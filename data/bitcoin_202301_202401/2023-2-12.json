        "title": "Warren Buffett says he doesn't own bitcoin because 'it isn't going to do anything' \u2014 he'd rather own these 2 highly ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Warren Buffett says he doesn\u2019t own bitcoin because \u2018it isn\u2019t going to do anything\u2019 \u2014 he\u2019d rather own these 2 highly coveted and productive assets instead\n\nDespite its recent turbulence, bitcoin has soared by more than 95% over the past five years. But while the world\u2019s largest crypto coin has clearly hit the mainstream, one prominent investor remains critical of the opportunity: Warren Buffett.\n\nDon't miss\n\nAt the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett said that while he doesn\u2019t know whether bitcoin will go up or down going forward, he\u2019s pretty sure that \u201cit doesn't produce anything.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the Oracle of Omaha doesn\u2019t own the asset.\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nTo put that in perspective, bitcoin was trading at around $38,000 a piece when Buffett made those comments. Now, the cryptocurrency has fallen to $21,700.\n\nWhile criticizing bitcoin, Buffett touched on two assets that he would buy if given the opportunity.\n\nFarmland\n\nAgriculture and bitcoin don\u2019t have much in common. Bitcoin was created in 2009 while agricultural communities began to form about 10,000 years ago.\n\nBuffett isn\u2019t known for being an agricultural investor, but he sees value in an asset class that\u2019s critical to the sector \u2014 farmland. His point is if you buy farmland, you hold a tangible asset that produces food.\n\n\u201cIf you said, for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I\u2019ll write you a check this afternoon,\u201d Buffett says.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need to have $25 billion to invest in U.S. farmland. Publicly traded real estate investment trusts \u2014 that specialize in owning farms \u2014 allow you to do it with as little money as you\u2019re willing to spend.\n\nStory continues\n\nGladstone Land (LAND), for instance, owns 169 farms totaling 115,000 acres. It pays monthly distributions of $0.0458 per share, giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 2.8%.\n\nRead more: Grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock market with these 3 easy alternatives\n\nThen there\u2019s Farmland Partners (FPI), a REIT with a farmland portfolio of 190,000 acres and an annual dividend yield of 1.9%.\n\nPlus, online crowdfunding platforms allow you to buy pieces of real estate, including farmland.\n\nWith inflation running hot, the prices of agricultural commodities including corn and soybeans are soaring to new highs.\n\nApartments\n\nApartment buildings are another asset that Buffett wouldn\u2019t mind owning at the right price.\n\n\u201c[If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I\u2019ll write you a check. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d the legendary investor says.\n\nWhether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people.\n\nYou can always buy an apartment building yourself, find tenants and collect the monthly rent checks. Of course, apartment-focused REITs can do that for you.\n\nFor instance, Camden Property Trust (CPT) owns, manages, develops and acquires multifamily apartment communities. It has investments in 171 properties containing 58,433 apartment units across the U.S. and offers an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nEssex Property Trust (ESS) invests in apartments primarily on the West Coast. The REIT currently yields 4.1%, backed by its ownership interest in 253 apartment communities \u2014 in California and Seattle \u2014 totaling approximately 62,000 units.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBuffett prefers farmland and apartment buildings to bitcoin for a very simple reason: They produce something.\n\n\u201cThe apartments are going to produce rent, and the farms are going to produce food.\u201d\n\nBitcoin boasts exciting long-term upside potential. But for risk-averse investors who\u2019d like to sidestep as much volatility as possible, sticking to productive assets is a prudent idea.\n\nA better way to buy property?\n\nOf course, REITs aren't the only way to easily invest in real estate.\n\nAmid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions outside of the stock market.\n\nPrime commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.\n\nWith a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart \u2014 and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "title": "Should Crypto Fear Quantum Computing? - Ledger",
        "content": "Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, and Victor Servant, Security Engineer at Ledger, explore the potential implications of quantum computing on the cryptocurrency industry, and how post-quantum solutions may eventually emerge to address the challenge.\n\n\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Quantum computing, a cutting-edge technology, holds immense potential for revolutionizing computation with its unmatched computational power.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Quantum computing, despite being at least several years from a major breakthrough, is perceived as a significant threat to cryptography due to its immense data processing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u2013 The potential impact of quantum computing on cryptography and secure systems such as Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work must be carefully considered. As the world\u2019s most secure gateway to crypto, such fundamental questions merit Ledger\u2019s full attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Computing: The Next Big Tech Leap\n\nThe computers we use daily process information based on \u201cbits\u201d. A bit can only hold one of the following values: 0 or 1, and can be strung together to create a piece of binary code. Today, everything we do with a computer, from sending emails and watching videos to sharing music, is possible due to such strings of binary digits.\n\nThe binary nature of traditional computers imposes limitations on their computing power. These computers only perform operations one step at a time and struggle to accurately simulate real-world problems. In contrast, the physical world operates based on amplitudes rather than binary digits, making it much more complex. This is where quantum computers come into play.\n\nIn 1981, Richard Feynman said that \u201cnature isn\u2019t classical, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you\u2019d better make it quantum mechanical.\u201d Instead of manipulating bits, quantum computing uses \u201cquantum bits\u201d, or qubits, allowing it to process data in a vastly more efficient way. Qubits can be zero, one, and, most importantly, a combination of zero and one.\n\nQuantum computing stands at the crossroads of physics and computer science. To put things into perspective, a 500-qubit quantum computer would require more classical bits than\u2026 the number of atoms in the entire universe.\n\nIs Quantum A Threat To Cryptography?\n\nPublic-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, forms the foundation of cryptocurrency security. It involves a combination of a public key (accessible to all) and a private key. The rapid calculation capabilities of qubits raise the potential for breaking encryption and disrupting the security of the cryptocurrency industry if quantum computing continues to advance.\n\nTwo algorithms need to be closely considered: Shor\u2019s and Grover\u2019s. Both algorithms are theoretical because there currently isn\u2019t any machine to implement them, but as you will see, the potential implementation of these algorithms could be harmful to cryptography.\n\nOn the one hand, Shor\u2019s (1994) quantum algorithm, named after Peter Shor, enables factoring large integers or solving the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time. This algorithm could break public key cryptography with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. Shor\u2019s algorithm would break the vast majority of asymmetric cryptography used today since it is based on RSA (relying on the integer factorization problem) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (depending on the discrete logarithm problem in an elliptic curve group).\n\nOn the other hand, Grover\u2019s (1996) algorithm is a quantum search algorithm devised by Lov Grover in 1996, which can be used to solve unstructured search problems. The Grover algorithm puts a significant dent in symmetric primitives\u2019 security but is not insurmountable. It is generally advised to double the key length to compensate for this break\u2019s square-root complexity. Using AES256 instead of AES128 is considered enough, but it should be noted that this rule of thumb might only sometimes be valid for all ciphers[5]. As for hash functions, which are part of the symmetric primitive\u2019s landscape, it is thought that it has no impact on collision resistance. However, researchers found instances of the problem where this is untrue[6] (multi-target preimage search, for example).\n\nIn essence, both algorithms pose potential dangers to cryptography. Shor\u2019s algorithm simplifies the process of factoring large numbers, making it easier to uncover a private key connected to a public key, and Grover\u2019s algorithm is capable of compromising cryptographic hashing more efficiently than current computers.\n\nWhen Will Encryption-Breaking Quantum Computers Emerge?\n\nLet\u2019s walk through some of the latest experiments and see how fast research is going. The first real quantum computer remains far off, but that doesn\u2019t prevent a global race from reaching \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d For Ayal Itzkovitz, managing partner in a quantum-focused VC fund, \u201cif three years ago we didn\u2019t know if it was altogether possible to build such a computer, now we already know that there will be quantum computers that will be able to do something different from classic computers.\u201d\n\nOne event that everyone has probably heard about was Google\u2019s \u201cquantum supremacy experiment\u201d in 2019 using a device with 54 qubits. In 2021, the University of Science and Technology of China solved a more complex calculation using 56 qubits, reaching 60 qubits later. Its goal was to perform a computation not involving Shor\u2019s algorithm that would equally demonstrate a quantum speedup over classical computing.\n\nBy definition, these experiments do not show progress toward breaking cryptography because they were designed to avoid the size and complexity of performing quantum integer factorization. However, they show that building more qubits into a quantum computer is no longer difficult, with different hardware solutions available, Google\u2019s \u2018Sycamore\u2019 chip qubits being fundamentally different from the USTC\u2019s photons. The next vital step to getting to an encryption-breaking computer is generally considered to be building fault-tolerant computation and error-correcting qubits.\n\nBSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development [1] shows how far from breaking a 160 bits discrete logarithm (lowest blue line in the following image) current quantum computers are. The abscissa shows how reducing the error rate through pure hardware improvements, or fault-tolerant computing helps reach such computing levels without dramatically scaling the number of available qubits (y-axis).\n\nImplementing Shor\u2019s algorithm in a scalable way requires fault-tolerant computation on a few thousand logical qubits: 2124 qubits at a minimum in order to break a 256-bit elliptic curve like bitcoin\u2019s secp256k1, from Improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms[7]. A \u2018logical\u2019 qubit in such a system is composed of several qubits designed to work as an error-corrected version of a single qubit.\n\nA thousand logical qubits roughly translate into several million qubits, covering the size of a soccer field. A practical demonstration of such a fault-tolerant computation was recently made in Fault-tolerant control of an error-corrected qubit[2], where a single logical qubit whose error probability is lower than that of the qubits it is made of. This area\u2019s improvement is expected to follow quickly as it will become the focus.\n\nProgress in this direction will directly translate into a concrete threat to public key cryptography. Lastly, another possibility for rapid progress can come from purely algorithmic improvements or hardware-only discoveries. BSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development[1] explains: \u201cThere can be disruptive discoveries that would dramatically change [the current state of knowledge], the main ones being cryptographic algorithms that can be run on near-term non-error-corrected machines or dramatic breakthroughs in the error rate of some platforms.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not just a problem of being able to build large computers with a lot of qubits (actually building more qubits reliably is not the main focus, fault-tolerant computing is), but also an algorithmic one and possibly a material research one.\n\n\n\nAs we were writing this article, IBM published its results on a 127-qubit chip with a 0.001 error rate, and plans on issuing a 433-qubit chip next year, and 1121-qubit chip in 2023.\n\nAll in all, it remains hard to predict how fast a quantum computer will come to life. Still, we can rely on expert opinion on the matter: A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments[3] and Expert poll on quantum risk[4] show that many experts agree that in 15 to 20 years, we should have a quantum computer available.\n\nQuoting A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments [3] as a summary:\n\n\u201cThe currently deployed public key schemes, such as RSA and ECC, are completely broken by Shor\u2019s algorithm. In contrast, the security parameters of symmetric methods and hash functions are reduced by, at most, a factor of two by the known attacks \u2013 by \u201cbrute force\u201d searches using Grover\u2019s searching algorithm. All those algorithms require large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum machines, which are not yet available. Most of the expert community agree that they will likely become a reality within 10 to 20 years.\u201d\n\nNow that we\u2019ve examined why quantum algorithms could harm cryptography, let\u2019s analyze the substantial risks implied for the crypto and Web3 fields.\n\nQuantum: What Risks for cryptocurrencies?\n\nThe Bitcoin case:\n\nLet\u2019s start with Pieter Wuille\u2019s analysis of the problem for Bitcoin, sometimes considered \u201cquantum-safe\u201d due to addresses being hashes of public keys and thus not exposing them.\n\nNot being able to break a Bitcoin private key based on the assumption that hashes make it impossible also relies on never disclosing one\u2019s public key, whatever the means, which is already wrong for many accounts.\n\nReferring to another thread, Pieter Wuille gives an idea of the impact of having the ~37% of exposed funds (at the time) stolen. Bitcoin would probably tank, and even unexposed, everyone else loses as well.\n\nThe crucial point here is the mention that the progress towards building a quantum computer will be incremental: billions of dollars are publicly invested in this field and any improvement resonates worldwide, as Google\u2019s quantum supremacy experiment showed.\n\nThis means that ending up with funds at risk will take time, and alternative solutions can be laid out correctly. One can imagine setting up a fork of the chain using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for signing and allowing people to transfer their funds to that new chain from the old once news of a reasonably beefy quantum computer seems imminent.\n\nThe Ethereum case:\n\nThe case of Ethereum is interesting as ETH 2.0 includes a backup plan for a catastrophic failure in EIP-2333.\n\nIn case ETH2\u2019s BLS signatures break, which would happen at the same time as ECDSA since they are both equally vulnerable in the face of Shor\u2019s algorithm, a hard fork of the blockchain will be executed before the algorithm is suspected to be compromised. Then, users reveal a preimage of their key that only legitimate owners can possess. This excludes keys retrieved by breaking a BLS signature. With that preimage, they sign a specific transaction allowing them to move to the hard fork and use new post-quantum algorithms.\n\nThis is not a switch to a post-quantum chain yet but it provides an escape hatch. Some more information here.\n\nPost-quantum signatures:\n\nA few things could be improved regarding switching to a post-quantum signature scheme for use in a cryptocurrency. The current NIST finalists have rather large memory requirements. When the signature size is not unreasonably larger than that of an ECDSA, the public key size increases block sizes and the associated fees.\n\nCandidate name Size Rainbow 58.3 kB Dilithium 3.5 kB Falcon 1.5 kB GeMSS 352 kB Picnic 12 kB SPHINCS+ 7 kB\n\nThe Falcon algorithm was designed to minimize the size of the public key and signature. However, its 1563 bytes are still far from the 65 bytes ECDSA currently reaches.\n\nCryptographic techniques can reduce block sizes, like aggregating several signatures together. This [multisignature scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/520) for the GeMSS signature does just that and reduces the cost of storage per signature to something acceptable, despite the vast one-time fee of a GeMSS signature.\n\nThreats to cryptographic hardware:\n\nSignature sizes also impact hardware wallets where memory is highly constrained: a Ledger Nano S has 320 KB of Flash memory available and only 10 Kilobytes of RAM. If suddenly we needed to use Rainbow signatures, generating the public key in a native way would not be feasible.\n\nSince, however, the whole cryptographic community is affected by the problem, including the banking, telecommunication, and identity industry, which make up most of the market for secure chips, we expect hardware to adapt quickly to the need for post-quantum algorithm-friendly hardware and remove that memory (or sometimes performance) all together in time.\n\nThe consequences of those breaks are the downfall of the current banking system, telecommunications, and identity systems such as passports. What to do in the face of such an apocalyptic future? Fear not, or a little, as cryptographers have got it covered.\n\nIs There A Cure, Doctor?\n\nWhile our current computers would need thousands of years to break public key cryptography, fully developed quantum computers would do this in minutes or hours. \u201cQuantum security\u201d standards will inevitably be needed to counter this threat and ensure the security of our future financial transactions and online communications.\n\nWork is already underway regarding what is commonly called \u201cPost-quantum cryptography\u201d that would possibly be \u201ccompatible with today\u2019s computers but which will also be capable of withstanding attackers from quantum computers in the future.\u201d Post-quantum cryptography brings algorithms and mathematical standards to the next level while allowing compatibility with current computers.\n\nThe NIST competition created just for the occasion has already reached its third round and produced a list of potential candidates for standardization. The Post-Quantum security Conference was launched as far back as 2006 to study cryptographic primitives that would resist known quantum attacks.\n\nThe foundations of this research stem from expert warnings that encrypted data is already at risk of being compromised, as the first practical quantum computers are expected to emerge within the next 15 years.\n\nThis kind of attack is known as \u201choard data now, attack later,\u201d where a large organization stores encrypted information from other parties it wishes to break and waits until a powerful enough quantum computer allows it to do so. This is the same worry of this article for example, \u201cThe US is worried that hackers are stealing data today so quantum computers can crack it in a decade\u201c, but it does not say what state-level actors might be doing in the same vein. They have a lot more resources and storage available.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe exact speed at which encrypted communications will become vulnerable to quantum research remains hard to determine.\n\nOne thing is sure: although significant progress is being made in quantum computing, we are still far from possessing the capability to crack cryptography with these machines. The likelihood of a sudden breakthrough resulting in the design of such a computer is minimal, giving us time to prepare for its arrival. If it were to occur overnight, the ramifications would be disastrous, affecting not only cryptocurrencies, but a wide range of sectors.\n\nFortunately, solutions, including post-quantum cryptography, are available to address the threat, but the crypto industry has yet to see the urgency in investing in these measures.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market must closely monitor quantum developments. With regards to hardware, there is little cause for concern as we anticipate the development of new secure elements to meet the demand. It is crucial to stay abreast of the latest advancements in side-channel and fault-resistant versions of these algorithms, in order to provide a reliable implementation for our users.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1]: BSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development\n\n[2]: Fault-tolerant control of an error-corrected qubit\n\n[3]: A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments\n\n[4]: Expert poll on quantum risk\n\n[5]: Beyond quadratic speedups in quantum attacks on symmetric schemes\n\n[6]: An Efficient Quantum Collision Search Algorithm and Implications on Symmetric Cryptography\n\n[7]: Improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms"

        "content": "2023 is off to a great start, with Bitcoin (BTC) rocketing up 40% in January. The good news is not relegated to just Bitcoin, however, as this price increase has sent ripple effects across the cryptoverse. Mining revenue jumped $22.66 million in January, and crypto-related stocks doubled on average. Despite this good news, venture capital investments are down 23% from the previous month.\n\nDownload and purchase this report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nFor a more detailed look into the various sectors of the crypto space, including venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulations and much more, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights report. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.\n\nBitcoin gaining momentum in Q1 of 2023\n\nBitcoin posted its best monthly price performance since October 2021, gaining almost 40% in January. After benefiting from a Consumer Price Index print that showed inflation slowing in December 2022, crypto and stock prices began to cool as retail data missed expectations and earnings diminished. As BTC\u2019s price hit a multi-month high of $23,920 on Jan. 29, all eyes turned to the Feb. 1 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, citing easing but still elevated inflation. BTC saw little volatility around the $23,000 level, suggesting the news was priced in.\n\nAs BTC gained bullish momentum in January, centralized exchange inflows and outflows normalized. The largest monthly outflow of coins in history occurred after the FTX collapse in November 2022, hitting 200,000 BTC/month across all exchanges. The net flows are now closer to neutral, with a reduction in the high outflow trend signaling investors are returning to the crypto market. BTC\u2019s bullish month blitzed through its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages for the first time in over a year, with investor cohorts returning to profitability previously wiped out in 2022.\n\nDeFi TVL up $10 billion despite persistent fears and hacks\n\nSeveral altcoins, including Gala (GALA), Aptos (APT), Threshold (T), Decentraland\u2019s MANA and Solana (SOL), experienced 100%+ monthly growth at the beginning of 2023 as Bitcoin\u2019s price started to rise at the beginning of 2023. This was caused by the extreme dominance of negative sentiment and the over-saturation of short positions by the end of 2022. However, Solana-based protocol Friktion still announced the halting of deposits due to the \u201ctough market for DeFi in the coming months,\u201d suggesting that further recession may occur in the near future.\n\nSimultaneously, several events in a darker world of exploits and hacks continued, following the pathway of 2022. Namely, Avraham Eisenberg\u2019s saga is unfolding as Mango Markets sued the hacker for $47-million compensation following his $117-million attack in October 2022. There have been several incidences of stolen funds moving around in the industry lately.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.

        "title": "MicroStrategy: Bitcoin's White Knight? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Before MicroStrategy became one of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin bulls, the software company was relatively unknown outside big tech and traditional finance. That changed in 2020 when the Fortune 500 enterprise added Bitcoin holdings to its balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy is one of the key players in the cryptocurrency market and the wider blockchain industry. Led by chairman Michael Saylor, they were among the first corporate entities to consider BTC as a store of value. This paved the way for other notable companies, like Tesla, to make their Bitcoin purchases.\n\nWe know MicroStrategy is an avid supporter of digital currency, but what is the company behind the internet fame? Do they hold any other digital assets, like Ethereum or NFTs?\n\nWhat Is MicroStrategy?\n\nFounded by Michael Saylor in 1989, MicroStrategy is a software company that provides powerful analytics and business intelligence tools. MicroStrategy products are used by some of the world\u2019s largest companies and household names, such as Visa and Porsche.\n\nOf course, developing data dashboards can only take a company so far. As part of its expanded offering, MicroStrategy provides cloud computing services.\n\nBut is the relationship between MicroStrategy and Bitcoin?\n\nMicroStrategy in the Crypto Market\n\nAccording to Coingecko (as of Feb 2023), MicroStrategy owns more Bitcoin than any other public company, including some leading exchanges like Coinbase. Unfazed by events like the FTX crash and crypto bear markets, MicroStrategy sees BTC as a long-term investment.\n\nBuying Bitcoin for the First Time\n\nMicroStrategy first expressed interest in Bitcoin in mid-2020 as a hedge against inflation. The United States Dollar (USD) was rapidly losing value following the economic fallout of the pandemic.\n\nIn a June earnings call with the company\u2019s CFO, Phong Le, Saylor mentioned that \u201cit makes sense to shift our treasury assets into some investments that can\u2019t be inflated away\u2026\u201d. By August 2020, MicroStrategy announced they\u2019d acquired 21,454 BTC at a market value of over $250M. The price of BTC at the time was around $11,000.\n\nSince then, MicroStrategy has routinely added to their bitcoin holdings, regardless of the volatility in the crypto market. As of February 2023, the tech giant\u2019s average price of Bitcoin purchases is roughly $30,415 per BTC.\n\nHas MicroStrategy Ever Sold Its Bitcoin?\n\nAfter a challenging year for Bitcoin, mainstream media and crypto news outlets eagerly shared the trending story: MicroStrategy sells. It seemed like following the last year\u2019s crypto winter, Saylor and Co needed to cut their losses.\n\nDespite what the headlines suggested, MicroStrategy explained in an SEC filing that they planned \u201cto carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains\u2026 which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nWhile this may have spread brief fear and doubt in the crypto market, MicroStrategy has since repurchased bitcoin. The company\u2019s conviction in digital currency runs deeper than ever. Per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, MicroStrategy plans to sell its other assets to fund further BTC investments.\n\nWhat Is MicroStrategy\u2019s Liquidation Price?\n\nAccording to Binance, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investment has been partly funded by Silvergate loans. Additionally, one of the tech firm\u2019s subsidiaries, MacroStrategy, has a leveraged position in Bitcoin.\n\nIn a significant crash, MacroStrategy would need to add additional collateral to its position to avoid liquidation. If the price of bitcoin were to drop to $13,644, Macrostrategy would receive an unwelcome margin call.\n\nWhen will MicroStrategy be forced to sell? Hopefully, not anytime soon. MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC position comes under threat of liquidation at a much lower price of around $3,561.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Other Crypto Holdings\n\nDespite being undoubtedly bullish on BTC and blockchain technology, MicroStrategy does not officially hold any other cryptocurrencies. Altcoins like ETH are not listed on the MicroStrategy balance sheet.\n\nBeing a bitcoin maximalist does have its drawbacks. Ironically, if MicroStrategy had bought Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, they would\u2019ve seen better returns. By purchasing ETH, as opposed to BTC, MicroStrategy would hold 3,540,000 ETH.\n\nMicroStrategy in the Stock Market\n\nAdding Bitcoin to the company\u2019s balance sheet has drawn mixed responses from MicroStrategy (MSTR) investors. Holding BTC has exposed the company\u2019s treasury to greater volatility, which appears to coincide with the performance of the MSTR stock.\n\nBloomberg suggests that MSTR stock hit its lowest price since 2020 following MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC purchases in December 2022. It\u2019s important to note that, at that time, MicroStrategy had lost over one billion USD through its Bitcoin investments.\n\nWhat Is Michael Saylor\u2019s Role at MicroStrategy?\n\nIn August 2021, MicroStrategy co-founder and CEO Michael Saylor stepped down. Saylor remains heavily involved with the company in his new role as executive chairman. The shift gives Saylor greater flexibility to pursue MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin strategy.\n\nSaylor\u2019s position as CEO was replaced by the former CFO and President, Phong Le.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile some might consider MicroStrategy\u2019s liquidation point impossible, it would surely trigger widespread panic in the crypto market. If MicroStrategy were forced to sell its BTC holdings, it could be a fatal blow to the price of Bitcoin and the reputation of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nMicroStrategy is the largest Bitcoin holder amongst corporate entities. Their belief and support of BTC and the blockchain industry represent the arrival of institutional investment into the crypto space.\n\nThis improves the image of cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 technologies in the view of both traditional finance and the general public. MicroStrategy\u2019s investment is a step toward the mass adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nF.A.Q.S."

        "title": "Bitcoin halving 2024: a blessing or a curse - crypto.news",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) halving significantly impacts the cryptocurrency world. The next event, scheduled for 2024, will likely impact bitcoin price again: let\u2019s find out how.\n\nBitcoin halving is an event wherein the reward given to miners for verifying transactions on the BTC blockchain is cut in half every four years. This event occurs as a mechanism to control inflation and reduce the rate of new bitcoins entering the market.\n\nHalving has substantial implications for miners, as their profitability is also cut in half. The halving also causes a surge in the price of BTC \u2014 as the limited supply pushes the demand higher.\n\nAs we approach the forthcoming halving event next year, the market is buzzing with anticipation. This halving could push bitcoin past its all-time high, exceeding the 2021 peak of $68,789.\n\nThis article will cover all you need about bitcoin halving, how it impacts the markets and stakeholders, and everything else. But first, let\u2019s understand what bitcoin halving is.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving\n\nThink of bitcoin halving as the network\u2019s version of a cost-of-living adjustment. Bitcoin halving is a predetermined event built into the Bitcoin network. It occurs every four years or after 210,000 blocks have been mined and reduce the block reward by 50%.\n\nSo where miners used to get 12.5 bitcoin for verifying a block before the 2020 halving, they now get just 6.25.\n\nThe 2020 halving was the third since bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2009. The first took place in November 2012 and reduced the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoin per block. The second took place in July 2016 and reduced the reward from 25 to 12.5 bitcoin.\n\nBTC mining rewards\n\nThe idea behind halving is that bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, established the total supply of bitcoin at 21 million coins. These halvings help ensure the scarcity of BTC by slowly reducing the amount of new bitcoin created until the supply is exhausted, which will be done by 2140.\n\nMoreover, the event also helps maintain bitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature, which limits its circulating supply and increases the cost of mining BTC.\n\nAs a result, the Bitcoin network is thought to be more secure as the incentive to attack it with more powerful computers (known as a \u201c51% attack\u201d) becomes less enticing.\n\nEffects of bitcoin halving on different stakeholders\n\nThe much-awaited bitcoin halving has been a source of great intrigue for all stakeholders, including miners, investors, and crypto exchanges. So let\u2019s look at how each of these stakeholders benefits from it:\n\nMiners\n\nWith halving, bitcoin miners earn only half the coins they were earning previously. Simply put, they must work twice as hard to get the same rewards. So, it\u2019s no surprise that the anticipation around the halving is exceptionally high for miners.\n\nHowever, halving is not necessarily a bad thing for the miners. Since a limited number of bitcoins can be mined, the halving helps miners maintain their profit margins. This means the miners can enjoy the same rewards without having to mine more.\n\nInvestors\n\nThe halving is an excellent opportunity for investors since it usually tends to lead to a surge in bitcoin\u2019s price. This momentum often causes a ripple effect across other cryptocurrencies and can be profitable for investors.\n\nThe surge in the price also allows investors to take advantage of low-cost entry points and potentially increase their profits.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges\n\nFor exchanges, the halving is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is an exciting event that attracts many traders and thus leads to increased volumes in trading.\n\nOn the other hand, it can also be a cause of concern as the sudden surge in activity can cause technical glitches and congest the networks.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s clear that bitcoin halving affects all stakeholders differently but can eventually lead to a positive outcome.\n\nHow each stakeholder benefits depends on their goals and strategies, so it\u2019s essential to carefully consider the implications of the halving before making any decisions.\n\nEffects of previous halvings on the market\n\nThe market impact of previous bitcoin halvings is often referred to as the \u201chalving effect.\u201d In other words, halvings can be viewed as catalysts for significant market events.\n\nBTC historical price chart. Source: CoinStats\n\nStatistics from the past three halvings show that bitcoin\u2019s price increased substantially in the long term following each.\n\nThe first halving in November 2012 saw the BTC price grow from around $11 to a high of $948 by December 2013.\n\nThe second halving, which occurred In July 2016, saw the BTC value increase from around $650 to a high of $13,650 by December 2017.\n\nLastly, the third halving in May 2020 saw the price surge from around $8,200 to a peak of $68,789 in November 2021.\n\nWhen halving hits, miners are rewarded fewer coins for their work, leading to a supply shock and causing the price to climb as demand driven by scarcity weighs heavier on the availability of the currency.\n\nThis effect has become so predictable that the market is actively anticipating them, leading to an influx of buyers before each event.\n\nIt is important to note that the halving effect can vary from cycle to cycle, so although it may have had a bullish impact in the past, it isn\u2019t guaranteed to happen each time.\n\nThat being said, if the past is any indication, the halving effect will likely continue to affect the market in the future.\n\nThe road ahead: what to expect from the next halving?\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHalving events have been a significant catalyst for bitcoin price appreciation. As seen in the chart above, bitcoin\u2019s price began to increase steadily in the 500 days before the most recent halving. After the halving, bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, just as in the past two.\n\nHence, bitcoin is likely to experience a similarly promising price rise in the days leading up to the fourth halving, slated for May 2024, by which the block reward will drop to 3.125 BTC.\n\nFollowing the halving, bitcoin is expected to make a decisive up move, potentially even reaching new, higher levels.\n\nAt the time of writing, the current price of BTC is around $22,715, with a market cap of $438 billion.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "It's hardly the most famous logo around, and certainly wasn't the work of a hugely well paid design agency. The Bitcoin logo was created by a community forum member back in 2010 \u2013 so perhaps we can forgive a few design imperfections.\n\nNearly 13 years later, a Twitter user has shared how a slightly infuriating defect has endured on the vector files \u2013 the kind that, while tiny, would be utterly unacceptable on a big brand design. And it turns out it isn't the only issue with the Bitcoin logo. (Looking for inspiration? Check out the best logos of all time.)\n\n(Image credit: Bitboy via Bitcoin Forum)\n\nUser @_Bosch_ points out that when zooming in on the vector, one can just about spot a few pixels from the orange background protruding into the white of the 'B'. Ironic, seeing as one famous Bitcoin slogan is \"when in doubt, zoom out\" (something about seeing the bigger picture, etc.) And another user added that one of the curves of the letter isn't perfectly smooth either.\n\nA small design detail that has stayed with many iterations of the original #bitcoin logo since its inception in 2010 pic.twitter.com/nYElwD2S6vFebruary 9, 2023 See more\n\n(Image credit: @skyler_fs on Twitter)\n\nStill, we can't be too hard on a logo designed by a community member over a decade ago. According to Decrypt, Bitcoin Forum member Bitboy shared the design as an improvement on the original (below) by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010, and shared it free to the public domain. If anything, the fact that is has endured for so long shows that, while not quite perfect, it's a pretty clean logo.\n\n(Image credit: Satoshi Nakamoto)\n\nAnd of course, not even the world's biggest logos are safe from the dreaded design flaw. Just yesterday, we reported that people are spotting an imperfection in the Google logo.

        "title": "You don't see that every day: Empty Bitcoin block found - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin is known for its robustness, security and predictability. Every 10 minutes \u2014 on average \u2014 the blockchain produces a new block, and the successful miner earns a block reward of 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC), around $130,000.\n\nHowever, every once in a while, the Bitcoin blockchain surprises observers and participants.\n\nAt block height 776,339, nodes across the network verified a completely empty block. The block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain with zero included transactions, leading to some confusion among the crypto community. So, what exactly is an empty block, and how does it happen?\n\nBlock expectation vs. reality. Source: Mempool.space\n\nFirst, while an empty block might seem strange at first, it\u2019s actually a normal occurrence on the network. The last time it occurred was a little over two weeks ago, in block 774,486.\n\nMiners are incentivized to mine blocks as quickly as possible, and sometimes, they mine a block before they have received any transactions to include. When this happens, the block remains empty.\n\nThe Bitcoin mempool, the go-to space for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain, offers the following explanation: \u201cWhen a new block is found, mining pools send miners a block template with no transactions so they can start searching for the next block as soon as possible. They send a block template full of transactions right afterward, but a full block template is a bigger data transfer and takes slightly longer to reach miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this intervening time, which is usually no more than 1\u20132 seconds, miners sometimes get lucky and find a new block using the empty block template.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the miners \u201cgot lucky\u201d by mining a template. In this instance, the Bitcoin block at height 776,389 was added mere seconds after its predecessor, 776,488. \u200eHowever, block 776,388 earned an extra 0.086 BTC or $1,854 in fees, which was added to the block reward of \u200e6.25 BTC or $135,247.\n\nEven though an empty block doesn\u2019t contain any transactions, the miner still receives the block reward of the newly minted Bitcoin. As such, block 776,389 was awarded 6.25 BTC \u2014 no transaction fees. Binance Pool was the winning miner, which contributes as much as 12% to the total hash rate.\n\nBitcoin mining pool ranking. Source: Mempool.space\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that empty blocks are not a problem for the network. By mining empty blocks, miners still produce the coin generation transaction, also known as the coinbase transaction, which keeps Bitcoin steady on its path to reaching 21 million BTC issued.\n\nRelated: Public miners increased Bitcoin production, hash rate in January\n\nAccording to data from BitInfoCharts, the percentage of empty blocks on the network is usually around 1%\u20132%. The stat is more surprising today, given the rise of \u201cordinals\u201d on Bitcoin, or the ability to permanently etch pictures, data and stamps onto the blockchain.\n\nThe rise in ordinals has provoked some questions and even concern among the Bitcoin community, and the first instances of pornography were recently recorded. The mempool has been increasingly busy, and block space has been contested for as some JPEG enthusiasts scramble to contribute their art to the Bitcoin blockchain."

        "content": "Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $10 million by the end of the sixth halvening in 2032, as long as Bitcoin layer-2 technology and wallet infrastructure improves.\n\nIn a Feb. 12 Twitter thread, the Bitcoin Core contributor explained to his 509,000 followers under what situation Hal Finney\u2019s $10 million price prediction for BTC could come true.\n\nBack noted that BTC has doubled in price year-on-year on average since 2013 and explained that if that trend continues, Bitcoin\u2019s price will reach $10 million, along with a $200 trillion market cap, in around nine years\u2019 time.\n\nearly this year i was curious of the claim \"bitcoin 2x's per year on average\". it checks: the decade jan 2013 - dec 2022 #bitcoin went up 2.036x/year (1200x in a decade). if that continues we'll cross $10mil/BTC and $200 tril market cap by end of next 2 halvenings, about 9 years. pic.twitter.com/mqmO2SRdAv \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) February 12, 2023\n\nHowever, Back said that in order for that figure to be reached, improvements in Bitcoin layer-2 technologies and wallet infrastructure needs to be fast tracked to give time for these innovations to scale:\n\n\u201ci think things will get \u201cinteresting\u201d over the next two halvings. and fast, we don't have much time to scale tech. we need somewhere for the next billion users to own their own UTXO, their own keys, with censorship-resistant cold storage. without weakening main-chain security.\u201d\n\nBack said that it \u201cprobably means sidechains/drivechains as a tradeoff. more lightning optimization [...] we don't have much time as tech takes time to mature, wallets, interop, integration.\u201d\n\nResponding to a comment, Back said he believes Bitcoin adoption hasn\u2019t reached the bottom of the S-curve yet, as only 1-2% of the world population has tapped into Bitcoin. He predicts more investors will begin to \u201cstack\u201d BTC into cold storage wallets:\n\n\u201cgiven volatility, i think #bitcoin can overshoot wildly and tap one of these $100-300 trillion market caps, correct and then regain a steadier adoption over time. i suspect people with average entry points, relative to then current price won't have much incentive to sell in size.\u201d\n\nThe CEO explained that part of that next wave of adoption may come from what he describes as \u201chyperbitcoinization spurts\u201d \u2014 where people in hyperinflationary environments will \u201crush\u201d to bitcoin:\n\nAdam Back believes the inflation of fiat currencies may force people to buy and hold bitcoin.

The cypherpunk suggested that Bitcoin could be used in mortgages where property is used as collateral and Bitcoin as the interest:\n\n\u201cthe market in bitcoin-native financialisation is immature, almost untouched. bitcoin structured products, mortgages backed by real-estate but interest guaranteed by BTC, other products make bitcoin easier to use for more people, and match risk profiles. which creates more growth.\u201d\n\nBack added that in order to approach $10 million, BTC would also need to \u201cdisplace\u201d a significant proportion of store of value premiums in bonds, real estate, gold and stock portfolios.\n\nYou think bitcoin twitter is bullish?

        "content": "The first production update of 2023 from publicly listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies shows a steady increase in hash rate and a surge in BTC production compared to the previous month, according to a new analysis from Hashrate Index.\n\nThe majority of public miners increased their bitcoin production in January, with CleanSpark boosting it by 50%, reaching a record monthly production of 697 Bitcoins. Leading the BTC production, Core Scientific reached 1,527 coins mined in January, followed by Riot, the second-biggest producer, mining 740 Bitcoins in the month.\n\nMarathon and Cipher have seen significant increases in Bitcoin production, reaching 687 and 343 Bitcoins generated, respectively, compared to 475 and 225 in December.\n\nPublic Miners: Monthly Bitcoin Production. Source: Hashrate Index and Luxor\n\nAccording to Bitcoin mining analyst Jaran Mellerud, better weather conditions in January and stable electricity prices helped miners boost production. \u201cIn December, a winter storm swept the North American continent and led to surging electricity prices that periodically forced many of these companies to curtail operations. With the weather more benevolent in January, electricity prices stabilized, and miners were able to achieve a higher up-time.\u201d\n\nHash rate increased for most public miners in January, but at a slower pace than expected. The exception is Texas-based Cipher, which boosted its hash rate by more than 50%, with a 4.3 EH/s. \u201cCipher has been building hard during this bear market, and I expect the company to reach its hashrate goal of 6 EH/s of self-mining capacity by the end of Q1 2023,\u201d wrote Mellerud.\n\nCleanSpark also grew its hash rate to 6.6 EH/s from 6.2 EH/s in December, following a series of acquisitions in late 2022. Hive also recorded growth in January, with its hash rate increasing by nearly 30%, from 2.1 to 2.7 EH/s. \u201cThe company keeps replacing its GPU fleet with ASICs, primarily with its in-house designed Buzzminers,\u201d Mellerud said of Hive.\n\nPublic Miners: Self-Mining Hashrate. Source: Hashrate Index and Luxor\n\nCore Scientific also continued growing its hash rate, reaching 17 EH/s in January from 15.7 in December. The figures, however, are expected to be impacted by the company's bankruptcy proceedings, which include a deal with the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) to pay off an outstanding debt of $38.6 million by handing over more than 27,000 mining machines used as collateral - representing 18% of Core Scientific rigs.\n\nCore Scientific filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21, seeking to reorganize its debts after months of financial distress due to increased electricity costs and low Bitcoin prices.\n\nMellerud also pointed out that \u201cthese companies have, on several occasions, extended the timeline of their lofty hashrate expansion goals. Most of them have plans to drastically increase their operating hashrate by the end of Q2 this year. At the current rate, most of them will likely have to push their expansion plans further into the future.\u201d"

Source: Rekt Capital/ Twitter\n\n\u201cMost important\u201d CPI print arrives\n\nThe macro landscape is set to be dominated by one data point this week with the Feb. 14 release of the CPI for January.\n\nBets are on for inflation continuing to decline in a move that could still buoy risk assets despite a comedown in early February.\n\nThe picture is complicated by a reshuffling of how CPI is calculated, but analysts dispute its significance versus the overall trend of inflation receding.\n\nHowever, this month\u2019s print is being closely eyed far beyond crypto circles.\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s CPI report is the most important report to date. After a strong January jobs report and December CPI \u2018revised\u2019 higher, uncertainty is everywhere,\u201d capital markets newsletter, The Kobeissi Letter, told Twitter followers at the weekend.\n\n\u201cBoth bulls and bears need the report to go their way. Whichever side is right will drive the market for the next month.\u201d\n\nPopular trader and analyst Myles G underscored the consequences for crypto should CPI come in higher than expected, warning that this would \u201cdump the market big.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost every CPI reveal last 6 months has been an instant dump, then an immediate recovery after traders digested the data,\u201d fellow trader Satoshi Flipper noted about the relationship between CPI and market volatility.\n\n\u201cWill this time be different?\u201d\n\nU.S. CPI chart.

Source: TradingView\n\nWhether the daily golden cross will repeat historical patterns and buoy the market remains to be seen, but in the meantime, another brand new cross is taking place.\n\nCaleb Franzen, a senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, noted that Bitcoin\u2019s one-year exponential moving average is about to drop below its three-year counterpart for the first time ever.\n\n\u201cThis crossover has never happened before, highlighting the severity of the BTC bear market,\u201d he wrote in part of a Twitter commentary on Feb. 11.\n\nThe event, in fact, occurred in mid-December 2022, but the one-year EMA has since continued to decline, plunging ever further below the three-year and two-year EMAs.\n\nIn the accompanying analysis, Franzen argued that the crossover could reframe Bitcoin bear market behavior. This time around, the depression could be harder and more drawn out than before.\n\n\u201cWhile many Bitcoin investors have noted that BTC typically bottoms roughly ~400 days after the bull market peak, this chart suggests that this time is different,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cConsidering that we\u2019ve never seen this signal until now, the implication is that the 1-year trend might stay below the 3-year trend even longer!\u201d\n\nHe said that the two-year EMA might also end up crossing below the three-year EMA, which would likewise constitute a first-of-its-kind event.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that occurs within the next 6 months as a result of further sideways action or downward consolidation,\u201d the analysis forecast.\n\nBTC/USD 1-week candle chart (Bitstamp) with 52-, 104-, and 156-day moving averages.

        "content": "The city of Da Nang, Vietnam, which some have dubbed \u201cBitcoin Beach Vietnam,\u201d will play host to Asia\u2019s first Bitcoin and Lightning Network conference in the region. Neutronpay, BitcoinVN and Nunchuk \u2014 all Vietnam-based Bitcoin companies \u2014 are excited to share what is happening in Asia as it relates to Bitcoin projects, Bitcoin communities and Lightning adoption across the region. The conference will take place on March 22 through 24, 2023 at the beautiful beachside Furama Resort.\n\nMalcolm Weed, chief operating officer of Neutronpay, who is the event\u2019s main organizer, said, \u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited to be putting on the world\u2019s first Bitcoin and Lightning event in Asia. Bitcoin adoption is very strong across the region, with countries like Vietnam, Philippines, India, Pakistan, Thailand and China all being in the top-10 global rankings for Bitcoin adoption, making it the world\u2019s Bitcoin epicenter. With over 4 billion people in Asia \u2014 70% of which are unbanked \u2014 it is no wonder Bitcoin adoption is so strong.\u201d\n\nMalcolm continued, \u201cWhen I looked around, I noticed that other parts of the world were being represented with events, but Asia and more specifically emerging markets in Asia had none, and were being completely overlooked considering the global rankings. We\u2019re proud to say that since we announced the event, it has been highly talked about and is now on many people\u2019s yearly must-hit conference calendars. We\u2019ve so far built a great speaker list, composed of many recognizable Bitcoiners, with an emphasis on making sure we have representation from countries across South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.\u201d\n\nThe event will kick off with a beach meet and greet on the evening of March 22, followed by two days of speakers sharing the latest developments across the Bitcoin ecosystem, touching on both technological and economic aspects. There will also be a strong representation of companies that are building on the Lightning Network and will share the current state of affairs and what exciting things are currently being worked on.\n\nThere will only be 500 attendees, so tickets are limited. General admission two-day passes are currently priced at $375, with ticket prices going up again on March 1. The nonprofit event can be accessed by local Vietnamese attendees at a preferential price of $35 dollars.\n\nThere are a few spots left for this Bitcoin-only event for speakers, moderators, volunteers, sponsors and media, so those interested in taking part should reach out via email.\n\nAbout Lightningcon Vietnam\n\nLightningcon Vietnam is Asia\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin and Lightning conference. It will bring together stakeholders from all sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem, with local representation from projects and communities across the region and a focus on networking, collaboration and learning over a two-day conference.\n\nAbout Neutronpay\n\nNeutronpay is a Silicon Valley VC-funded startup that provides Lightning Network infrastructure to businesses that wish to launch Lightning products such as remittances, payments, spending, payouts and banking capabilities. It is led by veterans in the payments, compliance, banking and Bitcoin industries and was founded in 2018, being part of the first cohort of companies building on the Lightning Network.\n\nAbout BitcoinVN\n\nBitcoinVN was founded in late 2013 by a Vietnamese-German team with the mission to provide locals and expats with access to the digital asset economy and its wider applications. The team comprises stalwarts of the Bitcoin scene in Ho Chi Minh City, and have grown to be the go-to Bitcoin provider in the region for online and over-the-counter trades."

While the total number of Bitcoin NFTs is unknown, the Ordinals website and Gamma, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Stacks, appear to point to several thousand minted on the network.\n\nBitcoin NFTs may be having a moment, but the technology is still in its infancy, especially when compared to Ethereum and Solana, which have had several years to perfect the minting, trading, and viewing of digital collectibles.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have been live for a few months now, but it\u2019s only really a week old in terms of mass adoption,\u201d Satoshibles developer Brian Laughlan told Decrypt on Discord. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while before we see general wallet support.\u201d Launched in 2021, Satoshibles is the first NFT Collection to bridge Ethereum NFTs with Bitcoin using Stacks.\n\nMany Bitcoiners, no matter what they say, are scrambling to mint a pre 100k inscription.

        "title": "Understanding crypto bag holders and their mindset - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For the first time in centuries, paper money, or fiat, found its true competition in the internet era. When Bitcoin (BTC) debuted in 2009, the fiat ecosystem was not only challenged with proving its worth in day-to-day transactions but also safekeeping the investment ecosystem it helped build.\n\nOver the years, the crypto ecosystem attracted people from all walks of life, serving their unique financial needs while filling the gaps left wide open by the fiat ecosystem. While most of the world watched from the sidelines \u2014 trying to decipher the true potential of cryptocurrencies \u2014 the first batch of Bitcoin millionaires swayed investors\u2019 attention toward the budding ecosystem.\n\nThe freedom to stick to what makes the most sense financially sprouted various classes of investors, each distinguished by their intent behind crypto investments. Based on the overall approach taken by investors, there are four main categories of mindsets of crypto bag holders: maximalists, hodlers, fomoers and traders.\n\nMaximalists\n\nFrom the day Bitcoin showcased its cross-border supremacy after being used as a currency on the dark web, numerous investors witnessed a true peer-to-peer monetary system for the first time. What followed was a pledge to stick with Bitcoin and see it overpower the centralized entities, bringing power back into the hands of the people.\n\nThis total support for Bitcoin and the belief that BTC is the only true replacement for the fiat economy gave birth to the term Bitcoin maximalism. Bitcoin maximalists have, time and again, advised the community members to hodl their assets during the bear market. They often recommend buying the dip \u2014 a process that involves investing in crypto during the market\u2019s poor performance. And over the last decade, the recommendation checks out.\n\n#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy. \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) September 18, 2020\n\nHowever, maximalism is not limited to Bitcoin. It has spread widely across other crypto ecosystems too. Investors and crypto enthusiasts that have committed years to the growth of their preferred blockchains and cryptocurrencies have a belief pattern similar to Bitcoin maxis. Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP (XRP) are the few leading cryptocurrencies that have garnered loyal maximalists over the years that continue to preach the strength of their respective tokens.\n\nHODLers\n\nHodlers are the type of crypto investors that believe in making long-term investments. This type of investor does not fear the infamous volatile market fluctuations and instead focuses on accumulating cryptocurrency tokens over time.\n\nHodlers can be found across all crypto ecosystems and are known to be the most resilient of the bunch. For new Bitcoiners, the dream behind hodling is to accumulate at least one BTC over time. Through many halving cycles and the resultant scarcity, Bitcoin hodlers envision a future when their investments shell out a return unimaginable in a traditional fiat setting.\n\nThis dream seems more attainable for other cryptocurrencies considering that investors can accumulate a big bag of tokens using comparatively lower funds. Some millennials and generation z\u2019ers prefer purchasing thousands of meme tokens in the hopes of hitting the jackpot during bull markets.\n\nFOMOers\n\nFomoers are a subset of investors that end up making the biggest mistakes in investing. Fomo is an abbreviation of \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d implying a feeling of apprehension related to price movements.\n\nFomoers tend to react adversely to every market condition. When the price of cryptocurrencies goes up, these investors purchase more tokens hoping that the prices will continue to rise. However, this approach does not always yield fruitful results. As a result, they often end up buying the top and selling the bottom.\n\nRelated: Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin?\n\nTo get out of this mindset, one needs to study the market extensively while putting aside the noise of misinformation. Moreover, prominent crypto entrepreneurs often recommend against fomo-ing and ask the general public to focus on the bigger picture.\n\nTraders\n\nThese are the most straightforward investors that primarily focus on day-to-day prices in search of opportunities to earn profits. Traders closely monitor market sentiment, new developments and regulations to gauge how the markets react.\n\nRegardless of the prices going up or down, traders are ready to cash in on the market fluctuations by longing or shorting trades. The need for liquid tokens for trading requires traders to store a significant amount of their assets on crypto exchanges. However, the FTX fiasco of 2022 is a reminder that self-custody is the ideal way of storing cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn reality, every type of crypto holder can potentially make a lot of money buying and selling cryptocurrencies if they know the real strategy.

        "title": "Emblem Vault: Bitcoin NFTs made easy - NFT Culture",
        "content": "The creation of Emblem Vault in 2020 has opened up a world of possibilities for Bitcoin NFTs, making it easier to trade and build a strong digital portfolio. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using Emblem Vault and why it is set to revolutionize the world of NFTs.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s understand what Emblem Vault is. It is a tokenized multi-asset wallet on the Ethereum blockchain that allows you to trade portfolios of NFTs and cryptocurrencies, including assets from different chains, as a single token. The vault is created as a unique ERC-721 token, and each vault contains a series of blockchain addresses generated from a single secret phrase. This means that you can store various digital assets in each address and only the person with the secret phrase can send assets to other wallets.\n\nBenefits of Emblem Vault for BTC NFTs\n\nOne of the key benefits of Emblem Vault is the ability to create a value-backed digital vault. This means you can store one or more digital assets, along with some cryptocurrency, in a single vault, making it easier to manage your digital assets. This is especially useful for individuals who want to keep their digital assets safe and secure.\n\nAnother benefit of Emblem Vault is the ability to create tradeable portfolios. This allows you to combine multiple assets into a single token, making it easier to trade and manage your portfolio. For example, you can create a portfolio that contains 50% ETH, 40% Bitcoin, and 10% LINK, and trade all these assets as a single ERC-721 NFT. This simplifies the process of managing your digital assets and makes it easier to keep track of your investments.\n\nEmblem Vault also enables you to create portable liquidity pools. This means you can create a vault with multiple pooled tokens to make transferable liquidity pools, as well as transparent funds. You can do this because Emblem Vault enables you to create a vault that is held by a community or other trusted third parties. This can be especially useful for individuals or organizations looking to pool their resources and invest in digital assets together.\n\nIn addition, Emblem Vault works by wrapping digital assets to make them modern ERC-721 NFTs, which can be traded on popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. This means that you can buy and sell assets that predate the ERC-721 standard, such as Rare Pepe\u2019s. This opens up a world of possibilities for those looking to invest in NFTs and allows you to trade assets that were previously difficult to buy and sell.\n\nFurthermore, Emblem Vault is user-friendly and easy to use. To create your own vault, simply go to Emblem.Finance, select Create, connect the wallet you would like to use, and then add a name and description. You can also buy and sell Emblem Vault NFTs on popular platforms such as OpenSea, LooksRare, and their official website.\n\nEmblem Vault is set to revolutionize the world of NFTs by making it easier to trade and manage digital assets. With its ability to create value-backed digital vaults, tradeable portfolios, and portable liquidity pools, it offers a range of benefits to individuals and organizations looking to invest in digital assets. Its user-friendly interface and the ability to wrap digital assets to make them tradable on popular NFT marketplaces make it a game-changer in the world of NFTs. If you\u2019re looking to invest in NFTs, it\u2019s definitely worth considering Emblem Vault."

        "title": "Bitcoin ordinals pump and dump using stolen images and copyright - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions using ordinals are becoming increasingly popular. As the hype cycle begins for the \u201cNFTs on Bitcoin\u201d movement, profiteering ordinals pump groups have quickly sprung into action.\n\nAlthough NFTs have existed on Bitcoin for years via OP_RETURN data and Counterparty, Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor\u2019s new ordinals project makes it possible to inscribe an unprecedented 3.9 megabytes of data into each Bitcoin block. The resulting inscription often takes the form of an NFT-like picture, audio file, video, or even computer game. Similar to an NFT, this inscription can be traded and passed along to other Bitcoin wallets.\n\nInscriptions endow normally fungible satoshis \u2014 the smallest denomination of bitcoin; one bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis \u2014 with numismatic value. In other words, inscriptions give certain satoshis extra value* (see footnote).\n\nOne inscription recently sold for a stunning 9.5 bitcoin, or over $200,000 in extra, numismatic value.\n\nSome inscriptions are harmless jokes, others are artwork, a few take the form of censorship-resistant speech, but most are hyped NFT collections. Many inscribe stolen images \u2014 including copyrighted media.\n\nRead more: NFT wash trade accounts for 6.5% of daily sales volume on OpenSea\n\nLet the ordinals pump and dump begin\n\nWith so much profit sloshing around just weeks into Rodarmor\u2019s unveiling of Ordinals.com, promoters smell money. OpenSea NFT promoters from the 2021 hype cycle are now hawking Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\nOf course, pump-and-dump groups are nothing new in digital asset history. Thousands exist on Telegram and Discord. If you see a small altcoin suddenly rallying and then crashing within a few minutes, you\u2019re probably watching a pump and dump.\n\nShielded behind usernames, VPNs, and ephemeral messages, ordinals pump organizers on Telegram or Discord often use pseudonyms, buy followers and engagement to appear credible, or even mask their web traffic with Tor.\n\nExamples of ordinals inscription projects\n\nAlthough Telegram and Twitter are gaining activity, ordinals pump groups are most active on Discord. One group with thousands of members claimed that they could \u201cfront-run whales\u201d and make sure paying members profit \u201cno matter what.\u201d\n\nJust days into the Ordinals project, there are already tens of thousands of inscriptions. Many of them are created by administrators of NFT projects, including:\n\nOrdinal Punks\n\nOrdinal Loops\n\nOrdinal Cubes\n\nOrdinal Shards\n\nOrdinal Diamonds\n\nOrdinal Tulips\n\nOrdinal Eggs\n\nOrdinal Penguins\n\nOrdinauts\n\nBitcoin Rocks\n\nBitcoin Punks\n\nBitcoin Toadz\n\nBitcoin Boos\n\nBitcoin Punks\n\nBitcoinShrooms\n\nInscribed Peps\n\nSeveral of these projects have simply stolen images from Ethereum-based NFTs. Marquee projects like CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, EtherRocks, and others have already been inscribed from Ethereum onto Bitcoin numerous times \u2014 without their owners\u2019 permission.\n\nOther projects are inscribing trademarked and copyrighted content. For example, BitcoinShrooms seems to be pushing its luck with promotional material including a recognizable Linux mascot, a copyrighted Wall-E character, and a copyrighted Pac-Man ghost. Its Twitter account indicated that its sale was not open yet.\n\nAcross all of the projects, the focus of administrators is rarely about art and almost always about profitably selling and re-selling NFTs. Many administrators make overt claims about price predictions, profit potential, BitClout-like bonding curves, and their entrepreneurial efforts to add additional \u201cvalue\u201d to their NFT-based enterprise.\n\nOf course, some people were less than thrilled with the idea of paying an inflated price for essentially a dressed-up satoshi. Some of them equated inscriptions with the NFT fad of 2021 whose volumes quickly declined -99%.\n\nWhich ordinals offerings are securities offerings?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the US Justice Department considers pump-and-dump schemes a form of fraud. The department regularly files charges against the organizers of these rings. Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warns against pump-and-dump schemes because their organizers typically misrepresent why an asset is surging in price in order to dump their holdings at an inflated price.\n\nSecurities laws exist to force issuers to disclose risks. Obviously, it is easier to withhold information to make an offering more appealing. However, regulators like the SEC enforce disclosure so that investors have enough information to make an informed decision.\n\nOf course, promoters of NFTs and inscriptions often claim that they not securities. Therefore, in their opinion, information disclosure regulations must not apply.\n\nNevertheless, almost anything \u2014 including orange grove parcels \u2014 can be sold as a security in what is known as an investment contract.\n\nAn investment contract exists when a promoter sells anything \u2014 even a non-security \u2014 when purchasers invest money into a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others. When sold in this way, the investment contract is, itself, a security. In other words, the offering of a non-security can be a securities offering.\n\nRead more: Ripple says SEC lawsuit could end in weeks \u2014 don\u2019t hold your breath\n\nIn the same way, many promoters are selling inscriptions in a way that makes their offering a securities offering. For example, one administrator claimed, \u201cIt will be our job to make sure we give you more than what you pay for. So, no matter what, everyone will end up in profit, because of what we are working on giving our holders.\u201d That promise seems dangerously close to the SEC\u2019s Howey Test. If an offering passes that test, it is a security.\n\nMain takeaway\n\nInscriptions bring back an old argument about adding data that has nothing to do with payments to the Bitcoin blockchain. Because they don\u2019t have a formal marketplace like OpenSea yet, they\u2019re more vulnerable to potential fraud, including pump-and-dump schemes that can dump satoshis with extra data on unsuspecting buyers.\n\n* (On a mathematical note, it becomes parabolically difficult to trace individual satoshis within UTXO sets as they process through multi-output transactions. In other words, it\u2019s computationally prohibitive to actually trace most satoshis in existence. Although satoshis are neatly ordered within newly mined blocks, as satoshis pass through multi-output transactions, their position within each UTXO set mixes. In launching his Ordinals project, what Rodarmor has actually contrived is an off-blockchain convention wherein participants, in his words, \u201cpretend\u201d to track satoshis. He makes several assumptions of convenience about where satoshis are located within UTXO sets post-transaction and assigns ordinals to his hypothetical ordering, despite the impossibility of knowing where satoshis are actually located after several multi-output transactions. Notwithstanding this arbitrary ordering system, Rodarmor has indeed combined a novel schematic using SegWit\u2019s witness data discount, Taproot signatures, and Ordinal theory to introduce NFT-like inscriptions into the Bitcoin network.)\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "content": "BTC is significantly correlated to the traditional financial markets.\n\nFor its price to grow, there has to be a decoupling.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price might have rallied by 32% on a year-to-date (YTD), the continued growth in the price of the king coin, in the face of prevailing macroeconomic conditions, is largely contingent upon its ability to detach from traditional financial markets, two CryptoQuant analysts have found.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Grizzly assessed BTC\u2019s 200-day moving average and its realized price and found a pattern previously observed in market bottoms.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThis pattern, which suggests the formation of a long-term bottom, is characterized by the crossing or overlapping of the 200-day moving average and the realized price, moving from the top to the bottom. This pattern was observed in 2019, 2015, and 2012, after which BTC experienced a long-term upward trend.\n\nAccording to Grizzly, in these highly inflationary times, the predicted long-term upward trend might follow if BTC detaches from assets such as equities and acts as a store of value.\n\nAnother analyst Baro Virtual considered BTC\u2019s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss ratio (NUPL). The analyst found that the current market situation was similar to the NUPL index movement in the spring of 2019 when it broke its 365-day moving average and BTC experienced strong bullish momentum.\n\nHowever, after encountering rejection at the medium-term resistance range of 0.15-0.25, BTC\u2019s NUPL index tested its 365-day moving average, which served as support.\n\nAccording to Baro Virtual, a successful hold of the 365-day MA and overcoming the resistance range could lead to solid bullish momentum.\n\nFor the upward break to happen, BTC\u2019s price has to \u201cdecouple\u201d from the broader financial markets, Baro Virtual opined. He further stated,\n\n\u201cAlso very important is the question of whether there will be a final decoupling of Bitcoin and the US stock market in the current cycle or whether Bitcoin will become a hostage to traditional macroeconomic indicators.\u201d\n\nBTC market refuses to cut ties with traditional markets\n\nOn 1 February, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the smallest interest rate adjustment since March. On this news, BTC\u2019s and ETH\u2019s prices fell slightly by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIt is no longer news that BTC\u2019s price exhibits high sensitivity to announcements such as inflation data or changes in Federal Reserve interest rates.\n\nIn fact, in the last year, BTC\u2019s price reacted each time interest rates were hiked.\n\nDuring the recent Federal Reserve meeting, the Fed Chair, Jerome H. Powell, indicated that \u201ca couple more\u201d interest rate increases were being considered to ensure that inflationary pressures are effectively contained.\n\nIf history is anything to go by, one can expect BTC\u2019s price to react to any further interest rate hikes as the year progresses."

While the year gone by witnessed a series of setbacks for cryptocurrencies including 30 percent capital gains tax , the New Year is ushering in positivity and hope for crypto investors.\n\nIncidentally, there was no negative commentary around digital currencies in the Budget 2023 , and their prices have also witnessed a significant jump in the past couple of months.\n\nA report by Reuters , while relying on the options trading data, asserts that bitcoin and ether have recovered noticeably in the recent past.\n\nThe report states that the total volume of bitcoin and ethereum options jumped significantly on Deribit in January against the previous month.\n\nIn the past three months, bitcoin prices have recovered by over 25 percent to hit $23,193 on Wednesday at 8.50 GMT. At the same time, the overall market capitalisation of crypto tokens crossed $1 trillion again, shows the CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEven the second most popular cryptocurrency Ethereum recovered by 52 percent from $1,100 on Nov 9 to hover around $1,671 on Wednesday, the CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nEther has reported a rise of 52 percent in the past three months, shows the CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe Binance Coin also witnessed a jump of 23.7 percent in its price in the past three months from $266.85 on Nov 9 to $330 on Wednesday.\n\nOther crypto tokens have also been trading higher than their previous close.\n\nRipple trades at $0.399 at 9 am GMT, nearly one percent higher than its previous close, Aptos rose 3.14 percent to trade at $15.77, Cardano rose 2.59 percent to trade at $0.397 and dogecoin trades 0.38% higher on Wednesday to trade at $0.09.\n\nPolygon rose 4.45 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at $1.28 and Solana rose 1.4 percent to trade around $23.64 on Wednesday.\n\nBack to business\n\nWazirX, which had earlier stopped accepting fresh cash deposits on its platform, has resumed accepting them, as confirmed by an email sent to its customers on Jan 27.\n\nHowever, the deposits can be made by investors only via RTGS, NEFT or IMPS and not via UPI.\n\nDuring the time when fresh cash deposits were barred, the crypto platform gave the option of peer-to-peer trading to investors wherein they could directly transfer money to the potential seller.\n\nOnce investors deposit money into their accounts, the option of P2P trading will automatically get disabled, reads the email referred to above.\n\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder and CEO, CoinSwitch, says the massive jump in crypto prices has led to 3 times increase in weekly investing activity since January.\n\n\"The crypto market has rebounded significantly since the turn of the year, with Bitcoin rising nearly 40% and other coins even more. Now, retail investment behavior, both in traditional and crypto markets, is momentum-based\u2014investing more when prices are rising, and fewer when they are falling. As such, we have been witnessing a rise in weekly investing activity since January\u2014over 3X, and this trend has continued through the Budget week. It is, therefore, not right to attribute this activity to the Budget alone,\" said Mr Singhal.\n\nHowever, Gaurav Mehta, Founder of Catax \u2013 Simple Crypto Taxes, believes that the overall outlook for cryptocurrencies is still gloomy, and there is no favourable climate for retail investors.\n\n\u201cThe absence of negative news in the budget should not be interpreted as a signal to purchase despite the current bull run, particularly for retail investors, given the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies and the absence of coverage in the budget. Industry has spoken out against 1% TDS, 30% tax, and the inability to deduct losses, but government has continued with implemented policy,\u201d said Mr Mehta.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder & CEO, CREBACO, believes the environment for crypto currencies is still quite gloomy in India with most exchanges on the verge of shutting their businesses.\n\n\u201cVolumes have dropped by 97%. One of the largest exchanges in India is struggling with international exchange. No new money is coming in and the liquidity in the INR order booking is running dry. The government must regulate or the industry in India will see its end soon\u201d said Mr Sogani."

        "title": "How JungleBus indexes Bitcoin's 'Internet of Value': Workshop - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Bitcoin is creating a new economy with the \u201cInternet of Value\u201d concept: monetizing data itself and returning power to users. As terabytes of new information flow onto the network every hour, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how data on the BSV blockchain could be filtered and searched. JungleBus, by GorillaPool, has created the concept of the indexing subscription service. In a video workshop, Kurt Wuckert Jr. and Luke Rohenaz explain why the world needs indexing so badly and how JungleBus can solve the problem.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s looked in dismay at their ever-expanding digital photo folder can understand the need for a reliable indexer. Decades of images, recorded by the time taken but with nothing else to identify them other than the image itself\u2014 looking for something specific can be a nightmare. Now imagine all the world\u2019s data recorded and stored by timestamp alone\u2014it\u2019s orderly, but unusable without some kind of indexing and the ability to search using different parameters.\n\nTo explain JungleBus, you must first explain (the real) Bitcoin\n\nJungleBus is an indexing engine that filters raw data from the blockchain and serves it back out in a useful format so that applications can use Bitcoin data in their apps or go so far as to build an entire overlay network to replace the internet itself.\n\nDid you get all that? It might sound like a bit much at first. The workshop is aimed not only at existing Bitcoin users but also newcomers, so Wuckert spends the first segment explaining what Bitcoin is really about, the problems it could solve, and some fundamentals about how it works.\n\n\u201cMore than just a payments network or an investment opportunity, Bitcoin is the Internet of Value,\u201d he states.\n\nWith Bitcoin, it\u2019s possible to create a worldwide peer-to-peer network able to secure and transact unique data items without the risk of \u201cdouble-spends\u201d or duplicates. Peer-to-peer is a more efficient way to scale the network than simply broadcasting all transactions to everyone, and proof-of-work (PoW) is the superior economic incentive model to keep all this secure and trustable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a brilliance to the power of communication, and Bitcoin is just economic communication. Bitcoin allows you to add value to every bit or byte of data that crosses the network,\u201d Wuckert remarks.\n\nData becomes more valuable as it becomes more ubiquitous, and over a trillion megabytes of data are created globally daily. Right now, the ones profiting from that data proliferation are Silicon Valley megacorps and online service providers, who use the information users upload to increase their own wealth, power, and influence (at users\u2019 expense).\n\nAs for networks like BTC, their participants have become too absorbed in downstream issues like libertarianism and speculative investment, which in turn has influenced those networks\u2019 development approach. Bitcoin (BSV), on the other hand, is more interested in creating new economies by monetizing data itself. It also hands ownership of that data back to those who create and/or own it: the users.\n\nBlockchain doesn\u2019t magically solve all these problems by itself, though, and there are some shortcomings.\n\n\u201cThe blockchain is just a giant bucket of unsorted data,\u201d Wuckert says, or \u201ca monolithic database.\u201d And here\u2019s where JungleBus comes in. How do you index, categorize, and identify the terabytes (or more) of new data Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processors record onto the network every day? How can you ever know what data is important and what can be ignored? How do we filter it, find out (for example) what data are payments, what are jpegs or audio files, what are tokens or scripts, or personal and business records?\n\nAs a mining pool, GorillaPool is running some of the most powerful nodes in the history of Bitcoin. They operate in large data centers, with 10GB connections, with the ability to process some of Bitcoin\u2019s largest-size blocks with minimum-possible latency.\n\nIt\u2019s quite challenging to set up and operate your own full node. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary for an application developer to take on the role of infrastructure manager just to keep it working. After all, it isn\u2019t necessary to run your own ISP to build an application on today\u2019s internet.\n\n\u201cJungleBus is essentially a piece of middleware that allows you to bootstrap an overlay network of just your (own) data,\u201d Wuckert shares. It\u2019s an interface to identify and filter only the data relevant to you and your project. Instead of verifying the entire world\u2019s random data stream, you can verify only your own and verify its provenance just as securely as if you were checking everything. JungleBus indexes data directly from Bitcoin miners (transaction processors), which Wuckert calls \u201cdirectly to the metal\u201d and is more reliable and scalable than existing index databases that communicate through their providers\u2019 servers.\n\nJungleBus allows developers to set up their own companies and services for a handful of dollars, rather than the six-figure or more sums associated with trying to verify transactions on your own full node operation.\n\nHow does JungleBus work?\n\nLuke Rohenaz then takes over leading the workshop to explain JungleBus\u2019 inner workings and use cases in more specific detail.\n\n\u201cWhere JungleBus really shines is with cross-platform interoperability,\u201d he says. He explains that it works as a back-end to the API that powers your applications and is not something you connect directly to the app itself. A single JungleBus subscription powers one app\u2014users don\u2019t have to use APIs to check data.\n\nJungleBus does the \u201cdeep inspection\u201d on transaction outputs to identify and flag data/protocol types. From that analysis, it can create a feed that can categorize data of interest across multiple different services. Rohenaz demonstrates the currently-supported data reference or media types, which include BAP (Bitcoin Attestation Protocol), RUN, MAP, BITCOIN, and B, among others. Subscribing users can configure their own dashboards with a selection of fields to follow and verify only relevant transaction data.\n\nJungleBus works in real-time and can even check data in mempool transactions (meaning even txs that haven\u2019t yet been processed), and it also allows for blockchain \u201cre-orgs\u201d and other errors. For developers, Rohenaz shows how to configure and code a subscription based on raw transaction data, using data across services like BitChat and BlockPost as examples.\n\nRohenaz describes all this as \u201ca big blue open sea of opportunity for anyone who wants to build interoperable apps\u201d and hints at an upcoming hackathon next month to explore new ideas. To kick this off, he suggests some possibilities. Watch Wuckert and Rohenaz\u2019s workshop in the video above, and start thinking of exciting ways you\u2019d like to organize the world\u2019s data.\n\nWatch: Build on Blockchain \u2013 Common Challenges & Tools to Make it Easier\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Brendan Lee: Empowering users with Bitcoin and blockchain - CoinGeek",
        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nBrendan Lee is one of the Bitcoin SV enthusiasts who talk about Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but because of its utility beyond the HODL attitude. Lee, the founder of Elas, was at the IEEE Blockchain Event at the University of Exeter to discuss the Bitcoin white paper, IPv6, Bitcoin, and their ongoing projects in the space.\n\nAfter his presentation, Lee talked to CoinGeek Backstage reporter Becky Liggero about why people should think of Bitcoin as a ledger instead of a coin or a store of value. Lee emphasized that owning a token isn\u2019t the main game of Bitcoin. Yes, you can possibly get rich with it, but building an application with more value generates the most revenue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about learning how to apply those tokens into an application and create something that has even more value\u2014potentially hundreds or thousands of times more value than the underlying tokens themselves. I expect that within a decade, the value of the objects being managed on the Bitcoin ledger will be a multiple like a hundred or a thousand off the actual value of the Bitcoin satoshis that are on the blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nLee also shared their work within the industry, such as the Tuvalu project with Fai\u0101 and nChain, which started in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn a place like Tuvalu that has a paper-based system but doesn\u2019t have any trees, the use of paper is like a bit of friction on their economy. It costs a lot of money. So [we\u2019re] trying to look at ways to minimize that use of paper or remove it entirely and speed up the delivery of those services and to enhance the outcomes of the people who live in Tuvalu without completely disrupting the process,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to make the process work much faster, much quicker, much more cheaply so that people can get on with business,\u201d he noted.\n\nAnother project that Elas and Lee are working on is Tokenized Gold with an Australian company, Amleh Gold. Lee revealed that the idea for this project is to enable corporations to manage gold resources by building tokenized ownership records, potentially buying and selling them in the market, with an option to create a gold-backed currency in the BSV blockchain.\n\nOne of the themes at the IEEE in Exeter event was empowering businesses and people with IPv6 and blockchain; Liggero asked Lee how Elas allows this to happen.\n\n\u201c[Blockchain is] here to be a tool for them to improve the capacity of their departments and their systems to handle the demands of the people. And it\u2019s not by destroying the system that we empower people; it\u2019s by improving the system and making the system work ten times better and finding ways to optimize the processes that are being developed,\u201d he replied.\n\nAs for teaching the university students of Exeter about the fundamentals of Bitcoin and blockchain, Lee said that the first step is to study its foundation\u2014the Bitcoin white paper.\n\n\u201cFirst thing is to go through the Bitcoin white paper section by section,\u201d Lee remarked. \u201cI think the Bitcoin white paper is one of the most misunderstood documents of the last couple of decades\u2026What we\u2019re trying to do is to help them [students] to understand it in a way that will allow them to build things\u2026improve the systems or create all new systems that are ten times better than the ones that we use today,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch: Elas: Creating private, permissioned ledgers on the public blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Blender, the cryptocurrency mixer sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control in May, was \u201chighly likely\u201d relaunched as Sinbad, according to risk management firm Elliptic.\n\nIn a Feb. 13 report, Elliptic said its analysis of Sinbad indicated that the crypto mixer was likely a rebrand of Blender as well as having \u201cthe same individual or group responsible for it.\u201d According to the firm, Sinbad was behind the laundering of roughly $100 million in Bitcoin (BTC) for North Korea\u2019s hacking group Lazarus.\n\nElliptic said that after U.S. authorities cracked down on crypto mixers \u2014 as OFAC did with Tornado Cash in August and Blender in May \u2014 Lazarus hackers used Sinbad to launder some of the funds from the $100-million attack on Horizon Bridge in January. Blockchain analysis of wallets tied to a suspected Blender operator also showed $22 million in crypto going to Sinbad and other funds sent to individuals who promoted the mixer.\n\n\u201cThe on-chain pattern of behavior is very similar for both mixers, including the specific characteristics of transactions, and the use of other services to obfuscate their transactions,\u201d said Elliptic. \u201cThe way in which the Sinbad mixer operates is identical to Blender in several ways, including ten-digit mixer codes, guarantee letters signed by the service address, and a maximum seven-day transaction delay.\u201d\n\nSource: Elliptic\n\nElliptic speculated that the individuals behind Sinbad may have rebranded to \u201cgain trust from users\u201d following Blender shutting down, adding that OFAC could consider ordering sanctions on the crypto mixer. The U.S. Treasury Department is already facing lawsuits for its sanctions on Tornado Cash.\n\nRelated: Into the storm: The murky world of cryptocurrency mixers\n\nLazarus has allegedly been responsible for several major attacks in the crypto space, including a $620-million hack of Axie Infinity\u2019s Ronin Bridge in March.

        "content": "The global crypto market cap stands on the verge of losing the $1 trillion mark, as prices of top coins saw more losses than gains early Monday morning. Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest crypto, failed to rise above the $22,000 mark over the weekend. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of reds and greens across the board. The Render Token (RNDR) became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 13 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.49 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $21,828.45, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.09 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 18.75 lakhs.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price today\n\nETH price stood at $1,518.99, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.88 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.32 lakhs.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) price today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour loss of 0.17 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.08179. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 7.29.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour dip of 0.16 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $93.07.

Bitcoin's value dipped below $22,000 following the US-based Kraken crypto exchange's decision to halt its staking service and pay a $30 million fine to the SEC for not registering the service. The current trading price of Bitcoin, near its support level of $21,770, is bearish, and if the trend continues, it could fall to $21,500 by the end of the week. Currently, Bitcoin does not show any signs of a midterm price recovery.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cThe Crypto market is feeling the impact of global regulations. Liquid staking token prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement which clarified that staking as a technical service will continue in the US but with more transparency around tokens going into the staking pool, to prevent fund misuse. Bitcoin\u2019s price fell due to the SEC verdict that Kraken will cease its US operations. Ethereum\u2019s price went down by almost 1.6 percent.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin price drops below $21,750, downtrend could continue with potential to reach $21,200. If the price breaks below this level, further declines may occur with the next support level at $20,600. Despite the current decline, with support from the 200-day EMA, there may be an opportunity for another top if the market holds above $20,300.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cOver the weekend, there was significant growth observed in certain subsectors of the cryptocurrency market. However, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating and charging Paxos for their involvement with the BUSD stablecoin, which highlights the increased regulatory scrutiny that the industry may face in the coming year. Despite the challenging global regulatory environment, there seems to be a shift in the commentary surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in India. Previously, there had been some suggestions to ban cryptocurrencies, but recent comments from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicate a more accommodating stance. It is expected that the regulation of cryptocurrencies will eventually be a coordinated effort by governments worldwide. However, India's initial stance during the G20 summit was to ban cryptocurrencies, as opposed to exploring the possibility of a coordinated regulatory framework.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market had a busy weekend as BTC is looking for a new support level. The macroeconomic factors are swinging the prices across the crypto market which include regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected December consumer prices. BTC is trading close to the $22,000 level while ETH is exchanging hands at the $1,516 level. The next FOMC meeting is the next big event for the digital asset market for which investors are eagerly waiting.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Trades for Six Figures amid OTC Trading on Spreadsheet - Tekedia",
        "content": "Lately there has been buzz on the Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs. Rodarmor, a prolific blockchain developer created the \u2018Ordinals\u2019 on Satoshi script a week ago on the Bitcoin network, presumably many believed Bitcoin is meant for processing payments and not as fungible tokens but through this new discovery, NFTS can now be inscribed on the chain with many notable derivatives such the original CryptoPunks and Bored Apes launching on the Ordinals protocol with high trading volumes, floor and bidding price.\n\nThe average price of a floor CryptoPunks NFT on the Ethereum mainnet is around 60 Eth or $90,000 but it is way more expensive on the Bitcoin chain, with Bitcoin Punks trading around six figures as most trades are executed on Spreadsheet via OTC trading.\n\nInterestingly, Leonidas an NFT Historian wrote an extensive Twitter thread explaining why he ventured into the Bitcoin NFTs narrative and what prompted him in spending 3.2 BTC (45 ETH) or $73,600 on Bitcoin Jpegs.\n\nTo put it simply, I\u2019ve fallen in love with the ordinals protocol. It\u2019s elegant, opinionated, and strives to bring digital objects to Bitcoin in a way that honors its ethos and values. I got to meet the founder back in September and am so proud of him. For those who don\u2019t know, every Bitcoin can be subdivided into 100,000,000 satoshis. Recently, Rodarmor found a way to associate a unique number with every satoshi so that they can be individually tracked and transferred. Then he took it a step further by developing a method for inscribing arbitrary data onto a satoshi. When you put all of this together it means that you can store any content that you want directly on Bitcoin and then transfer it to others. Want your art on Bitcoin? Just inscribe the JPEG. What about a song? Just inscribe the MP3. A website? Just inscribe the HTML. A video game? No problem, somebody already inscribed a fully functional game of Doom which you can play.\n\nSo far there are ~38,000 inscriptions and this number has been roughly doubling every day for the past week. However, interacting with the ordinals protocol is currently cumbersome as you need to run a full Bitcoin node and have minor technical skills.\n\nBut this is changing quickly, which is part of the reason why I\u2019m so excited about the future of ordinals. An organic ecosystem is forming and IMO it is inevitable that the infrastructure needed to onboard several orders of magnitude more people will get built out. Explorers, collections, inscription tools, wallets with a GUI (currently only has a CLI), and trustless marketplaces with a GUI (currently all trades are OTC) are all actively being developed.\n\nThis brings me to the Bitcoin Punks. As a Historical NFT collector, my thesis is that value will accrue asymmetrically to the collections that are early. I\u2019m not interested because they are punks (they could be anything) rather I care because they are low number inscriptions. Bitcoin Punks are 10,000 of the first 34,400 ordinal inscriptions. As a collector, this narrative resonates strongly with me.\n\nMy theory is that the more successful the ordinals protocol becomes, the more inscriptions there will be and thus the more rare and desirable the earliest inscribed collections will become. I think some people are missing the point by paying attention to the art/collection. In the future, quality will matter a lot more, just like it does for Ethereum, however, the ordinals market is currently predicated on low inscriptions having long-term collectible value. I believe that collectors will value the permanence of having art backed up forever to the Bitcoin blockchain, and think the high-end cryptoart market will eventually come to value what the Bitcoin brand adds to a collection but for now it\u2019s all about low inscription numbers.\n\nHowever, Davis KOL an ardent Bitcoin and Crypto Experimentalist at BasedKarbon, is not really happy with the Bitcoin NFT meta currently buzzing Twitter, he noted Bitcoin NFTs priced in eth, based on eth NFTs, and being wrapped in emblem vaults to sell on opensea has to be the stupidest nft meta we\u2019ve had so far;\n\nPriced in eth and emblem wrapped wouldn\u2019t be that dumb if the projects were original. I\u2019d understand the need to make the experience accessible and familiar. But copies of punks, a ripoff of a failed punk derivative, moonbird, Clones kinda clear which group is doing these gifts.\n\nBitcoinooooors have spent the last years alternately mocking NFTs and trying to get ETH regulated out of existence ex-post facto as a security, and now they want all the ETH NFT folks to basically seed them on their development of a Bitcoin NFT architecture.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

Depression possible. Fed forced to print billions in fake money. By 2025 gold at $5,000 silver at $500 and Bitcoin at $500,000. Why? Because faith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed. Gold & Silver Gods money. Bitcoin people\u2019s $. Take care. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 13, 2023\n\nKiyosaki warns of a recession ahead\n\nNotably, the best-selling author and entrepreneur, who is a known critic of the fiat currency system in the U.S. and the world, had previously warned that the world was already in a recession, voicing the expectations of a rough landing.\n\nHe had earlier also reiterated that investors should avoid paper money and instead focus on accumulating precious metals like gold, which he expected to rally in the coming months due to the accumulation by central banks, predicting that the stock market would likely crash further.\n\nAs for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Kiyosaki labeled it one of the three \u201chottest subjects on earth\u201d alongside silver and gold, referring to Bitcoin as \u201cpeople\u2019s money,\u201d and attributing its bullish rally in January to the increasing demand for alternative investment products.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency, which Kiyosaki predicts to trade at $500,000 by 2025, was at press time changing hands at the price of $21,756, down 0.8% on the day, as well as declining 5.19% across the previous week but still recording an increase of 9.1% on its monthly chart, as per data retrieved on February 13.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "content": "Wirex, a leading crypto payments platform, has announced a long-term strategic partnership with payment giant Visa (NYSE: V) to expand its footprint in the United Kingdom and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.\n\nUnder the partnership, Wirex will directly issue crypto-enabled debit, and prepaid cards for assets like Bitcoin (BTC) to more than 40 countries, the crypto payment firm said in a press release on February 13.\n\nThe partnership will support further collaboration in significant markets such as Europe, the USA, and APAC between two countries.\n\nExpanding crypto payment services\n\nThe development is another milestone for Wirex, which has over five million customers globally, with the UK as its largest customer base and rapid growth in APAC. The partnership is expected to empower more people to access the benefits of crypto.\n\n\u201cVisa wants to bring more payment options to consumers by connecting digital currencies with our network of banks and merchants. We\u2019re excited that Wirex is expanding their focus on Asia Pacific, making it easy and seamless for people to spend their crypto balance at the millions of merchants that accept Visa in the region,\u201d said Matt Wood, Head of Digital Partnerships, Asia Pacific at Visa.\n\nElsewhere, Svyatoslav Garal, Regional Managing Director of Wirex APAC, pointed out that Visa\u2019s safety, security, and innovation will help the company to continue developing a next-generation app and card.\n\nIt is worth noting that, although Wirex\u2019s primary customer base is in the UK, it withdrew from the region\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) temporary registration regime before the full registration deadline. This means it now serves UK-based customers through a subsidiary licensed in Croatia.\n\nIndeed, Wirex has long made it clear about its global expansion plans, an aspect backed by significant capital inflow from various backers.\n\nVisa crypto expansion\n\nAt the same time, Visa has been making inroads into the crypto space, intending to launch several products after the firm filed trademarks for crypto wallets and the metaverse.\n\nBack in 2022, the company also launched a no-limit Bitcoin card in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) alongside partnering with the now-collapsed FTX crypto exchange to offer crypto-backed debit cards in 40 countries"

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe Bitcoin price prediction sees a 0.46% decline over the past few hours as the cryptocurrency fails at $21,899 and could head lower.\n\nBitcoin Prediction Statistics Data:\n\nBitcoin price now \u2013 $21,692\n\nBitcoin market cap \u2013 $417.6 billion\n\nBitcoin circulating supply \u2013 19.2 million\n\nBitcoin total supply \u2013 19.2 million\n\nBitcoin Coinmarketcap ranking \u2013 #1\n\nBTC/USD Long-term Trend: Ranging (Daily Chart)\n\nKey levels:\n\nResistance Levels: $25,000, $27,000, $29,000\n\nSupport Levels: $19,000, $17,000, $15,000\n\nBTC/USD loses its momentum after touching key resistance above $21,899. As of writing, the king coin is down 0.46% on the day at $21,692 hovering below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price may struggle to close above $21,700, and if it does, it should be free to rise well above $22,000 if it moves toward the upper boundary of the channel.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: Can Bitcoin Price Trade Above $22,000?\n\nAfter a slightly positive move above $21,800, the Bitcoin price could remain below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. Over the past few days, the king coin has been struggling for the bullish movement. In today\u2019s session, the Bitcoin price attempted to push higher, but the sellers stepped into the market to bring the market price lower to touch the daily low of $21,431.\n\nMoreover, if the coin moves lower, the $21,000 may serve as the nearest support level, which may likely make room for the coin to fall further to hit the supports at $19,000, $17,000, and $15,000. The Relative Strength Index (14) remains below the 50- level, which could follow the downward movement. On the contrary, BTC/USD may likely face the upper boundary of the channel to hit the resistance levels of $25,000, $27,000, and $29,000.\n\nBTC/USD Medium-term Trend: Bearish (4H Chart)\n\nOn the 4-Hour chart, the BTC price hovers around $21,647 and may likely cross above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. However, if the bulls gather enough strength, the upward movement may be near the resistance level of $22,500 and above.\n\nOn the downside, immediate support could be located around the $21,300 level while critical support is at $21,000 and below. Therefore, the Bitcoin price may likely fall below the lower boundary of the channel if the bears put more pressure on the market, Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (14) keeps moving below the 40-level, suggesting a sideways movement.\n\nBitcoin Alternatives\n\nThe Bitcoin price is at the moment moving sideways, if the king coin moves above the resistance level of $22k, it is likely to resume upward movement but if not, there could be more negative movements in the market. However, the Meta Masters Guild has become one of the most popular crypto presales of the year, raising almost $4.5 million as it continues its presale to end the fundraising round in less than five days."
