        "title": "Bitcoin: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The stock market and the overall cryptocurrency market have had great years thus far, rewarding investors with strong gains. In this type of bullish environment, it's no surprise that Bitcoin (BTC -2.83%) has soared 125% (as of Nov. 21).\n\nDespite the renewed sense of optimism surrounding the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, its current price of roughly $37,000 is 47% below the peak price from about two years ago. There's still a lot of room before Bitcoin can get back to its all-time high.\n\nIs it a smart move for investors to buy this digital asset on the dip? Let's take a closer look.\n\nA favorable setup\n\nNow might be one of the best times to buy Bitcoin because of an event known as a halving. Miners, or those who expend computing power and electricity to approve transactions, are rewarded with new coins. Happening about every four years, a halving is when Bitcoin's inflation rate of new supply gets cut in half. It's set to happen in April next year.\n\nOver time, as rising demand has taken hold, coupled with less supply hitting the market, Bitcoin's price has trended higher. And looking at history, in the several months leading up to a halving, and in the months after, the price has generally been in bull market territory.\n\nThere's also anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to finally approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Some of the largest asset managers in the world, in charge of trillions of dollars, have applied for this financial product to come to market.\n\nIt's hard to know what the SEC will decide, but there's anticipation it will be positive. And this could open up the floodgates of fresh capital being directed to Bitcoin, which can help support a higher price.\n\nI'm no macroeconomic expert, but there's another potential catalyst for Bitcoin on the horizon, and it involves what the Federal Reserve does. With inflation showing signs of cooling, the central bank might decide to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Moreover, if the U.S. economy ends up entering a recession, the Fed will also have no choice but to reduce rates. This scenario can benefit risky assets like Bitcoin.\n\nA unique financial asset\n\nBesides the possibility of three catalysts for Bitcoin's price in the near term, there are some other reasons investors might be interested in owning this asset.\n\nJust look at what has happened in 2023: Bitcoin, often viewed as extremely risky to own, has crushed the performance of Treasuries and gold, both of which are seen as two of the safest assets to own. It's encouraging to see Bitcoin's price skyrocket this year amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nSome investors might view Bitcoin as a much more attractive asset in light of what's going on in the traditional financial system, thanks to its decentralized nature where no single entity is in charge.\n\nFinancial mismanagement by the government has seemed to cause rising costs for everything. Plus, budget deficits, increasing debt balances, underfunded entitlements, and the continuous threat of government shutdowns are likely only going to get worse. This situation makes buying Bitcoin, an asset completely outside of this fiat architecture, look incredibly smart.\n\nTo be clear, this is still a very volatile asset, which might be hard for most investors to stomach. So it's a good idea to allocate a tiny percentage of your overall portfolio to Bitcoin. As you learn more and gain greater conviction, it makes sense to increase that allocation."

        "title": "Opinion: Blockchain, the Backbone of Bitcoin, Has Power to Increase Accountability and Transform Industries - Sacramento Observer",
        "content": "By Samuel Houston | Special to California Black Media Partners\n\n(WIB) \u2013 The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has sparked a revolution that holds the promise of greater financial accountability. While many may view cryptocurrencies as nothing more than speculative assets, to better understand the transformative power they have, it is crucial to delve deeper into the underlying blockchain technology that supports them.\n\nBlockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, is essentially a decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This ledger is immutable and transparent, making it virtually tamper-proof. Transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name \u201cblockchain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s common to hear people talk about investing in cryptocurrencies without fully comprehending the intricacies of blockchain technology. While it\u2019s not necessary for every user to be a blockchain expert, a basic understanding of how it works can help one appreciate the significance of this innovation.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of blockchain technology is its wide range of use cases. Beyond serving as the backbone of cryptocurrencies, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including agriculture, entertainment, real estate, and retail.\n\nIn the agricultural industry, it enables the tracking of agricultural products from farm to table, recording information such as seed quality, crop growth, and the journey of a plant post-farm. This transparency ensures the authenticity of food products, reduces fraud, and enhances food safety. TE-FOOD has already revolutionized the tracing application\n\nof blockchain technology, providing over 150 million people access to farm-to-table foods across the globe.\n\nBlockchain-based platforms are revolutionizing the entertainment industry by ensuring fair compensation to artists and content creators through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries. Artists and creators can receive fair compensation for their work through transparent and automatic royalty payments, eliminating intermediaries who often take a substantial cut. Companies like Hollywoodland and Decentralized Pictures are even leveraging crypto tokens and blockchain to identify emerging talent and finance projects.\n\nReal estate transactions frequently entail multiple intermediaries, leading to high fees and lengthy processes. However, blockchain technology can greatly simplify property transactions, rendering them more efficient, secure, and cost-effective. For instance, Docuwalk by ShelterZoom used blockchain to oversee every facet of the real estate offer and acceptance procedure. This secure online platform meticulously documents each step in the journey towards finalizing a real estate deal, thereby guaranteeing an immutable financial record, and enhancing consumer protection.\n\nConsumers are already reaping the rewards of blockchain technology within the retail sector. Starbucks has leveraged blockchain technology to enhance customer satisfaction through a loyalty program that enables customers to accumulate rewards points from every purchase made at their stores. These accumulated points can later be redeemed for valuable rewards. Similarly, Walmart has adopted blockchain technology to offer loyalty programs, granting reward points to all customers who make purchases at their stores.\n\nOne of the key features of cryptocurrency that often comes under scrutiny is its financial accountability. Critics argue that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it challenging to hold individuals accountable for illicit activities. While it\u2019s true that there is no centralized middleman, it\u2019s essential to recognize that blockchain\n\ntechnology itself provides a level of accountability that traditional financial systems cannot match.\n\nEvery transaction on the blockchain is recorded and publicly accessible, making it possible to trace the flow of funds. This transparency can deter fraudulent activities and provide a level of financial accountability that is often lacking in traditional banking systems.\n\nCritics may contend that the absence of intermediaries means users must take responsibility for their financial transactions, which can be challenging for some. However, this very aspect empowers individuals to have greater control over their finances. With cryptocurrencies, you are your bank, and you can manage your assets directly, without reliance on third parties.\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have ushered in a new era of financial accountability and empowerment. While it\u2019s essential for users to educate themselves and exercise responsibility, the benefits of transparency, efficiency, and reduced reliance on intermediaries cannot be understated. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are not merely speculative assets but represent a significant step towards a more accountable and decentralized financial future, ultimately putting power back in the hands of the people.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSamuel Houston is a Fresno resident. He views cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies as a way for the Black community to take control of their finances and as another means to support his daughter."

The firm has come out saying it was its decision to remove the app.\n\n\u201cWallet of Satoshi needs to comply with local regulations or laws in ways that it cannot, or does not want to,\u201d John Carvalho, CEO of Bitcoin software developer Synonym, said in response.\n\nThe firm remains hopeful of a return in the country with future developments. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that future developments will allow us to revisit and possibly resume our operations in the U.S.,\u201d it added\n\nOne million Lightning transactions and near record capacity\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWallet of Satoshi is one of the most popular Bitcoin Lightning wallets and projected to process more than a record one million Lightning Network payments in November. Nonetheless, the firm has previously faced criticism for the custodial nature of its app, which retains control over users\u2019 funds, unlike non-custodial solutions that allow users to maintain full control over their bitcoin.\n\nWallet of Satoshi's decision to exit the U.S. market coincides with the Lightning Network\u2019s capacity rising back to all-time highs in both U.S. dollar and bitcoin terms, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nU.S. dollar capacity has jumped 67% over the last two months to reach $207 million, just shy of the $215 million record set in November 2021 at the peak of the bull market. Bitcoin capacity rose 20% over the same period to hit 5,530 BTC, slightly below the previous 5,640 BTC record set in July.\n\nWallet of Satoshi did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block."

        "content": "Bitcoin rallied to start the week, touched a new 2023 high to end it and suffered a brief drop in between, weighed down by the trouble at Binance. Bitcoin ended the week higher by about 4% after touching a new 2023 high on Friday above $38,000. Meanwhile, ether advanced 8%. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from 4:00 p.m. ET on a given Friday to the same time the following Friday. There was an array of events driving the price this week \u2013 from the election in Argentina , the minutes of the latest Fed meeting and updates to bitcoin ETF applications, to the Binance settlement and the leadership coup at OpenAI . These things not only highlighted the nuance in bitcoin's purpose and identity, it also put the crypto industry's long-standing regulatory woes back in focus for investors. \"The thing I'd be focused on over the short term is what kind of news we have on the regulatory front versus what is already discounted by traders,\" Zach Pandl, managing director of research at Grayscale Investments, told CNBC. \"Are we going to see news that's positive enough that gives us new price highs given the way people are already positioned?\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin, 1 year For the year, bitcoin is up about 130% even after remaining stuck in a tight range for most of it. Optimism about the likely approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has been building for the past couple months, serving as the biggest catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Pandl (whose company is a key player in the push to get an ETF off the ground with its popular GBTC product) said he thinks the market will continue to get good news on the ETF front. Moreover, as the industry recovers from the black eye FTX dealt it this time last year, regulators are learning how to separate different market participants. \"Regulators are very clearly segregating a variety of issues \u2013 on one hand, bad actors and parts of the business [of crypto] that we don't want to see continue, versus the asset management community [and] ETF community, which is just providing a product to the public,\" he said. The challenge is that active crypto trader positioning appears long, he added, based on activity in crypto futures, options, open interest and funding rates. \"While we may hear more positive news about the prospect of an ETF approval, some of that is priced in so things need to happen sooner or more smoothly for them to incrementally move a price,\" he said. Meanwhile, Michael Rinko, a research analyst at Delphi Digital, said this week's Binance settlement is one piece of evidence of a new narrative forming in crypto regulation, one in which the Biden administration could be starting to view crypto through a similar lens to which they see technology fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. It may be a long while before crypto reaches the level of priority as AI, he added, but the latest Binance development is part of an emerging narrative. \"Increasingly, the view in from the U.S. government's perspective is that they're viewing more and more technology through the lens of national security,\" he said. Rinko highlighted examples such as semiconductors and the CHIPS act and increasing engagement with AI leading to restrictions on some of Nvidia's higher-end chips, and said a similar path could be coming for crypto. Already underway is a sort of regulatory attack on the crypto players the U.S. deems unacceptable, he said, adding it will likely fracture the crypto world into two spheres. \"There will be the Western sphere of influence where there's Coinbase , Kraken and exchanges that have relationships and ties to the so-called West, and then there will be Eastern exchanges that operate outside the influence and control of the U.S. and its allies and are persona non grata from a U.S. perspective,\" he said."

It is currently at just below $21,000.\n\nBitcoin bear market bottoms are characterized by the spot price dipping below the realized price, while bull markets begin once the spot crosses the two-year and five-month realized price levels.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor the last year, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer has emphatically urged all who would listen to get out of crypto\u2014and specifically, away from Bitcoin.\n\nNow, the Mad Money host is\u2014once again\u2014changing his tune, right as Bitcoin surges to an 18-month high.\n\n\u201cFor a while I liked it, then I decided: You know what? The money had been made,\u201d Cramer said of Bitcoin during a Mad Money segment earlier this week. \u201cBut I was premature.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you make a lot of money, let\u2019s not look back,\u201d he added.\n\nCramer\u2019s newfound faith in Bitcoin comes during a major surge for the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency. Earlier today, BTC rocketed above $38,000 for the first time in a year and a half. In the last month, the coin has steadily climbed 10%. And it\u2019s not just Bitcoin that\u2019s up: in the same period, Ethereum has spiked 17%, hitting its own 18-month peak earlier Friday.\n\nMuch of that momentum stems from industry-wide hope for the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014which, if finally greenlit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after 10 years of denials, would allow traditional financial institutions to gain exposure to BTC without holding any cryptocurrency.\n\nBlockchain analysts at CryptoQuant have previously said the product could lead to a $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer, despite having profited off BTC himself, appeared to permanently write off the coin and all other cryptocurrencies after the collapse of the crypto market in May 2022, and again after the shuttering of crypto exchange FTX rattled the industry last fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never too late to sell an awful position, and that\u2019s what you have if you own these so-called digital assets,\u201d Cramer said last December.\n\nA year later, with Bitcoin back on the rise, Cramer\u2019s now claiming he\u2019s always supported those with long-term faith in the coin.\n\n\u201cIf you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin,\u201d the television personality said Tuesday. \u201cThat has always been my view.\u201d\n\nMany in the crypto and finance communities have long skewered Cramer\u2019s ever-shifting stances on financial products, with some claiming that doing the inverse of whatever he advises can generally be considered very sound financial advice.\n\nLast year, the SEC received multiple applications for real-life \u201cInverse Cramer ETFs,\u201d which would automatically invest user\u2019s funds using the opposite of Cramer\u2019s instructions as gospel.\n\nGiven such logic, some crypto investors have taken to social media to posit that Cramer\u2019s revived confidence in BTC could spell doom for the ascendant cryptocurrency\u2014and erase the encouraging gains of the last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

The market's equilibrium during this period can be attributed to the prevailing regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Investors are digesting the fallout from regulatory actions taken against some players in the industry.Amidst this, optimism lies in the anticipation of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ).

If not, it could trigger a fresh decline, with immediate support situated at the US$37,200 level.Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently positioned above the US$2,000 level, consolidating gains and eyeing potential advancement toward the US$2,150 level.In an interesting development, Alchemy Pay, a crypto-fiat payment service provider, has revealed its expansion into the U.S. following the acquisition of a money services license in the state of Iowa.

According to data from Blockchain.com, the total Blockchain hash rate reached 491 exahashes per second, signifying the colossal computational efforts securing the Bitcoin network.

Notably, Singapore's Central Bank is adopting measures to discourage crypto speculation while simultaneously easing investment qualifications, showcasing a responsive approach to industry feedback.In a positive stride towards digital currency adoption, the Bank of Korea (BoK) has unveiled plans to invite 100,000 Korean citizens to participate in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot. The testing, slated for September to October 2024, will enable citizens to make purchases with deposit tokens. Furthermore, the BoK will collaborate with the Korea Exchange to integrate its new digital currency into a simulation system for carbon emissions trading, testing the feasibility of delivery versus payment transactions.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1.

Every significant move in the market sparks curiosity and debate, as Bitcoin has recently experienced a notable increase in buying pressure.\n\nBLACKROCK IS PUMPING #BITCOIN!!!\n\n\n\nA lot of Bitcoin buying pressure seems coming from Coinbase!\n\n\n\nSince Coinbase is the custodial partner of BlackRock, could this be BlackRock? pic.twitter.com/cYyoaWlMSg \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) November 24, 2023\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Custodial Partnership with Coinbase\n\nCoinbase has been focused due to its custodial partnership with BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. The collaboration has led some to speculate that BlackRock may be a key player in the recent Bitcoin bullish pressure.\n\nWhile no concrete evidence confirms BlackRock\u2019s direct involvement, the correlation between the asset manager\u2019s partnership with Coinbase and the increased buying pressure on Bitcoin raises questions.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market evolves, institutional investors like BlackRock\u2019s role becomes increasingly significant.
