        "content": "A runoff election in Argentina, Sunday, resulted in a win for Javier Milei, a libertarian on the political right who wants to dollarize the country\u2019s economy and has expressed support for Bitcoin.\n\nMilei won about 56% of the vote versus just over 44% in the runoff, in Latin America\u2019s third most populous nation.\n\nIn a country which has recently witnessed triple-digit rates of inflation, Milei sees bitcoin and digital currencies as an effort to \u201creturn money to its original creator: the private sector.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEmphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply, he regards it as a more secure alternative to traditional mediums like gold or silver\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nMilei, known for his anti-central banking stance, has criticized the central bank for \u201ccheating good people\u201d through inflationary tax. He claimed that he would \u201cblow it up,\u201d calling it a scam, even releasing a cinematic political ad in 2021 while running for a seat in parliament, in which he\u2019s seen destroying a model representing the central bank with a Thor-like hammer.\n\nLoading Tweet.. The ad, surfaced recently, was produced in 2021.\n\nHis criticism is particularly poignant given Argentina\u2019s high inflation rates, which reached 135% in 2023\u200b\u200b. The peso has fallen in value, resulting in all-time highs for bitcoin (BTC), currently about ARS 13.2 million per BTC.\n\nMilei has been involved in controversies, including being sued for allegedly promoting a Ponzi scheme called Coinx in Argentina. He denied any misconduct, comparing the company\u2019s actions to those of a typical bank\u200b\u200b.\n\nDespite his support for cryptocurrencies, Milei has not proposed making bitcoin legal tender in Argentina, as it is in El Salvador. Instead, he has called for dollarizing the Argentine economy, as a way of dealing with the country\u2019s rampant inflation\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b problem.\n\nWhile Milei\u2019s views on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies reflect a strong preference for private sector-controlled money, and a skepticism towards central banking, it\u2019s unclear what a Milei administration will mean in practice when it comes to integrating crypto into national economic policies.\n\nUpdated November 20, 2023 at 8:35 am ET, clarifying Milei\u2019s anti-central bank political ad was from 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Economist Javier Milei will become the new president of Argentina after defeating Sergio Massa.\n\nMilei has made positive statements regarding bitcoin in the past, and he has also called for the abolishment of the Central Bank of Argentina.\n\nMilei has not outlined any specific policies regarding Bitcoin, but the dollarization of Argentina was a core tenet of his presidential campaign.\n\nBitcoin has become increasingly relevant in political campaigns around the world in recent years.\n\nOn Sunday, the Libertarian Party's Javier Milei was elected as the new president of Argentina. Milei has spoken positively about bitcoin in the past, and the price of the crypto asset rose to roughly $37,500 as Milei's opponent in the runoff election conceded defeat.\n\nMilei Has Embraced Bitcoin But Has No Policy Outlined\n\nLibertarian Javier Milei defeated fellow contender Sergio Massa in the runoff election for the president of Argentina on Sunday, with Milei receiving nearly 56% of the final vote tally.\n\nThe election result was viewed positively by bitcoin proponents around the world, as Milei has spoken supportively about the crypto asset in the past. Earlier this year, Milei referred to bitcoin as a representation of the \"return of money to its original creator, the private sector.\"\n\nMilei has already drawn comparisons to the heavily pro-bitcoin president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, who declared bitcoin legal tender in his country. However, the new president-elect of Argentina has not yet outlined a specific bitcoin policy for the country.\n\nThat said, Milei has promised to close the Central Bank of Argentina and embrace the dollarization of the Argentine economy. Argentina has a long history of difficulties with inflation, and the country has recently been struggling with an inflation rate of more than 100%.\n\n\"Ultimately, Grayscale Research views this as a meaningful step forward for crypto adoption, as bitcoin moves closer toward fulfilling its role as a super-sovereign means of exchange to accelerate a more accessible and inclusive financial system,\" wrote crypto asset manager Grayscale's Matt Maximo regarding the potential impact of Milei's victory.\n\nBitcoin Gathering Political Currency\n\nMilei is yet another example of bitcoin becoming a larger talking point in the global political landscape.\n\nIn the United States, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his first official appearance as a presidential candidate at a bitcoin conference earlier this year. Additionally, the current mayors of both New York City and Miami have talked about turning their respective cities into crypto hubs.\n\nThat said, there are also opponents of crypto in the U.S., most notably Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has embraced the idea of building an \"anti-crypto army\" in Washington.\n\nIn the past, Venezuela, which has been dealing with much worse levels of inflation than Argentina, attempted to create its own crypto token. However, Venezuela's crypto project, known as the Petro, was largely centralized, working much differently from bitcoin and failed in achieving what it set out to do."

        "content": "Bitcoin jumped nearly 3% after a pro-crypto candidate from the far right handily defeated Argentina\u2019s current economic minister in the country\u2019s presidential election.\n\nBitcoin broke through the $37,000 mark, and was still up 2% over the past 24 hours, after Javier Milei, a populist figure who labels himself an anarcho-capitalist and libertarian, was named the winner. Milei has found an audience in Argentina\u2014and among the crypto faithful\u2014in part for his radical economic proposals such as eliminating the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nMilei is friendly to cryptocurrencies, especially the most popular token, Bitcoin. In an interview with the Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn he raged against central banks and politicians, adding that Bitcoin was the natural reaction against \u201cthe scam that is central banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator, which is the private sector,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 53-year-old economist may be friendly to Bitcoin but he doesn\u2019t support making it legal tender as did El Salvador President Nayib Bukele in 2021. Milei has said he plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy in a bid to fight the more than 140% inflation that the South American country is facing.\n\nStill, some notable crypto figures have congratulated the president-elect, including MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and Arthur Hayes, the cofounder of crypto exchange BitMEX.\n\nWhile Milei\u2019s libertarian views on the economy have proved popular among Argentinians, the politician\u2019s radical stances on other issues have alienated others. Milei has actively opposed sex education and feminist causes, and he\u2019s said that humans are not the cause of global climate change, contradicting a nearly unanimous scientific consensus."

        "title": "With spot bitcoin ETFs looming, clock ticks on futures products - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nTwo years ago the first US exchange traded fund linked to bitcoin became the fastest ETF to hit $1bn in assets. But the coming weeks are set to test whether it and rival bitcoin futures ETFs can survive.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) now stands at $1.4bn, and it tracks the crypto token through futures. This type of product has been the only way for US investors to add bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios, as regulators have not approved numerous applications to launch ETFs tracking the crypto token itself.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission now faces a January 10 deadline to approve one or more pending applications for \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d ETFs, which are expected to provide a cheaper way for investors to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much life for that product after spot bitcoin launches,\u201d said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Peck acknowledged that bitcoin futures ETFs could retain some short-term trading utility but \u201cif you\u2019re a financial adviser or long-term investor, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d have it\u201d.\n\nThis summer brought a flurry of fresh applications for spot bitcoin ETFs in a rush prompted by BlackRock and a legal blow for the SEC after a federal appeals court ruled against the regulator in a bitcoin ETF-related lawsuit in August.\n\nUS regulators continue to hold doubts around whether spot bitcoin ETFs would be appropriate for investors, in part because of the heightened risk that the price of these often illiquid tokens is vulnerable to manipulation. Big trading platforms in this space are subject to a range of regulatory investigations and one of the biggest, FTX, imploded a year ago leading its chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried to be found guilty on multiple fraud and money laundering charges this month. However, industry insider still believe regulators will approve spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.\n\nIf that happens, some think the futures ETFs and spot ETFs can coexist.\n\n\u201cI think savvy investors who are risk-averse will gravitate to a product like BITO,\u201d said ProShares chief executive Michael Sapir, whose firm has not filed for a spot product. Oversight of the futures market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and fund administration services provided by a known financial juggernaut both offer support to the model he espouses.\n\n\u201cThere is risk in investing directly in the spot market [as opposed to BITOs] regulated futures contracts being held by JPMorgan,\u201d he said.\n\nPeck also pointed out that bitcoin itself is already obtainable by anyone with investable assets and the technical skill to set up a digital wallet. This should temper expectations for \u201csome giant organic demand right out of the gate\u201d for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cI view the [spot bitcoin] ETF as a workflow solution for primarily the wealth management channel,\u201d Peck said.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management and Swiss crypto manager 21Shares, which are among the firms hoping to launch a spot bitcoin product, earlier this month launched a suite of five digital asset ETFs, including a bitcoin futures strategy, which also indicates that futures ETFs will still have a role. Those two firms\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF application is set for its final deadline on January 10 after repeated delays on a decision by the SEC.\n\nThe potential for a dozen of spot bitcoin ETFs raises the prospect of fierce struggles to differentiate an ETF\u2019s brand, distribution tactics or price. In addition to 10 asset managers filing to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from scratch, Grayscale wants to reinvent the $23.3bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as an ETF \u2014 the SEC\u2019s initial refusal to allow this manoeuvre triggered Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 while Brazilian asset manager Hashdex is trying to convert its existing bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock, Ark Investment Management, Fidelity and Invesco are among the issuers waiting to hear from the SEC on their prospective spot ETFs, which trade over exchanges like stocks and enjoy favourable tax treatment. Spot bitcoin ETFs would not incur charges that futures-based products must bear, such as the cost of rolling over contracts on a regular basis, so they are expected to be substantially less expensive than both BITO and GBTC, which charge fees of 0.95 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.\n\nBecause the pending products are so similar and may launch all at once, their fees are likely to be a key differentiator compared to a typical ETF launch, which could drive down costs to investors, said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. He noted that providers are likely to fight for investors with low fees because \u201cthis is such a huge opportunity\u201d."

The recent eight-day window for potential approvals has concluded without any new ETFs being launched, prompting the SEC to announce a review of the applications in the coming year.\n\nThe SEC has postponed approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF from Global X and Franklin Templeton, as well as an application from Hashdex earlier this week. These delays have become a recurring theme as the SEC remains cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation.\n\nAnticipation for the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has long been held by market observers who believe it could result in a substantial influx of capital from Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market. Analysts at CryptoQuant suggest that such approval could provide a $1 trillion boost to Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite the delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate a 90% likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF receiving approval by January. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has expressed its preparedness to swiftly respond if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, anticipating enhanced market stability and liquidity, similar to what has been witnessed with other asset classes like gold ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fraud-ridden cryptocurrency exchange FTX, presented himself as an altruistic, unkempt genius who found himself unwittingly out of his depth. The jury, however, decided that he was a fraudster who knowingly stole $8 billion of customers\u2019 money. Another example that all that glitters in crypto land is not gold? A blockchain lover\u2019s Barbieland detached from the real world?\n\nWhatever your stance, crypto now has its own Jordan Belfort, and Bankman-Fried faces years behind bars. Ironically, as the 31-year-old awaits sentencing, bitcoin is on a tear. Its price has doubled, surging back above $37,000, while trading volume went gangbusters. But away from the courtroom drama, the reasons for this tidal shift are more prosaic, with the U.S. rumored to be on the cusp of having spot-price bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThis is arguably the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin since the mythical Satoshi Nakamoto invented it in 2008. Many clients will, therefore, see the legitimization provided by the new ETFs as a reason to ask their advisors why they aren\u2019t benefiting from the price increase.\n\nOn the surface, there are compelling arguments for the nascent asset class \u2014 its increasing lack of correlation to major markets establishes it as an alternative to gold, and the pending regulatory approval indicates that the data and structure are sound. But as InvestmentNews\u2019 Emile Hallez reports in this issue, most advisors don\u2019t have exposure. In short, they don\u2019t trust bitcoin or, whisper it, don\u2019t understand it. Given the cryptocurrency\u2019s short history and wild price swings, few advisors are willing to recommend an investment for which they can\u2019t predict or measure risk.\n\nAdvisors are, of course, paid to steer clients away from unsuitable investments, and bitcoin\u2019s volatility remains a huge turnoff for long-term financial planning. But doing so without a deep understanding of what you\u2019re rejecting won\u2019t be enough for bullish clients. Further education to get ahead of what could be another crypto wave looks like a smart play.\n\nThe new ETFs, at the very least, will make a small allocation of \u201cplay money\u201d in portfolios more palatable. Perversely, the fall of FTX may embolden some investors who view its collapse as some sort of nadir for crypto. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen again, right?\u201d\n\nBut for advisors, the SEC approval will be what matters and there is little doubt that bitcoin is inching toward more widespread legitimacy. Advisors, even deeply cynical ones, should be prepared for clients\u2019 crypto questions."

Now, the long-prophesied \u201cflippening\u201d of ether over bitcoin is even further in the future.\n\nThe market currently values Bitcoin three times higher than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at $727 billion, has swelled by $400 billion in 2023 \u2014 a figure bigger than Mastercard\u2019s entire stock valuation and about twice that of Netflix\u2019s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation has grown by $100 billion, jumping from under $145 billion in January to nearly $245 billion today.\n\nSome anticipate that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will one day eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s, despite the latter\u2019s half-decade head start.\n\nThings were looking good coming out of the 2019 bear market and into 2021\u2019s explosive bull cycle. DeFi summer and NFT mania boosted interest in Ethereum, at times driving up fees for certain actions beyond $250.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s market value was 925% of Ethereum\u2019s \u2014 $130 billion to $14 billion \u2014 at the end of 2019 (bottom of the bear market).\n\nThat figure had shrunk to under 200% by the end of 2021 (peak bull market).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is now 300% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Bitcoin rally has widened the gap\n\nThe case for flippening has recently taken a hit by a different flip: The Bitcoin network now rakes in more fees than Ethereum for the first time since December 2020.\n\nOver the past four days, Bitcoin users have paid miners about $40 million to have their transactions processed.\n\nEthereum users, meanwhile, forked out less than $27 million ether (most of those fees have been burned, slightly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall supply).\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum networks Arbitrum and Optimism haven\u2019t bridged that gap as they each generate less than $200,000 in fees per day right now.\n\nThe fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward when you consider the sheer amount of use cases supported by Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges, DAOs, memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, DeFi and GameFi all run atop Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had for the longest time mostly had one application \u2014 bitcoin transactions. But the rate of on-chain transactions had until recently sustained very little growth since 2015. Perhaps due to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and the rising ubiquity of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past five years, Ethereum users have paid $17 billion in fees, Bitcoin users just $2.9 billion\n\nAll that changed with Ordinals \u2014 a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin (BTC) with unique data to create digital collectibles, first launched in January.\n\nMusic, text, art, video and even code for browser-based DOOM clones have since been inscribed to Bitcoin, resulting in an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC. Bitcoin users trade Ordinals as Ethereum or Solana users would trade NFTs.\n\nToday, anywhere from around a third to one half of Bitcoin transactions contain Ordinals, driving up demand for blockspace as well as transaction fees. At times today, \u201cmedium priority\u201d transactions went for around $11 compared to around $2.30 for the same on Ethereum (more priority generally means faster processing), although those prices have since come down.\n\nTron comes in third overall for monthly fees, mostly thanks to stablecoin Tether\n\nSo is Bitcoin netting more fees than Ethereum good for Bitcoin? Maybe not.\n\nSome Bitcoin insiders worry the network isn\u2019t properly equipped to handle Ordinals and potential influxes of interest in its original use case, BTC payments.\n\nThe CryptoKitties incident in December 2017 \u2014 during which a NFT game grew so popular that it spectacularly clogged Ethereum \u2014 first showed that Ethereum probably couldn\u2019t handle serving as the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d just yet.\n\nThen, the 2021 bull market saw NFT mint costs soar to $250 at times \u2014 a reminder of how necessary it was to port activity to smaller chains, including rollups. Still, memecoins and low quality token projects ratcheted up fees beyond $20 earlier this year, drastically reducing Ethereum\u2019s usefulness for non-critical tasks.\n\nThe NFT craze of 2021 made Ethereum block space the hottest commodity in crypto. Even while tanking its utility.\n\nOrdinals may end up having the same effect on Bitcoin, especially if demand keeps up and the bull market truly hits.\n\nAt that point, it would seem reasonable to value Bitcoin and Ethereum more similarly. It might just take another run.\n\nUpdated Nov. 16, 2023 at 4:25 pm ET: Corrected reference to percentages in bullet points.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin And Austrian Economics: Insights From Tuur Demeester - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Austrian Economics have been subjects of much interest and discussion in recent years. In this article, we will explore the basics of Bitcoin, delve into the principles of Austrian Economics, and examine the unique insights provided by Tuur Demeester, a renowned expert in both fields.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Today's Economy\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin has become a store of value for many individuals who see it as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Its decentralized nature and limited supply have led some to view it as digital gold, a safe haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. This perception has been further reinforced by institutional investors and corporations, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla, allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin.\n\nIt is important to note that Bitcoin's impact extends beyond its monetary value. The underlying principles of decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance have inspired a broader movement for financial sovereignty and individual empowerment. Bitcoin has become a symbol of resistance against centralized authorities and a catalyst for reimagining the future of money.\n\nThe Principles of Austrian Economics\n\nLet us turn our attention to the principles of Austrian Economics. Austrian Economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes individual freedom, free markets, and limited government intervention. Its origins can be traced back to the works of economists such as Carl Menger, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nThe Origin and Evolution of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics emerged as a reaction to the prevailing economic theories of the time, which focused on mathematical models and central planning. Its proponents argued that economics should be grounded in the study of individuals' actions and choices, rather than abstract aggregates. Over the years, Austrian Economics has evolved and gained prominence, attracting a dedicated following of scholars and practitioners.\n\nKey Tenets of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics is characterized by several key principles. Firstly, it emphasizes the subjective nature of value, arguing that value is determined by individuals' preferences and choices. Secondly, it highlights the importance of entrepreneurship and market competition in driving economic growth and innovation.\n\nFurthermore, Austrian Economics emphasizes the role of the price mechanism in coordinating economic activity. Prices, according to Austrian economists, communicate crucial information about scarcity and consumer preferences. Finally, Austrian Economics advocates for sound money and opposes inflationary monetary policies.\n\nTuur Demeester: A Brief Introduction\n\nDemeester's Background and Influence\n\nTuur Demeester is an economist and investor who has extensively studied Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He is the founder of Adamant Capital, an investment firm specializing in Bitcoin research. Demeester's research and analysis have contributed significantly to the understanding of Bitcoin's economic implications and its relation to Austrian Economics.\n\nDemeester's Views on Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester has highlighted the compatibility between Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He argues that Bitcoin's decentralized and permissionless nature aligns with the principles of Austrian Economics, which emphasize individual freedom and free markets. Demeester sees Bitcoin as a potential disruptor to traditional financial systems and believes it can empower individuals by providing them with financial sovereignty.\n\nThe Intersection of Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester's Perspective on Bitcoin as a Free Market\n\nDemeester sees Bitcoin as a manifestation of the free market principles advocated by Austrian Economics. The absence of a centralized authority controlling Bitcoin's issuance and transaction validation aligns with the Austrian belief in spontaneous order and voluntary exchanges. Bitcoin's open-source nature allows anyone to participate and contribute, making it a truly decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Austrian Economic Theory\n\nBitcoin's emergence has sparked debates within the Austrian Economics community. Some argue that Bitcoin represents a digital form of Austrian economics in practice, as it operates outside the control of central banks and governments. Others contend that Bitcoin's lack of intrinsic value and its volatility make it an unsuitable representation of Austrian economic principles.\n\nCriticisms and Counter Arguments\n\nAs with any subject of interest, Bitcoin and Austrian Economics have not been immune to criticisms. Let us examine some common criticisms and explore Demeester's responses.\n\nCommon Criticisms of Bitcoin in Austrian Economics\n\nOne common criticism argues that Bitcoin's price volatility renders it unreliable as a medium of exchange. Critics claim that the constant fluctuation in value undermines its suitability as a store of value and a unit of account. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and its potential energy consumption.\n\nDemeester's Responses to Criticisms\n\nDemeester acknowledges the valid concerns raised regarding Bitcoin's volatility and energy consumption. However, he argues that as Bitcoin matures, its volatility is likely to decrease, making it more suitable for everyday transactions. Furthermore, Demeester highlights the growing adoption of renewable energy sources in Bitcoin mining, mitigating the environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the insights provided by Tuur Demeester shed light on the fascinating intersection of Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. Bitcoin's unique attributes align with the principles of Austrian Economics, opening the door to discussions about the future of money and the role of decentralized systems in our economic landscape.\n\nWeekly Recap (11/13/2023 - 11/17/2023)\n\nGermany\u2019s fourth largest bank Commerzbank granted Bitcoin and Crypto Custody license\n\nU.S. Presidential Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy: \u2018The Government is threatened by Bitcoin\u2019. During an interview on Natalie Brunell\u2019s CoinStories podcast Ramaswamy asserted that the government perceives Bitcoin as a potential threat to its control over monetary policy.\n\nBtcoin\u2019s price rose 120% since El Salvador became the first nation to buy 1 bitcoin a day. One year ago today (11/16/2023), El Salvador announced an ambitious plan to begin adding 1 Bitcoin per day to its national treasury.\n\nGrayscale CEO says \u2018They\u2019re ready for the main event\u2019, awaiting Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Bitcoin is up 122% year-to-date on the speculation of the first spot ETF approval in the United States.\n\nHong Kong based Boyaa plans to buy $45 Million worth of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "What do you make of these application delays? Are we going to see an approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF next year? Maybe I wouldn't, I would not put bet on uh on January of next year. And these delays I think are symptomatic of the general product that is being offered. So there, the SEC is delaying a whole host of them post the grey scale decision. We shouldn't be surprised that they're not going to go through until they're comfortable with all of them. Uh I mean, you know, before I deleted Twitter, of course, you had a lot of people on there that were saying things like, well, if it, if Blackrock and Fidelity are on it, then this is gonna happen because they have all this money and, and they know how to do things and they can tell the sec what to do because that's how the world works and you don't know anything, please. Um So tell me, I, I, is that actually a legitimate argument that all of us silly people who think that that regulators at the end of the day do have some amount of power over even the largest asset managers can say, look, we, we just don't want this out there and, and do you think that that's something they will do? It's, I think it's less that they just don't want it out there as much as we saw in the gray scale decision. What they want to continue to avoid. Right. They don't want to have any more losses. They suffered a huge loss on the arbitrary and capricious decision. They don't want to also suffer a loss in some of the other things that the court has suggested that they might lose on. And so one other thing that they are probably keeping in mind is how much these spot ETF S are going to probably change the investing market. We know, for example, that right now financial advisors aren't really advising people to diversify into Bitcoin. These are retail investors. Right. They're like maybe 12% but certainly that would go up to 77%. And I think that's what the SEC is taking a look at is that once they're comfortable with all, we'll probably see them say yes to all. But at the same time until they're comfortable with all, we're not going to see some sort of trickle effect of one after another. Slowly."

        "content": "Bitcoin Overtakes Ethereum in Transaction Fees on the Back of Renewed Ordinals Frenzy\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has recently surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in terms of average daily transaction fees, signaling a notable shift in the fee landscape. On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7. This listing sparked increased buying activity of BRC-20 tokens, resulting in a price surge of slightly over 50% for the ORDI token.\n\nIn addition to the growing popularity of the Ordinals Protocol, the Taproot Wizards project, which is built on the Ordinals protocol, announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million on November 17.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining involves people using computers or specialised mining hardware to participate in bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network as a transaction processor and validator. Bitcoin uses a system known as proof-of-work (PoW) to validate transaction information.\n\nBitcoin sets itself apart from conventional currencies managed by central banks through its fixed supply mechanism. Specifically, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, and at present, slightly fewer than 2 million are left to be mined. Roughly 90% of Bitcoin\u2019s entire supply has already been mined, with an estimated 900 being mined per day. This limited availability is maintained through a process called \"halving\u201d, strategically crafted to control inflation and progressively enhance its value.\n\nAs of today, network participants verifying transactions receive a reward of 6.25 bitcoins for successfully mining each block. However, the policy ingrained into its mining algorithm dictates a reduction of roughly half every four years, resulting in the reward falling to 3.125 in the next cycle.\n\nThe first bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012 and experts predict that the next halving will occur in April 2024.\n\nThe reward for mining each block:"

The ETF would trade on the BZX Exchange by the Chicago Board Options Exchange under the ticker ARKB.\n\nA slew of firms have recently added updates to their spot bitcoin ETF filings, including WisdomTree Investments on Nov. 16, indicating that conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission are moving along toward a potential approval..

Bitcoin, particularly, has been on a dream run over the past three weeks after remaining rangebound over the past two-and-a-half months.\n\nOn Nov 17, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were traded above $37,000 and $2,000, respectively. The rally has primarily been fueled by renewed optimism among investors following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is almost set to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF is poised to boost demand by offering traditional investors a means to access Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through conventional stock markets.\n\nThe move is expected to attract new investments to the crypto market, which could further boost overall demand for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe positive news sent other major cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) on a rally.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin have rallied 124.8%, 69.1%, 59% and 15.1%, year to date, respectively,\n\nCryptocurrencies rallied in the first seven months of the year as they staged a solid rebound from last year\u2019s lows. The rally stalled in August as investors failed to get a clear picture of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next course of action with interest rate hikes.\n\nHigher interest rates typically exert a negative impact on growth-oriented sectors, including technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, investors\u2019 mood has perked up once again as they expect the Fed to soon end its monetary tightening campaign as inflation has been declining sharply over the past few months.\n\nOur Picks\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "content": "The crypto community and many of its most high-profile players have started shifting focus toward the Bitcoin halving, an event that occurs every four years and cuts the market supply of new Bitcoin (BTC) in half.\n\nAt the next halving event scheduled for April 2024, the Bitcoin mining reward will reduce from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to set the countdown for the next halving in an X (formerly Twitter) post to remind everyone that the next BTC halving event is only 135 days away.\n\nHistorically, the Bitcoin halving is linked to bullish momentum for the BTC price due to supply and demand dynamics. The halving of new supply amid growing demand usually pushes the BTC price to new highs in the months following the halving.\n\nTwo months prior to the last halving event in May 2020, the Bitcoin price was trading at less than $10,000. As the event drew closer, bullish momentum saw BTC\u2019s price surpass the previous cycle\u2019s all-time high of around $17,000. After the halving, the BTC price broke into parabolic momentum and created an all-time high of almost $69,000.\n\nPopular trader and analyst Rekt Capital also took to X to elaborate on the different phases of a BTC bull cycle. The analyst divided the timeline into pre-halving and post-halving events, highlighting that approximately 60 days before the halving, a pre-halving rally tends to occur as investors tend to \u201cBuy the Hype\u201d to \u201cSell the News.\u201d\n\nHowever, the euphoric price surge in the pre-halving period is usually followed by a retracement around the time of the actual halving. In 2016, the pre-halving retracement was 38%, while the 2020 pre-halving retracement was 20%.\n\nThe pre-halving pullback is often followed by a multi-month reaccumulation phase during which the BTC price rises and falls, with little gains during a period of stagnation. Many investors get shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with their BTC investment\u2019s lack of performance in the halving\u2019s immediate aftermath.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle phases. Source: X/Rekt Capital\n\nThe accumulation phase is then typically followed by a parabolic surge, in which Bitcoin breaks out from the reaccumulation area to hit new highs. During this phase, Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new all-time highs."

ARK previously amended its form S-1 registration statement in October, which was interpreted by experts as a \u201cgood sign\u201d of progress.\n\nIn September 2023, the SEC again delayed its expected decision on ARK\u2019s application.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating above $35,000 for several days, but the bulls have failed to resume the uptrend above $38,000. This suggests hesitation to buy at higher levels. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that there is likely to be another round of rejections of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications before they are finally approved.\n\nMultiple analysts believe Bitcoin will enter a correction in the near term, with the worst outcome projecting a drop to $30,000. However, the fall is unlikely to start a bear phase. Look Into Bitcoin creator Philip Swift said that on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin bull market is still in its early stages as there is \u201cno FOMO yet.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAs Bitcoin takes a breather, several altcoins have witnessed a pullback, but some show signs of resuming their uptrends. Fidelity and BlackRock\u2019s applications for a spot Ether ETF show strong demand for investment in select altcoins.\n\nCould Bitcoin stay above $35,000 over the next few days? Is it time for altcoins to start the next leg of their up-move? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may rise in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin faces stiff resistance near $38,000, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $35,666.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to overcome the roadblock at $38,000.\n\nIf they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair may reach $40,000. This level may witness aggressive selling by the bears, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the rally could eventually touch $48,000.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a close below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate the possibility of a range-bound action in the near term. The pair may remain stuck between $34,800 and $38,000 for a while. A break below $34,800 could clear the path for a decline to $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price is swinging between $38,000 and $34,800. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nA tight consolidation near the 52-week high is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry. That increases the likelihood of an upside breakout. If that happens, the pair may resume the uptrend. The short-term trend will favor the bears on a break below $34,800.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) fell below the breakout level of $59 on Nov. 16, but the bears could not capitalize on this advantage. This indicates that selling dries up at lower levels.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are again trying to propel the price back above $59. If they do that, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The SOL/USDT pair may then climb to $68.20. If this level is scaled, the pair may resume the uptrend. The next target on the upside is $77 and subsequently $95.\n\nThis bullish move will be invalidated if the price turns down and plummets below $48. That could start a steeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $35.47. The deeper the fall, the longer the time it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers shove the price above $64, the pair may challenge the local high at $68.20.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and breaks below $54, it will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then plunge to $51 and eventually to the strong support at $48. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink\u2019s (LINK) pullback is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($13.42), indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will next try to push the price to the local high of $16.60. This level may witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears, but if this barrier is overcome, the LINK/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $20.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from $15.38, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. They will then try to sink the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $13.55. If they manage to do that, the pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($10.54).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has declined in a descending channel pattern for the past few days. Generally, traders sell near the channel\u2019s resistance line, and that is what they are doing. If the price skids below $13.36, it will open the doors for a fall to the support line.\n\nContrarily, if buyers kick the price above the channel, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair may first rise to $15.38 and subsequently to $16.60. The flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage to the bulls or the bears.\n\nRelated: One year on: Top 3 gainers after the \u2018FTX crash bottom\u2019\n\nNear Protocol price analysis\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) rose and closed above the formidable resistance of $1.72 on Nov. 17. This move indicates a potential trend change in the short term.\n\nNEAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA ($1.58) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in charge. There is a minor resistance at $2. The NEAR/USDT pair may rise to $2.40 if this obstacle is cleared.\n\nMeanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $1.72 and trap the aggressive bulls. The pair may then fall to the 20-day EMA. This remains the critical level to watch out for because a drop below it will indicate that the sellers are back in the game.\n\nNEAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been sustaining above the breakout level of $1.72, but the bulls have failed to start a strong up-move. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are trying to pull the price back below $1.72.\n\nIf they can pull it off, the price may drop to $1.60. If this level gives way, several stops may get triggered. The pair may then tumble to $1.45 and thereafter to $1.28. Contrarily, if buyers shove the price above $1.95, the pair may start its march toward $2.10.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nTheta Network (THETA) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($0.88) after going through a correction in the past few days. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rebound off the 20-day EMA is likely to face resistance at the psychological level of $1. If this level is conquered, the THETA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rise to $1.05 and later to $1.20. This level may again act as a strong hurdle, but if cleared, the pair may soar to $1.33.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. The pair may then start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($0.72).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been correcting inside a falling wedge, which usually acts as a bullish setup. Buyers will need to break and sustain the price above the wedge to signal strength. The pair may first rise to $1.05 and thereafter retest the resistance at $1.20.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may remain stuck inside the wedge for some more time. The sentiment is likely to turn bearish on a slide below the wedge.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin nears all-time high in Argentina after Milei wins presidential election - The Block",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin in Argentina is reapproaching all-time highs after pro-bitcoin libertarian Javier Milei\u2019s victory in the country\u2019s presidential election last night.\n\nBitcoin BTC -2.63% jumped 2% from around 13 million to 13.2 million Argentine pesos following the announcement before consolidating. It is currently trading at 13.17 million Argentine pesos, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe price rise did not quite take bitcoin to new all-time highs in the country \u2014 13.37 million Argentine pesos. That figure was set on Thursday, Nov. 16, coinciding with Milei becoming the strongly favored candidate on the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket.\n\nIt also did not rise as significantly as when Milei won the country\u2019s summer primaries on Aug. 13, soaring more than 20% to 10.2 million Argentine pesos within 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin is also up 1.5% over the last 24 hours in U.S. dollar terms, currently trading at $37,215, according to The Block\u2019s price data.\n\nMilei on bitcoin\n\nWhen asked about the potential for bitcoin as a monetary alternative in an interview with the Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn last year, \u201cThe first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam. It is a mechanism by which politicians cheat good people with an inflationary tax,\u201d Milei said.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\u201cWhat bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator \u2014 the private sector,\u201d he continued. \u201cBitcoin has an algorithm that one day it will reach a certain amount and there is no more and it can compete with other currencies, but the problem is that governments will not give up the legal tender. Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central bank scammers and to make the money private again.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite some drawing parallels with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who oversaw his country giving bitcoin legal tender status in 2021, Milei does not seem to favor bitcoin as legal tender either. Instead, the president-elect campaigned on eliminating Argentina\u2019s central bank and dollarizing a devastated economy that has witnessed multiple debt defaults and inflation soaring to nearly 150%.\n\nMilei\u2019s victory\n\nWith 99% of votes counted, Milei won 55.7% of support compared to 44.3% for Argentina\u2019s current economy minister, Sergio Massa, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cToday is the beginning of the end of Argentina\u2019s decadence,\u201d Milei said in his victory speech, local media reported. \u201cWe\u2019ll start doing things that history has shown works, and within 35 years, we\u2019ll return to being a world power.\u201d\n\nSeveral prominent bitcoiners congratulated Milei on X. \u201cIt\u2019s time to try something different. Change is coming, and with it volatility. Let\u2019s see if he stays true to his word and abolishes the central bank,\u201d BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said. \u201cBitcoin is hope for Argentina. Congratulations Javier Milei,\u201d MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor added.\n\nJubilant scenes among Milei\u2019s supporters followed his victory announcement, with some appearing to rip up Argentine peso bills to use as confetti in their celebrations. However, others warned that Milei\u2019s presidency could lead to economic \u201cdevastation\u201d and \u201csocial chaos.\u201d\n\nMilei will assume office on Dec. 10."

        "title": "Crypto you can mine from a home computer in 2024 - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Crypto you can mine from a home computer in 2024\n\nWhile mining bitcoin on an individual computer is no longer viable, there are other cryptocurrencies that you can still mine at home if you\u2019re prepared to put in the effort.\n\nUpdated 2nd December 2023. If the volatility of investing in cryptocurrencies is too much for you but you still want to benefit from the new economy, setting up a small cryptocurrency mining operation at home may be the right choice for you. Although the quoted returns are high, we warn against \u2018cloud mining\u2019, as every crypto cloud mining offer we\u2019ve seen is a scam.\n\nWhat Crypto To Mine?\n\nThe easiest cryptocurrency to mine is one that doesn\u2019t require you to build a massive crypto mining rig. Although it was initially possible to mine Bitcoin using laptops and desktops, the growing mining difficulty as well as the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs) hardware created specifically for Bitcoin mining has made it all but impossible to profitably mine Bitcoin at home using the processing power of a PC or laptop computer. However, crypto mining from home is still an option for other popular cryptocurrencies in 2023. In this article, we will introduce many popular options \u2014 with some how-to instructions to help get you started.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nMarket Cap: 9.7B Average Daily Volume: 200M-350M+\n\nThough the digital currency started out based on a meme, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been popularized by Elon Musk and has grown to be an altcoin with a substantial user base. DOGE is designed to add new coins each year as opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply. This is an added incentive for anyone mining it.\n\nHow To Mine Dogecoin\n\nTo mine DOGE, first ensure you have a wallet to store your earnings. You can download the Dogecoin core wallet or look on the website for other suitable online wallets. When mining using your CPU, the software that works best is CPU miner. Mining in this manner is possible, albeit at a slow rate. To increase the mining speed, you can use graphic cards. AMD and Nvidia cards are your best bet (see below for details on building mining rigs). If you decide on GPU mining, then the software you should use is either the cgminer or cudaminer. Full instructions for mining Doge can be found here.\n\nWhile crypto mining as an individual is doable, it is advisable to sign up to a mining pool as you can take advantage of larger processing power and speeds and thus generate higher mining returns. An example of a mining pool that supports Dogecoin is MultiPool. Once mined, exchanges that trade Dogecoin include Binance and OKX. If you\u2019re not an experienced trader, check our article on the best crypto trading bots, as many come with copy trading tools that mean you\u2019ll be making the same trades as the experts do.\n\nCheck current Dogecoin Price\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nMarket Cap: 2.5B Average Daily Volume: 70M-150M\n\nThe main goal of the Ethereum Classic project was to ensure the survival of the original Ethereum blockchain, to provide an alternative for people who strongly disagreed with the DAO bailout of Ethereum and the direction taken by the Ethereum Foundation. Mining standard Ethereum is no longer possible as the Ethereum blockchain moved to proof of stake in October 2022. This was good news for Ethereum Classic as the resources formally used for mining ETH can easily be applied to mining ETC.\n\nHow To Mine Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile ETC can be mined with ASIC machines, it can also still be mined on desktop machines. A full list of mining resources for Ethereum Classic can be found here. Once mined, exchanges that trade Ethereum Classic include HitBTC, Binance and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current Ethereum Classic price\n\nMonero (XMR)\n\nMarket Cap: 3B Average Daily Volume: 40M-100M\n\nMonero (XMR) is a popular anonymous digital currency. Furthermore, this altcoin\u2019s network was designed specifically to resist the development of Monero specific ASIC\u2019s. Therefore, it is well-suited for mining with a home computer.\n\nHow To Mine Monero\n\nTo begin, you must first download a wallet to store your coins. It is recommended to use the official Monero GUI client. Following this, the next step is to download mining software that supports Monero such as MultiMiner. MultiMiner is among the easiest to use but there are also other mining options available online. Once mined, exchanges that trade Monero include Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nCheck current Monero Price\n\nZCash (ZEC)\n\nMarket Cap: 540M Average Daily Volume: 20M-40M\n\nLaunched in 2016, Zcash (ZEC) is a leading privacy-centric digital currency. For mining crypto at home, Zcash\u2019s most important feature is that it employs the Equihash algorithm which is designed to be ASIC resistant. As a result, the home miner with a GPU can participate.\n\nHow To Mine ZCash\n\nBefore you can start mining Zcash, you will need to download the software that will control your hardware. Download the Zcash blockchain and set up your wallet. This will involve some waiting as the blockchain will need to download in its entirety on your node, and sync as well. Additionally, you will need to download the drivers for your graphics cards. Full instructions for mining Zcash can be found here.\n\nOnce mined, exchanges that trade Zcash include Binance, Huobi Global, and Bitfinex.\n\nCheck current Zcash Price\n\nRavencoin (RVN)\n\nMarket Cap: 250M Average Daily Volume: 5M-8M\n\nRavencoin (RVN) is a blockchain network optimized to move assets from one holder to another, such as tokens. Ravencoin is a fork of the Bitcoin code. It cites its main improvements over Bitcoin as a one-minute block reward time, a change in the number of coins released, but not the weighted distribution schedule, and the inclusion of capabilities for asset development and messaging. Ravencoin is open source.\n\nHow To Mine Ravencoin\n\nThe Ravencoin KAWPOW algorithm is designed to be ASIC resistant and can be mined using a consumer grade GPU. More details on mining Ravencoin are available here. Once mined, exchanges that trade Ravencoin include Binance, Huobi Global, and OKX.\n\nCheck current Ravencoin Price\n\nBitcoin Gold (BTG)\n\nMarket Cap: 238M Average Daily Volume: 1M-3M\n\nBitcoin Gold (BTG) was launched in 2017 as a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain. Although it initially had a progressive roadmap aimed at extending the scalability and the development potential of Bitcoin (BTC), the project has fallen silent in recent years and has not updated its website roadmap or its Twitter feed since 2021. Nonetheless, BTG still has a respectable market cap and daily trading volumes, so anyone mining BTG will be easily able to find buyers.\n\nHow To Mine Bitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold uses Equihash-BTG, also known as Equihash(144,5) or Zhash and its price movements typically correlate quite closely with those of the original Bitcoin. Check here for more info on mining Bitcoin Gold. Once mined, exchanges that trade Bitcoin Gold include Binance, Bitfinex\n\nHitBTC and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current Bitcoin Gold Price\n\nHorizen (ZEN)\n\nMarket Cap: 112M Average Daily Volume: 4M-6M\n\nLaunched in 2017, Horizen and its native cryptocurrency ZEN is a proof-of-work, equihash-based cryptocurrency and is mineable with a GPU. The project aims to ensure data integrity and privacy freedom by enabling real-world use cases within a secure interoperable blockchain ecosystem. In terms of price, like most alt-coins, ZEN tends to follow the overall price trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its highest price was US$148 achieved in December 2021. It has a respectable market cap and liquid daily trading volume.\n\nHow To Mine Zen Coin\n\nMore information about mining ZEN can be found here. Once mined, exchanges that trade ZEN include Binance, HitBTC and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current ZEN price\n\nBytecoin (BCN)\n\nMarket Cap: 6.8M Average Daily Volume: 5k-10k\n\nAnonymous cryptocurrency Bytecoin (BCN) is another altcoin that is easy to mine on your home computer. Solo mining has been designed to be an easy process for Bytecoin users.\n\nHow To Mine Bytecoin\n\nTo mine BCN you need to download the Bytecoin wallet and run the program on your computer. After the program is done syncing with Bytecoin\u2019s blockchain, create a wallet for yourself. Then simply input the begin mining command and set your wallet address as the recipient. Solo mining works on Bytecoin\u2019s network, but the process is slow and may not get you much revenue. To enhance earnings, you can join a mining pool that supports CPU mining. A good example is bytecoin-pool.org. You will also need to download compatible mining software such as xmrig.\n\nIt is also possible to mine Bytecoin using GPUs. To mine in this manner, you will need to download software that is compatible with GPU mining. While the set-up process here is more complex than with CPU mining, it does lead to a faster mining process. Once mined, exchanges that trade Bytecoin include HitBTC and Poloniex.\n\nCheck current Bytecoin price\n\nBeam (BEAM)\n\nMarket Cap: 9.7M Average Daily Volume: 100k-150k\n\nA MimbleWimble implementation, Beam (BEAM) is well-suited for home mining. It employs the Hashii algorithm that supports GPU mining.\n\nHow To Mine Beam\n\nTo get started, download the official Desktop Wallet, depending on the operating system on your computer, your antivirus may flag up the mining software as a harmful program. Exclude it from that designation or you will run into trouble in the mining process. Once the blockchain has downloaded and synced you are ready to start mining. You must first configure your settings. Turn on the \u201cRun Local Node\u201d feature and set the number of mining threads to a number greater than zero.\n\nIt is important to note that Beam\u2019s infrastructure involves the use of expiring addresses to maximize privacy. However, you will require a permanent address to successfully recover your mining revenues or your tokens will be lost. To create a permanent address, navigate to the receive tab on the main dashboard of the software. You can create a new address and set it to never expire to use it for the mining set-up. Once mined, exchanges that trade Beam include Binance and Bitforex.\n\nCheck current Beam price\n\nVertcoin (VTC)\n\nMarket Cap: 6.6M Average Daily Volume: 30k-40k+\n\nLaunched in 2014, Vertcoin (VTC) is another popular choice among small miners. The digital currency is designed to stay true to the spirit of decentralization and financial sovereignty envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin. The project\u2019s developers created the blockchain as a response to the growing influence ASICs were having on the Bitcoin blockchain and the mining ecosystem in general.\n\nHow to Mine Vertcoin\n\nThe algorithm employed with Vertcoin\u2019s POW consensus mechanism is Lyra2RE and is designed to be ASIC-resistant while simultaneously supporting GPU and CPU mining. VTC is popular because it has a very simple mining process. It is a matter of one click as the project developers have created the architecture to support easy mining. To start mining, download the software here, and join a mining pool to maximize mining revenues. Once mined, exchanges that trade Vertcoin include Bittrex and UPBit.\n\nCheck current Vertcoin price\n\nGrin (GRIN)\n\nMarket Cap: 3.5M Average Daily Volume: 400k-500k\n\nGrin (GRIN) was launched in January 2019. The project is focused on privacy and scalability. Like Beam, the Grin blockchain employs the MimbleWimble algorithm to support transactional privacy. For the home miner, though, it is the blockchain\u2019s ASIC-resistant POW algorithm that is most relevant. Moreover, the project developers have gone a step further to hard code a hard fork every six months to minimize the effects of any ASICS that may be developed specifically for its network.\n\nHow To Mine Grin\n\nTo get started with \u201cGRINning\u201d, download the blockchain from the official website to set up a node. Once you have successfully synced the blockchain, you must connect the node to your wallet. Creating your wallet is a simple matter of running a file in the directory. Once the wallet is live, you must then configure your graphics cards to work with the wallet. Finally, remember to set the software to the Cuckaroo POW, which is the version of the Grin network that supports GPU mining. Grin supports both CPU and GPU mining. However, if you decide to go the GPU way, purchase Nvidia cards because these are considered more effective. Moreover, you must have a minimum of 5.5 GB space to begin mining the coin. Once mined, exchanges that trade Grin include Bittrex and HitBTC.\n\nCheck current GRIN price\n\nAEON (AEON)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.3M Average Daily Volume: $50-$220+\n\nAEON was originally forked from Monero and based on the CryptoNote protocol. It uses the CryptoNight-Lite algorithm and ring signatures to make sure that transactions are untraceable.\n\nHow To Mine AEON\n\nAlthough AEON Is modelled after Monero, the project has chosen to forgo ASIC resistance. That said, AEON can still be mined with Windows CPUs, and AMB and Nvidia GPUs. More info on mining AEON can be found here. Once mined, Exchanges that trade AEON include Bittrex and HitBTC. Check current AEON price\n\nHow much money can you make GPU crypto mining at home?\n\nMining crypto at home with a CPU is possible with coins like Monero, Zcash and Byte, but it will be a slow process and the cost of electricity may be more than the value of the coins you can mine. For those who want to get more serious, crypto GPU mining is a realistic path. GPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 are popular options. The price of GPUs range from as low as $600 up to $2000 and more. The reason for the price differential is all about performance. For GPUs this relates to their maximum hashrate.\n\nIn simple terms, hashrate is the amount of power/speed/calculation that the GPU unit can apply to mining a cryptocurrency. The hashrate is expressed in \u2018million hashes per second\u2019. So 1MH/s is one million hashes per second. Lower-cost GPUs typically have lower hashrates. CPUs on desktops and laptops have lower hashrates still, and are measured in thousand hashes per second as opposed to millions \u2013 so TH/S.\n\nThe hashrate and revenue calculation\n\nHashrates.com is an excellent resource for calculating potential earnings. It displays hashrates for both CPUs and GPUs and an estimate on how much one could make per month applying that hashrate to mining cryptocurrency. For example, Hashrates.com says a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU can operate at 48MH/s and would earn $217 a month mining Ethereum. In comparison, an Intel i9-10900 can operate at 4KH/s and would produce around $9 worth of Monero over the same period. Two other factors influencing profitability are:\n\nThe market price of the coin you are mining. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile \u2013 so mining a crypto that is trending up will make you more money than one that is flat or trending down.\n\nThe cost of electricity. A basic rule of thumb for a GPU is the higher the hashrate it can produce, the more electricity it will use. The price of electricity worldwide is measured in kilowatt-hours.\n\n\n\nElectricity prices vary widely in the US. Source \u2013 Electricity prices vary widely in the US. Source \u2013 EnergyBot\n\nAccording to EnergyBot, the average price per kilowatt-hour in the U.S is currently 16.11 cents \u2013 but the price varies widely between states. The least expensive state is currently Idaho at 7.99 cents per kWh, and Hawaii is the most expensive at 43.18 cents. Worldwide, the lowest price electricity can be found in Burma, with many Arab states also offering very low rates.\n\nHow to scale up GPU mining \u2013 case study\n\nThe following case study was written by a professional GPU miner. In it they detail their real-world experience in GPU mining on a more commercial scale.\n\nThe technology set\n\nWe have 13 desktops that are low-cost Intel systems running Windows 10. The key here is finding motherboards that support 8 GPUs or more. Most run Z390 chipsets which are 8th/9th Gen Intel CPUs as the motherboards are readily available on Amazon. Speed is irrelevant as some systems run Celeron and some Intel i9 but mining will be 100% GPU dependent so no difference in speed. This is the area where you can cut corners to save on costs.\n\nWindows is not stable with more than 8 GPUs running. We utilize Windows to remote connect to each rig on our phones with Google Chrome. We do not recommend running anything larger because of stability and also because you would need Linux. All rigs run in an open frame with 120mm cooling fans to dissipate heat. The GPUs will thermal throttle down if not cooled or housed in a case.\n\nThe profitability equation\n\nEthereum has proven to be the most profitable crypto to mine per wattage. For a low-cost rig, 8 AMD RX580\u2019s generate $20 per day before electricity. I recommended 8 \u2013 AMD 5700 XT\u2019s because they use the same amount of electricity as the RX580s while generating 30% more profit. Electricity is your number one hurdle for profitability during a bear market. During a bull market it\u2019s not really a factor. For example, the rigs above utilize $4 per day in electricity. During a bear market with all 13 machines operating, we were able to generate around $500 a month. During the current bull market the same 13 machines have done up to $17,000 per month \u2013 so the power price is not an issue. The problem with electricity is scaling and heat. The rigs use 1000 watts so they are essentially 1000 watt space heaters. The more rigs you utilize the more you will then need to cool your residence depending on your space and goals.\n\nCrypto mining by at-home miners is challenging as large-scale operations dominate the mining industry. However, by choosing the most profitable coins and running the latest (and most efficient) mining hardware, it is still possible to generate crypto mining profits in 2023.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBest crypto interest rates 2023 \u2013 DeFi and CeFi\n\nHow to Earn Interest & Boost Yield With Bitcoin and Crypto"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies traded mixed on Wednesday amid a fall in the greenback. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $37,198.42, up 1.84%. While top crypto tokens like Ethereum (ETH), BNB XRP , Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin were up between 1% and 3.70% around 10.15 IST.Bitcoins's gains over the past seven days have been to the tune of 0.80% while for Solana Dogecoin and Cardano, the uptick has been nearly 4%, 2%, and 5% respectively. The laggards on a seven-day basis include XRP (-4.6%), Ethereum (-1.83%), and Tron (-5%).Cryptocurrencies have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. The dollar index was trading at 103.61, down 0.30 or 0.29%.The dollar index (DXY) has tumbled to a two-month low and corrected by 1.9% over the last five sessions, aiding the cause of cryptocurrencies. The weakness has been on account of softer US inflation for the October month which was lower than what the Street was expecting. This has given a fresh impetus to views that were batting for a pause in the interest rate. The lower inflation print may result in the Federal Reserve not doing any further rate hikes.\"Bitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin said.The analyst favors bullish trends above $36,400, he advises caution while putting importance to immediate resistance for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.The crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate\u2014Javier Milei\u2014won the elections in Argentina, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures said. \"On this account, BTC (+2.2%) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37.2k levels. Support is seen in the range between $33,000 and $34.500 with resistance at $38,000,\" Chaturvedi said.On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, Chaturvedi said, adding that entry of financial giants such as Fidelity provides positive signals for the sector.On a similar note, the SEC has delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton's and Global X's spot bitcoin ETF applications, he informed, expecting the deadline now to shift to early 2024, without any significant impact on BTC's price.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
