        "content": "CNBC Host Jim Cramer Is Now Bullish on Bitcoin: \u201cIf you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin\u201d\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC's Mad Money, has reversed his opinion on Bitcoin and is now urging investors to reconsider their positions as the cryptocurrency reaches its highest value in a year and a half. Previously, Cramer had advised against investing in Bitcoin but now acknowledges that his earlier assessment was premature.\n\nBitcoin has seen a significant surge in value, surpassing $38,000 for the first time in 18 months. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has shown a steady increase of 10%, while Ethereum has also experienced a spike of 17%, reaching its own 18-month peak.\n\nThis positive momentum is largely attributed to industry optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the ETF would allow traditional financial institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Analysts believe that such approval could result in a substantial $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite previously dismissing cryptocurrencies due to the crypto market collapse in May 2022 and the closure of crypto exchange FTX, Cramer now claims that he has always supported those who have long-term faith in Bitcoin. He encourages individuals to consider purchasing Bitcoin if they believe in its potential.\n\nCramer's changing stance on investments has faced criticism from the crypto and finance communities, with some suggesting that going against his advice could be a prudent financial strategy. An inverse Cramer ETF was launched to provide returns opposite of his stock picks.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The stock market and the overall cryptocurrency market have had great years thus far, rewarding investors with strong gains. In this type of bullish environment, it's no surprise that Bitcoin (BTC -2.83%) has soared 125% (as of Nov. 21).\n\nDespite the renewed sense of optimism surrounding the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, its current price of roughly $37,000 is 47% below the peak price from about two years ago. There's still a lot of room before Bitcoin can get back to its all-time high.\n\nIs it a smart move for investors to buy this digital asset on the dip? Let's take a closer look.\n\nA favorable setup\n\nNow might be one of the best times to buy Bitcoin because of an event known as a halving. Miners, or those who expend computing power and electricity to approve transactions, are rewarded with new coins. Happening about every four years, a halving is when Bitcoin's inflation rate of new supply gets cut in half. It's set to happen in April next year.\n\nOver time, as rising demand has taken hold, coupled with less supply hitting the market, Bitcoin's price has trended higher. And looking at history, in the several months leading up to a halving, and in the months after, the price has generally been in bull market territory.\n\nThere's also anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to finally approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Some of the largest asset managers in the world, in charge of trillions of dollars, have applied for this financial product to come to market.\n\nIt's hard to know what the SEC will decide, but there's anticipation it will be positive. And this could open up the floodgates of fresh capital being directed to Bitcoin, which can help support a higher price.\n\nI'm no macroeconomic expert, but there's another potential catalyst for Bitcoin on the horizon, and it involves what the Federal Reserve does. With inflation showing signs of cooling, the central bank might decide to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Moreover, if the U.S. economy ends up entering a recession, the Fed will also have no choice but to reduce rates. This scenario can benefit risky assets like Bitcoin.\n\nA unique financial asset\n\nBesides the possibility of three catalysts for Bitcoin's price in the near term, there are some other reasons investors might be interested in owning this asset.\n\nJust look at what has happened in 2023: Bitcoin, often viewed as extremely risky to own, has crushed the performance of Treasuries and gold, both of which are seen as two of the safest assets to own. It's encouraging to see Bitcoin's price skyrocket this year amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nSome investors might view Bitcoin as a much more attractive asset in light of what's going on in the traditional financial system, thanks to its decentralized nature where no single entity is in charge.\n\nFinancial mismanagement by the government has seemed to cause rising costs for everything. Plus, budget deficits, increasing debt balances, underfunded entitlements, and the continuous threat of government shutdowns are likely only going to get worse. This situation makes buying Bitcoin, an asset completely outside of this fiat architecture, look incredibly smart.\n\nTo be clear, this is still a very volatile asset, which might be hard for most investors to stomach. So it's a good idea to allocate a tiny percentage of your overall portfolio to Bitcoin. As you learn more and gain greater conviction, it makes sense to increase that allocation."

        "content": "Bitcoin's price could reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 by the end of 2024, Standard Chartered said.\n\nThe bank said bitcoin has additional upside from its earlier 2024 forecast for $100,000.\n\nReduced bitcoin sales by miners will help boost prices more than expected.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin may be primed for a $120,000 valuation by the end of 2024, as miners reduce sales of the top cryptocurrency, according to Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick.\n\nIn April, he predicted bitcoin could reach $100,000 by next year, but now thinks that could be too conservative when accounting for miner profitability.\n\n\"We reiterate our end-2024 BTC price target of around $100,000, with potential upside from reduced miner selling,\" he wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nIn a follow-up email to Insider, Kendrick said a price of $120,000 is valid, representing nearly 300% upside from current levels. He also expects bitcoin to jump 67% this year to $50,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis more bullish stance is due to increased mining profitability, which means miners can sell fewer tokens to maintain the same amount of cash flow. That reduces bitcoin supply and pushes prices higher, he said.\n\nKendrick estimated that just under 100% of all bitcoin mined was sold in the second quarter, but he expects miners will start to sell fewer over time. Historically, this occurs when bitcoin's price exceeds the average all-in cash cost of mining, as is happening\n\n\"If the BTC price averages $50,000 by Q1-2024, as we predict, the 'BTC minus all cash costs' calculation would rise to $30,000,\" he wrote. \"On that basis, selling just 27% of BTC mined in Q1-2024 would generate the same absolute level of excess cash as selling 100% in Q2-2023.\"\n\nEffectively, this would be enough to reduce the net supply of bitcoin by around 250,000. Not only could this pressure prices, but would have an effect on the currency's inflation rate, moving it down from 1.7% to 0.4% year-to-year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent weeks, bitcoin has returned above $30,000, after a few Wall Street giants showed interest in creating their own bitcoin ETFs. This has manifested other bullish calls for the crypto token, with Fundstrat's Tom Lee recently predicting a $200,000 valuation over the coming years.\n\nMining profitability has been climbing as the cost to produce new bitcoin falls. That's as large-scale miners, such as Riot and Core Scientific, have clamped down on corporate costs, while energy prices have also declined.\n\nMeanwhile, halving events \u2014 in which the amount of bitcoin produced by mining is halved, with the next one coming in April or May of 2024 \u2014 tend to cause industry consolidation, which further reduces mining expenditures.\n\nThis story was originally published in July 2023."

        "content": "To navigate the process of buying Bitcoin effectively, it is essential to explore secure options. In the United Kingdom, acquiring cryptocurrencies is legal, yet it can pose challenges, as the government underscores the need to comprehend the associated risks.\n\nFor an effective traversal of the crypto landscape, investors should follow key steps, including choosing the right crypto exchange or broker, setting up a secure wallet and making informed decisions regarding payments and orders.\n\nThis article examines how to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in the U.K. while offering information on legal considerations, secure storage options, cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers for effortless market navigation.\n\nIs it legal to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.?\n\nWhile the legal status of cryptocurrencies varies from one country to another, buying Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) is entirely legal in the U.K., with a well-defined regulatory framework in place. Cryptocurrencies are categorized as taxable assets by His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and they are subject to taxation.\n\nAcquiring Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. triggers the tax reporting and payment obligations associated with cryptocurrency transactions. As such, maintaining accurate records is crucial for individuals planning to purchase BTC and ETH in the United Kingdom. This ensures compliance with tax regulations for both crypto gains and crypto losses.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in the U.K., cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender like the British pound. This regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies helps to foster innovation and promote awareness of associated risks, creating a transparent, legal environment for buying, selling and holding Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nIn October 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its regulatory oversight to include crypto asset promotions in the U.K., emphasizing compliance with accurate information and risk warnings. Additionally, starting in September 2023, the Travel Rule mandates that U.K.-based crypto asset businesses are required to collect, verify and share information on transfers, which impacts the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite industry engagement, some market players have exited the U.K., highlighting the importance of adhering to rules and regulations when using exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nSecure wallet practices to safeguard Bitcoin and Ether holdings\n\nPrior to delving into Bitcoin and Ether investments, it\u2019s essential to have a secure crypto wallet, available in various forms. While leaving holdings on an exchange account is convenient for small quantities, transitioning to a more secure storage solution can be an option for those investors who want to store larger amounts of tokens.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s crucial to remember that retaining funds on an exchange means lacking control over the keys and, consequently, forfeiting control over the coins, emphasizing the importance of securing private keys for the full control and ownership of digital assets.\n\nBitcoin wallets, including hardware, software and paper options, are used to securely manage and store Bitcoin holdings, while Ethereum wallets act as secure repositories for ETH, providing control over assets and facilitating transactions.\n\nCryptocurrency users rely on Bitcoin and Ether wallets to safeguard and control their digital assets, ensuring the secure management of private keys essential for accessing and managing their holdings.\n\nRelated: A beginner\u2019s guide to filing cryptocurrency taxes in the US, UK and Germany\n\nTo reduce risk, an investor can enhance security by transferring their cryptocurrency from an exchange\u2019s default wallet to their own cold wallet, which is not online and thus less susceptible to hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these wallets don\u2019t store investor\u2019s cryptocurrencies per se; instead, they safeguard the private keys necessary for accessing the wallet\u2019s address and authorizing transactions. Losing these digital keys means forfeiting access to Bitcoin and Ether holdings.\n\nBuying Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. through crypto exchanges\n\nInvestors need to choose a broker or cryptocurrency exchange before they can purchase cryptocurrencies. Although both enable cryptocurrency purchases in the U.K., it\u2019s important to note some significant distinctions between them. Due to the growing possibility of hacks in the cryptocurrency space, choosing the best cryptocurrency exchange or broker can be a challenging process, with security being the main priority.\n\nChoose a crypto exchange\n\nIn the U.K., crypto assets and crypto exchanges operate without formal regulation, but the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandates registration for crypto exchanges within the country. Notably, some crypto exchanges such as Gemini, Bitpanda, Kraken and Crypto.com are successfully registered with the FCA.\n\nGiven the extreme volatility and absence of government-backed protection for cryptocurrency investments, exercising caution and acknowledging the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies is vital, even when dealing with FCA-authorized and regulated providers. To enhance security, an investor can also diversify their digital currency holdings across multiple exchanges to mitigate the risk of a single exchange failure.\n\nWhen choosing a crypto exchange, check for BTC and ETH availability, but also ensure there\u2019s substantial daily trading volume to guarantee adequate liquidity for smooth transactions in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currency. Also, watch out for fees that can affect returns, especially for high-frequency traders, and ensure the exchange offers desired trading types such as limit orders and margins.\n\nIn response to updated regulatory guidelines from the FCA and the expanded parameters of the Regime of Financial Promotions, CEX.IO and Binance announced in 2023 that they had suspended onboarding new U.K.-based consumers. Therefore, verifying an exchange\u2019s availability in the U.K. and compliance with regulatory changes is essential for informed decision-making.\n\nChoose a cryptocurrency broker\n\nCryptocurrency brokers, such as interactive brokers and eToro, simplify the crypto buying process with user-friendly interfaces that interact with exchanges for investors. While some cryptocurrency brokers charge higher fees, others offer their services for free but profit by selling traders\u2019 data or executing user trades at suboptimal market prices.\n\nWhile brokers offer convenience, they may limit the transfer of cryptocurrency holdings from their trading platforms. This restriction can be a concern for investors seeking enhanced security through crypto wallets, including hardware wallets disconnected from the internet. However, brokers can restrict investors from moving their crypto holdings to external wallets.\n\nDecide on a payment option\n\nAfter selecting a cryptocurrency broker or exchange, investors can sign up to open an account and fund it through options like linking a bank account or using debit or credit cards, though the latter may incur high fees.\n\nUpon creating an account and selecting a payment method, identity verification is mandatory. For example, the submission of an identity document and proof of address is a common requirement in the United Kingdom. Investors may also encounter a crypto risk awareness quiz. Depending on the broker or exchange, there might be a wait of a few days before the deposited funds can be used to buy cryptocurrency.\n\nPlace an order\n\nAfter funding their account, investors can proceed to place their order for purchasing Bitcoin or Ether by entering the desired amount in pounds. The process varies by exchange; some have a straightforward \u201cBuy\u201d button for BTC and ETH, which prompts users to enter the desired amount.\n\nMost exchanges enable the purchase of fractional cryptocurrency shares, making it feasible to own portions of higher-priced tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum that would typically require significant investment.\n\nStore Bitcoin and Ether\n\nAs previously noted, cryptocurrency exchanges run the additional risk of theft or hacking and are not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of the United Kingdom. If cryptocurrency owners misplace or forget their private keys or recovery phrases, they could forfeit their entire investment.\n\nWhen purchasing cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange, it is typically retained in a wallet connected to the exchange. If desired, investors can store or withdraw Bitcoin and Ether to a chosen external wallet for added security. However, investors purchasing cryptocurrency through a broker might not have much control over where it is kept.\n\nIf an investor is interested in transferring their digital currency to a securer place or doesn\u2019t like the provider the exchange collaborates with, they may move it off the exchange and into an independent hot or cold wallet. Depending on the exchange and the total amount of a transfer, investors may be required to pay a small charge in order to accomplish this.\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs\n\nCrypto ATMs have been appearing in cities all over the world; however, in February 2023, the FCA imposed a ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and urged operators to shut down their machines or face enforcement actions.\n\nThe FCA warns that using these machines is risky, as they operate unlawfully and provide no protection in case of issues, and communication with operators is often challenging. The FCA aims to keep cautioning the public and taking enforcement measures against unregistered crypto ATM operators.\n\nCrypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs): An alternative to directly holding Bitcoin and Ether\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide diversified exposure to multiple holdings within a single investment, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Investment trusts pool investors\u2019 funds through the sale of a set number of shares, which may have some initial trust-related challenges upon launch. This structure provides instant diversification and reduces risk compared to picking individual investments.\n\nInvestors can now access multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously through various firms. ETF providers such as Purpose Investments and VanEck offer opportunities for investors to engage in the crypto market.\n\nOther methods to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.\n\nSeveral U.K. banking and financial apps, such as PayPal, Revolut, Skrill and MoonPay, have introduced the ability for customers to purchase Bitcoin and Ether directly on their platforms. To purchase shares in companies that are publicly listed, they will require an online account.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that JPMorgan\u2019s U.K. bank, Chase, took a different stance in October 2023 by prohibiting cryptocurrency transactions for its British customers due to a notable increase in fraud and scams, including fake investments and deceptive celebrity endorsements.\n\nAdditionally, payment processors, such as BitPay, can be used to buy BTC and ETH. Once connected, users can initiate transactions through the payment processor, converting fiat currency into Bitcoin or Ether.\n\nMoreover, in the U.K., traders can utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto platforms, such as Cash App and Paxful, to trade digital assets, although the government emphasizes the risks associated with these assets. P2P platforms enable direct cryptocurrency transactions between individuals and are a prevalent means of acquiring digital currencies in the United Kingdom. However, it\u2019s important to be aware that U.K. investors have limited legal protections in the event of platform insolvency."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $38,000 on Nov. 24, but the bulls could not build upon this strength. This suggests hesitation to buy at higher levels. Bitcoin is on track to form a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart for the second consecutive week. This signals indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nWith Bitcoin maintaining near its 18-month high, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes retained his bullish stance. In a X (formerly Twitter) post, Hayes said that the United States dollar liquidity was increasing, which is likely to push Bitcoin higher.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAnother bullish projection came from PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of BTC price models, who said in a post on X that Bitcoin may not stay at the current levels for long. PlanB expects Bitcoin to maintain an average price of at least $100,000 between 2024 and 2028.\n\nAnalysts have turned increasingly bullish in the past few days, but traders should exercise caution because every uptrend is bound to have corrections.\n\nCould Bitcoin soar above $38,000 or start a corrective phase? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin\u2019s march higher has hit a wall near $37,980 but the bulls are not hurrying to close their positions. This shows that traders expect the uptrend to progress further.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe immediate support on the downside is the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,546). If the price snaps back from this support, it will signal that every minor dip is being purchased. That will increase the possibility of a break above $37,980.\n\nIf that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $40,000. This level may pose a strong hurdle to the bulls, but if buyers flip the $38,000 level into support on the downside, the rally could stretch to $48,000.\n\nConversely, if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are booking profits. The pair may then dump to $34,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are trying to maintain the price above the moving averages but are finding it difficult to overcome the obstacle at $37,980. The relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening.\n\nIf the price slips below the 50-simple moving average, the pair may plunge to the uptrend line. The bulls are expected to defend this level with vigor. On the upside, a break and close above $38,500 will indicate that bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) fell below the 20-day EMA ($5.44) on Nov. 21, but the lower levels attracted aggressive buying by the bulls. That started a sharp rally on Nov. 22, which pushed the price to $6.60 on Nov. 24.\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move is facing selling near the overhead resistance of $6.70. The UNI/USDT pair has pulled back to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $5.92, and the next stop could be the 50% retracement level of $5.71.\n\nA strong bounce off this zone will suggest that traders view the dips as a buying opportunity. That may enhance the prospects of a breakout above $6.70. Such a move will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $9.60. The bullish momentum is likely to weaken below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $5.50.\n\nThe bulls tried to protect the 20-EMA, but the bears had other plans. They pulled the price below the 20-EMA, starting a deeper correction. If the price sustains below the 20-EMA, the pair may tumble to the 50-SMA.\n\nIf the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 50-SMA, it will suggest that lower levels are being bought. The bulls will then again try to propel the price to the overhead resistance of $6.70. If this resistance is surmounted, the pair may skyrocket to $7.80.\n\nImmutable price analysis\n\nImmutable (IMX) has been sustaining above the breakout level of $1.30 for the past several days, suggesting that bulls have the edge.\n\nIMX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price may pull back to the zone between $1.30 and the 20-day EMA ($1.20). This zone is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears, but If the buyers prevail, the IMX/USDT pair could climb to $1.86.\n\nInstead, if sellers tug the price below the support zone, it may trigger stops of short-term traders. That could accelerate selling and result in a sharper correction to the psychological level of $1.\n\nThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a possible consolidation in the near term. The first support on the downside is $1.30. If buyers maintain the price above this level, it will suggest that the $1.30 is acting as a new floor.\n\nOn the upside, a break above $1.50 will signal the resumption of the up-move. The pair may travel to $1.59 and then to $1.63. Contrary to this assumption, a fall below $1.20 could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nRelated: XRP price bull flag hints at 20% rally by New Year\u2019s\n\nVeChain price analysis\n\nBuyers propelled VeChain (VET) above the overhead resistance of $0.023 on Nov. 26 but are struggling to sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSellers will try to trap the aggressive bulls and pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.021). If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest a positive sentiment. The bulls will then again attempt to overcome the obstacle at $0.023. If they can pull it off, the VET/USDT pair could rise to $0.027 and thereafter try to reach the pattern target of $0.031.\n\nOn the contrary, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the pair may remain stuck inside a large range between $0.014 and $0.023 for a while longer.\n\nThe pair has slipped back below the breakout level of $0.023, indicating that the bears have not given up and are selling at higher levels. The pair could next reach the 20-EMA, which is an important level to watch out for.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to drive the price above $0.023 and start the next leg of the rally to $0.027. On the other hand, a break below the 20-EMA may start a deeper correction to $0.020.\n\nAlgorand price analysis\n\nAlgorand (ALGO) reached the overhead resistance of $0.14 on Nov. 25, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that traders are holding on to their positions, expecting a move higher. That increases the likelihood of a rally above the $0.14-$0.15 resistance zone. If that happens, the ALGO/USDT pair will complete a cup-and-handle pattern. This reversal setup has a pattern target of $0.20.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to drag the price below the critical support at $0.12. If this level gives way, the pair may tumble to $0.11 and then to $0.09.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is oscillating inside the $0.12 to $0.15 range for some time. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty; hence, traders may consider waiting for the breakout before taking large bets.\n\nIf the price breaks above $0.15, the pair is likely to start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may first rise to $0.18 and then to $0.20. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and falls below $0.12.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
