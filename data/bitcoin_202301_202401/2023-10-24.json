        "content": "watch now\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly topped $35,000 for the first time since May 2022, bolstered by positive sentiment about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and a flight to safety that led to a spike in short liquidations. On Tuesday bitcoin rose 7.97% at $33,900.00, according to Coin Metrics. Late Monday night it reached as much as $35,113.29, its highest level since May 8, 2022. Bitcoin is now up 104% from the start of the year and 105% from its 2022 low. The rally could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze. Bitcoin saw $275.45 million in short liquidations on Sunday, followed by another $100.44 million Monday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. \"The real catalyst that created the 'god candle' [Monday] and pushed bitcoin above $34,000 was the $167 million in short liquidations, mainly on offshore exchanges,\" Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC. \"I don't think anyone expected the level of price action we're seeing, and those investors who were shorting bitcoin in the $33,000 plus range are certainly feeling the pain of that surprise.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin prices have doubled in 2023; highest point in nearly 18 months - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bitcoin is having another moment. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared to almost $35,000 this week, marking its highest point in nearly 18 months \u2014 and more than double the price seen at the start of 2023.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rocketed from just over $5,000 each during the start of the pandemic to nearly $68,000 in November 2021, according to FactSet, during an era of massive tech growth. Prices came back down to earth during an aggressive series of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as it battled inflation, and then the collapse of one of the biggest companies in crypto, FTX.\n\nWhen 2023 began, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000 after losing more than 75% of its value. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers this year as inflation started to cool. And the collapse of prominent tech-focused banks actually led more investors to turn to crypto as they bailed out of positions in Silicon Valley start-ups and other more risky bets.\n\nNow, bitcoin is getting another boost on the prospects of creating a much larger pool of investors. Industry advocates say a new way to invest in bitcoin at spot prices, instead of futures, could make it easier for anyone to enter the cryptoverse while lowering some of the well-documented risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere\u2019s rising optimism about the possibility of bitcoin exchange-traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks \u2014 potentially being launched.\n\nA green light from federal regulators hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but recent wins for some crypto fund managers with applications for bitcoin spot ETFs have improved odds for approval, perhaps in the coming months.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals recently ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to reconsider the ETF for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin fund, for example, after the company sued the regulator last year for rejecting its application over concerns about investor protections and other issues. The SEC did not appeal the decision.\n\nEdward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, also points to the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which clears market trades, gaining attention online Monday. That may have contributed to this week\u2019s Bitcoin surge, he said.\n\nIShares Bitcoin Trust appeared to be temporarily removed Tuesday, but was back online as of Wednesday. In a statement to The Associated Press, a DTCC spokesperson noted that both active and potential ETF securities appear on this list. iShares was added back in August, the spokesperson said.\n\nSocial media chatter, as well as misinformation, can make notable impacts on crypto trading, Moya and others note. Kaiko Research points to a brief spike in the price of bitcoin last week, for example, after crypto news outlet Cointelegraph erroneously posted about the SEC approving iShares\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. That post was soon retracted.\n\nStill, the most recent surge bitcoin goes beyond single developments or participants, Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey notes \u2014 crediting \u201cmore of a broad market rally\u201d around spot bitcoin ETF prospects.\n\nDespite the recent excitement around bitcoin, crypto is still a risky bet. Experts like Moya call it \u201cthe most volatile asset class,\u201d pointing to wildly unpredictable fluctuations in value. In short, investors can lose money as quickly as they make it.\n\nThe collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX also \u201cleft a big scar\u201d on the public\u2019s confidence in the crypto industry and crushed retail investors, Moya said \u2014 noting that institutional money, like hedge funds, are behind the bulk of crypto investing today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing interest is coming back into the space, but it\u2019s not the same as it was before,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s watching how future regulation unfolds.\n\nAnd a lot is uncertain. While the price of bitcoin \u2014 as well as the stocks of crypto players like Coinbase and MicroStrategy \u2014 has risen amid prospects of spot ETF approval, it\u2019s not clear if it will stay that way. A regulatory green light doesn\u2019t promise continued gains.\n\n\u201c(In the case of approval), are we going to see sustained interest? Are we going to see the trading volumes with this ETF? If it disappoints, then bitcoin\u2019s going to struggle,\u201d Moya said. \u201cI might be more short-term bullish until we get the actual confirmation.\u201d\n\nAs of around 12:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, the price of bitcoin stood at $34,789."

        "title": "Why bitcoin is surging again - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nBitcoin is rocketing higher, topping $35,000 for the first time since May 2022. It\u2019s up 20% over the past five days.\n\nThe famously volatile cryptocurrency has more than doubled in value this year as investors grow excited about the prospect of being able to buy bitcoin funds that trade on good old-fashioned stock exchanges rather than having to deal with less-regulated and sometimes sketchy crypto platforms (see: FTX, Binance, et al).\n\nThe latest round of excitement came as the BlackRock exchange-traded fund for bitcoin appeared on a list controlled by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., a Nasdaq-operated clearing house for stocks and ETFs, according to Reuters.\n\nBlackRock applied in June to register a bitcoin spot ETF, which is pending approval. The company is the largest provider of ETFs in the world, managing trillions of dollars of assets. A BlackRock bitcoin ETF would give the cryptocurrency a new sense of legitimacy.\n\n\u201cThis listing in the DTCC does not mean that the fund has actually been launched or that this will inevitably happen,\u201d said Samer Hasn, market analyst at online brokerage XS.com. \u201cHowever, it may appear as part of BlackRock\u2019s preparations to launch the ETF soon.\u201d\n\nOther companies have also applied for approval to launch similar bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale Investments.\n\nAlthough the US Securities and Exchange Commission had ruled against Grayscale\u2019s ETF, a three-judge panel for the DC Court of Appeals in August overruled the regulator\u2019s decision. The panel said the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application.\n\nThat has helped boost cryptocurrencies throughout the summer.\n\nStill, the SEC has not approved the fund, and investors may be getting out in front of their skis.\n\n\u201cI think that these rapid rises in bitcoin are somewhat exaggerated,\u201d said Hasn. \u201cRegulatory and legislative concerns are still clouding this market, and I don\u2019t see opportunities soon to dispel these concerns as the legal battles continue.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason why bitcoin may be rising: fear. As investors look to diversify their portfolios in uncertain times, some turn to bitcoin, ironically as a kind of digital safe haven. Sometimes dubbed \u201cdigital gold,\u201d bitcoin has become a way for investors to branch out beyond traditional stocks and bonds."

        "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS The bitcoin price crossed $35,000 for the first time since May 2022, as market speculators anticipate the impending approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S.\n\nMore than $250 million in bitcoin short positions were liquidated in the past three days.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Digital Assets Head of Research Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, a short squeeze was a key contributing factor to the recent bitcoin price spike.\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Index as calculated by TradingView, also reached 54.26%, which is its highest level since April 2021.\n\nAs bitcoin's dominance over the crypto market increases, a report from Kaiko indicates crypto asset delistings from exchanges are happening at the fastest rate in history.\n\nBitcoin's price briefly surged past the $35,000 mark this week and some analysts think that growing small-investor participation may bode well in the coming weeks, but the rise in the cryptocurrency hasn't helped the rest of the market.\n\nTrading related to the news of a potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) intensified, pushing up the price above $30,000 and squeezing shorts, according to Deutsche Digital Assets Head of Research Andr\u00e9 Dragosch. The short squeeze led to more than $250 million liquidation of short positions over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI)\u2014a measure of bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market\u2014reached heights not seen since April 2021.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Index at Highest Levels in Two Years\n\nWhile a rising bitcoin tends to lift all crypto assets, the rest of the market has not been able to keep up with bitcoin this week. In fact, this has been the trend for nearly a year, as the BDI has seen a steady increase since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. Today, BDI is about 54.4%\u2014 its highest level since April 2021.\n\nTradingView\n\nIndeed, the darlings of the previous crypto bull market have not fared well relative to bitcoin over the past year. For example, the native crypto asset of Ethereum, ether, is up only 14% in the past year as opposed to a roughly 66% gain for bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, Bloomberg reported that crypto tokens are being delisted from exchanges at a rate never before seen in the industry's history, according to data from Kaiko. Nearly 3,500 crypto token delistings have either already taken place or are expected to take place in 2023, and Coinbase (COIN), which is currently being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is said to have delisted 80 trading pairs this month alone.\n\nSmall Investors Laying Groundwork For Bitcoin Bull Market?\n\nDragosch observed increased bitcoin wallet activity for both small and large invetsors, but there was one number that stood out. An increase in \"median value of transfer volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain\"\u2014an indicator of small-investor participation\u2014could hold some clues about the price direction for bitcoin.\n\n\"Small-investor participation is a necessary condition for a sustained bull market in crypto assets,\" Dragosch wrote.\n\n"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin hit a 17-month high on Tuesday, recouping the losses it sustained in last year\u2019s crash, on rising speculation that US regulators will approve stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of the digital currency leapt more than 10 per cent in the past 24 hours to $35,000 a token as traders grew increasingly confident the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve an exchange-traded fund in coming months.\n\nIts sharp rise meant that bitcoin, the oldest and most actively traded token, has pulled back all the losses it made in the wake of the failure of the Terra stablecoin last May.\n\nTerra\u2019s sudden downfall sparked an unprecedented crisis of confidence and the collapse of a string of high-profile companies, including lender Celsius and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge has been driven by hopes that in coming months the SEC will resile its decade-long policy of refusing to approve spot ETFs, a stock market fund that hold bitcoins. Wall Street names such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe SEC accepting a spot bitcoin ETF application would validate bitcoin as an established asset class alongside all other asset classes,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, a London-based broker.\n\n\u201cIt could close the book on rogue and unregulated institutions leading the way on crypto. Major institutions would now have a buy-in into the sector,\u201d he added.\n\nCrypto advocates have said such funds offer consumers a cheap and safe way to trade the token, instead of buying it directly from unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SEC has argued that it cannot offer investors reassurance that the bitcoin market is not prone to being manipulated.\n\nHowever, the regulator has been under pressure since the summer after a Washington court ruled the agency was wrong to reject an application by asset manager Grayscale to turn its flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into an ETF.\n\nTraders said Tuesday\u2019s gains were driven by the listing of BlackRock\u2019s planned bitcoin ETF at the US securities market\u2019s main clearing house.\n\nIt came days after an updated filing from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which said that an unnamed investor planned to buy shares in the ETF. The move is common for new or upcoming ETFs in search of fresh capital.\n\n\u201cEvery day, we get news further solidifying the common consensus that the SEC will approve the variety of bitcoin spot ETFs,\u201d said Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nTraders have been positioning themselves for a jump in bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. Earlier this month it rose by more than 8 per cent as false rumours circulated on social media that BlackRock\u2019s application had been approved.\n\nCoinShares, an investment group, said that investors had put $179mn into digital asset funds over the past four weeks and were \u201clikely linked to excitement\u201d over a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, it noted the flows were below the $807mn that flowed into funds in the four weeks after BlackRock made its first filing last June. It suggests \u201ca more cautious approach from investors this time around,\u201d it said in a research note.\n\nThe SEC is due to make its first rulings on the ETF filings at the start of next year."

        "content": "Indulge me for just a minute. For more than a year now, I\u2019ve watched the industry I cover with a mix of disbelief and despair\u2014there are only so many hacks, frauds, and arrests you can witness without getting jaded. But this week, for the first time in months, I felt something else: optimism.\n\nThe feeling came as the price of Bitcoin reached its highest level since 2022 on Tuesday, and amid a growing consensus the SEC is on the cusp of approving applications for a Bitcoin ETF, and that it will soon do the same for Ethereum. When this happens, ETF providers like BlackRock and Fidelity will likely nudge the thousands of funds they serve to add a small percentage of crypto to their portfolio, driving the price up further. By mid-2024, memories of post-FTX Bitcoin at $15,000 could become quite distant, as the top cryptocurrency\u2014currently sitting above $34,000\u2014climbs to $50,000 and beyond.\n\nThis has certainly happened before. I recall Bitcoin shaking off a post-crash low of $300 in 2014 to climb to nearly $20,000 in 2017, and then, in the next cycle, recovering from a then-floor of $3,000 in 2018 to go all the way to its all-time high of around $65,000. Crypto aficionados with a technical bent say the industry operates in four-year cycles and that we are entering the upswing of another one. They\u2019re not the only ones\u2014Morgan Stanley just published a report titled \u201cWill Crypto Spring Ever Come?\u201d that suggests the worst is over.\n\nIf the good times are indeed returning, it\u2019s interesting to consider who the winners of this cycle will be. In the 2017 boom, cryptographers and technology experts reaped newfound crypto riches, while in 2021 money also flowed to chipmakers and to artists through the NFT market\u2014and also to Lamborghini dealers and makers of tungsten cubes. When it comes to the current cycle, one of the biggest beneficiaries is likely to be the traditional financial industry, which is not only seeking to dominate the impending ETF market but is making use of crypto for payments and settlements.\n\nThis would be an ironic outcome. After all, Satoshi Nakamoto founded Bitcoin to usurp the traditional banking industry\u2014not empower it with new tools. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a zero-sum game. Even if legacy companies reap a big part of the next crypto boom, there will be plenty of other winners\u2014including long-suffering exchanges like Coinbase and the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, if past booms are an indication, there will be an appetite for startups with new ideas. And maybe this time around, investors will actually remember to do due diligence instead of shoveling money to fly-by-night projects and con men.\n\nRemember this is all a best-case scenario. It\u2019s also very possible that a fresh wave of regulatory crackdowns or another massive collapse (you doing okay, Binance?) could snuff out the current rally before it properly takes off. But for today at least, let\u2019s be optimistic.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nDigital Currency Group\u2019s revenue climbed 23% and the company repaid its subsidiary $223 million in Q3, the conglomerate said in a shareholders letter.

We'll have to wait and see.\u201d Thomas declined to be interviewed or to comment further.\n\nA Very Valuable, Worthless USB Stick\n\nIn past interviews, Thomas has said that his 7,002 bitcoins were left over from a payment he received for making a video titled \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d that published on YouTube in early 2011, when a bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. Later that year, he told WIRED that he'd inadvertently erased two backup copies of the wallet that held those thousands of coins, and then lost the piece of paper with the password to decrypt the third copy, stored on the IronKey. By then, his lost coins were worth close to $140,000. \u201cI spent a week trying to recover it,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt was pretty painful.\u201d\n\nIn the 12 years since, the value of the inaccessible coins on Thomas' IronKey has at times swelled to be worth nearly half a billion dollars, before settling to its current, still-staggering price. In January 2021, as Bitcoin began to approach its peak exchange rate, Thomas described to The New York Times the angst that his long-lost hoard had caused him over the years. \u201cI would just lay in bed and think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn\u2019t work, and I would be desperate again.\u201d"

It then peaked at $35,100 early Tuesday morning, before dipping to just under $34,000 at the time of publication.\n\nAB analysts also pointed out that bitcoin is such a young asset compared to gold, which had its first ETF tracking the commodity\u2019s price in 2004.\n\nIn fact, speculation about a possible ETF is the very thing driving bitcoin\u2019s value up at the moment, even though some industry watchers believe this price action is premature since ETF approvals are dependent on the US Securities and Exchange Commission. So far, the SEC has dragged its feet, delaying multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications multiple times throughout 2023.\n\nAccording to AB, Bitcoin\u2019s main hurdle is its \u201cUX UI\u201d problem. This is an issue the analysts believe can be turned around with the advent of spot bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe inaccessibility of crypto wallets and the treacherous track record of exchanges, has made Bitcoin inaccessible to the mainstream. The Bitcoin ETF would make Bitcoin accessible in broker accounts, well integrated with private banks and wealth managers/advisors,\u201d AB analysts wrote.\n\nGrayscale could win the race to a bitcoin ETF since the SEC has declined to appeal an August ruling siding with Grayscale. The DC Court of Appeals said the SEC blocking the firm\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $35,000 in its largest single-day jump in 13 months, fueled by optimism that regulatory approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is nearing.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022. The price reached its highest point in a year and a half.\n\nThe stocks of digital asset companies also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively.\n\nThe rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product.\n\nThe BlackRock logo is pictured outside the money manager's headquarters in Manhattan. (Carlo Allegri/REUTERS) (Carlo Allegri / reuters)\n\nBitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the website of clearing house Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), while also cheering a suggestion that BlackRock had begun seeding the fund.\n\nA spokesman for DTCC said Tuesday evening that its \"standard practice\" for the company to add securities to its list, which includes \"active and potential\" ETFs, in preparation for the launch of a new ETF to the market and that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was added in August 2023.\n\n\"Appearing on the list is simply an indication that an agent bank has requested a DTCC identifier for an ETF fund, and that DTCC may process that transaction at an undetermined date,\" said the DTCC spokesman. It \"is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes,\" they added.\n\nSpeculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it. Investors expect the agency will rule on the applications by Jan. 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is another factor behind this week\u2019s price swings, according to crypto market data aggregator Coinglass. Over the past 24 hours, $231 million worth of levered positions on bitcoin have been liquidated by investors, 80% of which were short the digital asset.\n\nThe dramatic movements over the last few weeks have some in the crypto community celebrating a return of the enthusiasm that characterized the industry during the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\"We are so back,\" Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWe are so back. \u2014 Alex Svanevik \ud83d\udc27 (@ASvanevik) October 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now on trial in Manhattan for multiple counts of fraud.\n\nA widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. The SEC sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBut since the beginning of January, bitcoin has more than doubled. MicroStrategy, the Virginia-based software company, is the largest public company holding bitcoin. Its stash of 158,245 BTC is currently worth roughly $5.4 billion as of Tuesday morning.\n\nIn various tweets over the past month, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who stepped down as CEO in August 2022, has said of bitcoin that the asset is \"a flight to safety,\" \"digital energy,\" \"for the kids,\" \"power,\" and \"forever.\"\n\nUpdated 10/25 with DTCC comments.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "The global Bitcoin mining network is highly dependent on fossil fuels, having worrying impacts on water and land in addition to a significant carbon footprint, warns the new UN assessment.\n\nHamilton, Canada: The extraordinary rise in cryptocurrency prices over the previous decade has prompted huge investments in the cryptocurrency sector. Undeniably, digital currencies have won the faith of the world's top investors, ranging from large corporations and tech millionaires to criminals, money launderers, and sanction busters.\n\nThanks to blockchain and other technological breakthroughs, digital currencies now constitute an advanced element of the world\u2019s modern financial system. They are said to even have the potential to crush the world\u2019s strongest currencies.\n\nThe surge in the crypto market is comparable to the gold rush. Yet, this exciting market has a hidden dark side. Mining cryptocurrencies can have major environmental impacts on climate, water, and land, according to new research by United Nations scientists.\n\nBitcoin is the most renowned and popular cryptocurrency. This motivated the UN scientists to evaluate the environmental impacts of Bitcoin across the world by looking at the activities of 76 Bitcoin mining nations during the 2020\u20132021 period. The results are shocking. In addition to a substantial carbon footprint, global Bitcoin mining activities have significant water and land footprints.\n\n\u201cTechnological innovations are often associated with unintended consequences and Bitcoin is no exception,\u201d said Professor Kaveh Madani, the Director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), who led this study. \u201cOur findings should not discourage the use of digital currencies. Instead, they should encourage us to invest in regulatory interventions and technological advancements that improve the efficiency of the global financial system without harming the environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to study results, published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal, during the 2020\u20132021 period, the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 Terawatt hours of electricity. This means that if Bitcoin were a country, its energy consumption would have ranked 27th in the world, ahead of a country like Pakistan, with a population of over 230 million people. The resulting carbon footprint was equivalent to that of burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. To offset this footprint, 3.9 billion trees should be planted, covering an area almost equal to the area of the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark or 7% of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nDuring this time period, Bitcoin's water footprint was similar to the amount of water required to fill over 660,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, enough to meet the current domestic water needs of more than 300 million people in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The land footprint of worldwide Bitcoin mining activities during this period was 1.4 times the area of Los Angeles.\n\nThe UN scientists report that Bitcoin mining heavily relies on fossil energy sources, with coal accounting for 45% of Bitcoin's energy supply mix, followed by natural gas (21%). Hydropower, a renewable energy source with significant water and environmental impacts, is the most important renewable source of energy of the Bitcoin mining network, satisfying 16% of its electricity demand. Nuclear energy has a considerable share of 9% in Bitcoin\u2019s energy supply mix, whereas renewables such as solar and wind only provide 2% and 5% of the total electricity used by Bitcoin.\n\nChina, by a large margin, has been the biggest Bitcoin mining nation. To offset the carbon emissions from China's coal-intensive Bitcoin mining operations in 2021\u20132022, about 2 billion trees should be planted, covering an area equivalent to the sum of Portugal and Ireland or 45,000 times the area of Central Park in New York City. Aside from China, the world\u2019s top 10 Bitcoin mining nations in 2020\u20132021 included the United States, Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, Germany, Iran, Ireland, and Singapore.\n\n\u201cBecause countries use different sources of energy to generate electricity, their electricity production impacts on climate, water, and land are not the same,\u201d said Dr. Sanaz Chamanara, the lead author of the study and an Environmental, Social and Governance (EGS) Research Fellow at UNU-INWEH. \u201cThe rankings of countries in terms of the environmental impacts of their Bitcoin operations change depending on which environmental footprint is considered.\u201d\n\nNorway, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom are among the countries that make it to the top 10 list when the water or land footprint of their Bitcoin mining activities is taken into account. Together, the top 10 Bitcoin mining countries in terms of environmental footprint are responsible for 92\u201394% of Bitcoin\u2019s global carbon, water, and land footprints.\n\nThe UN scientists make a range of recommendations regarding possible interventions by the governments to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts of cryptocurrencies. They also suggest investment in other types of digital currencies that are more efficient in terms of energy use and less harmful to the environment. The investigation also calls for attention to the transboundary and transgenerational impacts of mining cryptocurrencies. \u201cWhen you note which groups are currently benefiting from mining Bitcoin and which nations and generations will suffer the most from its environmental consequences, you can\u2019t stop thinking about the inequity and injustice implications of the unregulated digital currency sector,\u201d said Madani.\n\nRead the paper, summarizing the main findings of the study: Chamanara, S., Ghaffarizadeh, S.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s rally above $35,000 is pushing higher the shares of several crypto-related firms, with investor optimism increasing alongside the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks led the gains on Tuesday morning, with Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms up 18% and 15%, respectively. Shares of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, were up 15%, to about $89, while Bitcoin HODLer MicroStrategy was up 13%, at $427, just after the market opened Tuesday.\n\nTwo of the three major indices closed down on Monday, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which posted a decline of 0.6%, or 191 points, and the S&P 500, which fell 0.2%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3%.\n\nThe surge in crypto-related stocks follows a downturn in 2022, which pushed some of them to the brink. After closing at $328 on its public debut in 2021, Coinbase\u2019s stock dropped to as low as $35 in 2022 as crypto prices slumped across the board.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally comes as Bitcoin broke through the $35,000 level for the first time since 2022, before paring back gains, to about $34,400. The increase is a jump from its Monday performance when the cryptocurrency broke through the psychologically important level of $30,000. Bitcoin now makes up more than half of the overall crypto market, according to CoinGecko, thanks to a flurry of inflows over the past few days.\n\nOn Monday, a court of appeals made official Grayscale\u2019s victory over the agency in a lawsuit over the SEC\u2019s decision to deny the asset manager\u2019s bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022. The agency has yet to officially approve Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nOther TradFi heavyweights such as BlackRock and Fidelity have also filed applications to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, which gives investors more direct exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nOn Monday, BlackRock took a step forward in preparing to offer the investment product by registering a ticker\u2014IBTC\u2014for its iShares Bitcoin Trust with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which provides clearing and settlement services to financial markets. An amendment to BlackRock\u2019s ETF application filed last week also showed that a seed investor could fund the investment vehicle as soon as this month, although that move doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with when the spot Bitcoin ETF would begin trading."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility; however, there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency, run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one U.S. dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies, and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through October 24, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged this past week, reaching its highest level since May 2022. BTC is now up over 100% year to date. Some market observers are optimistic that the digital currency can continue to build on the recent, modest gains as well as provide some protection against inflation.\n\nXRP\u2019s price also jumped this week, reaching its highest level in over two months. XRP is currently up ~62% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price rose to its highest level since August and is now up ~48% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nby Jennifer Nash of VettaFi | Advisor Perspectives, 10/25/23\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "What Are the Biggest Factors Driving Bitcoin Adoption? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Few inventions in finance have created as much talk and excitement as Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency has evolved from a tiny digital experiment to a global financial phenomenon since its launch in 2009. However, many people are wondering whether Bitcoin will ever overtake fiat currencies or if crypto itself will be relegated to niche use.\n\nBitcoin's Perception as a Store of Value\n\nThe perception of Bitcoin as a store of value is one of the most important elements driving its adoption. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation as a result of central bank policy, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of 21 million coins. This scarcity is intended to maintain Bitcoin's value and shield it from the devaluation that can occur with fiat currencies. Individuals and organizations have turned to Bitcoin as a hedge against currency depreciation as concerns about inflation have intensified, particularly in the aftermath of economic uncertainty.\n\nInstitutional Investment\n\nInstitutional investment has been essential in propelling Bitcoin adoption to new heights. Bitcoin is gradually being recognized as an asset class worthy of investment by major corporations, hedge funds, and asset managers. This shift in attitude has resulted in significant capital inflows into the cryptocurrency industry. Several factors have fueled institutional interest in Bitcoin, including the desire for portfolio diversification, the potential for high returns, and the rising acceptance of Bitcoin as a real store of value.\n\nGrowing acceptability and Integration\n\nAs Bitcoin has progressed from obscurity to widespread acceptability, it has been more integrated into the traditional financial system. Leading payment processors and financial institutions have started to provide Bitcoin-related services, making it easier for consumers to purchase, sell, and store Bitcoin. In addition, certain nations and regions have taken steps to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, creating a more favorable atmosphere for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nTechnological advances\n\nTechnological advances inside the crypto ecosystem have also aided Bitcoin acceptance. Individuals and institutions can now connect with Bitcoin more easily because to the development of secure and user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and custody solutions. The introduction of Bitcoin-related financial products such as futures contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has provided investors with new ways to obtain exposure to Bitcoin price changes.\n\nGlobal Economic instability\n\nGlobal economic instability, aggravated by events like as the COVID-19 epidemic and geopolitical conflicts, has prompted many people to seek alternative financial assets, such as Bitcoin. In times of crisis, the concept of a decentralized, borderless money that works independently of established financial institutions has proven increasingly intriguing. Furthermore, Bitcoin's capacity to conduct cross-border transactions without the use of intermediaries has established it as a crucial tool for individuals and enterprises navigating international financial issues.\n\nIncreased Accessibility\n\nThe rising accessibility of cryptocurrencies has also fueled Bitcoin acceptance. Individuals may now acquire, keep, and use Bitcoin more easily than ever before thanks to cryptocurrency exchanges, mobile apps, and peer-to-peer networks. The presence of Bitcoin ATMs in various places around the world has increased its accessibility. These devices enable customers to buy Bitcoin with cash, linking the digital and physical worlds.\n\nFear of Missing Out (FOMO)\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, has played a psychological effect in pushing Bitcoin acceptance. With Bitcoin's price seeing substantial rallies and media attention, more people have been motivated to participate in order to avoid missing out on possible benefits. The FOMO phenomenon has been aided by social media, news coverage, and word-of-mouth debates. Many newbies to the cryptocurrency industry have been enticed by stories of early Bitcoin investors who became millionaires, which has fueled their desire to engage in the market.\n\nFinancial inclusivity\n\nAnother compelling aspect driving acceptance is Bitcoin's ability to foster financial inclusivity. Bitcoin provides an alternate means of making financial transactions in areas where traditional banking services are unavailable. Individuals who do not have access to traditional banks can participate in the global economy by using Bitcoin wallets and smartphones. Furthermore, Bitcoin-powered remittance businesses have made it possible for migrant workers to send money to their family back home. By lowering fees and enhancing efficiency, this use case has the potential to revolutionize the remittance sector.\n\nUse Case Evolution\n\nBitcoin's use cases have evolved beyond its status as a digital store of wealth. It has acquired adoption as a payment method by a variety of merchants and online platforms. Some businesses already accept Bitcoin in exchange for products and services, allowing consumers to immediately spend their holdings. Furthermore, the Lightning Network, a second-layer Bitcoin solution, has increased its scalability and speed, making it more ideal for everyday transactions. This advancement has increased the utility of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\n\nRegulatory Clarity and Compliance\n\nClearer regulatory frameworks and enhanced compliance initiatives have made Bitcoin adoption more steady. Cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses have made strides in conforming to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules. The adoption of regulatory best practices has established trust in users and investors alike, lowering the notion of illegal behavior in the cryptocurrency market. Improved compliance procedures have also cleared the door for institutional adoption, as institutions feel more at ease participating in a regulated environment.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Obstacles\n\nWhile these factors have fueled Bitcoin adoption, obstacles remain. Price volatility is a worry, since large price swings can deter some consumers and companies from using Bitcoin as a payment method. Scalability concerns, as well as high transaction fees during times of network congestion, have sparked debate among the Bitcoin community. Furthermore, legislative developments and prospective changes in tax treatment may have an impact on Bitcoin's attractiveness to investors and consumers. In some regions, regulatory uncertainty may discourage firms from fully embracing cryptocurrency.\n\nHow the Spot Bitcoin ETF is Paving the Way for Crypto Mass Adoption\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation, and it's all thanks to the impending arrival of a spot market Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). After years of legal battles and regulatory scrutiny, a spot market Bitcoin ETF is finally on the horizon, and it could be a game-changer for the entire industry.\n\nThis ETF represents a financial product that allows investors to access Bitcoin's spot market prices within traditional stock exchanges, offering a regulated and familiar investment avenue. While similar products already exist in Canada and Europe, they have remained out of reach for U.S. investors due to repeated SEC rejections.\n\nExcitement around the spot Bitcoin ETF stems from a recent U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, criticizing the SEC for approving a futures-based Bitcoin ETF while rejecting spot market-based applications. This development has reignited hopes that a spot market ETF may arrive in U.S. markets by year-end.\n\nThe implications are monumental. The ETF opens the door to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, offering U.S. investors a regulated entry point into the market. This could drive substantial capital into the crypto space, propelling it to new heights.\n\nMoreover, the association of a spot Bitcoin ETF with financial giants like BlackRock has generated immense optimism. BlackRock's ETF submission alone caused a 20% Bitcoin price surge, underscoring the market's enthusiasm.\n\nWhile uncertainties remain about the SEC's stance, the current climate suggests a shift in favor of cryptocurrency adoption. The arrival of a spot market Bitcoin ETF may be the catalyst that drives crypto mass adoption.\n\nConclusion\n\nA convergence of variables has marked Bitcoin's journey from a whitepaper to a global phenomenon, including its role as a store of value, institutional adoption, technological developments, and global economic dynamics. While obstacles exist, Bitcoin's adoption is increasing, and its integration into the larger financial ecosystem is set to advance further. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, it will be critical to track how these factors influence Bitcoin adoption and the broader financial industry. The continual interaction of technology innovation, legal advancements, and economic pressures will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Bitcoin's adoption in the next years."

        "content": "An advertisement for bitcoin cryptocurrency is displayed on a street in Hong Kong on Feb. 17, 2022. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared to almost $35,000 this week, marking its highest value in nearly 18 months.\n\nCryptocurrency bitcoin breached the $35,000 mark briefly Wednesday for the first time in 18 months and is riding a 20% value surge over the last week. The token was trading around $34,675 later in the day.\n\nBut why the sudden bounce?\n\nMounting evidence suggests bitcoin, and potentially other cryptocurrencies, could be getting close to entering a more mainstream investment window via exchange-traded funds that can be bought and sold on a stock exchange.\n\nAccording to a breakdown by Investopedia, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity or other assets, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular stock can. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities, per Investopedia.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, which is simply an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, opens the door for, in this case, bitcoin investing without having to manage a crypto account or crypto wallet.\n\nA move by investment giant BlackRock is powering up the hype around bitcoin ETFs after financial services provider Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation posted BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF on an eligibility list, even though the fund is still awaiting approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And some investors are seeing the move as a sign that SEC approval could be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cThis listing in the DTCC does not mean that the fund has actually been launched or that this will inevitably happen,\u201d Samer Hasn, market analyst at online brokerage XS.com, told CNN. \u201cHowever, it may appear as part of BlackRock\u2019s preparations to launch the ETF soon.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned an SEC decision to reject a spot bitcoin ETF application from crypto asset management firm Grayscale, in a ruling that noted the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application, per CNN.\n\nAll signs appear to be pointing to crypto investment having a new presence via ETF opportunities and that collective vibe is helping drive the current rise in valuations.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant development and shows that U.S. institutions and U.S. investors are embracing the news that a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF) appears imminent,\u201d wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at crypto services provider Matrixport, according to a report from CoinDesk."

For that reason, projects and companies from nearby cities like Tampere and Turku are also included here.\n\nThe area was first settled around 5000 BC as the ice age retreated. Vikings raided the established settlements, as did Swedish crusaders in the 10th and 13th centuries. The city was formally established in 1550 as a Swedish trading post, defended by Suomenlinna (Finland\u2019s fortress), the largest sea fort in Europe. Later, under Russian control as the Grand Duchy of Finland, the emperor moved the capital from Turku to Helsinki, which was closer to St. Petersburg. Finland became independent in 1917, after which it resisted Soviet occupation in the 1940 Winter War.\n\nThe Finnish Parliament. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nHelsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame rests with Martti Malmi, a software developer who in 2009 sold 5,050 BTC for a $5.02 PayPal transfer, marking the first time that Bitcoin was exchanged for fiat currency. It occurred before the much better-known May 22, 2010, \u201cPizza Day,\u201d when Bitcoin was first used to purchase a physical good. Eventually, Malmi used most of his Bitcoin to purchase a studio in the metro area. If he\u2019d hung on to it, it\u2019d be worth $171 million today. The Bitcoin was used to seed an exchange called New Liberty Standard, which established the first BTC price of 1,309.03 BTC for $1.\n\nFound the first known bitcoin to USD transaction from my email backups.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds began working on what became Linux at the University of Helsinki. It is also home to many video game companies, with local firm Rovio\u2019s Angry Birds achieving global fame in 2009. Helsinki is also the home of Aave founder Stani Kulechov, though he has moved abroad with the company.\n\nIn 2019, a then-staunchly Bitcoin maximalist group called Konsensus organized the translation of Saifedean Ammous\u2019 2018 book The Bitcoin Standard into Finnish, and later also translated The Little Bitcoin Book by The Bitcoin Collective. According to one member, the organization has since become more accepting of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain use cases.\n\nThe \u201ccrypto community\u201d in Helsinki and Finland is somewhat disorganized and divided, with many enthusiasts being interested in one facet \u2014 be it Bitcoin, NFTs or Web3 \u2014 without embracing the whole, and thus having few common threads. Still, a certain grassroots energy is evident.\n\nThe founding meeting of The Finnish Bitcoin Association in Helsinki on May 6, 2023. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nPaying with Bitcoin is not common in Finland, where card and app payments dominate. One notable exception is the restaurant Faro, at which a few people are likely to buy a burger and beers with sats at the monthly Bitcoin meetup.\n\nOn the bar side, Taudo Baari and Time Bar also accept crypto. There is also the Osuva shooting range.\n\nSamuel Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4, CEO and co-founder of hardware startup Xellox and regular at the Faro Bitcoin meetup, tells Magazine about the state of Bitcoin acceptance:\n\n\u201cA few restaurants and bars have already been \u2018orange-pilled\u2019 \u2014 the biggest obstacles are the payment infrastructure and bookkeeping.\u201d\n\nToday, Helsinki has a vibrant tech and startup scene with many coworking spaces. The city is also host to the annual Slush startup conference, which draws 25,000 participants.\n\nWeb3 Helsinki is a student-run organization that organized its first event on April 20, 2020, with about 150 people in attendance, making it perhaps the largest single crypto event of the year.\n\n2023\u2019s events have included the Web3 Bash in late April, followed by the Aurora Nordic Web3 Conference in June. On June 6, the BRIDG3 Blockchain summit was held at Tampere\u2019s Nokia Arena, focusing on Web3, the metaverse and decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nThe Aurora Nordic Web3 Conference, held in Helsinki on June 6, 2023. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nThe Finnish Bitcoin Association was established on May 6, in an event attended by Magazine, with membership fees paid primarily with Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. Upon the conclusion of formalities, the saunas of the hosting coworking space were fired up.\n\nFor those interested in NFTs, Fungi is a platform advertising a no-code solution that lets organizations build NFT-based communities. One of these was a metaverse island called Cornerstone for VR studio ZOAN, where 100 plots could be purchased as NFTs.\n\nHABBO NFT, operated by the local creators of the 23-year-old online chat room game HABBO Hotel, has dropped an 11,600-piece avatar collection on OpenSea and is currently developing an NFT-based game. A group called The Future of Art has also dedicated itself to promoting digital art and runs an NFT gallery.\n\nThe Finnish Web3 Landscape, according to Tampere-based The Good Cartel, which exists to support Finnish Web3 startups.

Membrane Finance\u2019s EUROe was launched in February 2023 and is designed to be an \u201cEU-regulated full-reserve stablecoin\u201d that is compliant with recent legislation.

(Elias Ahonen)\n\nIn 2018, the Finnish customs service planned to auction 1,666 BTC that it had seized in a drug case, but decided not to proceed \u201cdue to concerns that the virtual money would return to the hands of criminals,\u201d displaying a rather negative official view of cryptocurrency. In July 2022, the state eventually auctioned nearly 2,000 BTC for $47 million, with proceeds being donated to Ukraine.\n\nThe Finnish Government decided on significant additional aid to #Ukraine. Finland will donate tens of millions of euros from the sale of #bitcoin seized by Finnish Customs to Ukraine. This historic decision was taken by the Ministry and Finance and Ministry for Foreign Affairs. pic.twitter.com/RNDenhsBWH \u2014 Valtiovarainministeri\u00f6 | Finansministeriet (@VMuutiset) April 28, 2022\n\nIn December 2021, local media reported a trend of investment scams involving the faces of prominent people, including industrialist Heikki Herlin and then-Prime Minister Sanna Marin.\n\nEarlier in 2018, the police also made warnings regarding a trend of Bitcoin blackmail relating to bogus claims that hackers had webcam material of users visiting pornographic websites. In 2022, a Helsinki watch dealer fell victim to a common crypto scam, handing over Rolex watches worth $400,000 after mistakenly believing that he had received a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nCryptocurrency, often adjacent to scams in the news, has come to be viewed with a relatively high degree of suspicion across most of society. Commenting on the decision to halt the 2018 customs seizure sale, Pekka Pylkk\u00e4nen, head of finance at the Finnish Customs Service, highlighted concerns about money laundering, telling national broadcaster YLE that \u201cthe buyers of cyber currency rarely use them for normal endeavors.\u201d\n\nNational media regularly interview outspoken cryptocurrency critic Aleksi Grym, head of fintech for the Finnish Central Bank, as an authoritative expert without seeking alternative pro-cryptocurrency views, though coverage has been improving.\n\nAs one may notice from this article, the term \u201cWeb3\u201d is preferred, presumably due to its distancing from the negative stereotypes of cryptocurrency.\n\nNeither the country\u2019s political establishment nor any major party or other large grouping of the population could be described outright as being \u201cpro-crypto.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this could be Finland\u2019s stable, highly functional, and high-trust society, in which most people do not see the need to \u201cdisrupt\u201d or fix something with cryptocurrency. Bank transfers are free and near-instantaneous across the EU, with cash use increasingly rare. Virtually nobody is unbanked, and the most trusted institution is the police, with 95% public support. Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4, whose startup is working on solutions to protect private keys, explains the disconnect:\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t understand Bitcoin and think it\u2019s something between criminal money and a pyramid scheme.\u201d\n\nIt is also notable that the \u201cmoon\u201d mentality and dreams of quick wealth found in many cryptocurrency investors are generally seen in a particularly negative light, with Malmi noting that he never set out to make money with Bitcoin, \u201cperhaps owing to Finnish culture\u201d and his idealistic mentality.\n\nIn the same vein, cryptocurrencies are seen by some as drivers of inequality in a country where large differences in wealth are often considered taboo.\n\nThe Finnish Innovation Fund, or Sitra, has stated it as a priority to accelerate the local development of Web3 services, saying that \u201cit\u2019s in Finland\u2019s interest to play an active role in ensuring that the metaverse is created in line with European values.\u201d\n\nThe fund has also worked with the Finnish National Gallery to create The Finnish Metagallery, an art gallery in the Decentraland metaverse whose building is modeled from the Finnish Pavilion as it appeared at the 1900 Paris World Fair.\n\nJohanna Eiramo from the Finnish National Gallery presenting The Finnish Metagallery in Helsinki at Web3 Bash on April 27.

The price of bitcoin could increase by 74% in the 12 months following approval, he added.\n\nYu\u2019s flow estimate comes from an assumption that BTC is adopted by 10% of total assets across three wealth management channels, with an average allocation of 1%. Assets managed by brokers-dealers, banks and registered investment advisers (RIAs) total roughly $48 trillion, according to the report.\n\nThe Galaxy research associate then looked to the gold market as a point of comparison to determine the impact of bitcoin ETFs on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nRead more: AllianceBernstein calls bitcoin a \u2018safe haven asset,\u2019 more attractive than gold\n\nThe price of gold has roughly quadrupled since State Street Global Advisors launched the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) in November 2004.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nGold ETFs held $198bn in assets under management, as of Sept. 30 \u2014 representing about 1.7% of the gold supply, according to World Gold Council data. The value of bitcoin held in investment products amounted to $21.7 billion at that time, or roughly 4.3% of total issued supply.\n\n\u201cWith gold having an estimated ~24x larger market capitalization and 36% less supply held in investment vehicles compared to bitcoin, we assume a dollar-equivalent amount of fund inflows having a ~8.8x greater impact on bitcoin markets compared to gold markets,\u201d according to Yu.\n\nBy applying the year-one estimate of bitcoin ETF inflows into the historical relationship between gold ETF fund flows and the change in gold\u2019s price, Galaxy Digital predicts a 6.2% price jump for BTC in the first month that a US bitcoin fund is offered, he adds.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price increase could gradually decline to 3.7% by the last month of the first year, the report states \u2014 resulting in a potential 74% rise in those 12 months.\n\nThe year-one bitcoin price increase estimate was from its price of $26,920 at the end of September. The BTC price has risen substantially since then, hovering around $34,000 Wednesday morning.\n\nGabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at VanEck, noted in a September X post that bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization of roughly $500 billion at that time is about a quarter of what gold\u2019s market cap was in 2004.\n\n\u201cIn my view, upon the approval of a US spot bitcoin ETF, bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory could follow gold\u2019s blueprint from 2004 and the years after just much faster,\u201d Gurbacs wrote, noting bitcoin\u2019s \u201csystematic scarcity\u201d via halving schedules.\n\nAfter estimated year-one inflows of $14.4 billion, Galaxy predicts nearly $27 billion and $39 billion of inflows into bitcoin ETFs in the second and third year, respectively.\n\nRead more: An approved spot bitcoin ETF could be \u2018one of the largest launches in history\u2019\n\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said during an August webinar earlier that his firm estimates US spot bitcoin ETFs could $55 billion in net flows in their first five years on the market. He noted at the time that he believes the ETF sector could ultimately reach the level of assets under management seen in gold ETFs.\n\n\u201cETFs were a game-changer for gold because they brought new investors and new demand into a market with relatively fixed supply,\u201d Hougan said in a Tuesday X post. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has jumped past $33,000, driven by enthusiastic sentiment for SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. Several major investment firms have already filed for those ETFs, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ). The question now becomes what the timeline for approval looks like and what will happen after those ETFs are approved.\n\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten joins Yahoo Finance to give his thoughts on those questions as well as give insight into the impact this will have on cryptocurrency markets at large.\n\nIn terms of what will happen once the ETFs are approved, Klippsten says \"the top-of-funnel for investor class is going to change from something that is contrary to bitcoin, which is all of the crypto scams and pump-and-dumps of the last six years, FTX and the like... Now you're going to see a new era where some of the most credible, some of the most well-funded, trust brands in the world are going to be shouting from the rooftops with tens, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing expense, just talking about bitcoin.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Cory, there's a lot of enthusiasm from crypto fans about the SEC possibly approving a spot bitcoin ETF. Bottom line, Cory, do you think the SEC is going to greenlight a spot bitcoin ETF? And if so, Corey, when do you think they make that decision? Is that this year? Is it early next year? What do you think the timeline could be?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: I do think it's pretty much an inevitability that it's going to happen. And that will be a batch of them at about the same time. And then they'll compete it out to see who becomes who's the bitcoin version of the cues for S&P for instance. So that's what they'll be spending into, these big companies with their listings.\n\nAs far as timing, you know, I have been handicapping it as basically Q1. But it does seem like there is a smaller chance obviously of it happening sooner. I would place my bets on Q1, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: And Cory, what effect if and when these ETFs are approved? You know, it's not as just that it creates the product and people invest in it. But one would have to think that these big firms are going to be trying to push clients into these products. I mean, what kind of effect do you expect?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: That's right. Yeah. The biggest effect of the ETFs is going to be that the top of funnel for the investor class is going to change from something that is contra-bitcoin, which is all of the crypto scams and pump and dumps of the last six years, FTX and the like and all these wannabe altcoins. That's generally what has gotten people into bitcoin because they've been able to print their own money and sell it with marketing and all this VC funding.\n\nAnd then it takes people a year or two often to wade through all of that false marketing noise and find out what really is the signal in the space, which is bitcoin and bitcoin only. And now you're going to see a new era, where some of the most credible, some of the most well-funded, some of the most trusted brands in the world are going to be shouting from the rooftops with tens and maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing expense just talking about bitcoin and putting all of the bitcoin authors and podcasters and executives out there at conferences and encouraging them to go speak on to their companies and to the investing public.\n\nAnd that top of funnel is going to be talking about bitcoin. And that's going to get people through the early stages of their customer journey much, much, much faster toward understanding what bitcoin is and how different bitcoin is from the world of, quote unquote, \"crypto.\"\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Cory, by the same token, I mean, the SBF trial is still going on. Do you think that there will be sort of a public overhang from not just that but some of the other frauds that there have been over the past couple of years and that it's going to take some time to overcome some of that institutional and individual reluctance perhaps linked to those incidents?\n\nCORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, they had a dramatically negative effect on bitcoin in the last bull market, because they siphoned demand away with false promises and frankly just by stealing demand with fake yields and, you know, fake pump and dumps that were all sort of just Sam's fraud essentially, allegedly, but probably, certainly.\n\nSo you know, I think I think that we'll see a very different dynamic play out. And it'll be fascinating, because there have been so many people, you know, myself included that would assume that the percentage rises sort of bull cycle to bull cycle would continue to diminish. But if we truly were chopped at the knees with the last bitcoin bull market, which it certainly seems like we were-- a lot of demand truly was siphoned away by these scams. And most of them are gone, or at least the investing public understands much better after having it drummed into their head the difference between bitcoin and crypto scams over the last couple of years-- there's a very good chance that we see a pretty different-looking bull market the next time it really gets into swing for bitcoin."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The rally in Bitcoin (BTC -3.20%) may not count as a bull market as it tries to shake off the frost from a brutal crypto winter, but the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has more than doubled in 2023. Helping to add to a solid year, over the last few days, Bitcoin mustered enough momentum to break through the $30,000 mark and surge to a new yearly high. Yet even with a fresh rally, sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish as Bitcoin's price is still more than 50% off of its all-time high.\n\nFor now, Bitcoin is teetering between the depths of a bear market and potentially preparing for a resurgence. As it continues to navigate this fine line, there are two reasons investors should treat this as a buying opportunity in preparation of looming unprecedented pressure on Bitcoin's finite supply.\n\nA supply scarcity game changer\n\nBitcoin's halving events, which occur roughly every four years, have been instrumental in its transformation into a scarce digital asset and ascension to the most valuable cryptocurrency. The principle is straightforward: After every 210,000 blocks, the rewards granted to miners are cut in half. This automatic mechanism reduces Bitcoin's supply growth rate and makes it scarcer with each passing event. Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins for their efforts, but in just 172 days, this figure will drop to 3.125.\n\nThis simple supply-and-demand dynamic has been a driving force behind Bitcoin's historical price surges, especially in post-halving years. As the next halving approaches, the growth in Bitcoin's supply will slow, potentially amplifying its value -- provided demand remains steady.\n\nYet this halving might be unlike any seen before. When observing data related to the number of Bitcoins on exchanges, there is a clear trend of an increasing supply until March 2020, when supply peaked at nearly 3.2 million coins. However, since then, it has been a different story. Currently sitting at 2.3 million, the number of coins available today is at levels last seen in the spring of 2018.\n\nThere are likely a handful of reasons behind this, but the most straightforward explanation is related to the reduction of Bitcoin's supply growth. Up until March 2020, the supply growth of Bitcoin seems to have outpaced demand, at least enough to cause Bitcoins to pile up on exchanges. But after the most recent halving in May 2020, the situation changed as the available supply of coins significantly diminished.\n\nThe institutional floodgates are opening\n\nOver the course of Bitcoin's evolution, there has been a widespread belief that it would one day mature enough to be sought after by mainstream institutional investors. Yet after the token went on a historic run in 2021 en route to an all-time high of nearly $69,000, the number of deep-pocketed institutions clamoring for Bitcoin exposure remained minuscule, with just a handful of companies including Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Block leading the way. But that might finally be changing.\n\nJune of this year marked a turning point as BlackRock (BLK -2.12%), the world's largest asset manager, applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The potential approval of a spot ETF could revolutionize institutional adoption, opening doors to clients with retirement plans, IRAs (individual retirement accounts), pensions, and more. Following BlackRock's filing, an array of Wall Street giants, including Fidelity, Invesco, Ark Invest, and VanEck, also entered the Bitcoin ETF race.\n\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETF applications have been submitted here and there since 2013, all have been denied thus far. But there's growing optimism that this time will be different due to the prominence of these firms and the recent legal battles between the SEC and crypto defendants tipping in favor of the accused.\n\nQuantifying the impact an approval would have, Steven Schoenfeld, former managing director for BlackRock, surmised that approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is a near certainty at this point and would bring $200 billion to Bitcoin in the short term. More optimistic estimates claim that approval of the ETF could unleash $600 billion into the Bitcoin market. Considering Bitcoin's current market cap hovers at about $650 billion, these numbers could easily move its price.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nIn the short term, it's easy to understand bearish sentiments surrounding Bitcoin, especially when comparing its current price to the all-time high. However, when looking at the bigger picture, there's a compelling case for a resurgence. The combination of an imminent halving, diminishing available supply, and billions of institutional dollars knocking on Bitcoin's door is coalescing to drive the price up.\n\nInvestors who maintain a long-term perspective, understanding that this is a marathon, not a sprint, are poised for the most lucrative rewards. With Bitcoin's price still significantly below its peak, those who invest now have the potential to reap substantial gains in the coming years as Bitcoin enters a new chapter of its success story."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s surge toward $35,000 has helped lift a number of altcoins, some of which have recorded double-digit percentage gains over the past week. Although smaller meme tokens often see a jump following a Bitcoin rally, more established altcoins have joined the party.\n\nSolana, branded by some as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d has shaken off a slump caused by frequent mentions in the first weeks of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s ongoing trial. The token notched a gain of 40% over the past week, and as of Wednesday afternoon Solana was trading at $33.28, up 8.3% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe token has been the most popular altcoin for investors in major exchange-traded products so far this year, according to a report by CoinShares. Last week alone, investors poured $15.5 million into the token, an inflow of capital that trailed only Bitcoin\u2019s. Last week\u2019s investment puts year-to-date inflows to Solana at $74 million, according to the report.\n\nOther winners from this week\u2019s rally included lesser-known tokens such as Chainlink and Aptos, as well as the meme token Pepe.\n\nChainlink, a coin with close ties to the decentralized oracle network of the same name, jumped 56.6% over the past week and was trading up 11.7%, at $11.12, on Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAptos was just behind Chainlink, with a 35% weekly gain. The token was up 6.1% on Wednesday.\n\nAnd although its valuation is based mostly on hype, the Pepe coin had one of the best weekly performances, gaining 88%\u2014and about 24% over the past 24 hours.\n\nPartly fueling the rally across the board is a bet by investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. TradFi giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have already filed applications, and analysts at Bloomberg put the odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved by January at 90%."

        "content": "Since Bitcoin\u2019s introduction in 2009, cryptocurrency has worked its way into mainstream conversations and consumer decision-making. The medium of exchange is now actively traded 24/7 and becoming more widely accepted as a payment form.\n\nBut is cryptocurrency right for your small business? Several serious considerations must be taken into account \u2013 both technical and pragmatic \u2013 before deciding to accept crypto as a form of payment from your customers. We\u2019ll weigh all the cryptocurrency factors small business owners should consider and examine how some blockchain startups are trying to push the space forward.\n\nDid You Know? Did you know According to Deloitte, 3 out of 4 retailers plan to accept cryptocurrency payments. Part of the motivation is helping their brand be perceived as cutting-edge \u2013 making crypto a tech trend that will influence marketing.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that relies on peer-to-peer blockchain technology. It\u2019s decentralized \u2013 no central bank or government regulates or backs crypto. Buyers transfer funds directly to sellers without the third parties traditionally used to process payments. \u201cCryptocurrencies cut out the middleman in a transaction,\u201d explained Chris Poelma, CEO and board director of PCS Software Inc. \u201cRather than store your money somewhere where you\u2019re dependent on an organization to safeguard it, you hold on to it through an encryption only you have a key to. As we hear more stories of data breaches and hackers becoming more sophisticated, cryptocurrencies sound more appealing to consumers looking for a safer way to do business.\u201d Small businesses might accept cryptocurrency for many reasons: It\u2019s at the forefront of financial technology.\n\nIt can attract customers who use crypto for all purchases.\n\nIt eliminates certain kinds of fraud. But is accepting cryptocurrency right for your business? Tip Tip Encryption is a digital form of cryptography. It uses mathematical algorithms to scramble messages; the sender\u2019s cipher or key is necessary for decoding the message.\n\nWhat are the benefits of accepting cryptocurrency? Compared to traditional point-of-sale (POS) systems, cryptocurrencies offer several primary benefits to consider. Cryptocurrency has lower transaction fees. The lack of a central intermediary dramatically reduces transaction fees. Small businesses that accept credit card payments often incur credit card processing fees of around $0.25 for each card swipe plus 2 percent to 4 percent of the transaction total. These costs add up, which is why smaller stores often have credit card purchase minimums on their POS systems. Accepting crypto can reduce these costs to less than 1 percent of the value of each transaction.\n\nThe lack of a central intermediary dramatically reduces transaction fees.

Cryptocurrency offers customer convenience. Accepting cryptocurrency offers customers additional ways to pay while providing an extra layer of protection for their information. Tip Tip Experience working with blockchain development and engineering is becoming an in-demand career skill, as is familiarity with cryptocurrency and digital ledgers.\n\nWhat are the risks of accepting cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency isn\u2019t without its downsides. Here are some of the risks of accepting cryptocurrency. 1. There are technical barriers to accepting cryptocurrency. Accepting cryptocurrency requires setting up a digital wallet on a digital currency exchange, which could be technically prohibitive for small business owners unfamiliar with the technology. Cryptocurrency is an information-dense field with a relatively steep learning curve, which can be a significant obstacle when you\u2019re also trying to run a business. \u201cAs it stands now, small businesses, in particular, would find it difficult to accept cryptocurrency,\u201d noted Serge Beck, CEO and founder of blockchain ecosystem company Optherium. \u201cAnd even without the technical obstacles, the volatility of crypto values still creates a disincentive for entrepreneurs to hold digital currencies.\u201d 2. Cryptocurrency can be volatile. Digital currency\u2019s highest risk is price volatility, which makes its value extremely unpredictable. For example, Bitcoin was first valued in pennies in 2009; it rose to more than $64,000 per coin in February 2021 before dropping down to less than $28,500 per coin in May 2023. \u201cYou will have to make some form of arrangement for translating your cryptocurrency back into your currency of record,\u201d advised Areiel Wolanow, managing director of consulting firm Finserv Experts. \u201cCryptocurrencies are volatile, [so] you will want to do this quickly and regularly.\u201d Using a merchant services company like BitPay or Coinbase helps insulate small businesses against that volatility by immediately exchanging digital currency for its cash value. Through these services, cryptocurrency payments are made in real time for the currency\u2019s current value. The only reason for a business to hold on to cryptocurrency would be as a speculative investment, Wolanow noted, but this essentially amounts to gambling with your revenue stream. Did You Know? Did you know While many speculate that digital payments like crypto will usher in a cashless society, it\u2019s doubtful that digital transactions will become exclusive anytime soon. 3. Cryptocurrency has security issues. Although cryptocurrency transactions eliminate cyber threats like stolen credit card numbers, the currency still isn\u2019t 100 percent safe from cybersecurity threats. So far, there is no way to completely prevent cybercriminals from getting their hands on users\u2019 digital wallets. This is particularly dangerous because, unlike fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies are not backed or insured. However, companies are working on measures to protect against cryptocurrency security issues, including the following: Some companies are insuring cryptocurrency. Some companies are working to insure and back crypto. For example, Coinbase holds less than 2 percent of customers\u2019 digital currency online; in the event of a breach, the company fully insures losses. All fiat currency maintained on Coinbase is subject to FDIC insurance up to $250,000, just like conventional banks. However, these protections don\u2019t apply if your personal wallet is hacked or affected by a data breach; it\u2019s still your responsibility to secure your personal account. Still, you can rest easy knowing that if the company suffers an attack, your funds are safe.\n\nSome companies are working to insure and back crypto.

Still, you can rest easy knowing that if the company suffers an attack, your funds are safe. Wallet security is being explored. Companies are also working on solutions to address wallet security. According to Beck, Optherium employs a biometric verification method that identifies users based on their facial structure to grant wallet access, significantly reducing a thief\u2019s ability to steal someone\u2019s assets. This method also helps users reconstitute their wallets when access is lost. However, some cryptocurrency wallets require only a password for access, and if you forget your password, there is no way to recover the wallet. You will lose your entire ledger. Tip Tip If your SMB plans to accept crypto, improve cybersecurity by enabling multifactor authentication, securing and maintaining your private keys, and considering taking your crypto offline by putting it in cold storage. 4. Cryptocurrency faces regulatory uncertainty. Cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory landscape is poised to change as lawmakers craft new regulations. Once regulations are in place, they will likely evolve further, meaning business owners must be ready to adapt to changes in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. \u201cBecause cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there\u2019s much uncertainty around how the government will work out kinks in its regulation,\u201d Poelma explained. \u201c[Cryptocurrency] won\u2019t be universally accepted until businesses are certain they know how to report gains and pay proper taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.\u201d Changes in cryptocurrency regulation will likely continue as cryptocurrency\u2019s adoption expands and new problems and difficulties emerge. As there are no significant current regulations, crypto firms are moving abroad to establish trading desks while also working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent flouting securities laws. Additionally, the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as \u201cproperty\u201d or a \u201cdigital asset,\u201d so anytime you sell or exchange crypto, it will be taxed. Key Takeaway Key takeaway Business owners who accept crypto should carefully monitor ever-changing local and state business regulations, particularly related to online business laws and data privacy regulations like the GDPR.\n\nHow do you accept cryptocurrency? If you decide to move forward and start accepting cryptocurrency, you must make some decisions and take a few steps. Overall, the process is similar to getting set up with a credit card processing company. First, you must decide whether to use a processor to accept payments or accept them manually. Payment processors: A processor will simplify the process; you must register with a company like BitPay or PayPal to start accepting payments.\n\nA processor will simplify the process; you must register with a company like BitPay or PayPal to start accepting payments. Manual crypto acceptance: Alternatively, you can accept cryptocurrency payments to your small business manually. However, the process is a bit more complicated. You must create an account on a crypto exchange (such as Coinbase) so customers have somewhere to send your payment. Then, you can add functionality to your website (like a QR code) so customers can send crypto to your exchange account. Finally, you must take steps to withdraw your crypto from your exchange account. You\u2019ll either move it to a digital wallet or exchange it for dollars and transfer the funds to your business bank account."

The company's revenue growth showed little signs of stopping in Q3, thanks in part to strong demand in Latin America, Nelson adds.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) was another stock popping post-earnings, with shares jumping 9.3% after the telecommunications firm reported a third-quarter earnings beat. Revenue of $33.3 billion matched estimates, while the company also raised its full-year free cash flow forecast by $1 billion to more than $18 billion.\n\nNext up on the earnings calendar are Alphabet (GOOGL, +1.7%) and Microsoft (MSFT, +0.4%) \u2013 both of which reported higher-than-expected earnings after tonight's close. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META, -0.5%) reports tomorrow night, while results from e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN, +1.6%) are due after Thursday's close.\n\nBitcoin price pops on ETF chatter\n\nBitcoin was a big mover too. The cryptocurrency ran up near $35,000 overnight, a level it hasn't seen since May 2022, on news asset management giant BlackRock listed its iShares Bitcoin Trust with the ticker IBTC on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). This sparked excitement that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on the cusp of approving the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\"Bitcoin has stormed higher again on Tuesday continuing its blockbuster start to the week on the back of more ETF chat,\" says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA . \"There's clearly a lot of excitement about the prospect of a Bitcoin spot ETF, as is evident by such a surge on speculation of something that was already expected to eventually get over the line.\"\n\nHowever, subsequent reports indicated that the listing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust had been removed from the DTCC website. This brought Bitcoin slightly off its earlier highs, with the digital asset last seen up 7.8% at $33,804. (Bitcoin markets don't close; price taken at 4 pm Eastern.) Still, the price of Bitcoin is up 25% since the start of the month.\n\nFlash PMI data comes in strong\n\nOn the economic front, data from S&P Global showed its flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) and flash services PMI were both higher in October vs September, with the latter surpassing the 50 level that marks expansion for the first time since April.\n\n\"Hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy will be encouraged by the improved situation seen in October,\" said Chris Williamson , chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, in the report . Still, Williamson warns that ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East \"post downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation, adding fresh uncertainty to the outlook.\""

Bitcoin was up over 19% for the past seven days on the back of the news, sitting above the US$34,000 support level as of 2.30 p.m. Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The coin briefly broke US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nA Grayscale spokesperson said that the company now hopes to \u201cwork constructively\u201d with the SEC on its efforts to convert GBTC \u2014 currently the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund with US$16.7 billion in assets under management \u2014 into a spot Bitcoin ETF. \u201cGBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Grayscale investors who are waiting for a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF. The financial instrument \u2014 which would allow investors a way to invest in the coin on a traditional exchange \u2014 is seen as a way to open up the still marginal world of crypto investment to traditional finance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of people getting into crypto by the way of an ETF,\u201d said Jack Jia, head of crypto at payment platform Unlimit. He said the primary benefit of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that it improves the user experience (UX) for would-be crypto investors.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t need to use account abstraction or a custodial wallet because their UX is their broker,\u201d Jia added. \u201cThey\u2019re telling their customers or their clients to buy Bitcoin. So that is going to be the onboarding process, if you will.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOther than Grayscale, a range of institutional investors, from BlackRock to Fidelity to Ark Invest, have applied to the SEC for permission to create a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest economy. The SEC has so far either rejected or delayed making a decision on the applications, citing fears about a lack of liquidity and price manipulation in crypto markets.\n\nBut Vivian Fang, a FinTech expert and professor of finance at Indiana University, said she sees various signs that the SEC is now \u201cwarming up\u201d to the idea of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. She pointed to recent comments coming out of the regulator that it now considers the Bitcoin market to be of a sufficient size to resist market manipulation.\n\nThis, Fang said, has made her feel \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the SEC will approve at least one spot Bitcoin ETF application by the end of this year.\n\nBullish behavior\n\nAccording to research released Oct. 16 by blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, an SEC decision to allow the creation of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the seven largest asset managers with pending applications could bring up to US$155 billion into the Bitcoin market. Based on their analysis of the coin\u2019s past bull run behavior, CryptoQuant calculated that would increase Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization by US$450 billion to US$900 billion, adding US$1 trillion to the wider crypto market along the way.\n\nThe Next Wave of #Bitcoin Institutional Adoption:\n\nThe Launch of Spot ETFs\n\n\n\n\u2013 SPOT ETFS AS THE NEW WAY OF INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION.\n\n\u2013 IMPLICATIONS OF ETF APPROVALS FOR BITCOIN MARKET CAPITALIZATION.\n\n\n\nPrepared by Our Head of Research, @jjcmoreno.\n\n\n\nLink\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/dKyd5GJJdT pic.twitter.com/ECEWMpkf0g \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 16, 2023\n\nThe crypto market has, over the past week in particular, shown a wholehearted desire to buy into that narrative. Crypto media picked up on a social media post Oct. 16 saying the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application. The crypto market blew up. The price of Bitcoin soared nearly 10%, rising to around US$30,000 before falling back down to the US$28,000 range.\n\nThe news, it turned out, was fake. Regardless, there was around US$100 million in BTC liquidations in the first 30 minutes following the story. Cointelegraph, the media organization that first reported on the misleading post, issued a clarification statement apologizing for the error. But the damage \u2014 or the improvement, depending on which way you look at it \u2014 was done.\n\nWhether or not the original post was a legitimate attempt to manipulate the market or simply a prank gone too far, the fake news attracted a flood of interest and mainstream media attention to the ongoing ETF discussion.\n\nBlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, once a vocal skeptic of the crypto industry, appeared on a Fox Business broadcast, saying that the Bitcoin price rally to US$30,000 was more than just investors buying the rumor. Rather, he said, it was \u201can example of pent-up interest in crypto\u201d trading as a \u201cflight to quality\u201d during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nOn Monday, Oct. 23, as the market digested the likelihood the SEC would forgo an appeal on the Grayscale decision, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence highlighted that BlackRock had listed its spot Bitcoin ETF on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website.\n\nA bullish sign that the ETF could soon see approval from the SEC, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF specialist Eric Balchunas posted to X (formally Twitter) that this was \u201canother step in the process of launching.\u201d\n\nNote: Seeding is typically not a lot of money just enough to get ETF going. So I wouldn't read this as 'omg Blackrock is buying a ton of bitcoin' at all but more the fact they doing it and disclosing it shows another step in the process of launching. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 23, 2023\n\nRoad bumps\n\nWhile the road ahead for one, if not multiple spot Bitcoin ETF approvals appears to be growing smoother, there are potential road bumps ahead. For Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payment platform Mercuryo, the principal obstacle remains the potential for lawsuits against the SEC.\n\n\u201cIf the regulator were to accept the ongoing application from BlackRock, it may be criticized in the future over why it gave a green light for a large institutional player from the [traditional finance] sector while raising so much fuss over younger and smaller crypto projects,\u201d Berker said via a note.\n\nThe past 18 months in the crypto industry have been characterized by corporate failures and capital flight resulting in a two-thirds drop off in the value of a once US$3 trillion industry. From the perspective of many crypto advocates, much of those losses were caused by increased scrutiny and so-called \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d from the SEC and fellow regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe two regulators have sued a number of crypto firms throughout that period, including cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, alongside blockchain software firm Ripple. They have also prevented some cryptocurrency-related financial products such as a spot Bitcoin ETF from taking off. Finance professor Fang described the spate of lawsuits as part of an ongoing \u201cturf war\u201d between the two regulators as to who gets to regulate the crypto industry in future.\n\nThe lack of clarity on that issue, Fang said, adds to a number of other uncertainties hanging over crypto and potentially hampering the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Chief among those is the question of whether or not cryptocurrencies are securities.\n\n\u201cIf they are, then the SEC must regulate them as it regulates stocks and bonds, but I am not sure the SEC can or has resources to (even if it wants to),\u201d Fang wrote in an email. \u201cFor example, can the SEC demand all investors of Bitcoin be registered (the KYC rule)?\u201d\n\nWith regulators unwilling to adopt a particular position on those issues, Fang added, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF appears less like a silver bullet for the crypto industry and more like a stop-gap measure as the different regulators get their houses in order.\n\n\u201cI view a spot Bitcoin ETF as a bone that the SEC is willing to throw to the industry after taking a tough stance against many crypto exchanges,\u201d Fang said."

        "content": "Wall Street has had some big concerns about the stock market lately. A big move downward in major market benchmarks over the past several weeks has many investors wondering whether a new bear market might be just ahead.\n\nYet one long-struggling market appears to be getting itself back in shape. Cryptocurrencies have been down and out for quite a while as digital assets have gone through a fabled \"crypto winter.\" Now, though, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%) are seeing their prices climb back to their best levels in more than a year. That's also good news for the companies that rely on Bitcoin and its peers for their own success. Here's the latest on what's going on.\n\nBitcoin regains lost ground\n\nBitcoin made a major move higher Monday night and Tuesday morning. The value of Bitcoin is up nearly $4,000 in the past 24 hours, climbing 13% to around $34,675.\n\nMost of the excitement surrounding Bitcoin lately has come from efforts among institutional investors to provide an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will invest in the cryptocurrency to ordinary investors. Currently, investment vehicles that allow investors to get exposure to Bitcoin futures are available. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators have hesitated to allow ordinary investors to have access to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe latest step forward came from BlackRock's proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust. The proposed ETF filed an amended Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC that suggested that its initial seed capital investor would purchase fund shares at some point during the month of October. That move led Bitcoin enthusiasts to speculate that the ETF would commence operations within the next week, in turn suggesting that BlackRock anticipates favorable action from regulators.\n\nIf BlackRock is successful, it's likely to spur other companies that have sought to bring their own Bitcoin ETFs to market to get more aggressive in their efforts as well. The net result could be increased demand for the cryptocurrency that could further boost its price.\n\nBig gains for crypto stocks\n\nExcitement about Bitcoin inevitably draws interest to stocks that are connected with cryptocurrencies. Several categories of cryptocurrency stocks performed well early Tuesday.\n\nCrypto exchange stocks were clear winners. Coinbase Global (COIN -7.36%) rose more than 7% in premarket trading early Tuesday, adding to gains of about 3.5% from Monday's trading session. Coinbase in particular has sought to be the standard-bearer for cryptocurrency trading, but the long crypto winter has caused it to suffer significant losses. Robinhood Markets, which offered cryptocurrency as part of a broader range of investment assets, picked up a more modest 2% in premarket trading.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks also moved higher. Marathon Digital Holdings looked poised for its second straight double-digit percentage move higher, climbing 13% in the premarket session following a similar rise on Monday. Riot Platforms posted a 12% advance, bringing its total two-day gain to 22%. The math for these stocks is simple: If the Bitcoin that their operations produce is worth more, it means more in profit for the companies and their shareholders.\n\nIt's noteworthy, though, that other crypto tokens largely underperformed Bitcoin. Ethereum, for instance, was up just 9%, and some smaller digital assets saw even smaller gains. That doesn't mean that those Bitcoin alternatives won't catch up at some point, but it shows that crypto investors are focused most closely on the first mover in the space right now."

        "title": "These 4 Bitcoin Miners Are Absolutely Skyrocketing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This past 24 hours have been incredible for investors in Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%). The world's largest cryptocurrency surged from around $30,000 per token to break the $35,000 level in early morning trading Tuesday. As of 12:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin's price was hovering around the $34,000 level.\n\nThe crypto's surge appears to be tied to bullish sentiment building around the listing of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF product has reportedly been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database, under the ticker \"IBTC.\" This has led many investors to believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already capitulated in its fight against the formation of such ETFs. And that has crypto bulls expecting that a wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin will follow.\n\nAll of this has had ripple effects for Bitcoin miners, which are seeing strong price appreciation Tuesday. Shares of Canaan (CAN -6.57%), Marathon Digital (MARA -10.40%), Cleanspark (CLSK -10.64%), and Riot Platforms (RIOT -8.01%) had surged by 12.3%, 10.5%, 9.5%, and 9.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nInvestors are looking for ways to play Bitcoin's momentum\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in and of itself isn't really significant, in that Bitcoin miners and other publicly traded vehicles already exist as options for investors looking to play Bitcoin's volatility either to the upside or the downside. Indeed, many who follow and invest in the crypto sector often look to Bitcoin mining stocks as a way to trade Bitcoin volatility. These equities generally have good liquidity and also provide higher beta than the token itself. (In other words, when Bitcoin moves in either direction, Bitcoin miners tend to make larger percentage moves.)\n\nThat said, the long-awaited debut of a spot Bitcoin ETF will be important, as it opens the door to what could be an absolute wave of institutional investment into crypto. A surge in open interest for the CME's Bitcoin product surged above 100,000 Bitcoin Tuesday for the first time ever (a notional value of roughly $3.4 billion). That's impressive, and signals just how much institutional capital has been waiting on the sidelines for the right vehicle through which to invest in crypto.\n\nWill the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF diminish investors' interest in Bitcoin miners?\n\nOne question I've been pondering lately is whether a spot Bitcoin ETF could siphon off some investor demand for Bitcoin-adjacent stocks such as crypto miners, if investors (institutional or otherwise) view such an ETF as a more stable way to play the sector. I think this concept is directionally correct, though I do think Bitcoin mining stocks provide traders, speculators, and investors with another use case and purpose that's worth noting.\n\nSecuring the Bitcoin network and validating transactions on the blockchain is what Bitcoin miners do. One could argue that without these companies, Bitcoin's entire existence could be in jeopardy. Thus, with a Bitcoin halving event coming up next year, and other catalysts on the way that are expected to push Bitcoin's price higher, there are fundamental reasons for investors to hold these stocks, independent of a Bitcoin ETF launch.\n\nOverall, I think Bitcoin miners represent a unique option for investors looking to create a truly diversified portfolio. These higher-beta assets will tend to be much more volatile than crypto itself, though, and investors should be aware of this before jumping in. Tuesday's price action indicates just what investors can expect, and on rally days like this one, that means big gains."

        "content": "Volatility across the crypto derivatives market leaped to fresh local highs this week following a surge led by major blue chip asset bitcoin (BTC).\n\nA two-month period of relatively muted market activity had placed the world\u2019s largest digital asset in relative stasis, trading within a $2,000 range. But on Monday, the market sprang to life, with a 14% rise in the asset\u2019s price topping out at just above $35,000 on Tuesday.\n\nThat activity caused a flush of large leveraged short positions, creating a short squeeze \u2014 short sellers closing out their positions \u201cen mass\u201d \u2014 Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cOnly hindsight will be able to tell us if this rally actually has legs, but it feels like enthusiasm for bitcoin is starting to return,\u201d he said.\n\nOpen interest for bitcoin futures initially tanked on the back of those liquidations, wiping roughly $1 billion from the market. That has since retraced, indicating new contracts are being opened post-rally, according to Aditya Jalan, APAC trading manager at FalconX.\n\nInterestingly, open interest in listed BTC options on Deribit has increased to $13 billion and is now at the highest level in USD terms since the bull market of Q4 2021, Jalan said.\n\nBlockworks was told by several analysts that options trading tends to attract a more professional audience compared to futures trading, leading to fewer retail investors participating in this segment of the crypto market.\n\nConsequently, the incidence of liquidations and declines in open interest are less frequent in options trading compared to futures, crypto algorithmic trading firm Auros said.\n\nImplied volatility over a 30-day period for bitcoin options contracts shows the rally has also pushed the value to its highest point since the end of June, at just above 59%, data from T3\u2019s Bitcoin Volatility Index shows.\n\nTo put that into context, the index has only crossed over that level five times this year.\n\nContributing factors\n\nAccording to Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, the recent volatility in the crypto derivatives market can be attributed to a combination of factors.\n\n\u201cHistorically low cold coming into this week and favorable developments in spot BTC events combined to ignite a chase by some market makers to get longer gamma,\u201d Connors said.\n\nThis means that changes in market sentiment occurred more quickly than market makers could adjust their hedges, leading to a shift in open interest across different derivatives vehicles, he said.\n\nConnors emphasized these factors contributed to the surge in BTC price but were not the primary driver behind it.\n\n\u201cWe do not think the options positions drove the spike to $35,000, rather they augmented the move somewhat,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same time, BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin ETF, carrying the ticker IBTC, reappeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation website after disappearing early on Tuesday.\n\nThe initial listing on the Depository website was attributed by analysts as a catalyst for continued bullish fervor surrounding a potential greenlight of a US bitcoin ETF in the year ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "At last, bitcoin has broken out of a tight trading range, potentially heralding greater highs from here. After oscillating between $25,000 and $30,000 for most of the year, touching the top end several times and stepping out of it briefly at one point in July, the flagship cryptocurrency shot up to $35,000 late Monday . Bitcoin sat just below that threshold for much of the trading day Tuesday. Investors should expect higher lows and higher highs in the bitcoin price over the next few months, chart analysts say. \"The strong rise in the price of bitcoin is indicated by its daily relative strength index reaching above 80 for the first time since January,\" Ari Wald, a technical analyst at Oppenheimer, told CNBC. \"Although typically viewed as an overbought condition, it's also an indication that price is still accelerating.\" \"This characterizes a trend that should continue, rather than reverse, as it did in January 2023,\" he added. \"This doesn't mean that trend will continue in a straight line higher either, but it does indicate pullbacks should provide tactical opportunities for purchase, similar to the test of the 200-day average in March 2023.\" Wald said he's eyeing the 200-day moving average of $28,000 as a potential new support level while bitcoin runs into key retracement levels of its 2021-22 decline. Many chart analysts considered the previous support level to be about $25,000. If bitcoin can clear the $32,000 level, that would open the door for it to reach the $38,000 to $40,000 range, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG. For Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, bitcoin's former resistance level of roughly $31,000 could now become support, with the next resistance level ranging as high as $47,000 to $48,000. \"All selling activity in the $31,000 area has now been exhausted, there is no supply left, and buyers are getting very aggressive, which is pushing the price up,\" de Kempenaer said. \"The tables have now turned, and risk/reward is getting back in favor of bitcoin.\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has issued an order requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to reconsider Grayscale Investments\u2019 application to register a bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the New York Stock Exchange Arca, confirming the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal the circuit court\u2019s August ruling in Grayscale v. SEC.\n\nIn August, the D.C. Circuit held that the SEC\u2019s denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\u201d The similar products were two bitcoin futures ETFs that were listed, with the SEC\u2019s approval, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one from Teucrium Trading and the other from Valkyrie Funds.\n\nThe decision held that the ETF proposed by Grayscale was a very similar product\u2014an ETF in the Bitcoin spot market\u2014to the two previously-approved products\u2014both ETFs in the futures market\u2014and that Grayscale\u2019s ETF had a manipulation surveillance agreement with the CME similar to the one the futures ETFs had. Therefore, the D.C. Circuit held, denying one and approving the others, absent further argument, was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for the SEC to appeal the August ruling was October 13, and the appeals court advanced a formal order on Monday to comply with the ruling.\n\nThe ruling has significant implications for 12 outstanding bitcoin exchange-traded products currently being considered by the SEC, managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investment and VanEck.\n\nThe first deadlines for these ETFs are January 10, 2024, and they will likely be approved together, according to Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital, a crypto hedge fund: \u201cConsensus is that the SEC is going to approve these.\u201d\n\nSilberberg says the \u201cSEC has continued to not give clarity\u201d on \u201cwhich digital assets are commodities and which are securities,\u201d a complaint echoed by many supporters of the cryptocurrency industry in Congress.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has rejected making a formal rule on the issue, instead saying that current laws are clear enough to take enforcement action. Gensler has indicated, while speaking in public settings, that he believes Bitcoin to be a commodity, not a security, though exchanges regulated by the SEC must still seek approval to list a bitcoin ETF. Specifically, Gensler has said that all cryptocurrencies are securities, except for Bitcoin and possibly Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, including Bitcoin, has raised still unanswered questions about which federal regulator, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, should be the primary regulator. This case does not address that question.\n\nSilberberg says he expects \u201csmall allocations from large institutions into bitcoin.\u201d He argues that digital assets can be highly non-correlative with other assets and can be a useful hedge strategy that \u201cwould serve any portfolio.\u201d\n\nTags: Bitcoin, CME, Crypto, digital asset, NYSE, SEC"

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin (BTC) Moving Up? | Markets Insider - Markets Insider",
        "content": "The recent rally in Bitcoin's price over the last week can be attributed to several factors:\n\nOptimism Around Bitcoin ETF Approval:\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), have experienced a boost due to optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US\u200b.\n\nThe speculation around the Bitcoin ETF has been building up, with a notable instance on October 16th when a false news report regarding the approval of a Blackrock ETF led to a brief price jump.\n\nFinancial institutions are showing increased interest in providing access to Bitcoin investing to their clients through ETFs. The expectation of a fully-fledged Bitcoin ETF in the US has significantly ramped up, with several asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Analysts believe that the approval of such ETFs could lead to a substantial inflow of capital into the Bitcoin market, potentially boosting its price significantly\u200b.\n\nStatements from Influential Figures:\n\nA CEO managing $9 trillion in assets mentioned that this rally is just the beginning, indicating a belief in continued capital flow into the cryptocurrency market, which can instill confidence among investors.\n\nTechnical Factors:\n\nThere was a mention of Bitcoin breaking through the $30,000 barrier for the first time since mid-August, which could be considered a technical breakout, possibly triggering buying activity from traders and investors following technical analysis strategies.\n\nFurther Speculation:\n\nAccording to a recent Cointelegraph article, the proposed iShares spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock has recently been registered on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), hinting at a possible nod from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On Oct. 23, in a thread on X (previously known as Twitter), Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas mentioned that the DTCC registration is a step forward in the journey of launching a crypto ETF. The iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, with a ticker identifier of IBTC, could potentially make its way to the Nasdaq stock exchange, following an application for listing and trading shares of this investment tool back in June.\n\nEric Balchunas stated: \u201cThis is [the] first spot ETF listed on DTCC, none of the others on there (yet),\u201d said Balchunas. \u201cDef notable BlackRock is leading charge on these logistics (seeding, ticker, dtcc) that tend to happen just prior to launch. Hard not to view this as them getting a signal that approval is certain/imminent.\u201d\n\nBalchunas theorized that BlackRock might have attained preliminary approval for the ETF listing from the SEC, or is orchestrating all prerequisites under that assumption. Given the timeline of BlackRock's submission, the SEC has a deadline of Jan. 10, 2024, to finalize their verdict on whether to approve or reject the ETF.\n\nUS Court Puts Pressure on The SEC:\n\nThe US Court's decision regarding Grayscale's bid for a spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) has indeed made a notable impact in the cryptocurrency sphere, especially on the price of Bitcoin. Here's a breakdown of the events and their implications:\n\nCourt's Ruling:\n\nOn Monday October 23, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals resolved a dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale, ordering the SEC to reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF\u200b.\n\nThis ruling was celebrated as a significant win for Grayscale as it nudged the SEC to reevaluate its stance, which was deemed \"arbitrary and capricious\" in the initial rejection of Grayscale's attempt.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin Price:\n\nFollowing the court's mandate in August, Bitcoin's price briefly surged by 10%, showcasing a positive reaction from the market.\n\nOn a specific day post-ruling, Bitcoin's price spiked roughly 6%, reaching its highest level since August 17.\n\nThe legal tussle and its outcomes were closely watched by investors, as the SEC's initial rejection had led to a price dip of around 12%, pushing Bitcoin's price below $20,000. The optimistic outlook is that listing GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) as an ETF could increase Bitcoin demand, thereby potentially boosting its price further\u200b.\n\nFuture Implications:\n\nThe court's decision not only bodes well for Grayscale but also sets a precedent for other asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, who have similar applications pending with the SEC.\n\nGrayscale expressed its readiness and eagerness to work constructively with the SEC to expedite the process of converting GBTC to an ETF, which reflects a positive stride towards mainstream acceptance and regulatory compliance in the crypto sector\u200b.\n\nShould You Buy Bitcoin Now?\n\nPlease read this 1st: I am not a financial advisor, and the information provided herein is purely for entertainment purposes.

Remember, investing and trading involve risks, and you should only invest money that you can afford to lose.\n\nConsidering the recent market dynamics, regulatory advancements, and technical factors surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), the potential decision to invest or trade in Bitcoin could vary greatly depending on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the given facts and current market conditions:\n\nOpinion on Buying BTC Now:\n\nThe current atmosphere seems cautiously optimistic with the anticipation around Bitcoin ETF approval and positive technical breakouts. However, investing in Bitcoin remains a high-risk, high-reward venture due to its historical volatility and regulatory uncertainties.\n\nSupporting Arguments:\n\nRegulatory Progress: The recent court ruling favoring Grayscale's bid for a Bitcoin ETF is a positive sign, potentially paving the way for more institutional investment and broader acceptance. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin ETFs could lead to an influx of capital, which may drive the price higher.\n\nInfluential Statements: Prominent figures envisioning a bullish future for Bitcoin could instill confidence among investors.\n\nTechnical Breakout: Crossing the $30,000 mark might trigger buying activities from technical traders.\n\n\n\nHowever, unpredictability in regulatory decisions and market reactions can lead to significant price swings.\n\nAggressive Strategy:\n\nTrading: Entry Point: Buy BTC now anticipating further bullish momentum driven by ETF optimism and technical factors. Exit Point: Set a high target price for selling, perhaps near its previous all-time highs, or utilize trailing stop losses to capture gains while protecting downside. Risk Management: Allocate a portion of the portfolio to BTC but be ready for high volatility.\n\nInvesting: Long-Term Holding: Buy and hold BTC with a multi-year horizon expecting mainstream adoption to drive prices up substantially. Diversification: Diversify with other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets to mitigate risk.\n\n\n\nConservative Strategy:\n\nTrading: Entry Point: Await clearer regulatory clarity or a more stable price trend before entering. Exit Point: Set a modest profit target or a tight stop loss to manage risks. Risk Management: Only allocate a small portion of the portfolio to BTC and consider using options for downside protection.\n\nInvesting: Long-Term Holding: If buying, consider a long-term horizon but with a smaller portfolio allocation. Diversification: Broadly diversify across asset classes to mitigate the inherent risks of BTC.\n\n\n\nThe outlined strategies underline the importance of adept risk management, diversified asset allocation, and staying abreast of regulatory and market developments when navigating the intricate and volatile terrain of Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency markets.

        "content": "Every country has a different environmental bitcoin mining footprint, largely depending on its energy sources. China and the United States have the largest bitcoin mining footprints, a new United Nations-led study reveals\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union\n\n24 October 2023\n\nAGU Release No. 23-39\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nThis press release and accompanying multimedia are available online at: https://news.agu.org/press-release/bitcoin-mining-has-very-worrying-impacts-on-land-and-water-not-only-carbon/\n\nAGU press contact:\n\nRebecca Dzombak, news@agu.org (UTC-4 hours)\n\nContact information for the researchers:\n\nKaveh Madani, United Nations University, madani@unu.edu (UTC-4 hours)\n\nBy the numbers, global bitcoin mining in 2020-2021:\n\nUsed 173 terawatt hours of electricity (more than most nations)\n\nEmitted 86 megatons of carbon (like burning 8.5 billion pounds of coal)\n\nRequired 1.65 cubic kilometers of water (more than the domestic use of 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa)\n\nAffected 1,870 square kilometers of land (1.4 times the size of Los Angeles)\n\nGot 67% of its energy from fossil fuels, with coal contributing 45%\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have grown in market share, they\u2019ve been criticized for their heavy carbon footprint: Cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive endeavor. Mining has massive water and land footprints as well, according to a new study that is the first to detail country-by-country environmental impacts of bitcoin mining. It serves as the foundation for a new United Nations (UN) report on bitcoin mining, also published today.\n\nThe study reveals how each country\u2019s mix of energy sources defines the environmental footprint of its bitcoin mining and highlights the top 10 countries for energy, carbon, water and land use. The work was published in Earth\u2019s Future, which publishes interdisciplinary research on the past, present and future of our planet and its inhabitants.\n\n\u201cA lot of our exciting new technologies have hidden costs we don\u2019t realize at the onset,\u201d said Kaveh Madani, a Director at United Nations University who led the new study. \u201cWe introduce something, it gets adopted, and only then do we realize that there are consequences.\u201d\n\nMadani and his co-authors used energy, carbon, water and land use data from 2020 to 2021 to calculate country-specific environmental impacts for 76 countries known to mine bitcoin. They focused on bitcoin because it\u2019s older, popular and more well-established/widely used than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMadani said the results were \u201cvery interesting and very concerning,\u201d in part because demand is rising so quickly. But even with more energy-efficient mining approaches, if demand continues to grow, so too will mining\u2019s environmental footprints, he said.\n\nElectricity and carbon\n\nIf bitcoin mining were a country, it would be ranked 27th in energy use globally. Overall, bitcoin mining consumed about 173 terawatt hours of electricity in the two years from January 2020 to December 2021, about 60% more than the energy used for bitcoin mining in 2018-2019, the study found. Bitcoin mining emitted about 86 megatons of carbon, largely because of the dominance of fossil fuel-based energy in bitcoin-mining countries.\n\nThe environmental impact of bitcoin mining fluctuates along with energy supply and demand in a country. When energy is inexpensive, the profitability of mining bitcoin goes up. But when energy is expensive, the value of bitcoin must be high enough to make the cost of mining worth it to the miner, whether it\u2019s an individual, a company or a government.\n\nChina, the U.S. and Kazakhstan had the largest energy and carbon footprints in 2020-2021.\n\nWater\n\nGlobally, bitcoin mining used 1.65 million liters (about 426,000 gallons) of water in 2020-2021, enough to fill more than 660,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. China, the U.S. and Canada had the largest water footprints. Kazakhstan and Iran, which along with the U.S. and China have suffered from water shortages, were also in the top-10 list for water footprint.\n\n\u201cThese are very, very worrying numbers,\u201d Madani said. \u201cEven hydropower, which some countries consider a clean source of renewable energy, has a huge footprint.\u201d\n\nLand use\n\nThe study analyzed land use by considering the area of land affected to produce energy for mining. The land footprint of server farms is negligible, Kaveh said. The global land use footprint of bitcoin mining is 1,870 square kilometers (722 square miles), with China\u2019s footprint alone taking up 913 square kilometers (353 square miles). The U.S.\u2019 land footprint is 303 square kilometers (117 square miles), and likely growing while China\u2019s is shrinking.\n\nMost impacted countries\n\nChina and the United States, which have two of the largest economies and populations in the world, take the top two spots across all environmental factors. A mix of other countries make up the other 8 spots in the top 10. Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Iran and Thailand \u2014 countries to which servers are outsourced and, in some cases, where cryptocurrency mining is subsidized by the government \u2014 appear as well. Canada, Germany and Russia have some of the largest footprints across all categories. Each country engaged in large-scale bitcoin mining affects countries around the world by their carbon emissions, Kaveh noted.\n\nBut the benefits of bitcoin mining may not accrue to the country, or the individuals, doing the work. Cryptocurrency mining is an extractive and, by design, difficult to trace process, so geographic distribution of environmental impacts cannot be assumed to be a map of the biggest digital asset owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know exactly who is benefiting from this,\u201d Madani said. \u201cThe issue now is who is suffering from this.\u201d\n\nAlready, some countries have potentially seen their resources impacted by cryptocurrency mining. In 2021, Iran faced blackouts. The government blamed bitcoin mining for excessively draining hydropower during a drought and periodically banned the practice.\n\nChina in June 2021 banned bitcoin mining and transactions in the country; other countries, such as the U.S. and Kazakhstan, have taken up the slack and had their shares in bitcoin increase by 34% and 10%, respectively.\n\nMadani said the study is not meant to indict bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining. \u201cWe\u2019re getting used to these technologies, and they have hidden costs we don\u2019t realize,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to inform people and industries about what these costs might be before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nNotes for journalists:\n\nThis study is published in Earth\u2019s Future, an open-access journal.

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies Destined to Be the Next Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a phenomenal success story. The numbers behind it are truly eye-popping. For example, between 2010 and 2022 Bitcoin provided average annual returns of 1,576% and a total return of 18,7912%.\n\nIts market capitalization of $602 billion accounts for approximately 60% of the total capital in the entire cryptocurrency market. Despite some spectacular scams, crypto is here to stay and many incredible projects that will solve real problems are currently being built.\n\nThus, crypto investors are bound to continue to search for \u201cthe next Bitcoin.\u201d To find those returns look for utility and integration into the wider financial system. That\u2019s the key.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQuant (QNT-USD)\n\nThe logo for the Quant cryptocurrency network is displayed in white on a black background.\n\nSource: Zeedign.com / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuant (QNT-USD) has defined utility as the focal point of its development. It is working to facilitate interoperability between multiple blockchains. In essence, Quant connects individual blockchains through decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are Web 3.0 apps in a sense and allow users to interface with blockchains. Quant is facilitating a big idea that\u2019s difficult to fathom completely but remains one that is hugely important nonetheless.\n\nAnother thing to note about Quant and the other cryptos listed below is that all are ISO 20022 compliant. ISO 20022 is a global standardization body that governs commercial and industrial standards. In this case, those related to financial system integration. By 2025, all financial institutions must be able to process ISO compliant payment transactions. Quant is going to be mainstream and investors should realize that and act accordingly.\n\nInteroperability is the name of the game. Cryptocurrency is still in its Wild West phase but ISO 20022 compliance and integration will bring those that meet the standard into the mainstream of finance.\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD)\n\nConcept tokens for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) on a black keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD) has established an important first-mover advantage that makes it part of the conversation to identify the next Bitcoin. It has become deeply associated with enterprise utility. Corporations moved into crypto during the pandemic to varying degrees and continue to integrate crypto today. Hedera is among the first names that enterprises will think of as crypto opportunities increase. When it comes time to add functionality, Hedera has that opportunity because it laid the groundwork.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also ISO 20022 compliant which only strengthens that narrative. Larger financial institutions are developing crypto businesses in house. Hedera may not have a great opportunity to break into those enterprises. However, SMEs don\u2019t have as many resources as the big banks do. Sooner or later, they\u2019re going to seek crypto integration and functionality en masse. That is among the best reasons to invest in Hedera overall. The project is preparing for fintech opportunities that are being established by the day. Hedera\u2019s ISO 20022 compliance is a crystal clear example of its goals and direction and shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nCardano crypto logo\n\nSource: RuskaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) has also ticked the ISO 20022 compliance box. Cardano is being developed with the goal of long-term success as its primary purpose. Long-term success means a reliance on computer science and empirical evidence to guide its development. Unsexy stuff at its heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cardano doesn\u2019t get much attention overall. It\u2019s the polar opposite of meme coin nonsense and aims to build utility first and foremost.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine that the developers at Cardano understand that the game is really about wider integration. Cardano, and any other long-term winners, are going to win by being part of the evolution of money. That means development ultimately is evolution and integration into the financial system, not a wholesale replacing of the financial system. I\u2019m sure that the empirical evidence draws similar conclusions. Cardano is sure to listen and that\u2019s why it\u2019s got a great chance of winning in the long term.\n\nIt may not exactly fit the ideal frame of \u201cthe next Bitcoin\u201d in that Cardano\u2019s value can\u2019t realistically increase to $28k. It currently trades for less than 30 cents. However, it does have the potential to grow over the next decade like Bitcoin did from 2010-2020.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The price of bitcoin has always been a closely monitored datapoint in the world of digital currencies given that it\u2019s pretty much the touchstone for cryptocurrencies. And this week, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price shot above $34,500 per token, further cementing its position at the top of the pile.\n\nAt the time of publication, one bitcoin was worth around $34,800, up 23.4% on the week and 109% from $16,625 at the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap. On Monday, the cryptocurrency almost reached $35,000, marking its highest price since May 2022, when the Terra/LUNA collapse led to a sharp decline in the value of most digital tokens.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price had been rising \u201cvery smoothly for eight weeks, suggesting an accumulation phase, and early last week, it fired off several important bull market transition signals at once,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, told TechCrunch+. \u201cThese signals provided an opportunity to break through the 50-day moving average . . . These bullish victories attract a wide range of investors and traders to focus on these signals.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is cheering these gains, though. The recent run has been the \u201cperfect storm\u201d for market participants who have been shorting bitcoin, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, said.\n\nWhat is driving the hike?\n\nThe primary driver of this week\u2019s price moves has been the anticipation and \u201chigh likelihood of the approval\u201d of a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nThere has been ample market speculation around a possible bitcoin spot ETF and the potential such a fund holds for unlocking new demand for bitcoin itself. More demand could lead to rising prices since the supply of bitcoin is limited, and some traders may be working to get ahead of any future value gains.\n\nMany traditional financial players aren\u2019t allowed to trade spot market cryptocurrencies yet, due to regulation and compliance matters. So they do it through other regulated products like bitcoin futures.\n\nThere is a belief that a bitcoin spot ETF will allow for much pent-up institutional interest to flow in through these ETFs, Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at crypto ETP provider ETC Group, said. \u201cThis will put upward pressure on the price of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nStill, the road to a bitcoin spot ETF has been bumpy. Last week, a false report surfaced of BlackRock\u2019s ETF application being approved, which caused a slight pump in the value of bitcoin.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears NASDAQ trades. While this seemed like a new development (and helped drive bullish sentiment), the ticket has actually been posted on DTCC since August; most people just didn\u2019t notice it until recently.\n\nOn Monday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals closed the June 2022 suit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and digital asset manager Grayscale, with a final ruling that ordered the government agency to rescind its rejection of the firm\u2019s bitcoin spot ETF application. The court of appeals had ruled in favor of Grayscale back in August, calling the SEC\u2019s denial of the product \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, the ETF futures trading volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going up as a result of investors betting on the spot ETF being approved.\n\nThere are other factors at play, too\n\nWhile a potential bitcoin spot ETF is the most obvious factor driving up the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, there\u2019s more going on here. Some traders anticipate bitcoin\u2019s price to increase in line with historical patterns leading up to bitcoin halving, which happens roughly every four years and is due in about late April 2024.\n\nThe institutional market has also increasingly been accepting of bitcoin \u2014 outside of pending spot ETF approvals. Earlier this week, FTSE Russell launched a joint crypto index business with Grayscale to help grow institutional education and adoption in the space, Fiona Bassett, CEO of FTSE Russell, and Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, shared at a private dinner on Monday that TechCrunch+ attended.\n\nStill, all this excitement around bitcoin spot ETFs is somewhat reminiscent of what happened in 2017, when the expansion of crypto products and services to institutions did not translate into a price spike, Kuptsikevich said. \u201cAnd now, it could be that the influx of new money into cryptocurrencies from launching a new instrument is overrated, and many companies interested in bitcoin already have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market positioning \u2014 a lot of outright shorts coupled with a lot of negative gamma \u2014 was a big contributor to this [moving] higher in price,\u201d Glover said.\n\nIn simple terms, negative gamma is a result of traders selling options. As the spot bitcoin price moves higher, those with negative gamma will be forced to buy bitcoin to hedge themselves, and those who don\u2019t will be liquidated on an exchange, Glover added.\n\n\u201cOnce the market began to recognize the size of positions of those who are outright short or had negative gamma, we started to see sustained buying in the market,\u201d Glover said. \u201cThis was exacerbated by the retail participants coming back in as the posts of the likelihood of a sooner-rather-than-later approval for all of these BTC ETFs started hitting the market.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\nAs with any asset class, it is always hard to know what is simply short-term bullish sentiment or a sustainable bull run, Duke said. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d\n\nBut any time the market has moved upward sharply, some retracement is likely, Silberberg said. \u201cThat remains true in this case. However, we expect to continue to see higher lows during price fluctuations, as overall market enthusiasm has increased.\u201d\n\nIn the near term, market players think bitcoin\u2019s price is likely to retract within the next week or two, unless more bullish news comes out regarding spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing people say that this is the beginning of the bullish cycle,\u201d Glover said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a bull cycle since November of last year, when BTC hit sub-$16K. This is just the next leg up in the cycle.\u201d\n\nGlover believes this upward movement is sustainable given the recent historical data over the past 11 months, and expects bitcoin to hit $45,000 in the coming months based on his weekly technical analysis. Still, he noted that \u201cmarkets never move in a straight line and we will see pullbacks in the price action.\u201d\n\nRust feels this is the beginning of a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d that will give the market a signal to move on from the prolonged winter it has been foundering in."

        "content": "Bitcoin has risen over 110% in 2023 at the time of writing, where the price of the asset started the year off at $16,677 on January 1, has now pumped to above $35,000 only 10 months later. With more room to run this year as hype builds in the market around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the upcoming halving event, many are now questioning if this is the end of this cycle's eventful bear market.\n\nSince the few disastrous incidents that happened in the bear market causing the price drop, things are now looking more optimistic. As some of the worlds largest asset managers, including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree, have filed in hopes to be the first in the United States to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. One name in particular though is making more headlines than the rest, and that is the worlds largest asset manger BlackRock, who manages about $10 trillion.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently made an appearance on Fox Business stating that their clients around the world are interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin, saying the recent price rally has been a \"flight to quality.\" Earlier this month, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC to 90% by January 10, 2024.\n\nThe next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in roughly 180 days in late April, 2024. The event will see the Bitcoin block reward drop from 6.25 BTC per block to only 3.125 BTC. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, with the first happening in November 2012, the second happened in July 2016, and the third happened in May 2020. Historically, a year leading up to and after the halving, the price of BTC goes up substantially.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Rallied Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The prices of several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Tuesday amid increased speculation over the imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC -2.41%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of the regular markets' close on Tuesday, Bitcoin was up more than 9%, Ethereum (ETH -2.96%) had gained nearly 7%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.64%) had risen 5.5%.\n\nFresh signs of the first spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\n\nLate Monday, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on social media platform X that BlackRock's (BLK -2.09%) iShares Bitcoin Trust had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website (the organization that clears all Nasdaq trades) with the planned ticker symbol IBTC. The news subsequently garnered so much attention that the DTCC website briefly crashed due to overwhelming traffic.\n\nIndeed, Tuesday's optimism followed a significant rally in cryptocurrency prices last week, which was spurred by the SEC's reported decision not to appeal a federal court's August reversal of its order preventing crypto asset manager Grayscale from converting its widely popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -3.48%) into an ETF.\n\nSure enough, late Monday the D.C. Circuit of Appeals formalized Grayscale's court win over the SEC, indicating no appeal was filed and putting the onus back on the SEC to move forward with its approval process. The court described the SEC's order preventing Grayscale from converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF -- while simultaneously allowing bitcoin futures funds to launch -- \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\n\"This is pretty much checking every box that you need to check before you launch an ETF,\" Balchunas added, noting the timing of the ticker's appearance on the site was \"surprising\" considering any formal approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC was widely expected to happen sometime over the next several weeks.\n\nWhy the first Bitcoin ETFs are likely still several weeks away\n\nYou shouldn't hold your breath waiting for an imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. Eagle-eyed investors noticed early Tuesday that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust was no longer present on the DTCC's list this morning -- a change Balchunas speculated may have happened after BlackRock was \"told to or want[ed] to wait until they are days, not weeks or months away\" from the SEC's formal approval.\n\nIt's hard to blame BlackRock, of course, for ensuring all the pieces are in place to move forward as soon as that approval hits the wires. For perspective, the SEC's final deadline to respond to BlackRock's application is March 15, 2024. According to a research report released last week by JPMorgan, however, the first approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs will most likely arrive before January 10, 2024 -- the final deadline by which the SEC is required to respond to ARK Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF. At that time -- rather than responding to individual applications separately over the course of several months -- the SEC will most likely approve multiple applications at once to level the playing field and prevent any single bitcoin ETF from gaining a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage.\n\nSo why is this a big deal for cryptocurrencies in general? Exchange-traded funds are a much more investor-friendly medium compared to creating separate investment accounts through cryptocurrency trading firms, enabling people to buy and sell shares throughout each trading day through any brokerage firm. Any approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would significantly broaden investors' access to cryptocurrencies as a widely accepted asset class and source of portfolio diversification.\n\nAs a result, tens of billions of dollars of incremental liquidity would almost certainly flow into cryptocurrencies in short order, likely driving prices even higher in the near term. According to a report from data analytics firm CryptoQuant last week, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization could ultimately increase by a total of more than $1 trillion after Bitcoin ETFs are approved and become mainstream.\n\nIn any case, it now seems a matter of if, not when we see the SEC finally give its stamp of approval to the first Bitcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency investors are rightly enthused by the news."

        "content": "Matrixport, a cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Bitmain co-founder Wu Jihan, has doubled down on its prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $45,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAfter first setting its 2023 year-end BTC price target at $45,000 in early 2023, Matrixport reiterated its bold Bitcoin prediction in a blog post on Oct. 24.\n\nTitled \u201cBitcoin Targets $45,000 \u2014 FOMO Is Hitting the Market,\u201d the blog post provides a brief analysis of Matrixport\u2019s previous market forecasts, noting that the firm successfully predicted several market events.\n\nMatrixport specifically cited its \u201cOctober Ignites a Bitcoin Boom: Institutions Fueling the Price Surge\u201d report from September 2023, which has so far successfully predicted significant action on the Bitcoin market in October.\n\nThe firm predicted that October would be a strong month for Bitcoin due to excitement around potential approvals of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). The firm also pointed out that October has historically been the strongest month for Bitcoin, with average returns of 20%.\n\nRelated: Galaxy predicts 74% Bitcoin price increase first year after ETF launch\n\nAfter starting October at around $27,000, Bitcoin briefly touched $35,000 on Oct. 24, hitting 17-month highs and triggering the fear of missing out among investors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $34,396, up 27% from its price on Oct. 1, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nIn the report, Matrixport also emphasized that Bitcoin\u2019s breakout above July\u2019s $31,500 shows that $45,000 is achievable by year-end, adding:\n\n\u201cWhile our prediction might have been bold, our analysis is based on a proven investment process that has been incredibly successful this year.\u201d\n\nMatrixport first mentioned the $45,000 Bitcoin prediction in its bullish 2023 report published in January 2023. \u201cThere is a high statistical probability that Bitcoin prices could double from here until year end. This could bring Bitcoin prices to $45,000 by Christmas 2023,\u201d the firm wrote at the time.\n\nSome analysts haven\u2019t been too optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2023, though. In December 2022, Standard\u2019s Chartered global research head and chief strategist predicted that Bitcoin would drop to as low as $5,000 in 2023. Bitcoin\u2019s lowest value so far this year was about $16,600.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives \u2014 Mt. Gox collapse saw birth of Chainalysis"

This comes as Bitcoin surged past $35,000 momentarily, for the first time since May last year. Excitement surrounding the potential approval of the ETFs likely triggered the spike, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ticker reportedly listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nThe biggest sources of these inflows were Germany and Canada, with Germany's ETC Group receiving $24.3 million and Canada's Purpose Investments receiving $10.9 million. In addition, 21Shares AG took about $11.8 million.

Allen's tweet has since become a symbol of how the cryptocurrency has defied expectations and evolved into a mainstream asset class.\n\nAllen's responded to the post in 2021, at a time when Bitcoin was down from $60,000 all-time highs.\n\nNick Allen, who has an extensive background in the gaming and esports industry, may not have anticipated the extraordinary growth of Bitcoin when he posted his tweet, but the incredible price increase highlights the digital currency's journey and the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment vehicle.\n\nStill, as recent news stories show, Allen is not alone when it comes to believing Bitcoin is a fad whose best days are behind it. While some are excited about the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, there has been a continued barrage of news stories in the wake of the FTX trial that take a similar tone.\n\nIn this way, Allen's tweet may serve as a reminder that Bitcoin has a history of defying its doubters \u2013 and rewarding its investors.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Beware the Bitcoin Rally: Short Squeeze and Excitement Not Enough for Bull Cycle - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin jumped by 125% from its November 21 low.\n\nBTC has a short-term potential for further gains below $40,000.\n\nOn-chain figures don\u2019t suggest a high demand.\n\nA larger descending move could soon occur.\n\nContrary to widespread predictions, Bitcoin surprised the market on Monday, October 23, surging to $35,200, marking a remarkable 33% increase from its October 12 low of $26,570.\n\nThis unexpected surge set off a chain reaction in the cryptocurrency market, driving altcoins like LINK, AAVE, BSV, and INJ to even more impressive gains from their October lows. Our recent analysis of Bitcoin explored potential catalysts for this surge.\n\nWhile undeniable fundamental factors are at play, such as mounting anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF and hint at its imminent reality, the true drivers behind these price spikes seem to be two short-squeeze events.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to grasp the dynamics of altcoin valuations. Their USD values are primarily linked to their BTC equivalents since most altcoins are primarily traded against BTC and ETH on exchanges. This means that even though it may seem like all altcoins are surging, their USD values essentially rise in sync with Bitcoin\u2019s ascent.\n\nIn light of this context \u2013 a short-squeeze indicating predominantly bearish market sentiment and the altcoin rally largely mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price movement \u2013 it prompts the question: How reliable is this rally?\n\nBitcoin On-chain data\n\nWhen assessing the on-chain demand for Bitcoin, it\u2019s crucial to take into account the quantity of Bitcoin held on exchanges, as this can offer valuable insights into accumulation patterns.\n\nOn-Chain Demand Analysis:\n\nThe chart illustrating Bitcoin holdings on exchanges has displayed a consistent downtrend since its peak in June, persisting throughout the year. Nonetheless, when viewed alongside recent developments and past occasions when Bitcoin\u2019s price surged, the decrease in supply seems relatively modest.\n\nStarting from October 13, when the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges peaked at 2,056,000, it gradually decreased to 2,018,000 by October 19, indicating a relatively minor decline of just 38,000 BTC. Notably, this decrease preceded the recent price surge. Interestingly, as the price began its ascent, the number of Bitcoins on exchanges began to rise once more. This trend implies that investors might be transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges, possibly with the intent to capitalize on the rising prices and secure their profits. The growing deposits may indicate a willingness among some investors to sell, particularly if they anticipate a potential price correction following the parabolic increase.\n\nSupply Side Analysis \u2013 Miners\n\nShifting our focus to the supply side, miners hold a central role. The Miner Position Index (MPI) offers valuable insights into their actions. Elevated MPI values signal substantial Bitcoin deposits by miners on exchanges, often signaling a potential intention to sell. By analyzing the MPI, we can assess whether miners aim to take advantage of current price levels or are maintaining their Bitcoin, anticipating further price appreciation.\n\nIn conclusion, while on-chain metrics offer valuable insights into market behavior, it\u2019s essential to consider them alongside other indicators and the broader market sentiment to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential price movements. A distinct upward trend becomes evident when smoothing the chart with a 7-day moving average, starting from September 9, with a temporary dip to $25,000. This upward trend persisted for the most part of the price rise from Monday, suggesting that miners have been exerting pressure on the price. Distinguished crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X on potential future price targets for Bitcoin.\n\n#Bitcoin built a massive support barrier between $25,000 and $30,000. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model now suggests the next two critical areas of resistance for $BTC are $38,440 and $47,360! pic.twitter.com/tdgdYYiMnW \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 24, 2023\n\nHe highlighted a robust support region between $25,000 and $30,000, backed by the creation of a substantial number of UTXOs at that price range. \u201cThese bars represent the quantity of existing bitcoins that last moved within the specified price bucket.\u201d He interprets this UTXO distribution as a support zone, indicating that investors who purchased at these levels are unlikely to sell below them, expecting higher prices. This is why he identifies the next resistance zone at approximately $38,440. It\u2019s worth noting that these tall bars could be misleading because they represent the quantity of UTXOs rather than the number of coins, i.e., volume.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nWhen analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s price chart, it becomes evident that there is still potential for further upside. The recent uptrend that began on October 12 has been shaping a five-wave pattern, with the current upswing representing its wave 3.\n\nThe current path implies that a modest higher high may soon occur, signifying the culmination of this particular upward move. This will likely be followed by a retracement, indicating the end of wave 4, and another anticipated surge leading to wave 5. The target for this surge could hover just below the $40,000 threshold, aligning with significant horizontal resistance, as emphasized by analyst Ali Martinez\u2019s UTXO distribution resistance. However, considering that this may mark the final wave of a higher-degree trend originating on November 21, a more substantial downturn is on the horizon. If this indeed marks the beginning of a new bull cycle after a prolonged period of declining prices, the next critical milestone would be establishing the initial higher low of the bull market. This is likely to take the form of an ABC correction, representing wave 2 of a higher degree. Ideally, this correction should remain above the $25,000 level. Should the price approach the anticipated peak of around $40,000 and then experience a 38% decline, it could potentially shake the confidence of short-term investors, prompting a reassessment of their positions.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the recent upswing in Bitcoin\u2019s price is undoubtedly bullish, several factors must align before we can confidently proclaim the beginning of a new bull cycle. While catalysts like the anticipated Bitcoin ETF and the short-squeeze have played a role in the current rally, a genuine bull cycle for Bitcoin necessitates more enduring and foundational triggers. One of the significant upcoming events is Bitcoin\u2019s halving scheduled for next year. Historically, the market tends to price in the anticipation of halving, often resulting in an uptrend leading up to the event and sustaining momentum post-halving. However, to genuinely confirm the start of a bull cycle, a mere price surge and temporary bullish sentiment won\u2019t suffice. We need to witness the emergence of a sustained uptrend, marked by the establishment of a higher low, indicating that the market is creating new support levels. Skeptics still exist, with some predicting Bitcoin\u2019s potential drop below $15,000. Nevertheless, if Bitcoin can establish a higher low, it would not only shift the narrative but also potentially convert many bearish investors into bulls. Such a move would solidify the belief that Bitcoin found its bottom last November.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "A company is petitioning former Ripple chief technology officer Stefan Thomas for a hard drive containing more than 7,000 Bitcoin (BTC) that he has been unable to access for years.\n\nIn an Oct. 25 open letter, crypto recovery firm Unciphered offered to unlock an IronKey hard drive belonging to Thomas containing 7,002 BTC \u2014 roughly $244 million at the time of publication. The former Ripple chief technology officer forgot the information to access the drive, designed to erase its data if an individual enters the incorrect password ten times. So far, the German-born programmer has used eight out of his ten attempts.\n\nAccording to Unciphered, its teams developed a method to crack the hardware and access the BTC keys safely stored for years. Technology magazine Wired reported on Oct. 25 that the company was able to access the data on a similar IronKey after \u201c200 trillion tries\u201d \u2014 seemingly bypassing the 10-attempt restriction on the drive.\n\n\u201cThough there are always caveats, this is not theoretical,\u201d said Unciphered. \u201cWe can do it; we\u2019ve done it many times before [...] And we can do it again. You don\u2019t have to take our word for it [...] we would be happy to demonstrate it on as many samples in a row as it takes for you (and everyone) to feel confident before moving forward.\u201d\n\nThis is an open letter to Stefan Thomas (@justmoon) - we would love to help you get back into your IronKey.https://t.co/zhfu41b9jn pic.twitter.com/1hYg3h79BF \u2014 Unciphered LLC (@uncipheredLLC) October 25, 2023\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Unciphered CEO Eric Michaud said the company accessed the data in the IronKey from the Wired report by extracting some of the drive\u2019s information and using offline servers, giving its team more than one bite at the apple at guessing the password. He declined to say what the firm would ask for in return from Thomas but added Unciphered had created a \u201csustainable business\u201d helping people recover crypto.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared if Stefan doesn\u2019t want to work with us, but we\u2019re hopeful,\u201d said Michaud. \u201cWe already have a business that is growing and we\u2019ll be here when he\u2019s ready.\u201c\n\nRelated: Ledger hardware wallet rolls out cloud-based private key recovery tool\n\nThere are many highly publicized stories like Thomas\u2019 involving recovery or users unable to locate their keys for one reason or another. In 2021, a Redditor claimed to have regained access to 127 BTC after more than ten years, finding the private keys on an old computer. In 2013, British national James Howells mistakenly discarded a hard drive containing roughly 7,500 BTC \u2014 he has made multiple attempts to locate and recover the drive in a landfill without success.\n\nEstimates from 2022 suggested that users could have lost access to roughly 20% of Bitcoin\u2019s supply. This amounted to billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Major crypto exchanges recorded a net outflow on Oct. 24 as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) briefly touched the $35,000 mark for the first time in a year. The movement of funds away from exchanges is considered a bullish sign, as it indicates traders are moving their assets away from exchanges to secure storage, expecting prices to increase.\n\nAccording to data shared by crypto analytic firm CoinGlass, Binance saw the biggest outflow, with over $500 million moving off the exchange over the past 24 hours, followed by crypto.com with $49.4 million in outflows, and OKX with $31 million. Most other exchanges recorded less than $20 million in outflows.\n\nOutflows from crypto platforms recently have led to \u201cbank run\u201d fears after the FTX collapse in November 2022. However, the most recent outflows align more with trader sentiment than fear-induced withdrawals during the peak bear market. Glassnode data confirms that the Bitcoin outflows from exchanges over the past few days have risen in line with BTC\u2019s price surge.\n\nBitcoin exchange outflows. Source: Glassnode\n\nRelated: BTC price nears 2023 highs \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nThe price surge also led to the liquidation of roughly $400 million worth of short positions. Over the last 24 hours, 94,755 traders saw derivative positions liquidated. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, worth $9.98 million.\n\nOn-chain analysts also pointed toward the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the asset\u2019s market value to its realized value. It is calculated by dividing a cryptocurrency\u2019s market capitalization by its realized capitalization. The realized price is determined by the average price at which each coin or token was last moved on-chain. The MVRV ratio currently sits at 1.47. The last time there was a bull run, the MVRV ratio was 1.5.\n\n#Bitcoin hit $35K.
