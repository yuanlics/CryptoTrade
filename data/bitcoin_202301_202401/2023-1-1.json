        "title": "The boldest bitcoin calls for 2023 are out \u2014 and a 1,400% rally or a 70% plunge may be on the cards - CNBC",
        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year. STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\n\n2022 was a rough year for crypto. More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the value of the market. And bitcoin, the world's largest digital coin, saw its price slump more than 60%. Investors were caught off guard by a wave of collapses in the industry from stablecoin project terraUSD to crypto exchange FTX, as well as a worsening macroeconomic climate. Those who made predictions about bitcoin's price in the past year really missed the mark. But with 2023 now here, some market players have stuck their neck out with price calls for what could be another volatile year. Interest rates around the world are on the rise, and that's weighing on risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. Investors are also watching how the FTX saga, which resulted in the arrest of the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, will develop. CNBC rounds up some of the boldest price calls for bitcoin in 2023.\n\nTim Draper: $250,000\n\nBitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year. In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he's extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he's convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone. \"My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,\" Draper told CNBC via email. Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level. Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper. \"I suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin's price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024. Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs. These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.\n\nThat's historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno. \"In prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,\" Ayyar told CNBC. \"Their cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines \u2026 or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.\" \"If the market reaches a point where it's absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we're seeing a bottoming period.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $5,000\n\nFor some market participants, the worst is yet to come. In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank's list of \"surprises\" that are being \"under-priced\" by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices. \"Yields plunge along with technology shares\" in Standard Chartered's nightmare 2023 scenario, \"and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,\" said Eric Robertsen, the bank's global head of research. \"More and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,\" he added. Robertsen said the scenario has a \"non-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead\" and falls \"materially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.\"\n\nMark Mobius: $10,000\n\nVeteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nHe said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023. The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve. \"With higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,\" Mobius said via email.\n\nCarol Alexander: $50,000\n\nCarol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn't far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains \u2014 but not for reasons you might expect. The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four. \"There will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble \u2014 so we won't see the price overshooting as before,\" she told CNBC. \"We'll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.\" Alexander's reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as \"whales\" will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial.\n\nwatch now\n\nSome investors have given up trying to predict the price of bitcoin. For Antoni Trenchev, CEO of crypto lending platform Nexo, the recent events are a sobering moment. Bitcoin was on a \"positive path\" earlier in 2022, with institutional adoption rising, but \"a few major forces interfered,\" he said. Trenchev once predicted bitcoin surging to a peak of $100,000 by early 2023. Now, he's done trying to predict the price. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, suggested attempts to forecast bitcoin's price are futile. \"We could be sitting here talking this time next year and it could be at $5,000 or 50,000 it just wouldn't surprise me because the market is so heavily driven by sentiment,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\""

        "content": "One of the original core developers behind Bitcoin (BTC), Luke Dashjr, claims to have lost \u201cbasically\u201d all his BTC as a result of a hack that occurred just before the new year.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 post on Twitter, the developer said the alleged hackers had somehow gained access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key, a common security method that uses two keys to gain access to encrypted information.\n\nIn the thread, he shared a wallet address where some of the stolen BTC had been sent but did not reveal how much of his BTC was stolen in total.\n\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing the wallet address in question shows four transactions between 2:08 and 2:16 pm UTC on Dec. 31, totalling 216.93 BTC \u2014 worth $3.6 million at current prices.\n\nDashjr said he had \u201cno idea how\u201d the attackers gained access to his key, though some in the community have pointed to a possible connection with an earlier Twitter post from Dashjr on Nov. 17 that noted that his server had been compromised by \u201cnew malware/backdoors on the system.\u201d\n\nPSA: My server was accessed this morning by an unknown person. Full analysis in progress, but take extra care that you PGP-verified any downloads. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) November 17, 2022\n\nDashjr told a user in his most recent Twitter thread that he had only noticed the recent hack after getting emails from Coinbase and Kraken about login attempts.\n\nThe incident has also caught the attention of Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, who offered condolences and support in a Jan. 1 post.\n\n\u201cSorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor. If it comes our way, we will freeze it. If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,\" he wrote.\n\nSome in the crypto community have speculated that lax security might be to blame for the loss.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 Reddit thread, a user calling themselves SatStandard suggested that Dashjr may not have taken the Nov. 17 security breach \u201cseriously enough\u201d and later suggested that the Bitcoin developer \u201cdid not keep different activities separated.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had hot wallet on the same computer he did everything else. It looks like he was really complacent.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a few others appear to suggest it may not have been a hack at all, suggesting that someone had stumbled across the seed phrase somehow, or it was part of an unfortunate \u201cboating accident\u201d ahead of tax season.\n\nA boating accident in this context is in reference to a running joke and meme originally used by gun enthusiasts, but since repurposed by the crypto community about people trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming they lost all their BTC in a \u201ctragic boating accident.\u201d\n\nTop tier boating accident. \u2014 Nate (@beeforbacon1) January 1, 2023\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Dashjr over Twitter for more information about the alleged hack but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nRelated: The 10 largest crypto hacks and exploits in 2022 saw $2.1B stolen\n\nThe news has also ignited a debate around self-custody, which became a hot topic after the collapse of FTX last year.\n\nBinance\u2019s Zhao, who previously cautioned the crypto community about self-custody, said: \u201cSad to see even an OG #Bitcoin Core Developer lost 200+ BTC ($3.5 million). Self custody [has] a different set of risks.\u201d\n\nOnline social media BTC influencer Udi Wertheimer also took the time to question whether self-custody was a viable and safe option, commenting that one \u201cshouldn\u2019t manage your own keys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf even one of Bitcoin\u2019s OG developers messes this up, I really don\u2019t know how other people are expected to do it safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say self custody is bad. But you shouldn\u2019t manage keys directly,\u201d he said."

        "title": "The centralization of Bitcoin: Behind the two mining pools controlling 51% of the global hash rate - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "While most of the market focuses on Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility, a much bigger problem seems to go unnoticed.\n\nThe centralization of Ethereum has been one of the hottest topics in the crypto industry since the network\u2019s switch to Proof-of-Stake, with many critics warning about the dangers of such a high market cap cryptocurrency relying on only a handful of centralized validators.\n\nSince the coveted mining ban in China, the centralization of the Bitcoin network mostly disappeared from mainstream discussions and became the focus of a niche group in the mining sphere.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s centralization is a problem that concerns the entire market, especially now when only two mining pools produce the majority of its blocks.\n\nCryptoSlate looked at Bitcoin\u2019s global hash rate distribution and found that more than half of it came from Foundry USA and Antpool.\n\nThe two pools mined over a quarter of Bitcoin blocks in the past ten days each. Since mid-December, Foundry USA mined 357 blocks, while Antpool mined 325. Foundry\u2019s block production accounted for 26.98% of the network, while Antpool was responsible for just under 24.5% of the total block production.\n\nAntpool has been at the forefront of Bitcoin mining for years and produced almost 14% of the blocks mined in the past three years. On the other hand, Foundry is a relatively new name in the mining space. However, it quickly rose to become one of the top ten pools by hash rate, accounting for 3.2% of the blocks mined in the past year.\n\nA deeper look at Antpool and Foundry USA shows an alarming level of centralization \u2014 and a web of interconnected companies that effectively own half of the network.\n\nFoundry \u2014 DCG\u2019s mining behemoth\n\nIt took less than two years for Foundry USA to become a force to be reckoned with in the Bitcoin mining space. The mining pool is owned and operated by the eponymous Foundry, a company Digital Currency Group (DCG) created in 2019.\n\nBy late summer 2020, Foundry was already among the largest Bitcoin miners in North America. Aside from mining, the company offered equipment financing and procurement. By the end of 2020, Foundry helped procure half of all the Bitcoin mining hardware delivered to North America.\n\nFoundry\u2019s massive success as an equipment procurer and miner directly results from DCG\u2019s influence in the crypto industry.\n\nThe venture capital firm is one of the space\u2019s largest and most active investors, backing more than 160 crypto companies in over 30 countries. DCG\u2019s portfolio is a registry of the industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 Blockchain.com, Blockstream, Chainalysis, Circle, Coinbase, CoinDesk, Genesis, Grayscale, Kraken, Ledger, Lightning Network, Ripple, Silvergate, and dozens more.\n\nFoundry is its wholly-owned subsidiary that acts as a one-stop shop for all of these companies\u2019 mining needs. The rapid growth in Foundry USA\u2019s hash rate led some to speculate that DCG\u2019s companies were contractually obligated to do all of their mining through Foundry\u2019s pool. However, it\u2019s important to note that neither DCG nor any companies in its portfolio confirmed this.\n\nThe mining ban instated in China last year helped as well.\n\nForced to leave China\u2019s abundant and cheap hydropower, miners were looking for alternative locations offering at least a fraction of their profit and a more welcoming regulatory environment.\n\nThe U.S. presented as a perfect relocation spot, offering miners a wide selection of locations and power sources. And having a mining pool as large as Foundry USA at their doorstep certainly didn\u2019t hurt.\n\nAntpool \u2014 Bitmain\u2019s monopoly\n\nFounded in 2014, Antpool is one of the oldest operating mining pools on the market. Frequently accounting for over a quarter of the global hash rate, Antpool has almost never left the top ten largest mining pools.\n\nThe pool\u2019s success is its perfect vertical integration \u2014 it is owned and operated by Bitmain, the world\u2019s largest mining hardware manufacturer. The company behind the Antminer series has supplied its pool with the newest and most efficient Bitcoin hashers, helping it stay profitable even in the coldest crypto winters.\n\nBitmain\u2019s influence over the global crypto market has led many to speculate that the company was obligating its large buyers to mine with Antpool. With both Bitmain and Antpool having headquarters in China, many also worry about the country\u2019s influence over such a large portion of Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate.\n\nThe corporatization of crypto mining\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that a mining pool differs from a private mining operation. Unlike a private miner, a pool represents the joint hash rate of many machines owned by various entities.\n\nOwners of mining machines, or hashers, split the profits generated by the mining pool according to the size of their contribution.\n\nThat Foundry USA accounts for a quarter of the Bitcoin hash rate doesn\u2019t mean that DCG owns every machine that produced it.\n\nHowever, Foundry provides the foundation and the roof for its clients\u2019 mining operations. The company\u2019s weaknesses could shake up a significant portion of the Bitcoin network and leave thousands of smaller miners and machines fending for themselves if it were to shut down.\n\nThe same can be applied to Antpool.\n\nThe rate of centralization these two entities imposed on the industry becomes even greater when looking beyond just Bitcoin. Antpool has pools for other cryptocurrencies as well \u2014 Litecoin (LTC), ZCash (ZEC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Dash (DASH), just to name a few.\n\nFoundry offers enterprise staking support for Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cosmos (ATOM). The company doesn\u2019t disclose the number of assets it manages.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "2022 was a terrible year for cryptocurrencies, with the loss of $2 trillion in market value.\n\nWe could now see the handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to more regulated and established institutions.\n\nCryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit.\n\nBy any measure, 2022 was a terrible year for crypto. In all, more than $2 trillion in largely speculative market value evaporated.\n\nMillions of consumers and businesses lost money, and perhaps more damaging for a nascent industry and technology, the fundamental trust in the promise of crypto-finance, which was supposed to be a correction to many of the misdeeds that gave rise to the 2008 financial crisis, is waning.\n\nMeanwhile, policymakers who have been sounding an alarm about crypto\u2019s excessive risks, while failing to create sensible regulations, have been vindicated by not one, but multiple large-scale failures.\n\nHave you read? Do cryptocurrencies have a future? An expert explains\n\nTo the diehard crypto utopians (and some crypto-anarchists), 2022 was not just another \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d but more of an ice age. Along with a broad loss of confidence, economic value and a market littered with the tombstones of failed firms and projects, perhaps the era of crypto speculation will remain frozen in ice, giving way to a Cambrian explosion for responsible, always-on internet finance.\n\nJust as it took the dot-com bubble bursting in the early 2000s to hand over the future of the internet to more durable companies, business models and use cases, perhaps 2022 marks a handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to steadier hands.\n\nWhile the underlying technology of cryptography and blockchain is generalizable to all industries and coordinating activities (collectively the building blocks of Web3), experimentation at the core of financial services, among other sectors, continues unabated. Indeed, as a test of the staying power of digital assets and blockchains at the core of financial services (and other areas of the global economy), watch what the big banks and mature financial services firms do, not what they say.\n\nTo the diehard crypto utopians (and some crypto-anarchists), 2022 was not just another \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d but more of an ice age. Image: Coinmetrics\n\nWhile the most famous volte-face on policy towards crypto and blockchain belongs to JPMorgan, they are no longer alone among major financial institutions in embracing Web3. Arguably, just as boards and executive teams reluctantly owned their cybersecurity and digital transformation mandates, the embrace of crypto technology is equally inevitable, even if the term feels like a bad word. For all its faults, this technology remains a protagonist in the global financial world.\n\nHistory is riddled with examples of otherwise good or neutral technologies being co-opted by bad actors and those ever-present human follies of greed, nescience, risks of opportunity or outright criminality. All of which are amplified in emerging, lightly regulated sectors and accelerated by technology. Indeed, no sector is risk-free, especially not one involving money. However, crypto punishes the errant at speed, giving bad actors few places to hide.\n\nRemember how crypto was born from anonymous trading activities on the so-called dark web? Or how insidious global ransomware attacks like WannaCry in 2017 spread worldwide in days, delivered by seemingly innocuous emails and triggered by perilous human curiosity between the keyboard and the chair?\n\nYet we didn't ban the internet or email. The more enduring approach with all breakthrough technologies is to net out their harmful effects by placing technologies (like all tools) in the hands of responsible actors and encouraging their responsible use."

        "content": "MicroStrategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor is explaining why the software company sold some Bitcoin (BTC) despite previously stating that the firm will not sell its crypto holdings.\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces discussion, Saylor says that as a corporation, MicroStrategy is in a position to enjoy tax benefits by selling some of the firm\u2019s Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is traded as property right now, so that means that you can sell the property, take the capital loss and you have the option to buy property in the future or to have bought it in the past and that\u2019s a different tax basis.\n\nWe have some capital gains that we pay taxes on and then we can have some capital losses in Bitcoin, so by selling the Bitcoin and taking the capital loss, we\u2019re able to use that to offset some capital gains. So it\u2019s very tax efficient for the corporation.\u201d\n\nIn a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing submitted on December 28th, MicroStrategy reported that it sold $11.8 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $16,776 per BTC on December 22nd. The company says the sale of about 704 BTC is for tax purposes.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin remains bullish on the benchmark cryptocurrency. The SEC filing shows that two days after the sale, MicroStrategy bought more Bitcoin than it sold.\n\n\u201cOn December 24, 2022, MicroStrategy acquired approximately 810 Bitcoins for approximately $13.6 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $16,845 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull.\"\n\n3. \"Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon the 'orangutan effect': If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, you may leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\"\n\n4. \"I know I'll win over time. That doesn't mean I'll beat everybody else, or anything like that. But the game is very, very, very easy if you have the right lessons in your mind about what you're buying.\" (Buffett was underscoring that he views shares as pieces of a business.)\n\n5. \"We have a successor in place, but he's not warming up. I'm in overtime but I'm out there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \"Elon is taking on General Motors and Ford and Toyota, and all these people who've got all this stuff, and he's got an idea and he's winning. That's America. You can't dream it up. It's astounding.\"\n\n7. \"It couldn't happen but it did. If they'd stopped in Omaha on the drive from New York to Seattle and he'd said, 'What do you think of this idea?' I would have said, 'Good luck, Jeff.'\" (Buffett was referring to Amazon's unlikely evolution from an online bookseller to a technology titan under founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\n8. \"Sometimes the stock market is quite investment-oriented, and other times it's almost totally a casino, a gambling parlor \u2014 and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years, encouraged by Wall Street.\"\n\n9. \"If you told me you owned all of the bitcoin in the world, and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I would have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \"The best protection against inflation is still your own personal earnings power. The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself.\"\n\nRead more: David Rubenstein views Warren Buffett as the ultimate investor.

        "title": "Models and fundamentals: Where will Bitcoin price go in 2023? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) had a bumpy ride throughout 2022, along with the rest of the digital asset market. The cryptocurrency began the year exchanging hands around $46,700 and is currently trading over 64% down at $16,560 at the time of writing. Consequently, the coin\u2019s market capitalization took a tumble from around $900 billion on Jan. 1, 2022 to end the year at around $320 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Trend in 2022\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price could be attributed to the extraordinary circumstances that the entire cryptocurrency market has been through this year, it is important to reevaluate the 2022 price predictions made by various market entities. One of the most popular predictions was that of analyst PlanB\u2019s Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model.\n\nThe S2F model predicted BTC to be at nearly $110,000 as of December 2022. The cryptocurrency finished the year trading at almost 85% off target, which raises questions about the validity of the price model. Stock-to-flow models are generally used to price commodities in the traditional markets, as they account for two variables related to an asset: stock and flow. \u201cStock\u201d refers to the total existing supply of the asset, and \u201cflow\u201d refers to the new supply of the asset created each year.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo \u2014 a digital asset management platform \u2014 shared with Cointelegraph his thoughts on the validity of the S2F prediction model:\n\n\u201cThere are many factors that can influence the price of Bitcoin, including market demand, regulatory changes and technological developments. The S2F model is one tool that can be used to make projections about the future price of Bitcoin, but it is important to keep in mind that it is based on certain assumptions and is not a definitive guide to the future.\u201d\n\nBesides S2F, other models have been used to attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin in the near and distant future. Two popular ones are Elliott Wave Theory and Hyperwave Theory. While both also find their roots in traditional financial markets, their success in predicting the price of BTC has been relatively limited as well.\n\nPrice models fail as a new year for Bitcoin ushers in\n\nConsidering that Bitcoin only began its journey as an asset just over a decade ago, it is safe to say that the cryptocurrency is still in its nascent stages of price discovery when compared with commodities like gold or silver and other leading technology stocks like Apple and Microsoft. Thus, while there are various BTC price predictions, it is essential to remember the limited availability of cyclical data to factor into these models.\n\nTrenchev added that there are many different models and approaches that can be used to try to predict the price of Bitcoin. Some people use technical analysis, which involves studying historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends. Others use fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating the underlying factors that can affect an asset\u2019s demand and supply. No single model or approach is universally considered to be the most reliable for predicting the price of Bitcoin, and it is crucial to consider a range of factors when making any investment decisions.\n\nRelated: The Three Most Controversial Bitcoin Price Models and What They Predict\n\nAlex McCurry, CEO and co-founder of blockchain solution provider Solidity.io, agrees with Trenchev, telling Cointelegraph, \u201cBitcoin is a completely unpredictable asset. The only thing one can be certain of when it comes to Bitcoin is the underlying fundamental value of the Bitcoin network and the value it presents to holders and investors. Because of this, one can predict long-term adoption and value in the macroeconomic climate over time, but perfectly timing an exact price is impossible.\u201d\n\nHowever, one important aspect could change the trends for the price of Bitcoin: utility.\n\nSince Bitcoin is not a smart contract-compatible network, the asset\u2019s utility has been limited to a payment rail. That is slowly beginning to change, with Bitcoin now finding more utility than ever before, supported by the Lightning Network.\n\nLN is a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network that enables fast, seamless peer-to-peer transactions. It helps improve the scalability of the network enormously. Most recently, Michael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy announced that it plans to release Lightning Network-powered software and solutions in 2023.\n\nClick \u201cCollect\u201d below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.\n\nMicroStrategy also continues adding Bitcoin to its treasury. Between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21, 2022, the company acquired 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,181 for a total of $42.8 million. For tax reasons, it sold 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin for a total of $11.8 million on Dec. 22. As a repurchase, the company bought 810 BTC on Dec. 24 for $13.6 million in cash. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, this puts the firm\u2019s holdings at 132,500 BTC, worth around $2.2 billion at the time of writing.\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck released 11 crypto predictions for 2023, among which it claimed that BTC will drop to $10,000\u2013$12,000 in Q1 \u201camid a wave of miner bankruptcies\u201d and will bounce back up to $30,000 in the second half of 2023.\n\nMcCurry agreed with this prediction, stating, \u201cI believe Bitcoin will bounce back in 2023, and I feel that by 2024, Bitcoin will achieve a new all-time high significantly higher than the 2021 peak of $69,000.\u201d\n\nTrenchev added, \u201cIt is possible that the price of Bitcoin could rebound to $30,000 in the second half of 2023, but it is also important to keep in mind that the price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and can be affected by a wide range of factors.\u201d\n\nDerivatives market and BTC price discovery\n\nDespite the unpredictable, volatile nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price, the asset\u2019s derivatives market is an important indicator of its current and future sentiment.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the Bitcoin futures market currently has an open interest (OI) of over $9 billion. At the same time, the open interest of the Bitcoin options market stands at $3.4 billion, with over 76% of the OI on cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit.\n\nLuuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of Deribit, spoke with Cointelegraph about what options data for 2023 reveals about the market\u2019s price sentiment for Bitcoin. He said:\n\n\u201cThe overall put-call ratio for June 2023 is 0.24, which is rather low. This typically implies bullish sentiment, as there are three times more calls outstanding than puts. Max pain is at $19,000, also showing upside potential. Investors are positioning at the larger strikes ($20,000, $25,000 and $30,000). The premium for the higher strikes is much lower, obviously, so these could be seen as an upside bet, or used for yield generation by call sellers.\u201d\n\nThe max-pain price is the price point at which the largest number of options are in loss. Strijers also added that \u201csince the FTX implosion, investors seem to be on the sidelines, waiting for news about the industry, but also macroeconomic news. We have experienced new lows in the implied volatilities, and the short term is currently trading in the low 30s. We\u2019re even having dailies seen trading below 30%. At the same time, liquidity is currently lower than normal.\u201d\n\nMarket uncertainty aside, incoming regulations in 2023 \u2014 namely, the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets bill and the United States\u2019 Lummis-Gillibrand and Warren-Marshall bills \u2014 could bring stability to the market, as investors who feel the space is provided with more oversight will likely feel more confident.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining revenue was down to $9.55 billion in 2022 from $15.3 billion in 2021 \u2013 a 37.5% decline.\n\nSince the peak of a massive rally in 2021, cryptocurrencies have lost more than $2 trillion in market cap to reach below $900 billion. There has been more than a 70% drop in Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest digital coin since it reached an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. In addition, several high-profile company and project failures have sent shock waves in the past year.\n\nThis all began in May with the collapse of terraUSD, which brought down other firms like Three Arrows Capital, a crypto-oriented hedge fund. Then, in November, FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, collapsed, affecting the industry.\n\nAdditionally, rising interest rates have put pressure on risk assets, such as stocks and crypto, along with crypto-specific failures.\n\nAs investors became wary of volatile assets, deteriorating market conditions also affected miners. Aside from market conditions, miners also faced high electricity costs and record mining difficulty. In 2022, mining difficulty reached a record high due to an increase in hash rate, which left some miners struggling for profitability.\n\nDue to this, the miner\u2019s daily revenue has fallen sharply to $16.173 million \u2013 down from $63.548 million on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nTop Mining firms suffered in 2022\n\nAccording to Hashrate Index, the debt-to-equity ratio more than tripled for many mining firms, indicating greater financial leverage.\n\nCore Scientific has the highest debt-to-equity ratio at 26.7, followed by Greenidge and Stronghold at 18 and 11.1, respectively. Argo also has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 8.7.\n\nAccording to Core Scientific\u2019s balance sheet, as of Sept. 30, the company owed the most, with $1.3 billion in liabilities. The second-largest debtor is Marathon, with $851 million in liabilities.\n\nAs a result, miners with high debt-to-equity ratios, such as Core Scientific (CORZ), filed for bankruptcy. Whereas Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining restructured their debt obligations.\n\nDue to the bearish sentiment in 2022, miners\u2019 profitability suffered. Bitcoin\u2019s profitability is measured in dollars per terahash, or TH, per second. During its peak in 2017, bitcoin mining generated $3.39/TH per second, but it dropped to $0.104/TH in 2022.\n\nProminent public mining companies suffered considerable losses in 2022 that rose over 90% on average.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Luke Dashjr, who claims to be \u201cthe longest contributing Bitcoin Core developer,\u201d revealed that an unknown hacker had raided \u201cbasically all\u201d of his Bitcoin holdings on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nThe total sum of Bitcoin stolen is unknown, but in a Twitter thread, Dashjr tracked \u201csome of it\u201d to a wallet address that received a little under 217 Bitcoin, or about $3.6 million at today\u2019s price.\n\nDashjr blamed the hack of his Bitcoin wallet on a compromised PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key and later, in a Reddit discussion, he stated that the attacker\u2019s IP came from a ColoCrossing server. He was at a loss to explain how his cold wallets were compromised, but he said the last time he\u2019d accessed them was in September.\n\nLooks like some of it is coinjoined to 1YAR6opJCfDjBNdn5bV8b5Mcu84tv92fa \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nDashjr posted a followup tweet calling out ColoCrossing for allegedly \u201cdropping the ball on abuse investigation last time\u201d and he vowed to replace his server provider. Some responders also flagged up a security breach he tweeted about back in November as possibly being connected to the hack.\n\nDashjr continued to answer questions on Twitter, saying that he believes \u201ceverything is compromised,\u201d even potentially his Twitter. He also strongly cautioned people against using Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin wallet signed by his own now-compromised PGP key.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) volatility remained subdued in the final few days of the last year, indicating that investors were in no hurry to enter the markets.\n\nBitcoin ended 2022 near $16,500, and the first day of the new year also failed to ignite the markets. This suggests that traders remain cautious and on the lookout for a catalyst to start the next trending move.\n\nSeveral analysts remain bearish about Bitcoin\u2019s near-term price action. David Marcus, CEO and founder of Bitcoin firm Lightspark, said in a blog post released on Dec. 30 that he does not see the crypto winter ending in 2023 and not even in 2024. He expects that it will take time to rebuild consumer trust but believes the current reset may be good for legitimate firms over the long term.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe bearish calls are an indication that the sentiment remains negative, but there is also a silver lining to it. Usually, bear markets end after the last bull has turned bearish. With no more sellers left, the price action stabilizes and new buyers enter the market. That usually causes a reversal and starts a new up-move.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains range-bound, select altcoins are showing signs of strength. Let\u2019s look at the charts and spot the important levels to keep an eye on.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nThe failure of the bulls to push Bitcoin above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $16,778 has strengthened the bears further who are trying to sink the price below the immediate support at $16,256.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the relative strength index (RSI) is near 43, indicating a minor advantage to sellers. If bears sink the price below $16,256, the BTC/Tether (USDT) pair could drop to $16,000 and thereafter to the vital support at $15,476. A break below this support could signal the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis negative view will be invalidated in the near term if buyers thrust the price above $17,100. Such a move will indicate aggressive buying on dips. The pair could then pick up momentum and make a dash toward $18,388. Sellers are again expected to mount a strong defense at this level.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been stuck between $16,256 and $17,061 for some time. The bounce off the support is facing selling near the moving averages. This suggests that bears continue to sell on rallies.\n\nHowever, a minor positive is that the bulls have not given up much ground and the pair remains near the 20-EMA. This increases the likelihood of a break above the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could rise to $16,800 and then $17,061.\n\nOn the downside, bears will have to pull the price below the immediate support of $16,429 to set up a retest of $16,256.\n\nLTC/USDT\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies are still searching for a bottom but Litecoin (LTC) is way above its June low. This indicates strong demand at lower levels.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA of $69 has flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.\n\nThe advantage will tilt in favor of the buyers if they push and sustain the price above the moving averages. The LTC/USDT pair could then climb to the overhead resistance at $75. This is an important level to watch out for in the near term because a break above it could open the doors for a rally to $85.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could slide to $65.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the 4-hour chart are moving up slowly and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $72, but if this level is crossed, the up-move could reach $75.\n\nSellers are likely to mount a strong defense in the $72 to $75 zone, but if bulls bulldoze their way through, the rally could accelerate and reach $80. On the downside, a break below $65 could open the doors for a decline to $61.\n\nAPE/USDT\n\nApeCoin (APE) has been trading inside a large range between $3 and $7.80 for the past several months. The moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure could be reducing.\n\nAPE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears have not allowed the price to rise above the moving averages, but an encouraging sign is that the bulls have maintained the buying pressure and not let the price slip. This increases the possibility of a break above the moving averages. If that happens, the APE/USDT pair could ascend to $4.58 and thereafter to $5.25.\n\nAlternatively, if the bears do not allow the price to pierce the overhead resistance, the pair could again slump to the vital support at $3. A slide below the $3 to $2.61 support zone could indicate the start of the next leg down.\n\nAPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has formed a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This indicates indecision between the bulls and the bears. Although the moving averages are flattish, the RSI has risen into the positive zone, indicating that bulls have a slight edge. If buyers clear the minor hurdle at $3.71, the pair could rise to the resistance line of the triangle.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, it will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The pair could then tumble to $3.20 and later to the important support at $3.\n\nRelated: Rewind 2022: A crypto roundup of the year and stepping into 2023\n\nICP/USDT\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) continues to trade below the breakdown level of $4.61, but the RSI is forming a positive divergence, indicating that the selling pressure could be reducing.\n\nICP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers propelled the price above the downtrend line on Dec. 30, but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The bulls again tried to overcome the barrier on Jan. 1, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that bears are selling on intraday rallies.\n\nIf the price slips and sustains below the 20-day EMA of $3.91, the bears will try to pull the price to $3.60 and then to $3.40.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price rebounds off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to drive the price above $4.21. If they can pull it off, the ICP/USDT pair could soar to $4.61, where the bears may try to stall the recovery.\n\nICP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls have managed to defend the 50-SMA but they have failed to sustain the price above the 20-EMA. This indicates that bears are active at higher levels. If the price turns down and plummets below $3.90, the pair could drop to $3.76 and then $3.60.\n\nAlternatively, if bulls pierce the overhead resistance zone of $4.10 to $4.21, the momentum could pick up and the pair could surge to $4.46. This level may behave as a minor hindrance but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then reach $4.61.\n\nBIT/USDT\n\nBitDAO (BIT) has been consolidating between $0.25 and $0.35 for the past few days but the price action is showing signs of a possible breakout.\n\nBIT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, indicating a potential trend change. If buyers catapult the price above $0.35, the BIT/USDT pair could start a new uptrend. The pair could then attempt a rally to the target objective at $0.45.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down from $0.35, it will suggest that bears are guarding this level with vigor. The price could then dip to the 20-day EMA of $0.30.\n\nIf the price rebounds from this level, it will suggest that the sentiment may have shifted from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That could enhance the prospects of a break above $0.35.\n\nThe bears will have to yank the price below the moving averages to invalidate the bullish view. The pair could then remain stuck inside the range for a while longer.\n\nBIT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price turned down sharply from the overhead resistance at $0.35 but the bulls are trying to arrest the pullback at the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, it will suggest aggressive buying on dips. The pair could then scale the overhead resistance and start its northward march to $0.40 and then $0.42.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, several short-term bulls may book profits. That could pull the price to the 50-SMA. Such a move will suggest that the pair may spend some more time inside the range.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: TradingView\n\nLooking ahead, traders are thus conservative as to what lies in store for BTC/USD as signs of a fundamental shift remain wholly absent from market behavior.\n\n\u201cIt takes a tiny pump into resistance to turn everyone bullish again.

As soon as those signals come in, sentiment around risk-on should markedly strengthen.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nThe Fed will release minutes from its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Jan. 4, providing clear guidance on policy going forward.\n\nFor \u201cBig Short\u201d investor Michael Burry, however, even that more permissive scenario is not the end of the inflation story.\n\n\u201cInflation peaked.

Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.\u201d\n\nThe results of Fed policy have been clear to see for 2022 stock market performance, with the S&P 500 for example finishing the year 1,000 points below many of the most popular estimates.\n\nWhile markets await the first Wall Street trading day of 2023, the U.S. Dollar Index is already struggling in what could be the year\u2019s first silver lining for crypto assets.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is currently threatening to fall through support unchallenged for over six months, after which the 100-point level reenters.\n\n\u201cMarkets: DXY on the verge of breaking down again, 10yr yields reaching resistance, WTI crude rebounded to resistance, gold paused at resistance, stocks treading water,\u201d Callum Thomas, founder and head of research at macro research house Top Down Charts, summarized in part of Twitter comments on the day.\n\nU.S. dollar index (DXY) 1-week candle chart.

Some believe that this makes it difficult for normal people to adopt or secure their Bitcoin.\n\nIn a post, a Twitter user was shocked by the news, believing that not many would be able to help the developer and that \u201cthere\u2019s little hope for most.\u201d They tweeted:\n\nYou've definitely been one of the most security conscious folks I've known in this space, so this is a little shocking.

A Twitter user also brought mass adoption to the conversation. They believe that if a top Bitcoin developer cannot keep his wallet secure, mass adoption is a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Namcios believes that these sentiments are not a fair assessment of the situation. The analyst highlighted that though Dashjr has a high level of Bitcoin knowledge, this doesn\u2019t mean that he cannot make mistakes.\n\n1/ This is not a good take.

Zhao also promised that their security team would monitor the assets and freeze the BTC if any of them got deposited into their crypto exchange.\n\nRelated: Crypto self-custody a \u2018fundamental human right\u2019 but not risk-free: Community\n\nOn Nov. 14, the Binance CEO recommended self-custody only with small amounts, as mistakes could get \u201cvery costly.\u201d Zhao described self-custody as a fundamental human right and urged the community to make sure to do it right. Apart from Zhao, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor also discussed the merits of self-custody amid the FTX collapse. Saylor said that custodians \u201caccumulate too much power\u201d in a system where there is no self-custody."

        "content": "El Salvador, the first country to legalize Bitcoin (BTC), has been pushed down yet another spot in total crypto ATM installations as Australia records 216 ATMs stepping into the year 2023.\n\nAs part of El Salvador\u2019s drive to establish Bitcoin as a legal tender, President Nayib Bukele decided to install over 200 crypto ATMs across the country. While this move made El Salvador the third-largest crypto ATM hub at the time after the United States and Canada in September 2021, Spain and Australia overtook the Central American country\u2019s ATM count in 2022.\n\nOn October 2022, Cointelegraph reported that Spain became the third-largest crypto ATM hub after installing 215 crypto ATMs. However, Spain continued its installation drive and is home to 226 crypto ATMs at the time of writing. El Salvador\u2019s position as the fourth-largest crypto ATM hub was short-lived as Australia stepped up its game over the following months.\n\nIn the last three months of 2022, Australia deployed 99 crypto ATMs, confirms data from CoinATMRadar. As of Jan. 1, 2023, Australia recorded 219 active crypto ATMs, overshadowing El Salvador by 7 ATMs at the time of writing.\n\nAustralia represents 0.6% of global crypto ATM installations and, at this rate, is well-positioned to take over Asia\u2019s crypto ATM numbers, which stand at 312 ATMs. The total number of crypto ATMs worldwide is 38,602, out of which 6,071 ATMs were installed in 2022 alone.\n\nRelated: Florida best-prepared US state for widespread crypto adoption: Research\n\nNigeria\u2019s drive to impose the adoption of an in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC) \u2014 eNaira \u2014 forced the government to limit ATM cash withdrawals to $225 (100,000 nairas) a week.\n\n\u201cCustomers should be encouraged to use alternative channels (internet banking, mobile banking apps, USSD, cards/POS, eNaira, etc.) to conduct their banking transactions,\u201d noted Haruna Mustafa, the director of banking supervision, while announcing the drive."

        "content": "Stepping into 2023, it\u2019s time to pause and reflect on the accomplishments and struggles the global crypto community witnessed over the last 365 days. From the beginning of 2022, no investment strategy could help recover the falling portfolios across traditional and crypto markets. In January 2022, the market had already started to collapse, with investments made at 2021 all-time high prices resulting in immediate losses.\n\nFor many, especially the new entrants, falling crypto prices were perceived as an end game. However, the community\u2019s resilience against global economic turmoil, orchestrated attacks, scams and an unforgiving bear market went largely unnoticed.\n\nAmid falling prices, 2022 also inherited the 2021 hype around nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the metaverse and all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEconomies worldwide suffered massive inflation as the most influential fiat currencies succumbed to ongoing geopolitical pressures. The fall of investor confidence in traditional markets seeped into crypto, with collapsing ecosystems only aiding the sour sentiments.\n\nA year full of disruption\n\nAmid poor market performance, the crypto community focused on strengthening its core. This meant releasing blockchain upgrades and introducing faster, cheaper, more secure features and capabilities, all driven by the consensus of the respective communities. As a result, 2022 was a milestone year for leading crypto ecosystems.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s layer-2 Lightning Network protocol received improved privacy and efficiency thanks to a November 2021 upgrade called Taproot. The upgrade also helped lower the database sizes, an essential factor in slowing down the growing size of the Bitcoin ledger.\n\nAnnouncing lnd 0.15 beta: To Taproot and Beyond! \u267e\ufe0f\n\n\n\nFeaturing:\n\nTaproot + Musig2 support for better privacy + efficiency, Taro soon\u2122\n\n~95% database space reduction for new data\n\n\ufe0f New pathfinding tool to choose speed vs. cost of payments\n\n\n\nRead more: https://t.co/5pavMcpxBg \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f (@lightning) June 28, 2022\n\nBy May 2022, Bitcoin was already halfway to the next halving, which is an event that reduces the mining rewards by half. The reward for confirming Bitcoin transactions gets slashed by half for every 210,000 blocks. The last Bitcoin halving event occurred on May 11, 2020, when it traded at the $9,200 mark.\n\nThe total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million by design. Therefore, a halving event further reduces the amount of BTC released into the market. A resultant scarcity due to the halving event has historically worked in favor of Bitcoin price.\n\nAdhering to industry experts\u2019 expectations, Bitcoin rallied for several months to reach its all-time high in November 2021. It retained its value well above $15,000 until the end of 2022, confirmed by data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nBitcoin price during the last halving event. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe Ethereum community welcomed the highly anticipated Merge upgrade, which saw the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The upgrade\u2019s most significant impact was a drastic energy consumption reduction. The wider crypto community counts on this lower energy usage to reignite the interest in Ether-powered sub-ecosystems, such as NFTs.\n\nCrypto resilience vs. traditional markets\n\nHistory proves that two factors play a crucial role in crypto market performance: the price of Bitcoin and investor sentiment. Both factors dipped throughout the year.\n\nTimeline of crypto events against market capitalization. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe crypto ecosystem was plagued with a series of attacks, unprecedented sanctions and bankruptcy filings, adding to the impact of global economic turmoil on the market. In addition to poor price performance, some of the deepest scars for investors in 2022 include the fall of FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, BlockFi and the Terra ecosystem, with many investors losing access to their funds.\n\nAmid this commotion, entrepreneurs once loved by the masses ended up breaking the trust of millions \u2014 namely, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Terra co-founder and CEO Do Kwon.\n\nDespite the added hurdles, the Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem not only survived but also displayed resilience. Traditional store-of-value investments such as gold faired better. Between January and December 2022, gold investors realized a net loss of 0.3%.\n\nMajor company stocks also performed poorly this year, including Apple (-25%), Microsoft (-29%), Google (-38%), Amazon (-49%), Netflix (-51%), Meta (-65%) and Tesla (-65%).\n\n2022 performance of traditional stocks. Source: LinkedIn\n\nBitcoin started strong with a $47,680 price point in January 2022. Still, dwindling investor sentiment driven by rising inflation, energy prices and market uncertainties managed to bring the prices down over 60% by December.\n\nSetting the stage for a stronger foundation\n\nTime after time, bear markets have taken the responsibility of weeding out bad actors and offering a chance for promising crypto projects to display their true value to investors beyond the price point.\n\nThe noise around price fluctuations could not stop the Bitcoin network from strengthening its core against 51% attacks. Thanks to the widespread mining community, hash rate and network difficulty \u2014 two important computational power-based security metrics \u2014 Bitcoiners felt reassured that the network was secured. The Bitcoin network consistently recorded new hash rate all-time highs throughout the year, ending in the 250-300 exahashes per second range.\n\nClick \u201cCollect\u201d below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.\n\nOther prominent players in the crypto ecosystem also released feature upgrades as they geared up for 2023. Polygon, a layer-2 scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain, launched a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup, or zkEVM, to reduce Web3 transaction costs. Decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator 1inch Network launched the Fusion upgrade to deliver cost-efficient, secure, profitable swaps for crypto investors.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s legalization of Bitcoin did not go unnoticed, especially considering that the country\u2019s Bitcoin procurement from 2021 shared the same fate as other crypto investors. Regardless of losses, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele doubled down on BTC as the government announced its intention to purchase the cryptocurrency daily from Nov. 17.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nOne of the immediate impacts of this move was a reduction in El Salvador\u2019s average buying price. A planned purchase of Bitcoin dips combined with a subsequent market recovery makes the country well-positioned to offset the unrealized losses.\n\nIn countries with high inflation, Bitcoin helped numerous individuals shield their wealth from the declining purchasing power of their fiat currencies.\n\nExpect a return of the hype\n\nWhile 2023 will not be fortunate enough to witness the upcoming Bitcoin halving, it may play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem\u2019s comeback. With aggressive blockchain upgrades, updated business strategies and investors\u2019 attentiveness back on the menu, the ecosystem is now gearing up for the next wave of disruption.\n\nFor investors, 2023 will hopefully be a year of recovery from losses and broken trust toward self-custody and informed investments. \u201cMaking it\u201d in crypto is no longer just about becoming an overnight millionaire; it is about creating, supporting and preaching a fresh approach to the future of money."

This time, trend is at most 2,500. It will be hard to prevent the market from declining to that level.\" (January 26) (Grantham's S&P 500 forecast suggests the benchmark stock index could plunge another 34% from its current level of around 3,800 points.)\n\n2. \"We have a market today which feels superficially like 2000, and I think it's going to play out initially like 2000. Then the deflationary effects on the economy and the stock market will result in a world rather like the 1970s, where all assets are simply much lower priced than they are today.\" (May 9)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"We are really messing with all of the assets, and this has turned out, historically, to be very dangerous.\" (May 18) (Grantham pointed to the soaring prices of stocks, bonds, housing, energy, metals, and food.)\n\n4. \"There's nothing as quick and spectacular as a bear market rally. With hindsight they signify very little, but at the time they frighten the pants off bears and they give hope that all is over, all is forgotten, and it's back to the races.\" (July 29)\n\n5. \"Bitcoin is not a good reserve of value, as we've seen. It's terrible for a currency exchange. It's expensive to transact, but worst of all, it is deadly to the environment. It's incredibly energy intensive to give you a speculative instrument to wager on, that's it. The fact that it takes our precious energy and has a carbon footprint is the worst crime of all, and the sooner it goes away, the better.\" (July 29)\n\n6. \"Each cycle is different and unique \u2014 but every historical parallel suggests that the worst is yet to come.\" (August 31)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"I believe the housing markets around the world will spend the next big chunk of time unraveling and causing all manner of, perhaps, unexpected problems.\" (September 1)\n\n8. \"This is a more dangerous-looking moment in global economics than even the madness of the housing bubble of 2007. The deterioration in fundamentals on a global basis looks absolutely shocking.\" (September 8)\n\nRead more: The world's top investment firms pay Rob Arnott for advice.

Analysts infer that the more inactivity exists, the more BTC is being hodled, thus reducing sell pressure and acting as a tailwind for bullish price action.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of Glassnode data showed the percentage of supply held for less than six months has fallen to its lowest level.\n\nBitcoin Supply Last Active falls to new lows\n\nWith the arrival of 2023, hopes are high that Bitcoin will reverse the negative price action that characterized the previous year.\n\nThe cohort of Bitcoiners who held for six months or less currently comes in at around three million BTC, which equates to 15% of the total circulating supply \u2013 the lowest-ever percentage.\n\nThe previous instance of the lowest Supply Last Active was during the bottom of the 2015 bear market, which occurred in Q4 of the year, as the metric touched 17%.

        "title": "Taking a look at Bitcoin\u2019s historic low volatility periods to find what 2023 holds - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Volatility, or the lack of it, can serve as a tool for analyzing market trends\n\nThe downtrend of Bitcoin is mostly done, but one more leg downward could be painful\n\nBitcoin [BTC] investors have faced some difficult times throughout 2022. Investors and traders who witnessed the Celsius, Terra, and FTX crises (among so many other events) have seen history unfold before their eyes.\n\nAll of this history is laid bare on the price charts, and it is possible that we can prepare for the worst-case scenario by studying these charts. Look to the past to understand the future, as somebody famous probably once said.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe periods when volatility vanishes are worth noting. For assets like Bitcoin, a fall in volatility often heralds a massive move around the corner. One of the simpler tools to measure how volatile an asset is on the price charts is the Bollinger Bands.\n\nBollinger Bands width indicator findings\n\nBollinger Bands is a tool developed by John Bollinger. It has two bands plotted with one standard deviation above and below the price (based on the past 20 periods). These bands adjust based on the volatility of the price of the underlying asset.\n\nWhen the Bollinger Bands\u2019 width decreases, it indicates a period of lower volatility or contraction on the price charts. This generally highlights a period of accumulation before a strong move upwards, especially on higher timeframes. However, it can also indicate phases of distribution, before another move downward, once buyers are exhausted.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the Bollinger Bands width indicator showed a reading of 0.09 at press time. It had receded to a low of 0.07 on 1 December and 0.06 on 25 October. Previously, the BB width indicator touched these values on the daily timeframe of 8 October, 2020.\n\nOther dates in 2020, such as 26 August (0.07), 15 July (0.04), and 21 September, 2019 (0.06), also saw extremely low values registered.\n\nNorthward expansions followed reduced volatility\n\nHistory does not repeat, but it does rhyme. All technical analysis is based on patterns that repeat themselves, over and over again. The October, August, and July contractions in 2020 came right before the recent bull run where Bitcoin ripped as high as $69k.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin was in the depths of a bear market winter at the time of writing. Throughout 2023, Bitcoin might not embark on a strong higher timeframe trend, as was seen in late 2020 until mid-2021.\n\nTherefore, there is the need to find points in time when volatility dried out after Bitcoin had retraced most of its gains from a bull run. This occurred in late 2018 and early 2019.\n\nThe above chart showcases the late 2017 rally to $19.5k, and the subsequent retracement in 2018. During the downtrend, the volatility was nearly dead in September and October 2018.\n\nThe BB width indicator showed values of 0.08 and 0.09 consistently. However, another steep drop from $6k to $3,3k followed. From December 2018 to March 2019, the bulls fought for their lives to push prices back above $4.3k.\n\nFinally, when this resistance was broken, a rally to $13k ensued. Hindsight tells us that this was not a true bull market rally. Still, it was an impressive move, north of 220% in under 90 days, once the $4.3k level was broken.\n\nTherefore, the inference was that low volatility does not automatically translate into a long-term bottom. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has lost the $18.7k level, and another drop toward $10k could occur, just like it did back in late 2018.\n\nThis rally reached a peak at $13.7k in June 2019 and receded in the months that followed. September 2019 saw volatility drop to 0.06, but it took until the COVID-19 crash before the markets found a long-term bottom and reversed.\n\nMarket structure breaks could be key to identifying rallies\n\nDespite the bounce from $4.3k, BTC was not in a reversal. That took till the higher timeframe bearish market structure was broken, as highlighted in the chart above. A move back above $9k flipped the longer-term bias in favor of the bulls, and a breakout above the $10.5k level showed bullish strength.\n\nWhat can we learn from this series of events? Compared to the present, the volatility has been low, and the trend has been downward, just like August \u2013 October 2018. From June \u2013 November 2018, the $6k level was rock-solid, until it wasn\u2019t, and prices crashed another 46%. Can the same develop over 2023?\n\nIs the $18.7k level the line in the sand that $6k was back in 2018? $18.7k was defended as support from June \u2013 November 2018, for 144 days.\n\nThis was similar to the defense of $6k from June to November 2018, but the difference was that the $6k mark had already been tested as support as early as February 2018.\n\nNow that $18.7k was lost, it was likely that more losses could follow. Long-term BTC bottoms tend to form abruptly after months of foreshadowing.\n\nAnother crash, like the one we saw during the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, or November 2018, would be necessary to force billions of dollars of liquidation before the markets can march upward.\n\nUsing Liquidation Levels Heatmap data from Hyblock, an anonymous analyst hypothesized on 29 December that $15k and $13k are the two major liquidation levels, with $50 billion worth of liquidation to be hunted in the vicinity of the $13k level.\n\n$BTC \u2013 the @hyblockcapital heat map shows 2 major liquidation levels between that 13k & 15K I previously mentioned. As shown in the previous tweet, if we can wipe out all that liquidity in a wedging fashion I really like the odds for a significant bounce. 13k to 30k hopefully. https://t.co/dm78uFuH40 pic.twitter.com/3HiqRCmG49 \u2014 TradingHubb (@TheTradingHubb) December 29, 2022\n\nThe price seeks liquidity, and this area could be too juicy to leave unattended. A descent below $15.8k could see the already fearful market conditions ripen into a panic.\n\nForced sellers, both in the spot and futures markets, could cause prices to drop further and further, and end with a liquidation cascade.\n\nPatience will likely be rewarded, but all-time highs are unlikely to be reached in 2023\n\nIn the event of a drop to $13k-$13.8k, buyers can await a move back above $15.8k and $17.6k and anticipate a rally, possibly a mirror of the one in mid-2019. As ever, it might not exactly replicate, and caution would be key.\n\nAre your BTC holdings flashing green? Check the Profit Calculator\n\nIt was not certain or even necessary that $13k would mark the bottom. The heatmaps and the highs of the rally from mid-2019 show confluence at this level.\n\nIf, instead, BTC dumped another 46% beneath the $18.7k support, investors could look at $10k as a region where the bottom could form. Which way the die would roll was uncertain.\n\nThere were 641 days between Bitcoin\u2019s breakdown beneath the $6k support level in late 2018 and the retest of $10.5k as support in Q3 2020. 641 days after November 10, 2022 gives us 12 August, 2024. However, each cycle is different, and all that a trader or investor can control is the risk they assume.\n\nLaid out above is one scenario whose central theme is liquidity and volatility. When volatility goes on a holiday, so does liquidity. A large, violent move could be necessary to shake even the fanatics out of their positions.\n\nOnly then might the market reverse. In this game of shark eat shark, the patient and the prepared survive and profit."

        "content": "The year 2022 had been plagued with news around crypto hacks and it ended on a similar note when one of the core developers of Bitcoin took to Twitter to inform that he'd lost \"basically\" all his BTC as a result of a hack.\n\n\n\nIn a 1 January Twitter post, Luke Dashjr alleged that the hacker had somehow gained access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Key. This is a widely-used security method that uses two keys to encrypt sensitive information.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMore than $3.6 million stolen\n\nDashjr posted a thread on Twitter where he mentioned the wallet address where his stolen BTC had been sent but did not talk about the amount of BTC that was stolen.\n\n\n\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nHe also told a Twitter user in the thread that he got to know about the recent hack when he received emails from Coinbase and Kraken about suspicious login attempts.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Cointelegraph report, the wallet address in question shows four transactions on 31 December with the total value amounting to $3.6 million, which is roughly 216.39 BTC.\n\n\n\nIn the thread, Dashjr mentioned that he had \"no idea\" how his account was compromised and how the hacker gained access to his security key. However, one of the users on Twitter pointed out a possible connection with an earlier Twitter post by Dashjr on 17 November where he mentioned that his server had been compromised by \"new malware/backdoors on the system\".\n\n\n\nPSA: My server was accessed this morning by an unknown person. Full analysis in progress, but take extra care that you PGP-verified any downloads. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) November 17, 2022\n\nThis incident has caught the eyes of some prominent figures in the crypto space, especially the CEO of Binance, CZ Zhao, who offered his support and condolences to Dashjr in a post. \u201cSorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor. If it comes our way, we will freeze it. If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,\" he wrote.\n\nSome suggest foul play\n\nThough many have come in support of Dashjr, there are a few who have speculated that lex security was the reason the hack could be conducted successfully. A user on Reddit suggested that Dashjr may not have taken the earlier 17 November security breach \"seriously enough\" and later suggested that Dashjr might not have kept his Bitcoin on a more secure device, suggesting that \"he had a hot wallet on the same computer he did everything else.\n\n\n\nAlso, there are a few users who feel that Dashjr might have been complacent with his seed phrase or it could have been part of a \"boating accident\". A boating accident is basically a meme repurposed by the crypto community to cite when someone is trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming that his crypto assets have been stolen. Post the hack, many crypto influencers and even CZ Zhao have cautioned the crypto community regarding the self-custody of crypto."

Bitcoin is currently being traded at the $16,584 level, with $16,500 serving as a support level. The price is attempting to move above the resistance level at $16,600. If buyers are able to sustain their efforts, it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will rise above $16,700 by this week.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cSolana saw a rebound from its recent low value of $8.19 and returned to the $9.50 price range. However, having experienced a drop of 96 percent, in order to recover, SOL may need to distance itself from Bankman-Fried, who invested significantly in the cryptocurrency and provided support to Solana projects through venture deals with FTX and market-making from Alameda Research. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading around $16,500$ & $1,200, respectively, with no major change.\u201d\n\nweTrade founder Prashant Kumar offered his take on the market scenario as well, \"The global cryptocurrency market started the new year largely flat with the global market cap under $800 billion. The two key currencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 have seen some gains in the past day and are in the green. Cardano, Polkadot saw gains of approximately 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, XRP saw a decline of 3.3 percent over the last 24 hours. 2022 saw lots of downward movement in cryptocurrency prices, investors are hoping for good news from the market this year.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin entered 2023 on a positive note as it witnessed a jump of 0.39 percent in its value. The largest altcoin Ether also registered a jump of 0.29 percent to start the new year in green. It will be interesting to see the moves of the central banks around the globe to tackle inflation which will chart the course for financial markets. Markets will remain on the edge due to the evolving covid situation in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bitcoin price predictions for 2023: rally to $250000 or crash to $5000 - TechSpot",
        "content": "Forward-looking: To say 2022 was a rough time for crypto is an understatement. Following a long period of rising prices and delighted investors, last year saw the arrival of a crypto winter that brought Bitcoin's price crashing down, bankrupted companies, and wiped over $1 trillion off the market, and that's not even mentioning the collapse of FTX. But what will 2023 bring? Analysts' predictions vary wildly, from Bitcoin almost quadrupling its previous record high and reaching $250,000, to the digital coin crashing to $5,000, which would be its lowest price since 2019.\n\nBitcoin started 2022 at close to $48,000. That's down from its highest-ever price of almost $68,000 a few months earlier, but it was still welcome news for those who invested a few years prior when BTC was under $10,000.\n\nHowever, the last 12 months have been some of crypto's worst. The collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD and its support coin Luna crushed the industry in May. It led to huge crypto businesses such as Celsius going bankrupt and the market dipping below $1 trillion as the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets crashed. Then came the FTX controversy, which has seen the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried and lawsuits against celebrities who promoted the company in TV ads.\n\nBitcoin has been hovering between $16,000 and $17,000 since mid-December. But how will the world's most popular crypto fare in 2023? CNBC round up some predictions from analysts, investors, and others within the industry.\n\nBitcoin's price over the last five years. Will it go up or down in 2023?\n\nThe most optimistic call comes from billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper. He believes Bitcoin will rally 1,400% to end the year worth $250,000. \"My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,\" Draper told CNBC. He expects things to get even better in 2024 when the halving---an event that occurs every four years in which the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half---takes place.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale is Standard Chartered's global head of research, Eric Robertsen, who believes Bitcoin's fall will continue to $5,000 next year, a drop of about 70% from its current price. Veteran investor Mark Mobius has a similarly pessimistic outlook, believing BTC will drop to $10,000 in 2023.\n\nCarol Alexander, a professor of finance at Sussex University, has better news for holders. She believes BTC will reach $30,000 in the first quarter, climbing to $50,000 in quarters three or four, thanks to whales who hold large amounts of Bitcoin stepping in to help the market.\n\nUltimately, of course, accurately predicting Bitcoin's future price is impossible. Whether the market recovers or plunges even further in 2023 is anyone's guess."

        "content": "A Bitcoin core developer has had his server hacked after his security key was compromised. The hacker has supposedly stolen over 200 BTC, worth around 3.3 million dollars.\n\nLuke Dashjr, a developer who works on Bitcoin Core, the technology and security behind the cryptocurrency, has lost over 200 Bitcoins in an apparent hack.\n\nAccording to Dashjr\u2019s Twitter, the PGP key (Pretty Good Privacy) was compromised and allowed the hacker to loot his Bitcoin from the computer they were being stored on.\n\nA PGP key is an encryption method that utilizes two different keys to lock away information. Dashjr has identified the Bitcoin wallets that some of the money was sent to, but as of yesterday, claims it has all gone.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nDashjr had been targeted in an attempted smash-and-grab on his Bitcoin stash earlier in the year but brushed it off after investigating. On his Mastodon, Dashjr stated he had \u201cpurged the backdoors\u201d implemented in the attack, but couldn\u2019t find any evidence of it being used.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nDashjr also deleted a tweet in regards to his \u201ccold wallet\u201d. This is a type of Bitcoin wallet that is kept offline to ensure maximum security. Dashjr questioned whether or not it was \u201cMaybe not as cold as intended?\u201d\n\nAccording to another developer, Peter Todd, Dashjr\u2019s active PC runs a Linux distro called Gentoo. This was also where he stored his \u201chot\u201d Bitcoin wallet. A hot wallet is one that is actively connected to the internet and can be accessed at any time.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIf a compromised piece of software made it on, as Dashjr suspects, then it was an inevitability of it getting stolen and not a targeted attack.\n\nEven the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, stated on Twitter that \u201cSelf-custody [has] a different set of risks\u201d.\n\nSuspicions around the lost Bitcoin\n\nIn response to his loss, user beeforbacon1 called it a \u201cTop tier boating accident.\u201d This in-joke alludes to claiming your cash was lost in a boating accident to avoid paying tax on it.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nOn Reddit, the hack has been discussed in detail, including some of the participants alluding to this being part of Dashjr\u2019s habit of being a \u201cserial grifter\u201d.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn 2017, a fundraiser was set up to collect money for Dashjr\u2019s house. People pointed out that with his amount of Bitcoin \u2013 at the time in 2017 it was at a peak of $19,511 per BTC \u2013 he would have insurance and be able to cover the costs himself.\n\nAt the time, another user monitored the wallet activity and saw the 3.5 BTC sent for upgrading the internet access to the house \u2013 a stretch goal \u2013 never left the wallet.\n\nOthers on Reddit have pointed out that this happening close to the tax season in the US is suspicious."
