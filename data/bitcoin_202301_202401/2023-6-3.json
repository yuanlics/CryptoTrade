        "content": "Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s cofounder and former CEO, has endorsed Democratic presidential contender Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nOn Sunday, the influential tech billionaire tweeted a Fox News YouTube video entitled \u201cRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. argues he can beat Trump and DeSantis in 2024\u201d writing, \u201cHe can and will.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he was endorsing or predicting, he replied, \u201cBoth.\u201d\n\nKennedy, a nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of his slain brother Robert F. Kennedy, is like Dorsey a strong believer in Bitcoin, which he recently described as an \u201cexercise in democracy.\u201d\n\nLast month, Kennedy delivered a well-received keynote address at a Bitcoin conference in Miami. He called Bitcoin a \u201cbulwark\u201d against \u201cgovernment and corporate expansion and intrusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use Bitcoin is inviolable,\u201d he added.\n\nHe pledged to defend the right of self-custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets. \u201cYou should be able to own your own private keys, the same as you own the keys to your car or own your wallet\u2026I don\u2019t think the government has the right to demand access to your Bitcoin key or indeed any of your passwords. To say otherwise to cede essential territory to surveillance state.\u201d\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy frequently and controversially attacked Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, over the way he handled the pandemic, accusing him of orchestrating \u201cfascism\u201d and writing a book on the topic.\n\nWhen a Twitter user commented there was \u201cnot a chance the DNC [Democratic National Committee] allows him to be nominated,\u201d Dorsey replied, \u201cEven more reason.\u201d He later added that the DNC \u201cseems more irrelevant by the day\u201d and wrote \u201cend of an empire,\u201d to which Tesla CEO and current Twitter owner Elon Musk replied with two fire emoji.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Musk tweeted that he\u2019ll host Kennedy in the Twitter Spaces audio platform on Monday afternoon. Dorsey replied to that by writing, \u201cExcellent.\u201d\n\nThe event came together quickly, with Musk asking Kennedy Friday on Twitter, \u201cWould you like to do a Spaces discussion with me next week?\u201d Kennedy replied in the affirmative, and Dorsey chimed in, \u201cThis would be great.\u201d\n\nTwitter Spaces also figured large in politics last month, when Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced his presidential bid there, although technical glitches marred the event.\n\nOn Friday evening, Musk tweeted, \u201cSystem is being upgraded & stress-tested in advance of @RobertKennedyJr interview on Monday.\u201d\n\nWhen a Twitter user commented that Kennedy\u2019s shaky voice is \u201can issue,\u201d Dorsey replied by calling it a \u201csuper power,\u201d saying it sets the candidate apart."

        "content": "From the late-1980s until the early 2000s, the Cypherpunks \u2013 a group of cryptographers, mathematicians, computer scientists and activists \u2013 worked to build what they referred to as a crypto-anarchist \u201cGalt\u2019s Gulch in cyberspace.\u201d This virtual place would be one where individuals from around the world could communicate and engage in commerce, with property rights protected, with contracts enforced, and with its own native digital currency. These Cypherpunks are widely credited to having significant involvement in the development of (or influence on) projects such as Tor, anonymous remailers, PGP for email encryption, OTR for chat encryption, BitTorrent, Wikileaks, the Silk Road market, and, of course, Bitcoin, both during the group\u2019s formal existence and thereafter.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s very existence derives from the set of ideas to which these Cypherpunks adhered, it is worth exploring its anarchic roots.\n\nAccording to Timothy C. May, one of the Cypherpunk founders and more influential members, crypto-anarchy was a concept deriving inspiration from the work of economist David D. Friedman, science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, and philosopher Ayn Rand.\n\nFriedman\u2019s book The Machinery of Freedom, first published in 1973 and now in its third edition, makes the case for anarcho-capitalism, exploring how various societies throughout history, to varying degrees, protected property, resolved disputes, enforced contracts, and provided defense without the state.\n\nFrom Vinge\u2019s work, May references the novella True Names. And, as it turns out, Friedman had an impact on Vinge\u2019s thinking too. In an interview, Vinge cites Friedman\u2019s The Machinery of Freedom as one of his own inspirations, stating that Friedman\u2019s book instigated a profound \u201cinternal intellectual revolution.\u201d\n\nFriedman\u2019s inspirations for anarchy\n\nWhere did David Friedman\u2019s own anarchy come from? His influential parents Milton and Rose Friedman were certainly no anarchists.\n\nIn an email to me, he confirms that Robert Heinlein\u2019s fictional novel The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was a primary influence. In an interview about the book Friedman states that it:\n\n\u2026provided a fictional picture of a society in which law and law enforcement are endogenous\u2026 done within the system\u2026 As far as I could tell, it was an internally consistent picture\u2026 That is as far as I could tell [from] reading it, there is no particular reason why that shouldn\u2019t have worked under those circumstances\u2026 Once I was convinced that it was possible to have a society in which law and law enforcement were internal to the market system rather than imposed from the outside, that got me interested into the question of how one could do the equivalent in something more like the world I actually lived in.\n\nFriedman is quick to point out that if he had more knowledge of history and anthropology at the time he may not have needed Heinlein\u2019s fiction to arrive at these conclusions, as he later discovered there was no shortage of real world examples.\n\nF.A. Hayek was another influence. In a recorded conversation, Friedman highlights Hayek\u2019s \u201cdistinction between an organization and a self-generated order.\u201d He (Friedman) was intrigued by the idea that \u201ca market economy does not have a purpose\u201d in the way that clubs or corporations do. This is to say that many individuals, with their own different ends, could still coordinate their plans. In Friedman\u2019s words, \u201ca set of people that have different purposes nonetheless interact and coordinate their activities.\u201d\n\nNotably, Friedman dedicated The Machinery of Freedom to both Heinlein and Hayek (among others).\n\nFriedman\u2019s influence on May\n\nTimothy May advocated for a crypto-anarchist society as far back as 1988 in his \u201cCrypto Anarchist Manifesto\u201d and later repeatedly mentioned Friedman and The Machinery of Freedom in the Cypherpunk mailing list as well as in other writings.\n\nBut beyond anarchy generally, May would have also had the opportunity to come across Friedman\u2019s writings on money. The second edition of Friedman\u2019s book The Machinery of Freedom, published in 1989 around the time that the Cypherpunks were just getting started, contains a chapter entitled \u201cThe Market for Money.\u201d This chapter (which also cites economist Lawrence H. White\u2019s work on private monies) argues that \u201cinstead of arguing about whether our government should return to the gold standard we should instead be thinking about whether the government should produce money at all,\u201d and that private monies might be devised that would \u201cnot rely on the wisdom or benevolence of the people appointed to manage the money supply.\u201d Here we see Hayek\u2019s idea of competition in money integrated into Friedman\u2019s broader anarchist ideas, which were quickly embraced by the Cypherpunks.\n\nMay\u2019s passion for crypto-anarchy was shared by Cypherpunk and computer engineer Wei Dai, whose 1998 essay \u2018b-money\u2019 described how a cryptocurrency might work (and, by the way, was listed in the references of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin whitepaper). Dai wrote in his essay that \u201cI am fascinated by Tim May\u2019s crypto-anarchy.\u201d\n\nNote: Although May had come across Murray Rothbard\u2019s ideas (yet another pioneer in anarcho-capitalist thought), I have found no mention of Rothbard in any of May\u2019s Cypherpunk-era writings. So May\u2019s writings on anarcho-capitalism, taking on a new face as \u2018crypto-anarchy,\u2019 make it clear that Friedman was the primary influence.\n\nTimothy C. May\u2019s (later) influence on Friedman\n\nMay noticed that Friedman was becoming interested in the mating of ideas between cryptography and anarchy. He wrote in the Cypherpunk mailing list how Friedman \u201cbecame a convert\u201d to crypto-anarchy and had given a talk on the matter in Los Angeles.\n\nFriedman stated in a presentation to the Independent Institute in 2001 that \u201cthe basic history of these ideas is that I stole them from from a bunch of people called \u2018Cypherpunks,\u2019 of whom the leading light is Tim May, who stole some of them from me\u2026 and then I stole the ideas back from him.\u201d Friedman even dedicated his book Future Imperfect to May (among others), and in fact, the book covers Friedman\u2019s own contributions to many of the same technological ideas that Cypherpunks dealt with.\n\nConclusion\n\nTimothy May envisioned \u2013 and some key Cypherpunks worked to create \u2013 a (sometimes) hidden digital society (inspired by the fictional works of Ayn Rand and Vernor Vinge) that would essentially exist in a state of anarchy (inspired by David Friedman). In the context of cyberspace, this meant that individuals from around the world with very different ends could coordinate their plans, thanks to interconnectivity of computers around the world, open source software, and technological breakthroughs in cryptography.\n\nBitcoin itself is a currency that might best be considered existing in a state of anarchy. It was indeed designed, but its decentralized governance operates in such a way that no single party (neither the miners, nor the full node operators, nor the programmers, nor the users, nor the exchanges, nor the wallet providers, nor the payment processors) controls it. Thus, it has governance, objective rules by which each party must follow, but as a protocol, it is entirely stateless.\n\nFriedman\u2019s reading of Heinlein\u2019s science fiction allowed him to imagine a society \u201cin which law and law enforcement were internal to the market system rather than imposed from the outside,\u201d and when he began to dig, he found many real world examples of this in practice.\n\nBeyond fiction, he also took the idea of a \u201cself-generated order\u201d to its logical conclusions: to anarchy, further than Hayek was comfortable with taking it himself. His creative way of thinking about how individuals with very different ends could coordinate their plans was instrumental in the thinking of the Cypherpunks, whose ideas and work eventually led to what we now call Bitcoin."

        "content": "As a newcomer to the world of crypto, you may have heard about the process of Bitcoin mining and wondered how long it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin. In this blog post, we will delve into the fascinating world of Bitcoin mining, explore the inner workings of the Bitcoin network, and discover why Bitcoin mining remains an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralised network, meaning it is not controlled by a central authority like a traditional bank or government. Instead, it relies on tens of thousands of computers around the world, known as nodes, to validate and secure transactions.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin:\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so does its value. Bitcoin prices have been known to fluctuate, with some experts predicting that one Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars in the future. This potential for growth has captured the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nUnderstanding the Blockchain:\n\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, ensuring transparency and security. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, which are verified by miners before being added to the blockchain.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using powerful computers, called miners, to validate and secure transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first one to find the solution adds a new block to the blockchain, earning block rewards in the form of bitcoins.\n\nHow does Bitcoin Mining work?\n\nMiners earn rewards in two ways: block rewards and transaction fees. When a new block is added to the blockchain, the miner who successfully adds it receives a fixed amount of Bitcoins, known as the block reward. They also collect transaction fees from users who want to prioritise their transactions. While solo mining is possible, it is highly unlikely for a solo miner to successfully mine a block on their own. As a result, most miners join the largest Bitcoin mining pools to increase their chances of earning rewards.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin Mining:\n\nMining operations come with their own set of risks, such as the high electricity cost and the environmental impact of using non-renewable energy sources. Many crypto-mining facilities have started to explore renewable energy options, like solar or wind power, to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWhy Do Bitcoins Need to be Mined?\n\nThe mining process is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. Without miners, transactions would be left unverified, and the decentralised nature of the network would be compromised.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThere are several factors that affect how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. These include the mining hardware you\u2019re using, the mining difficulty, and whether you\u2019re part of a mining pool or operating solo. In general, it can take anywhere from several months to years for a mining operation to mine 1 Bitcoin, depending on these factors.\n\nMining Difficulty:\n\nAs more miners join the network and contribute their computing power, the Bitcoin network adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a consistent rate of new blocks being added to the blockchain. The higher the mining difficulty, the more hash rate (or hashing power) is required to successfully mine a Bitcoin block. This means that as the network grows and more miners join, it becomes increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete and successfully mine a block.\n\nDifficulty of Bitcoin mining over the last 3 years (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty)\n\nMining Hardware:\n\nThe type of mining equipment used can have a significant impact on how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. High-performance mining hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) miners, are designed specifically for mining and provide much greater computing power than traditional Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) miners. Consequently, miners with more powerful hardware have a higher chance of successfully mining a single block, reducing the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Pools:\n\nMining pools are groups of miners who combine their computing resources to increase their chances of mining a block. By working together, miners in a pool have a higher likelihood of finding a solution to the mathematical problem and receiving block rewards. The rewards are then split among the pool members according to the mining pool fees and their individual contributions. While mining pools increase the chances of success for miners, they also reduce the amount of Bitcoin each miner receives, potentially extending the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Software:\n\nEfficient mining software can help optimise mining performance, allowing miners to utilise more computing power and increase their chances of successfully mining a block. This can help reduce the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin, especially for miners with limited hardware resources.\n\nIs Mining Bitcoin in 2023 Profitable?\n\nDetermining whether Bitcoin mining is profitable in 2023 depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, mining hardware, and mining difficulty. As the price of bitcoin continues to fluctuate, so does the potential for profit. However, increasing mining difficulty and competition have made it more challenging for individual miners to turn a profit.\n\nImportant Bitcoin Mining terms:\n\nHash rate: The hash rate is a measure of the computational power used by miners to solve the mathematical problems required to mine a Bitcoin block.\n\nHash: A hash is a fixed-length output generated by a cryptographic function from input data (in this case, transaction data).\n\nPrevious block: In the blockchain, each block contains a reference to the previous block, creating a linked chain of blocks.\n\nMining rig: A mining rig is a specialised computer designed for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nMining pool: A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their resources to increase their chances of mining a block and receiving block rewards.\n\nFAQ:\n\nHow do Bitcoin miners get paid?\n\nMiners are paid in two ways: block rewards, which are a fixed amount of bitcoins awarded to the miner who successfully mines a block, and transaction fees, which are collected from users who want to prioritise their transactions within the blockchain.\n\nHow many computers do you need to mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThe number of computers required to mine one Bitcoin depends on factors such as the mining hardware, mining difficulty, and whether you\u2019re mining solo or as part of a mining pool. In general, more powerful mining hardware and participation in a mining pool can increase the chances of successfully mining one Bitcoin.\n\nCan I mine Bitcoin on my laptop?\n\nWhile it is technically possible to mine Bitcoin using a laptop, most miners use specialised mining hardware, such as ASIC miners, which provide significantly more computational power. Mining on a laptop is not recommended, as it is unlikely to yield any significant rewards and can cause damage to your device due to overheating.\n\nCan you Mine Bitcoin for Free?\n\nThere are no truly \u201cfree\u201d methods of mining Bitcoin, as mining requires specialised hardware and consumes a significant amount of electricity, both of which come with associated costs.\n\nDo I get Taxed on Bitcoin Mining?\n\nTax regulations regarding Bitcoin mining vary by jurisdiction. In most countries, Bitcoin mining is considered a taxable event, and miners are required to report their earnings as income. It is essential to consult with a tax professional or research your local tax laws to understand your obligations as a Bitcoin miner.\n\nRemember, the world of cryptocurrencies is always changing, and staying informed is the best way to ensure you make informed decisions when it comes to investing, mining, or using digital currencies like Bitcoin. Good luck, and happy mining!"

They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.58% to 3,281.22 in the 24 hours to 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding to a 2.38% weekly loss.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite index was down 1.17% in the same period, logging a 1.38% weekly decline.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 10% over the last 24 hours to US$23.65 million, but gained 83.97% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 31.9% to US$3.82 million, but still recorded a 30% weekly increase.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$5.1 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$3.4 million and Mutant Ape Yacht Club\u2019s US$1.7 million.\n\nUncategorized Ordinals \u2013 recently popular Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of an established collection \u2013 recorded a 45.24% drop to US$1.4 million in sales over the past 24 hours, but its seven-day sales gained 7.85%.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, continued gaining momentum with a 18.34% rise in sales to US$1.35 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nNotably, the number of NFT transactions reached 8.9 million in May, the largest since February 2022, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cBefore we get too excited we need to understand that the NFT landscape is vastly different from last year,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, wrote in a commentary on Sunday.\n\n\u201cToday, we have projects like DMarket\u2019s gaming skins on Mythos Chain, which did over 2 million transactions in the past 30 days alone. Still, growth isn\u2019t measured in just sales, and the May turnaround just might indicate that mass adoption is happening right under our noses,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nBiden signs debt bill; China, Japan services sectors expand in May\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden.

        "content": "Breaking the year-long worldwide trend of declining Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto ATMs, May recorded a steep increase, with nearly 1,400 net installations.\n\nThe total number of crypto ATMs consistently declined in the first four months of 2023. During the timeframe, major economies like the United States contributed to the dwindling numbers, but Australia, Poland and Spain increased crypto ATM installations.\n\nA histogram chart shows the net change of cryptocurrency machine numbers installed and removed monthly. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nThe chart above shows that, in the first four months of 2023, the net crypto ATMs worldwide declined by 5,850. In May, however, 1,397 machines were added back to the global crypto ATM network, confirming data from Coin ATM Radar.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ATMs do not contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin network, it serves as a physical gateway for people to exchange their fiat currencies for crypto. In 2023 alone, Australia installed a total of 233 ATMs, climbing up the ranks to become the third-largest crypto ATM hub in the world.\n\nDespite a poor year-long reduction, the United States maintains a leading position \u2014 representing 84.7% of crypto ATMs worldwide, followed by Canada at 7.6%.\n\nRelated: Australia ranks 3rd in crypto ATM installations after US and Canada\n\nAt the time of writing, 35,069 ATMs remain operational worldwide.

        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nBitcoin wallets are a critical cog in the rise of digital currency adoption globally. Today, wallets have gone beyond the safe custody of users\u2019 funds and offer features such as remittances, on/off ramps, day-to-day payments, direct bank withdrawals, and more. But what goes toward making the perfect Bitcoin wallet? This was the question the industry\u2019s leaders in the field sought to answer on Day 1 of the London Blockchain Conference.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by the BSV Blockchain Association\u2019s Kevin Healy on the technical stage. The panelists were Centbee founder Lorien Gamaroff, 4chain Studio CEO Michal Pawelski, DotWallet founder Lin Zheming, and TAAL\u2019s Liam Missim.\n\nThe discussion starts with Healy asking whether new entrants must build their own solutions from scratch or leverage existing wallets. Lin pointed out that it all depends on the needs of the users.\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the user,\u201d Pawelski concurred. \u201cThere are a lot of solutions already out there. Do we need another wallet, or another application that we surrender our crucial data to? For simple UTXO management, you can use existing tools that are battle tested.\u201d\n\nThe panelists noted that security is one of the key concerns for anyone building a wallet. Missin says some formats, such as web wallets, have higher security risks. He believes the industry needs more standards to allow different interfaces to interact easily.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a major topic,\u201d Gamaroff added. He revealed that Bitcoin wallets are \u201cconstantly attacked, all the time.\u201d Some, like Centbee, offer non-custodial solutions, easing the burden on security. However, he admitted that this is a band-aid solution as an average user doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of securing their private keys.\n\nThe panelists delved into the dire need for regulations in the industry, having Bitcoin wallets at the operating system (OS) level, and the role that financial institutions play in the industry.\n\nThe challenges of wallet development\n\nOn challenges faced, the panelists noted that regulators have not caught up with the rapid pace of industry developments. Centbee, for instance, has failed in its quest to be regulated like other remittance companies despite offering the same services through Minit Money.\n\n\u201cIf we could get these licenses\u2014since we\u2019re performing the same function but using a different rail\u2014we could enjoy some benefits like easy access to bank accounts,\u201d Gamaroff said.\n\nA few high-profile delistings have also thrown a spanner in the works for the wallets, which must adapt quickly. Some popular hardware wallets also don\u2019t support BSV blockchain, making it even more critical for BSV blockchain wallets to secure their platforms as they hold large sums of funds for their users.\n\nMost wallets offer both web and mobile platforms. According to Lin, the choice of platform depends on the target audience.\n\nAnother key challenge for Bitcoin wallets has been the ever-evolving industry standards impeding interoperability. Gamaroff noted that most exchanges still use legacy systems and addresses and have yet to adopt features such as Paymail and simplified payment verification (SPV).\n\n\u201cIt makes things more complex, and so you have to support everything. Eventually, hopefully, we can scale it down to just a few standards which the entire ecosystem can buy into,\u201d he added.\n\nYet another challenge has been integrating legacy payment systems for off-and-on-ramps. Some, like Centbee, have resorted to providing their liquidity ecosystem where users can cash out directly to make payments or buy gift cards.\n\n\u201cAs adoption comes, these problems will go away,\u201d Missin summed it up.\n\nWatch: How To Create a Wallet?\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "After Bitcoin's First Monthly Loss is Big Eyes Coin to Reign? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As Bitcoin experiences its first monthly loss in 2023, it\u2019s crucial to explore the similarities and differences between Bitcoin and another emerging cryptocurrency that is taking the crypto world by storm \u2013 Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nWhile Bitcoin has long been the face of the crypto market, Big Eyes Coin aims to revolutionize the industry by combining meme coin appeal with a focus on community-driven utility and environmental protection. Not to forget that it plans to build a full-fledged ecosystem just like Bitcoin. In this article, we will delve into the key aspects of both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin, analyzing their goals, mechanisms, and potential impact on the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Pioneer Of The Cryptocurrency Realm\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as BTC, stands as the pioneer of cryptocurrencies. Introduced by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity and market dominance. It operates on a decentralized network called blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin holds significant value and serves as a store of wealth for many investors. Its decentralized nature, coupled with strong security protocols, attracts individuals seeking financial sovereignty and protection against inflation. Despite facing market volatility, Bitcoin has consistently rebounded and demonstrated resilience, fostering trust among its user base.\n\nThe BIG Bridge Between Memes, Community, And Sustainability\n\nBig Eyes Coin, on the other hand, takes a unique approach to the crypto industry. This meme-inspired cryptocurrency combines the allure of meme coins with a strong emphasis on community engagement and environmental conservation. The project revolves around Big Eyes, a cat with big eyes, who embarked on a global journey to raise awareness about ocean conservation and blockchain.\n\nBy leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a crypto casino, Big Eyes Coin aims to create an ecosystem that fosters rapid growth while offering exclusive content and events to its community. Members are rewarded with tokens, NFTs, and early access to news and updates, promoting active participation and ownership within the ecosystem. Moreover, the project\u2019s commitment to charitable causes further amplifies its appeal, resonating with individuals who seek meaningful investments.\n\nThe Showdown: Bitcoin Vs. Big Eyes Coin\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin operate within the same cryptocurrency realm, they have distinct features and objectives. Bitcoin, as the market leader, primarily focuses on establishing itself as a decentralized digital currency and a long-term store of value. Its limited supply and proven track record attract both institutional investors and individual enthusiasts seeking to secure their wealth.\n\nIn contrast, Big Eyes Coin positions itself as a community-driven meme coin with a strong emphasis on environmental protection and charitable causes. It aims to engage users through exclusive content and events, leveraging the appeal of its mascot \u2013 the Big Eyes cat. By combining meme culture with a purpose-driven approach, Big Eyes Coin seeks to capture the interest of meme coin lovers and investors looking for both entertainment and utility.\n\nAs Bitcoin faces its first monthly loss in 2023, it\u2019s essential to explore alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique value propositions. While Bitcoin remains a prominent player in the crypto market, Big Eyes Coin introduces an innovative approach by merging meme coin appeal with community engagement and environmental protection. Both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin cater to distinct audiences, each with its own investment preferences and objectives.\n\nBy examining the dynamics of these cryptocurrencies, investors and meme coin enthusiasts can make well-informed decisions, considering factors such as market trends, utility, and long-term sustainability. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, understanding the similarities and differences between cryptocurrencies becomes crucial for navigating this exciting and rapidly changing landscape.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The United States equities markets welcomed the debt ceiling deal and the May nonfarm payrolls data on June 2 with strong rallies. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% during the week while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 2%. This was the sixth successive week of gains for the Nasdaq, the first such occasion since January 2020.\n\nIn addition to the above, the expectation that the Federal Reserve will be in a pause mode during its next meeting may have acted as a catalyst for the rally. CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool is showing a 75% probability of a pause, with the remaining 25% expecting a 25 basis points hike at the June 14 meeting.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nRallies in the equities markets failed to trigger a similar performance in Bitcoin (BTC) and the altcoins. However, a minor positive is that several major cryptocurrencies have stopped falling and are trying to start a recovery.\n\nCould bulls maintain the momentum and surmount the respective overhead resistance levels? If they do, which are the top five cryptocurrencies that may lead the rally?\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading close to the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,233) for the past three days. This suggests that the bulls are buying the dip near $26,500.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the buyers if they drive the price above the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. That may start a northward march toward $31,000.\n\nIf the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the BTC/USDT pair may spend some more time inside the channel. The critical level to watch on the downside is $25,250. A break and close below this support may intensify selling and tug the price toward $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the immediate resistance of $27,350. On the downside, the pair has been forming higher lows in the near term, indicating demand at lower levels. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the overhead resistance. If that happens, the pair may soar to the resistance line of the descending channel.\n\nIf bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to quickly sink the price below the nearest support at $26,505. The next stop on the downside could be $26,360 and then $25,800.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nCardano (ADA) has been repeatedly finding support at the uptrend line but the bulls have failed to kick the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($0.38).\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA breakout from this tight range trading is likely to happen within the next few days. If bulls shove and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, it will clear the path for a possible rally to $0.42 and then to $0.44.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA and dips below the uptrend line, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction. The ADA/USDT pair could then plunge to the strong support at $0.30.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the $0.38 level is behaving as a strong obstacle. However, the rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls have the upper hand. If buyers thrust the price above $0.38, the pair could climb to $0.40 and thereafter to $0.42.\n\nIf the price turns down sharply from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that bears have seized control in the near term. The pair may then collapse to $0.36 and later to $0.35.\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nAfter staying below the downtrend line for several days, Quant (QNT) turned around and started a recovery on May 26. The bulls continued their purchase and pushed the price above the moving averages on May 29, indicating a potential trend change.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is a barrier at $120 but if bulls overcome it, the QNT/USDT pair could rise to $128 and subsequently to $135.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from $120, the bears will try to yank the price to the 20-day EMA ($110). This remains the key level to keep an eye on because a break below it will indicate that bears are back in control.\n\nQNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is stuck inside a trading range between $114.50 and $120. The 20-EMA is flattish but the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the momentum remains bullish. If bulls clear the hurdle at $120, the pair is likely to start the next leg of the up-move.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down and plummets below $114.50, it will suggest that bears have a slight edge. The pair may then slump to $110 and later to $102. The deeper the fall, the greater the time needed for the recovery to resume.\n\nRelated: Cryptocurrency markets\u2019 low volatility: A curse or an opportunity?\n\nRender Token price analysis\n\nWhile most major cryptocurrencies are struggling to start a recovery in a downtrend, Render Token (RNDR) has started a new upward move.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RNDR/USDT pair dipped to the 20-day EMA ($2.48) on May 31 but the bulls successfully defended the level. This shows a positive sentiment where traders are buying the dips to strong support levels. The pair could retest the 52-week high of $2.95. If this resistance is overcome, the pair may soar to $3.75.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will indicate aggressive profit-booking by the short-term bulls. That may open the doors for a possible drop to the 50-day SMA ($2.20).\n\nRNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. Buyers will try to push the price above the overhead resistance zone between $2.90 and $2.95. If they succeed, the pair may start a new uptrend.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are on a comeback. A break and close below $2.42 will indicate the start of a downward move toward $2.25.\n\nRocket Pool price analysis\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) has been trading inside an ascending channel pattern for the past several days. A positive sign in the short term is that the bulls have kept the price above the moving averages. This indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nRPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RPL/USDT pair has been trading inside a tight range for the past few days. This suggests that a range expansion could be around the corner. If the price breaks and closes above $50.50, it will suggest the start of an up-move to the resistance line of the channel. The bears are expected to defend this level with all their might.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages. The pair could then plummet to the support line of the channel.\n\nRPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are sustaining the price above the moving averages,but they have failed to clear the overhead hurdle at $50.37. This suggests that bears continue to sell on minor rallies.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will indicate that the bulls have given up. The pair may then plummet to the support line near $46.\n\nContrarily, if buyers propel and sustain the price above $50.50, the bullish momentum may pick up and the pair could rally to $53.50.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum holding price better than Bitcoin, can Avorak Trade explain why? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Avorak Trade has been making waves in the crypto market while still in development. With the Ethereum (ETH) holding price better than Bitcoin (BTC), investors wonder whether Avorak Trade can help.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) price\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. The correlation between the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) prices was close to 1.0, which made it less crucial to track. However, recent reports indicate a decline in the correlation, dropping from 0.95 in mid-March to 0.82 in mid-April. ETH is gaining more value in relation to BTC as time progresses. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including Ethereum\u2019s recent technical upgrades. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s diversified ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more, sets it apart from Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a payment method. Investors increasingly recognize Ethereum\u2019s potential, and some speculate that with a stronger and more diversified ecosystem, Ethereum could eventually flip Bitcoin. However, the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and it remains to be seen whether Ethereum (ETH) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) and become the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nWhat is Avorak Trade?

        "title": "Is Biden's controversial Bitcoin mining tax dead or set to rise from the ashes? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States can breathe a sigh of relief after a proposed tax on crypto mining did not make it into a bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling that appears set to pass.\n\nThe Digital Assets Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax proposal sought to charge crypto miners a tax equal to 10% of the cost of the electricity they used for mining in 2024, before scaling up to 30% in 2026.\n\nThe tax was highly controversial, with critics arguing that it had the potential to increase global emissions as a result of miners being forced to go overseas where countries may produce more emissions during energy production.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin miners seek out cheap energy, and as one of the cheapest sources of energy is excess renewable energy, Bitcoin miners can actually incentivize its production by providing utilities with a buyer for energy that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThe news broke after Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms vice president of research Pierre Rochard noted on May 28 that the proposed bill did not include any mention of the DAME tax, which Representative Warren Davidson replied was \u201cone of the victories\u201d of the bill.\n\nYes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes. \u2014 Warren Davidson (@WarrenDavidson) May 29, 2023\n\nDead and buried or set to return?\n\nWhile much of the online discussion around the news suggested the proposal was \u201cdead,\u201d others, such as Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter, highlighted that it was only temporarily defeated, alluding to the possibility of it being included in future bills.\n\nBitcoin mining \"DAME\" tax defeated (for now)\n\n\n\nBiden CEA, specifically Heather Boushey, hold this L https://t.co/hJgZ7oUGub \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) May 29, 2023\n\nCarter suggested later in a May 29 Twitter thread that the administration would likely attempt to sneak it into some omnibus bill and would already have done so if it had the political currency to do so.\n\nBut bills are required to pass both through Congress and the House, and considering the Republican party is generally opposed to increases in taxes and currently controls the House, it seems unlikely such an omnibus bill would be able to make it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nWhile speaking to Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO Perianne Boring during a May 20 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Senator Cynthia Lummis assured viewers that the DAME tax \u201cisn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nLummis added that ensuring Bitcoin mining firms remain in the U.S. was important for both national security and energy security, highlighting how Bitcoin mining can both reduce gas flaring emissions and help stabilize the energy grid.\n\nCointelegraph contacted the White House asking whether it planned to continue pursuing the DAME tax but did not receive a response.\n\nIs the damage already done?\n\nIn response to questions from Cointelegraph, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel suggested that, regardless of whether President Joe Biden\u2019s administration decides to keep pursuing the DAME tax, it will continue its anti-crypto agenda, saying:\n\n\u201cI think it is clear that this administration will continue to broadly oppose the crypto sector, and even if this specific tax is no longer on the table, it is likely not the last of misguided, targeted efforts to bring this industry down.\u201d\n\nMany from within the crypto industry and even some U.S. lawmakers agree with this take, arguing that, among other measures, the U.S. government is making a coordinated effort to discourage banks from working with crypto firms \u2014 aka Choke Point 2.0 \u2014 under the guise of ensuring the financial system remains stable and safe.\n\nWhen businesses make long-term decisions, they generally seek to reduce risk. So, given the choice of operating in a region with clear, crypto-friendly policies compared to one where regulations are unclear, and there is a greater potential for policies that hurt the competitiveness of U.S.-based activity, firms will generally choose the former.\n\nThiel highlighted how the actions of the U.S. government and regulators weigh in on business decisions while speaking to Cointelegraph, saying, \u201cRegardless of the DAME tax\u2019s likelihood of passing, Marathon has already begun diversifying the locations of our operations.\u201d\n\nAsia Express: Yuan stablecoin team arrested, WeChat\u2019s new Bitcoin prices, HK crypto rules\n\nThiel added that \u201cwith regulation around mining being so nebulous,\u201d his firm has made the strategic decision not to concentrate its footprint in the U.S. but rather diversify its operations.\n\nHe pointed to a May 9 announcement from his firm, which said it would be building two new mining facilities in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi is a region that has made a concerted effort to attract crypto-related investment via its clear regulatory regime, which has been hailed as pro-market."
