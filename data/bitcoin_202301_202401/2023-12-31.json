        "title": "These are the boldest bitcoin predictions for 2024 \u2014 one calls for a 1,000% rally to $500,000 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin had a huge rally in 2023, with the digital currency up some 152% for the year. And a number of commentators CNBC spoke to \u2014 both inside and outside of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 expect the rise to continue. After hitting a record high in 2021, bitcoin had a rough 2022, which was marked by the collapse of high-profile projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies. That year, FTX, once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy. In 2023, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S. Also in 2023, Binance's Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.\n\nNow that those two high-profile cases are out the way, many cryptocurrency executives see it as a chance to move forward and draw a line under the bad behavior of two of the industry's poster children. With fervor returning to the crypto markets, industry executives are calling the start of a new bull run, mainly predicated on two things \u2014 the bitcoin \"halving\" and the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, there is growing excitement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF, after years of opposition. This would mean investors can buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin, without having to go on to an exchange and hold the digital currency directly. The industry is hoping this will draw in a wider range of investors, and in particular, large institutional investors. With all of this excitement comes some quite bold predictions about bitcoin's price. Here's a selection of some of them.\n\nMark Mobius: $60,000\n\nIn 2022, Mark Mobius correctly forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000. He had a price call of $10,000 thereafter, which he stuck to in 2023. However, that did not materialize, as bitcoin rallied. For 2024, Mobius told CNBC that bitcoin could reach $60,000 by the end of the year. \"No rationale for that prediction,\" Mobius said, except that a bitcoin ETF looks likely and \"that has heightened interest\" in the cryptocurrency.\n\nBit Mining: $75,000\n\nYouwei Yang, chief economist of crypto mining firm Bit Mining, believes that bitcoin could reach a high of $75,000 by 2024. Yang attributes the anticipated price rise to a bitcoin ETF being approved, leading to higher institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as May 2024's bitcoin halving, which would result in the bitcoin supply being constrained. \"I anticipate the Bitcoin will be trading around $25K to $75K in 2024, and $45K to $130K in 2025,\" Yang said in an emailed note. \"While high prices are possible, not all investors will profit due to market volatility and the human tendencies of fear and greed.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's price performance over the last year.\n\nYang said the ETF approval remains the biggest story for bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 though investors should hold a degree of caution on timing given the wounds left by collapses of major crypto firms like Luna and FTX, and as it is an election year when the topic of crypto is likely to become more of a political issue. \"Timing the market is hard, but a gradual approach \u2014 accumulating in bear markets and taking profits in bull markets \u2014 might be a more effective strategy for whom don't have early-on accumulations.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the landscape for digital assets is set for \"significant change\" in 2024, driven by the potential approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \"This long-awaited development is poised to expand the investor base for cryptocurrencies and integrate them more closely with traditional financial markets,\" Butterfill told CNBC via email. \"Estimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000.\" Meanwhile, the scenario of central banks cutting interest rates could also \"play a decisive role\" in moving bitcoin higher, Butterfill added. The market will be also looking at factors beyond the halving \u2014 which he considers already priced into bitcoin \u2014 that could influence the price of the digital coin further. \"Thus, while the halving is a known event, other elements, particularly the potential for interest rate reductions, are likely to be significant in shaping Bitcoin's price in the future,\" Butterfill said.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, a noted bitcoin bull and co-founder of Nexo, a cryptocurrency exchange, believes bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024. In 2022, he called for bitcoin to hit $100,000, but that didn't happen. Instead, the price of bitcoin collapsed that year. He held off from any further price predictions. But in a note in December, Trenchev reinstated his $100,000 call for 2024, citing the halving and potential approval of multiple bitcoin ETFs. \"My expectation for 2024 is that the twin-turbo boost from the Bitcoin halving & spot ETF approval should propel Bitcoin to $100,000, with the prospect of further highs in 2025,\" Trenchev said in a note. \"The road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin.\" Trenchev added that the biggest gains will come from digital tokens and projects \"that aren't even on the radar yet.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $100,000\n\nIn November, Standard Chartered doubled down on its $100,000 call for bitcoin made in April. The bank said this will be driven by the approval of numerous ETFs. The halving will also be supportive for bitcoin, the bank said.\n\nCarol Alexander: $100,000\n\nIn 2022, University of Sussex professor of finance Carol Alexander had a fairly successful run of calling bitcoin's future price. She predicted bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. That year, bitcoin fell as low as around $15,480, according to CoinDesk data. For 2023, Alexander said bitcoin would rally as high as $50,000. Bitcoin reached a yearly high of roughly $44,700 in early December. Alexander told CNBC that during the first quarter of 2024, bitcoin will trade within the $40,000 to $55,000 range, owing to \"professional traders creating volatility.\" The next stage will depend on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settles charges against Coinbase and Binance, which could be required before approval of a bitcoin ETF, according to Alexander, echoing other commentators. The SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance in 2023.\n\nAlexander said settlement of those charges is likely in either the second or third quarter, after which ETFs will be approved and bitcoin's price will rise to $70,000, a new all-time high. The price after that depends on the abilities of the ETF providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, \"to equip their market makers not only to create the ETFs, but also to defend price manipulations\" on exchanges which create \"excessive volatility.\" \"Before end of 2024 price could exceed $100k, but only if Blackrock and Fidelity market maker algorithms have the ability to reduce volatility,\" Alexander concluded.\n\nMatrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note in November projecting that bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\" Many commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin, which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife, though many disagree with this theory.\n\nCoinFund: Up to $500,000"

        "title": "Bullish on Bitcoin? Might as Well Buy MicroStrategy Shares, Says Canaccord - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "It\u2019s probably been the holiday season all year long at the Michael Saylor household. The MicroStrategy (MSTR) founder & chairman is one of the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin bulls and must have enjoyed watching the asset outperform in 2023. To wit, the leading crypto is seeing out 2023 up by 155%.\n\nThe last 3 months have been particularly bountiful, with BTC gaining 56% over the period. Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi has a clear idea about what\u2019s been driving the gains. \u201cAs we have stated multiple times,\u201d said the 5-star analyst, \u201cwe believe BTC spot continues to move higher in anticipation of US spot BTC ETF approvals in January.\u201d\n\nNever one to think there\u2019s such a thing as too much bitcoin, in the meantime, Saylor has been loading up. After purchasing ~16,130 bitcoins for $593 million during November (at an average price of $36,785 per bitcoin), last week MicroStrategy disclosed that it had bought another 14,620 bitcoins throughout December. At an average price of $42,110 each, that purchase set the company back another $616 million. As of December 26, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC stack stood at 189,150, with an overall average acquisition price of ~$31,200 per bitcoin. At the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth $42,375.\n\nAs Vafi notes, investors looking to get in on the bitcoin game can just stay in the stock market and purchase MSTR stock. While bitcoin\u2019s direct returns have obviously been excellent, MSTR shares are up by a phenomenal 346% this year. Here, Vafi also has an explanation for the disparity between BTC\u2019s display and that of MSTR shares. \u201cPartially driving MSTR\u2019s relative outperformance versus BTC remains scarcity premium for equity investors looking for exposure to BTC,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhile there are other equity plays with exposure to BTC, they bring with them materially higher operating risk (COIN & the Bitcoin miners, for example). While MSTR has some operating risk in its business, we would quantify it as much less on a comparative basis as its BI software business is sticky, highly recurring, and cash flow rich.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it\u2019s the bitcoin holdings that are the main story here. By now, Vafi estimates that MicroStrategy\u2019s software business represents less than 15% of the overall enterprise value, with the vast majority now down to the company HODLing (what refers to the buy-and-hold strategy) 189,150 bitcoins. \u201cIn comparison,\u201d Vafi notes, \u201cmost other equity plays with crypto exposure do so by virtue of their business operations; and few have a HODL of any material size.\u201d\n\nBottom-line, due to the ongoing price appreciation in BTC combined with \u201cfurther accretive additions to the HODL,\u201d Vafi thinks it\u2019s time for a new price target for MSTR shares. His objective moves from $670 to $791, making room for further gains of 25% from current levels. (To watch Vafi\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOver the past 3 months, only 2 other analysts have waded in with MSTR reviews, but like Vafi, they are also bulls, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $713.67, implying share gains of 13% for the coming year.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will hinge on regulatory environments, public perception, and institutional adoption.\n\nRegulatory changes will crucially impact Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth prospects in 2024.\n\nIncreased corporate and institutional engagement is expected to significantly boost Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nGlobal economic factors, including inflation and market shifts, will closely influence Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has been subject to notable price swings, capturing the interest of individual traders, significant investors, and the public alike. The price of Bitcoin can rise significantly, driven by increased adoption, limited supply, and growing institutional interest.\n\nFactors That Affect The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin volatility and discovery requires insight into several critical aspects that impact Bitcoin price movement. Key factors that contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility include:\n\nBitcoin Regulatory Environment\n\nGovernment stances significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s path. Positive and clear regulations can enhance investor trust and lead to growth, while strict rules or prohibitions can cause instability.\n\nPublic Perception Of Crypto\n\nHow Bitcoin is viewed by the public, influenced by media, influential figures, and overall market behavior, can significantly affect its value.\n\nCorporate And Institutional Engagement\n\nAs more prominent businesses and financial entities adopt and utilize cryptocurrency, it lends greater legitimacy and potentially boosts its value.\n\nGlobal Economic Factors\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation, recessions, and stock market shifts, often parallel impact Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSupply-Demand Dynamics\n\nLike any traded asset, Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by supply and demand. The halving events diminish the available supply and could push prices up, especially if demand remains consistent.\n\nWhat Will Bitcoin Be Worth In 2024? Experts\u2019 Insights\n\nSeveral experts in the field, both individual and institutional, are bullish on the price of Bitcoin moving into the year 2024. These forecasts can be seen below:\n\nCathie Wood | CEO Ark Invest | $600K\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Invest predicts Bitcoin could reach $650,000 in 2024 to $1.5 million by 2030, with her optimism spawning from a potential spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, contrasting with centralized entities like FTX.\n\nThis prediction entails a crypto market cap representing over half of a projected $25 trillion total crypto market, emphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s role as a unique global digital monetary system.\n\nMike Novogratz | CEO Galaxy Digital | $500K\n\nMike Novogratz, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has significantly revised his earlier bullish predictions for Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2021, he had anticipated Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2024, even planning a commemorative tattoo for the milestone. Novogratz maintains a long-term optimistic view, believing Bitcoin will eventually hit $500,000, though not within the next five years.\n\nHis current outlook is influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s firm stance on interest rates, which Novogratz has forecasted as a barrier to a rapid return to Bitcoin\u2019s previous highs.\n\nTim Draper | Billionaire Investor | $250K\n\nBillionaire investor Tim Draper, known for his early advocacy of cryptocurrency, has adjusted his prediction for Bitcoin\u2019s value. Initially, Draper forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by June 2023.\n\nHowever, he recently acknowledged that this target might be delayed until 2025, attributing the postponement to unexpected aggressive enforcement actions by the U.S. government, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), against crypto companies.\n\nDraper remains optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s value and underlying technology, envisioning a future where financial transactions and operations are conducted entirely in Bitcoin, leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency and efficiency.\n\nMax Keiser | American Broadcaster | $220K\n\nMax Keiser, a seasoned financial broadcaster and Bitcoin advocate, has long been known for his outspoken and sometimes controversial predictions.\n\nKeiser\u2019s unique insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and broader global economic implications provide a thought-provoking perspective. Max advocated for Bitcoin when it was just $1 and has been one of the earliest adopters and most influential figures in the space.\n\nFundstrat | Research Firm | $180K\n\nFundstrat, a prominent research firm, has set an ambitious target for Bitcoin, predicting it could soar to $180,000 by its 2024 halving.\n\nThis forecast is based on two major factors being: the potential launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the historical influence of previous halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFundstrat\u2019s projection reflects a bullish stance on Bitcoin\u2019s future, buoyed by these significant market developments and anticipated changes in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nStandard Chartered | Investment Bank | $120K\n\nStandard Chartered has revised its Bitcoin price forecast, now estimating it will hit $50,000 by the close of 2023 and then escalate to $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThis projection represents an upward revision from the bank\u2019s earlier forecast, which anticipated Bitcoin reaching a value of $100,000 by the conclusion of 2024, showcasing an increasingly optimistic view of Bitcoin\u2019s market potential in the next few years.\n\nRobert Koyosaki | Author Investor | $120K\n\nNumerous well-known individuals have forecasted that Bitcoin will eventually reach $100,000.\n\nAmong them is Robert Kiyosaki, the American investor and author of \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad,\u201d who predicts a potential surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $120,000 by 2024, driven by a decline in the U.S. dollar.\n\nAdam Back | Computer Scientist | $100K\n\nAdam Back, renowned as a pioneering figure in the Bitcoin community, projects that the cryptocurrency will hit the $100,000 mark by March 31, 2024.\n\nHis prediction considers the pivotal role of Bitcoin miners and the anticipated impact of the upcoming halving event. According to Back, this event, set to reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, could propel its value close to $100K, setting the stage for a significant milestone in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation journey.\n\nJesse Myers | OnRamp Capital | $100K\n\nJesse Myers of OnRamp Capital believes that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 mark only after the 2024 block subsidy halving.\n\nHe anticipates that it will take the market between a year to 18 months to fully adjust to the effects of the halving. This perspective suggests a more gradual increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value, following the pattern set by the significant event in the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem, which alters the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated.\n\nArthur Hayes | CEO BitMEx | $70K\n\nBitMEX\u2019s founder, Arthur Hayes, envisions Bitcoin potentially reaching $70,000 by 2024 amid a more conservative short-term outlook.\n\nHe predicts a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value, with a long-term projection of $750,000 to $1 million by 2026. In his recent interview , Hayes pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in regulated markets, and geopolitical uncertainties as significant factors driving this anticipated growth.\n\nHe underscored the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply at 21 million coins, which he believes will fuel demand. Additionally, Hayes anticipates a bullish trend across all asset markets, influenced by central bank policies.\n\nWhile his predictions for the near future are modest, with Bitcoin possibly hovering around $38,000 this year, his long-term forecast is notably optimistic.\n\nBerenberg | Investment Bank | $56.6K\n\nThe investment bank Berenberg has updated its forecast for Bitcoin, setting a target of $56,630 for April 2024. This revised prediction is shaped by the anticipated 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to impact the supply dynamics significantly and increase interest from institutional investors.\n\nConsidering these key market developments, Berenberg\u2019s projection reflects a cautious yet optimistic outlook on Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nJP Morgan | Investment Bank | $45K\n\nJP Morgan analysts predict Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $45,000 in 2024, a slight premium to its current trading price. Bitcoin trades at $38,000 (at the time of writing), approximately 20% below JP Morgan\u2019s forecast.\n\nThis bullish outlook is partly based on the belief that investors see Bitcoin as interchangeable with gold and also considers the impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for next April or May. This represents a notable change in the narrative around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe price of Bitcoin in 2024 is expected to be influenced by regulatory policies, public perception, institutional adoption, global economic conditions, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nExpert predictions vary, with estimates ranging from $45,000 to $600,000. These projections reflect optimism about Bitcoin\u2019s future amid challenges in a dynamic market, highlighting its potential growth and continued relevance in the financial landscape.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat factors will influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will be shaped by regulatory environments, public perception, corporate engagement, global economics, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nHow will regulatory changes impact Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nGovernment regulations will significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth in 2024, with clear policies potentially boosting investor trust.\n\nWhat Role will institutional adoption play in Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 valuation?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value in 2024 could rise with increased corporate and institutional engagement, lending legitimacy and boosting its value.\n\nHow might global economic factors affect Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation and market shifts, will likely parallel Bitcoin\u2019s valuation in 2024."

        "title": "Bitcoin Outlook 2024: What are the emerging themes to watch out for? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the investment universe gets ready to bid adieu, all signs point to the popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies getting bigger and better in 2024. As we step into 2024, the landscape of the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency, remains at the forefront. Bitcoin 's journey has been marked by both triumphs and challenges, and the year 2024 promises to bring about new trends and emerging themes that will shape the future of this decentralized digital asset. Before we get excited or curious about what 2024 is about to bring us, let us remember that studies and trends have showing an explosion of trends in cryptocurrency that investors can try to participate in. However, for the sake of this article, let us try to explore a handful of these themes that we can look forward to in the New Year.Despite the well-documented challenges faced by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent years, there has been a notable uptick of institutional interest in Bitcoin. All signs point to this intensifying in 2024, with more traditional financial institutions and corporations exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios. As regulatory clarity improves, it will only serve to strengthen Bitcoin's reputation as a store of value with institutions looking at using it increasingly as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.Another challenge that Bitcoin has been dealing with for a few decades is that of Scalability, leading to slow transaction processing times and higher fees during periods of high demand. In 2024, seeing the rise in fees, adoptability of layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network would see an increase. Lightning significantly enhances Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput. This would make microtransactions more feasible and contribute to a more efficient and scalable network.Consumption of energy by cryptocurrencies expended during mining of crypto has been a hot topic of debate and has been concerning environmentalists and environment-conscious folks for years. While there is no telling with absolute certainty if this problem is one that will be solved or not. However, in 2024, the industry is likely to witness increased efforts to address the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, data storage, etc. Innovations in sustainable mining practices, the use of renewable energy sources, and the development of eco-friendly consensus algorithms may emerge as key themes, aligning Bitcoin with broader environmental goals.The fast-growing technology that is soon if not already challenging the existing centralized monetary system, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has gained tremendous momentum in the cryptocurrency space. Come 2024, and it is expected that Bitcoin will expect to be more widely accepted to play a more active role in this ecosystem. Projects exploring the integration of Bitcoin with DeFi applications could open up new avenues for lending, borrowing, and trading, allowing users to leverage Bitcoin in a decentralized financial landscape. 2024 will also more than likely see the connection of more TradFi and DeFi bridges and gateways which will bring about a constant flurry of the development of innovative hybrid financial products. An increase in the number of connections will facilitate the seamless flow of capital between traditional / centralised finance and DeFi thereby legitimising the world of crypto in India.It is widely expected across the cryptocurrency world that India will announce and implement a proper set of regulatory guidelines for the protection and understanding of its 20 million investors in 2024. It is no secret that clearer regulatory frameworks may provide a sense of security for investors and businesses, fostering a more robust and stable ecosystem. The institution of these much-needed guidelines will go a long way in bringing about a great deal of clarity and regulation from various jurisdictions, which could positively impact the adoption and use of Bitcoin on a global scale.Privacy remains a fundamental concern in the cryptocurrency space, and in all likelihood 2024, will see an increased emphasis on privacy enhancements, such as the integration of technologies like CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions. These features could offer users greater privacy and fungibility, making Bitcoin transactions more confidential and resistant to surveillance.Often dubbed \"digital gold\" and a hedge against economic uncertainties, with as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties likely to persist at least through H1 2024. Bitcoin may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value and a diversification strategy. While Bitcoin is primarily known for its role as a digital currency, developments in 2024 may pave the way for the integration of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. This would bring additional functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for more complex programmable transactions and potentially expanding its use cases.Over the course of the last few years, the process of altering real-world assets into digital tokens, is gaining some serious momentum. 2024 is expected to see tokenizing of traditional assets, such as financial assets, commodities, real estate, or even intellectual property, fractional ownership can be created, liquidity could be enhanced liquidity, while allowing for democratize access to these modern asset classes. 2023 saw a rise in Ordinals making use of the Taproot upgrade. Ordinals are basically NFTs on bitcoin. Ordinals emphasizes Premium art and we predict this market would see a substantial rise with many startups emerging in 2024. This is one of the factors of driving fees up. In the New Year, investors can expect further advancements in tokenization protocols and the emergence of tokenized assets enabling individuals the opportunity to invest in a wider range of assets using lesser amounts of capital. With greater tokenisation comes a more viable opportunity for institutional investors to diversify their investment portfolio.The Bitcoin industry is more than likely to see a significant increase in the number of ETFs especially after the filing of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock which will go a long way in opening up the participation Institutional investors in the Bitcoin world. A financial player as large and reputed as BlackRock entering the world of Bitcoin in 2023 bodes well for 2024 when it comes to the adoption of digital crypto assets. This action of BlackRock has shown that the future of Bitcoin is extremely bright with their more than likely integration into the financial world. 2024 could just prove to be the year of Crypto ETFs as other institutions are watching and waiting for regulatory approvals before they decide to follow suit and change the world of Bitcoin forever.Despite never-ending criticism from the naysayers, 2024 promises to be a pivotal year marked by the promise of a great deal of financial innovation in the world of cryptocurrency. Moving further into the digital age will see greater in the whole ecosystem of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resulting in Bitcoin being poised to play an increasingly significant role in the global financial landscape. Keeping an eye on these emerging themes will be crucial for investors, enthusiasts, and industry participants as they navigate the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency in 2024.(Roshan Aslam is Co-founder & CEO at GoSats)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Countries Where Bitcoin Is Banned or Legal In 2024\n\nIf you are looking to buy, sell, or spend Bitcoin, you should check if it is legal in your country.\n\nIn fact, there are many countries with different cryptocurrency regulations. Some of them even single out Bitcoin, allowing it to be used as money, pay taxes, purchase goods, or trade it like a commodity.\n\nIn other countries, even the mere possession of Bitcoin can get you to prison. Others have not even bothered to regulate it yet, leaving Bitcoin and other cryptos in legal limbo.\n\nThe legality of Bitcoin all over the world can be seen in this map:\n\nLegal map of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Source: Coin.dance\n\nAlthough it has had some chance to mature, in the grand scheme of the history of money, Bitcoin is still new. It may take a decade, or decades, before Bitcoin can fully replace the world\u2019s money supply. With its increasing adoption and becoming legal tender, the once far-fetched idea of Bitcoin as the world\u2019s currency is closer to becoming a reality.\n\nThis article will cover where Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are\n\nBanned\n\nRestricted\n\nLegal\n\nNeither Legal or Illegal\n\nDisclaimer: Although this list is extensive, crypto regulations are often subject to change.\n\nCountries where Bitcoin is banned\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are generally welcomed in most parts of the world. Nevertheless, some countries have actually banned them or their use. Whether bans were imposed due to Bitcoins decentralized nature, the threat to their current financial system or just because proper regulations are yet to be approved, there are at least nine countries that decided to do so. These are:\n\nAlgeria.

In such states, banks and other financial service providers are prohibited from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges and companies, and in more extreme cases the countries have even banned crypto exchanges (etc China).\n\nBahrain.

Although Bitcoin is still prohibited in trade relations by the State Bank, possession and trade in crypto is a tolerated occurrence for the average user. Research in the country is being done to further understand cryptocurrency and its implications.\n\nNote that despite the bans and restrictions, these laws have not eradicated Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency trades and their usage. Due to the nature of decentralized cryptocurrencies, it is simply impossible to ban them. Many individuals in those countries still make use of sites like Local Bitcoins, Paxful or Bisq to trade it with others, as indicated by the trading volumes on these platforms.\n\nSource. coins.dance\n\nSource. coin.dance\n\nThis serves to prove that no government holds the power of truly ban Bitcoin unless they prohibit the usage of the internet for the entire nation.\n\nCountries where Bitcoin is legal\n\nOn a positive note, research shows there are at least 111 states where Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are recognized by law and are legal.\n\nFor instance, major countries like the United States and Canada hold a generally crypto-friendly attitude towards cryptocurrencies while also trying to enforce anti-money laundering laws and prevent fraud. Meanwhile, in the European Union, the member states are not allowed to launch their own cryptocurrency, but crypto exchanges are encouraged to be legalized and comply with the regulations.\n\nAs of 2024 the most Bitcoin-friendly countries where BTC is legal are:\n\nAntigua and Barbuda: A bill was passed to protect exchanges and crypto users.

At the same time jurisdictions which oppose the emerging industry are at risk of being left behind. Ironically, these countries already are some of the poorest nations in the world, and widespread Bitcoin and cryptocurrency crackdowns seem to yield no favorable results to improve the situation. Quite the contrary; embracing the cryptocurrency businesses with favorable regulations present an excellent opportunity to bring in innovation, capital, tax revenue and improve the living standard for the whole population.\n\nYou may also like to read: How to buy Bitcoin?"

        "title": "2023 in Review: Bitcoin dominates the year as best-performing asset; here's how equities, gold and bonds performed | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "In the dynamic landscape of investment, the primary objective is to achieve returns that surpass the rate of inflation, all while considering the impact of taxes on the overall investment strategy. In the spotlight of the year 2023, Bitcoin has emerged as a standout performer, overshadowing traditional asset classes such as gold, equities, real estate, and bonds.\n\nIn stark contrast to the challenges faced in the previous calendar year, 2023 has proven favourable for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The world's most renowned cryptocurrency has staged a remarkable comeback, boasting a 154.37% surge in 2023 that contributed a substantial $530 billion to its market capitalisation.\n\nAlso Read: Five assets that could beat inflation in 2024\n\nThis is a noteworthy turnaround from 2022, when Bitcoin witnessed a significant 65% dip amid tightening monetary policy and a series of blowups that exposed high counterparty risk.\n\nBitcoin price has jumped $25,506 in 2023, reaching $42,208, according to CoinDesk prices. The highest level of this digital currency was hit in November 2021, when it topped $67,802.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Jumps 160% in 2023 amid roller coaster ride; What lies ahead for cryptocurrencies?\n\nAt the outset of 2023, the cryptocurrency sector faced a multitude of challenges, such as the FTX and TerraLuma debacle, regulatory scrutiny, legal actions against prominent exchanges, and the closure of doors by several nations due to concerns about relinquishing economic control to private currencies, which cast a cloud of negativity over the market.\n\nAmidst these hurdles, savvy investors, particularly large asset-backed institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, and others, seized the opportunity.\n\nLet's look at the performance of other major asset classes in 2023:\n\nEquities: A record year\n\nThe Indian market saw a remarkable rally in 2023, with key benchmark indices -Nifty 50 and S&P BSE Sensex - gaining 20%. The surge can be attributed to robust participation from retail investors and sustained Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) inflows, propelling frontline indices to break multiple record highs.\n\nThe most significant phase of the market rally unfolded between November and December, following the BJP's victory in three crucial state elections. This outcome signalled the potential return of the NDA in the 2024 general elections.\n\nAlso Read: 2023 in Review: FPI inflows recorded at \u20b91.65 lakh crore, highest since 2020; will the trend continue?\n\nAdditionally, a pause in US Federal Reserve rate hikes, coupled with indications of a 75-basis-point rate cut in 2024, contributed to positive sentiment among investors. The upbeat mood was further bolstered by India's robust economic growth of 7.6% in the September quarter, solidifying its status as the fastest-growing economy in the world.\n\n2023's impressive rally propelled the market capitalisation of NSE-listed stocks to surpass the $4 trillion mark for the first time on December 01. As of December 29, the market capitalisation reached $4.3 trillion, bringing India's equity market closer to Hong Kong, which is currently valued at $4.7 trillion.\n\nAlso Read: Will the Indian market continue its strong run? Here's where experts see Nifty by 2024-end\n\nMeanwhile, mid- and small-cap stocks have witnessed an exceptional surge, with a majority of stocks delivering multi-bagger returns and some even exceeding 500% returns. The Indian IPO market has also been a wealth creator, with many IPOs debuting at substantial premiums on the opening day, contributing to the overall vibrancy of the market.\n\nIn contrast to the stellar rally in Indian stocks, China delivered a negative return in 2023 due to real estate woes and the country's ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another major peer, Hong Kong, also delivered a negative return in 2023.\n\nGold: Shone brightly\n\nGold, a traditional asset known for its resilience during economic and geopolitical uncertainty, gained sharply in 2023, marking a significant turnaround from two consecutive years of underperformance. The precious metal recorded a gain of 13.16% in 2023 to $2062 per ounce and reached a record high of $2135 on December 4th.\n\nMultiple catalysts fueled this remarkable ascent, including geopolitical tensions, central bank actions, fluctuations in the dollar index and US yields, and the recent Israel-Hamas war, which also boosted demand for the safe haven asset, and expectations for interest rate cuts have provided further support.\n\nAlso Read: Gold and silver outlook 2024: Motilal Oswal lists four key factors that may influence prices in 2024\n\n\u201cCentral banks purchased around 800 tonnes of gold over the first three quarters of 2023, 14% ahead of the same period last year, according to data from the WGC. Last year, global central banks purchased a record 1,136 tonnes of gold, compared to 450 tonnes bought in 2021, mostly driven by a flight towards safer assets amid soaring inflation. Last year was not only the thirteenth consecutive year of net purchases but also the highest level of annual demand on record back to 1950,\" said domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in its latest report.\n\nReal Estate: A year of robust growth\n\nThe Indian residential real estate space witnessed a healthy demand in 2023 due to various factors, such as a pause in rate hikes, increased buyer interest, and rising rental costs. As various reports suggest, residential property values in the country's top six cities increased by 10-15% in 2023, representing the highest capital appreciation rates witnessed in a decade.\n\nAlso Read: Nifty Realty index soars 77% in 2023 so far amid residential sales boom; Prestige Estates, Brigade, DLF top gainers\n\nDespite the substantial increase in property prices and a surge in mortgage rates, the housing sector experienced a remarkable surge. According to recent data released by real estate consultant Anarock, housing sales in the top seven cities rose by 31% in 2023, reaching an all-time high of nearly 4.77 lakh units.\n\nThis, in comparison with the 2022 figure of 3,64,870 units, underscores the robust growth and sustained momentum in the Indian residential real estate sector.\n\nAnarock Chairman Anuj Puri said, \"2023 has been phenomenal for the Indian housing sector, despite global headwinds, rising domestic property prices, and interest rate hikes over the first half of 2023.\"\n\nPuri said it was widely expected that rising property prices and interest rates, along with global market uncertainties, would impact residential sales, but high demand sustained.\n\nDebt: Higher volatility\n\nBonds typically operate as one of the safest and least volatile assets globally, offering a stable income stream and acting as a hedge against the risks associated with stocks. However, bonds experienced significant volatility in 2023, driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a pause in rate hikes, and open market operation (OMO) announcements by the RBI.\n\nAlso Read: As the bull run continues, it is time to exercise caution, say experts\n\nThe increase in yields had an impact on returns from debt instruments, with the price of bonds decreasing as yields rose. Nevertheless, the RBI's decision to pause rate hikes had positive implications for debt investments, as a decline in interest rates tends to enhance the value of debt securities. Debt funds managed to generate returns ranging between 6.5% and 7% in 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: We advise investors to check with certified experts before making any investment decisions.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "What Gen Z Thinks About Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of us is from Kentucky and the other from China. We both attend Washington and Lee University in Virginia. Last summer, we assisted Professor Seth Cantey, also a co-author of this piece, with research on the roles of bitcoin and Tether in Lebanon. To help with that work, first we had to learn a lot. What is bitcoin, and what are the problems it\u2019s trying to solve? How is it being used in Lebanon? Could bitcoin adoption mitigate the economic crisis? For two months, we wrestled with these questions.\n\nBut another question came up too. What does our generation, Gen Z, think of bitcoin?\n\nGen Z, the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials, includes those born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. Basically, we\u2019re digital natives in our teens and twenties. We\u2019re already entering adulthood, taking up an increasing share of the workforce, and contributing to the global economy. We\u2019re not Blackrock, but whether and how we adopt bitcoin will matter for the currency and the network in the long term. So, we decided to ask our peers what they thought about the technology. And we have some thoughts of our own.\n\nOur survey was simple, not scientific, but we found it anecdotally useful. We asked two open-ended questions to dozens of peers in the United States and China: 1) What is your understanding of bitcoin? 2) How often do you come across it? We were especially interested in whether answers to these questions varied by geography, since the US and China have radically different policies vis-\u00e0-vis bitcoin and cryptocurrency generally.\n\nResponses from our peers were similar in some ways, different in others. Gen Zers in both countries view bitcoin mainly as an investment option. In the US, they tend to see it as a speculative investment, but one that\u2019s attracting increasing attention and gradually becoming a more prominent part of investor strategies. They also think savvy investors wouldn\u2019t allocate a large percentage of their portfolios to bitcoin. It\u2019s understood as \u201chigh-risk, high-reward.\u201d Chinese Gen Zers similarly regard bitcoin as a speculative investment, but they tend to be even more cautious. In China, bitcoin brings to mind gambling, cheating, and crime, all activities with potentially serious consequences. The Chinese government has made clear to its citizens that bitcoin is not backed by the state, creating the perception of a lack of guaranteed value.\n\nWhen asked whether and how they\u2019ve noticed bitcoin in everyday life, American Gen Zers characterize bitcoin\u2019s presence as peripheral. They\u2019ve seen bitcoin ATMs at gas stations, Coinstar machines while buying groceries, and payment options at certain online stores. Even QR codes at a few restaurants. In other words, they know bitcoin is out there, but it still feels like a novelty. In contrast, Chinese rarely see bitcoin in their daily lives. China\u2019s decision to ban bitcoin mining in 2021 contributed to the population\u2019s sense that it\u2019s mostly off limits. And while there has never been an explicit ban on holding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in China, trading is illegal, and Beijing has warned banks and other financial institutions against providing crypto services.\n\nWhile our peers don\u2019t qualify as a representative sample of Gen Z, their views make sense to us, because they resemble what our own thinking was before working on this topic over the summer.\n\nBut that thinking has changed. After months of learning about bitcoin, we now recognize it as much more than an investment option. In Lebanon, where the banking and financial systems have collapsed, bitcoin serves as a savings tool and a hedge against inflation. In Russia, it\u2019s become a lifeline for dissidents whose bank accounts have been frozen. In Nigeria, it\u2019s a remittance vehicle with the potential to put companies like Western Union out of business. Refugees fleeing Ukraine have used it to transport wealth on hardware wallets or in their heads. El Salvador has made it the centerpiece of a campaign to attract high tech entrepreneurs and tourism. The list goes on.\n\nMore broadly, bitcoin looks like a way to level the playing field in the realm of international currency. We doubt it will ever replace fiat entirely, because governments will always want the ability to control money. It does seem plausible that bitcoin could serve as a check on fiat currencies, though, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the kinds of inflation we\u2019ve seen in recent years. If bitcoin were to do that alone, it would be a meaningful contribution to the world. But it\u2019s doing much more.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from our peers is that bitcoin is misunderstood not just by boomers but across generations. We\u2019re still early. Having grown up with the internet, we think Gen Z is likely to catch on to bitcoin more quickly than others, but we\u2019re not there yet. So far, it\u2019s not being widely taught in universities, and our peers continue to think of it mostly as speculation. We think that will change in the years to come. Once people go down the bitcoin rabbit hole, we\u2019ve discovered, they tend to like what they see.\n\nThis is a guest post by Seth Cantey, Jack Evans, and Anonymous.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin squeaked briefly above $45,000 on New Year's Day, a view it hasn't enjoyed since April 2022, and echoing the rollercoaster of January that year, when the price of the world's leading cryptocurrency oscillated above the threshold three times within a matter of days, interleaved with dips as low as $36,000.\n\nBitcoin was last at $45,000 on April 5, 2022, and sunk as low as $15,742 on November 9, according to Coingecko. Its New Year's Day market cap exceeded $836 billion, seeing trading volumes of $22 billion.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is up over 171% compared to this time last year, rising more than 13 perccent over the past month, and up over 5% for the day. Bitcoin kicked off 2023 at under $17,000 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis year, it's the drawn-out anticipation of the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the SEC that appears to be driving much of the upward movement. But many deadlines have come and gone with no formal action on any number of pending applications to offer a spot ETF. Could 2024 finally be the year it happens? And will the price of Bitcoin jump or plummet?\n\nBig round numbers like $45,000 don't have any special significance except that they represent psychological barriers for investors. Reaching one tends to increase confidence, which spurs more trading, and could then create a flywheel effect\u2014at least, that's what Bitcoin holders are hoping.\n\nIn the big picture, that means Bitcoin is edging closer to surpassing the high it saw last year when it started the year just shy of $50,000. BTC stayed mostly above $40,000 for a few months, but fell off a cliff after algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed and set off a wave of liquidations and bankruptcies.\n\nAs the world's largest and oldest cryptocurrency continues its rally, its total value by market capitalization continues to balloon. Bitcoin at $855 billion surpassed Elon Musk's Tesla in terms of market cap a while ago, after leaping past the $750 billion mark, according to CompaniesMarketCap. It's now also flipped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which commands a $774 billion market cap, and Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook), which stands at $815 billion.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "What Led to Bitcoin Bull Runs in 2023? - CoinGape",
        "content": "A bull market, in the traditional market sense, refers to a phase of significant and sustained upward movement in the market. This period is characterized by positive market sentiment, which helps maintain the rise in prices. Additionally, increased participation from investors typically leads to a surge in trading volumes during a bullish phase.\n\nAlthough various parameters can indicate a bull run in the crypto market, Bitcoin often serves as a reliable barometer. This is due to Bitcoin\u2019s dominant market position and high levels of trading activity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn this post, we explore key moments in 2023 when significant increases in Bitcoin\u2019s price suggested the onset of a bull market.\n\nH1 2023: The Rise and Resilience\n\nIn January, according to TradingView charts, Bitcoin started the year at a low of around 12,000 USDT. This was the lowest level seen since November 2020. By January 20, the king coin had soared above 23,000 USDT, marking a significant rise in the first half of 2023. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exceeded 70, indicating an overvalued or overbought market from January 10 to January 29.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price at the start of 2023 can be attributed to several macroeconomic factors. High inflation and the US Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive monetary policies set the tone for the year. Additionally, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine exacerbated an energy crisis, leading to increased prices for natural gas and oil. This period also saw the US report its highest inflation levels in approximately four decades. Moreover, January witnessed the successful launch of Bitcoin Ordinals, which positively impacted the market and likely contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price increase.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin\u2019s price spiked to around 25,000 USDT, at a time when the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes hit the market. Due to high inflation, the trend shaped the first half of 2023. March saw Bitcoin surpass the crucial resistance level of 28,000 USDT. Around March 17, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin briefly remained above 70, indicating an overvalued market. The uptrend continued until April 14, with market volatility starting to decrease after the first week of April. This period marked a significant phase of price movements influenced by macroeconomic factors and monetary policies.\n\nIn April, Bitcoin\u2019s price breached the 30,000 USDT mark, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s significant Shapella hard fork. By June, Bitcoin had reached levels above 31,000 USDT.\n\nH2 2023: Bitcoin\u2019s Momentum Continues\n\nA major boost occurred in mid-July when a U.S. judge ruled Ripple Labs Inc.\u2019s XRP token sales on public exchanges did not violate federal securities law, leading to a market surge. August saw further positive developments as a federal judge overturned the SEC\u2019s decision to deny a Bitcoin ETF from Grayscale Investments. Finally, a substantial upsurge occurred around October, with Bitcoin hitting around the 35,000 USDT mark.\n\nOn October 19th, Bitcoin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) exceeded 70, indicating an overvalued or overbought market, and it stayed within the normal or above normal range until December 11th. This period coincided with growing optimism for the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF and a shift towards more relaxed monetary policies, factors that contributed to the positive market sentiment.\n\nIn early December, Bitcoin impressively surpassed the 44,000 USDT level, marking the highest price point of the year, despite experiencing some volatility. This volatility was evident in both November and December, as indicated by the widening of Bollinger Bands. The period was also significant due to the near-realization of the Bitcoin ETF launch, a development that not only bolstered the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. but also had a global impact, signaling a major step towards mainstream acceptance of crypto assets."

It was last up 2.6% at $45,344 but remains far off the record high of $69,000 it touched in November 2021.\n\nEther ETH=BTSP, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, was 1% higher at $2,376 on Tuesday.\n\nInvestor focus has been squarely on whether the U.S. securities regulator will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would throw open the bitcoin market to millions more investors.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected multiple applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in recent years, arguing that the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nIn recent months, however, there have been increasing signs that regulators are prepared to sign off on at least some of the 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, with expectations that the decision will likely come in early January.\n\nRising bets that major central banks will cut interest rates this year has also been a boon for cryptocurrencies, helping shake off the gloom that had settled over crypto markets following the collapse of FTX and other crypto-business failures in 2022.\n\n\"The crypto market is set to experience notable growth this year, with key influencing factors being the influx of investment funds from spot ETFs, Bitcoin halving, and a more accommodative monetary policy both in the United States and worldwide,\" said Jupiter Zheng, partner of liquid funds at HashKey Capital.\n\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Summer Zhen in Hong Kong; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)\n\n((ankur.banerjee@thomsonreuters.com;; Mobile - +65 8121 3925; Follow on X (formerly Twitter): @AnkurBanerjee17;))\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
