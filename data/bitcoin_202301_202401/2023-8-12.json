        "title": "When cryptomining comes to town: High electricity use spillovers to the local economy - CEPR",
        "content": "High energy use is increasingly a feature of many technology processing industries, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and cryptocurrency mining (\u2018cryptomining\u2019). Estimates suggest that technology processing passed the milestone of consuming 1% of world energy in 2010 and is on trajectory to increase to 6% by 2030 (Masanet et al. 2020, Andrae and Edler 2015). In recent years, data centres and Bitcoin mining alone consumed 0.9% and 0.5% of global electricity, respectively (Andrae 2017, Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance).\n\nThis intensive electricity consumption results in two negative externalities. The first is the carbon emissions resulting from electricity production of cryptomining, with the website Digiconomist estimating that the global CO2 emissions from Bitcoin mining alone are equivalent to those of Libya (see also De Vries 2018, Blandin et al. 2020).\n\nOur work concerns a second, unstudied externality \u2013 the real effects of technology processing on local economies (Benetton et al. 2023). What, for example, are the spillovers from cryptomining on households and small businesses? How does the interaction of supply and demand impact prices and delivery of electricity to homes and small businesses? As we shall see below, cryptomining also has positive externalities in that cryptomines produce local tax revenues, raising questions about net costs and benefits.\n\nBefore describing our methodology and findings, a brief note about cryptomining, which is the clearing of payment transactions for decentralised blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that rely on the \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 protocol. Any person or firm can become a cryptominer, which involves solving increasingly complex computational puzzles to verify the validity of transactions. This has led to an arms race among firms who run large cryptomines, essentially warehouses full of specialized computers, crunching numbers across the world. And the key point here is that these cryptomines need lots of electricity, while employing very few people.\n\nA tale of two channels\n\nWe analyse the negative externalities of the high electricity use of cryptomining through two channels: prices and quantity rationing.\n\nChannel #1: Analysing negative externalities via prices\n\nIn the first case, we study New York State, specifically Upstate NY, excluding New York City and Long Island, which was an early market for cryptomining in the US due to its cold climate, cheap electricity, and proximity to large hydropower sources (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Bitcoin prices and electricity consumption\n\nNote: This Figure shows monthly electricity consumption for businesses in the town of Plattsburgh, NY, and the neighbouring town of Peru. Before the end of 2017, Plattsburgh and Peru experienced a similar pattern in electricity consumption for businesses. However, in January 2018, when the Bitcoin price peaked, electricity consumption by Plattsburgh businesses increased by almost 150%, whereas almost no change to the seasonal pattern occurred in Peru. The blue line shows the average price of Bitcoin each month. The red dash-dot line and the green dash line show total electricity consumption by small and industrial businesses in Plattsburgh and Peru, respectively. We normalise electricity consumption in each town to 100 in December 2017, which is the month in which Bitcoin prices reached their maximum of around $15,000. Gray areas denote December, January and February of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.\n\nThe region\u2019s grid operator employs a marginal supply pricing algorithm, whereby upward pressure on prices from demand gets passed to all users, including households and small businesses. We combine detailed data on these local electricity prices, electricity usage, and other economic outcomes with hand-collected data on the likely location of cryptominers, to analyse whether and how the use of electricity by cryptominers affects local communities.\n\nOur findings include the following:\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices are high, the returns from cryptomining are higher in expectation since the reward to miners is paid in Bitcoins. Thus, a higher Bitcoin price increases the demand for electricity by cryptominers.\n\nThere is a statistically significant, negative price elasticity of demand for electricity by the local communities, meaning that as the price of electricity rises, demand falls. These higher prices also lead to larger surpluses for electricity producers.\n\nThere is a positive and significant effect of cryptomining on tax generation. Treated communities experience a relative increase in taxes per capita by $6 compared to control communities when the price of Bitcoin increases by 100%. To put these numbers in perspective, the price of Bitcoin increased from about $600 in 2016 to $7,500 in 2018, which could have led to higher taxes per capita in cryptomining communities by about $70, or 14% of the average tax revenue per capita.\n\nCryptomining leads the average household and small business in New York to pay an extra $88 and $168 in their electricity bills per year, respectively. In aggregate, Upstate NY households and small businesses pay $204 million and $92 million more annually, respectively.\n\nWhen accounting for the differential increase in government revenues, cryptomining towns in Upstate NY generate almost $40 million in additional government revenues, thus recovering about 14% of the losses. As a result, we estimate a net consumer surplus loss of $257 million in Upstate NY.\n\nChannel #2: Analysing negative externalities via quantity rationing\n\nWe now turn to China, a country that employed a quantity rationing system for electricity, and which hosted 65\u201382% of the world\u2019s cryptomining during the last decade before a ban in 2021. In a quantity rationing system, when total demand increases, prices do not adjust; rather, the electricity supply is rationed among locations to align with physical infrastructure. To explore possible externalities associated with the rationing of electricity in local economies, we exploit an annual panel of statistics at the city level for China (cities in the data include the surrounding areas). We focus on the 218 inland China city-areas, which have a mean population of 355,000, and do not include the large coastal metropolitan areas. There is evidence of cryptomining in 52 of these inland city-areas, of which we find the following:\n\nAfter cryptomining enters a city, local fixed asset investments decline annually by 19%, and wage levels decline by 10%, suggesting that cryptomining tends to crowd out other business uses of electricity.\n\nThese results also suggest that the crowded-out industrial uses of electricity would have led to larger investments in the physical and human capital of the local economy in the years following the entry of cryptomining. To put a number on it, cryptomining entry is associated with a statistically significant drop in local GDP of 8.2%.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that local economies could suffer as a result of crowding out in the electricity market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe present novel empirical evidence of the real effects of cryptomining on local economies.\n\nFirst, we focus on a setting in Upstate New York, where cryptomining led to an increase in electricity prices and a resultant consumer surplus loss. On the other hand, local governments saw an increase in tax revenues, although this only offsets a fraction of the consumer surplus loss through higher electricity prices. We then turn to China, where we reveal a negative impact on the labor market as well as fixed asset investments.\n\nWhat does this mean for policymakers? Though likely tempting for some, the optimal response is likely not to ban cryptomining, which would only shift the problem to a more permissive jurisdiction and restrict any possible tax revenue gains. Rather, a better response would be to introduce electricity pricing schemes or dynamic quotas that minimise the adverse impact on the local community. In addition, the effects on local communities we document should be weighed against any other costs (notably, from pollution) and potential benefits arising from the growth of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrae, A (2017), \u201cTotal consumer power consumption forecast\u201d, Nordic Digital Business Summit 10.\n\nAndrae, A S G and T Edler (2015), \u201cOn Global Electricity Usage of Communication Technology: Trends to 2030\u201d, Challenges 6(1): 117-157.\n\nBenetton, M, G Compiani and A Morse (2023), \u201cWhen Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy\u201d, NBER Working Paper 31312.\n\nBlandin, A, G Pieters, Y Wu, T Eisermann, A Dek, S Taylor and D Njoki (2020), \u201cThird global cryptoasset benchmarking study\u201d, Technical report, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School.\n\nDe Vries, A (2018), \u201cBitcoin's growing energy problem\u201d, Joule 2(5): 801-805.\n\nMasanet, E, A Shehabi, N Lei, S Smith, and J Koomey (2020), \u201cRecalibrating global data center energy-use estimates\u201d, Science 367(6481): 984-986."

        "content": "Consumer bitcoin provider Azteco recently announced a $6 million seed funding round at an $84M valuation led by Jack Dorsey as the company introduces bitcoin gift cards to enhance the cryptocurrency\u2019s spending power near the level of the U.S. dollar.\n\nAmid persistent inflationary pressures in the U.S., many investors are looking into digital assets as a hedge against the weakened dollar. At the same time, changing views on bitcoin are establishing the currency as a player in the American economy.\n\n\"My contribution to Azteco comes out of a deep respect for their mission. The unbanked population is immense,\" Jack Dorsey said after the funding announcement.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"We have the technology and resources to close this gap, but until now, no one has taken that important next step,\" he added. \"Azteco is providing so much more than just access to a secure financial system; it is building an ecosystem of financial self-determination that is secure and supported by local communities. I am honored to support them.\"\n\nSHORT SELLER ACCUSES JACK DORSEY'S BLOCK OF FACILITATING FRAUD\n\nAlso designed to bridge geographical boundaries in the retail industry, bitcoin gift cards, or vouchers, provide in-person storefronts and e-commerce platforms around the globe while democratizing access to financial services and reshaping consumer-retailer interactions in an increasingly interconnected digital economy, according to Azteco.\n\n\"Trusting a third party as the issuer of money can result in that third party becoming a single point of failure. As the Federal Reserve and every other Fiat currency that has ever existed has proven, the incentive to cheat is irresistible. By removing this incentive through the issuer and replacing him with a computer program, bitcoin can run a politically and financially neutral, global synthetic money for people everywhere,\" Azteco CEO and founder Akin Fernandez told FOX Business.\n\nBITCOIN ON TRACK TO CHALLENGE U.S. DOLLAR?\n\nThe U.S. economy has been mired in inflation and a devalued currency, leading to a banking crisis and a raised investor interest in not only material wealth like gold and silver, but in digital assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nCentral banks and the Fed are already discussing the implementation of a digital dollar. Meanwhile, BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June.\n\n\"The fundamental problem with the U.S. dollar is that its supply is controlled by a small committee of private bankers focused solely on the shareholders\u2019 interests. America\u2019s Constitution considers only gold and silver money, which was arguably done deliberately to remove the inevitable corruption that follows when people are in control of the money supply,\" Fernandez said.\n\nBITCOIN BONNIE AND CLYDE' PLEAD GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING HACKED CRYPTO\n\n\"Bitcoin solves this problem by replacing a committee of men with an infallible computer program.\"\n\nAlready, Azteco has over 590,000 payment locations in more than 190 countries on the ground floor facilitating development.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"In the U.S., an estimated 4.5% of households were \u2018unbanked\u2019 in 2021 with no access to eCommerce, meaning they couldn\u2019t buy from Amazon, get a bank loan, send money or receive it electronically. Bitcoin fixes this by giving them around-the-clock global access to a frictionless financial rail using instant transactions that are guaranteed free of payer fraud,\" Fernandez said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There are 2 billion people unbanked on Earth, and the country that becomes the center of this new financial system will be raking in taxes from 2 billion people,\" he continued. \"A move to bitcoin will greatly enhance the U.S. economy. America\u2019s most prosperous era was when it was on the gold standard and the money supply was strictly constrained. Strong economies are built on saving, not spending.\""

        "content": "During a recent podcast interview, MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor expressed the opinion that large corporations purchasing and holding Bitcoin (BTC) in their custody should not be a cause for concern.\n\nWhile speaking to Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, released on Aug. 7, Saylor emphasized the inevitability of third-party and corporate participation growing in the Bitcoin space.\n\nHowever, he suggested that while Bitcoin enthusiasts may desire total self-control, or sovereignty, over their Bitcoin, it might not be the only answer, as people will be using Bitcoin for diverse purposes.\n\n\u201cWe need to be prepared for Bitcoin to infuse everything,\u201d Saylor stated, explaining that as Bitcoin becomes more integrated into society, it will have many use cases, and there will not be a one-size-fits-all model.\n\n\u201cThere are different types of wrappers. Some people will always be self-custody, some will be multisig, some will need a layer-3 custodian. There will be a need for political or utility or functionality purposes.\u201d\n\nSaylor speaking to Coin Stories host Brunell. Source: Coin Stories\n\nSaylor outlined three main reasons underpinning the need for custodians: technical, political and natural.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, relying on a third party might be the only course of action.\n\n\u201cThe mayor of New York is still the mayor of New York. Unless you get rid of New York City, California or Iceland, the country, political reasons will mean the need for custodians.\u201d\n\nRelated: Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy plans $750M stock sale, possibly buying more Bitcoin\n\nOn the technical side, there will be people that will want to transact in crypto with their mobile phones, so trusting layer-3 third parties, such as Bank of America and Apple, will be unavoidable, Saylor said.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is going to be a base layer. There is going to be layer 2\u2019s like lightning to make things fast. Then there is going to be layer 3\u2019s like Bank of America and Apple. Custodial layer 3 is going to exist to provide functionality.\u201d\n\nSaylor speaking on the Coin Stories podcast. Source: Coin Stories\n\nAs for natural reasons, Saylor suggested the possibility that it is safer for certain people to entrust their assets to others.\n\nHe gave the example of an 85-year-old grappling with Alzheimer\u2019s or the desire to secure holdings for a yet-to-be-born grandchild.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t complain that my mother and father had the car keys when I was twelve years old, and I didn\u2019t get the car key,\u201d Saylor stated.\n\nSaylor stated that the optimal blend of Bitcoin integrations will be determined by the market.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of all the different ways people integrate, wrap, embed or execute with Bitcoin, there is no one right answer; the marketplace will determine the right mix of integrations of Bitcoin.\u201c\n\nMagazine: Why Coin Stories\u2019 Natalie Brunell doesn\u2019t want a Bitcoin ATH anytime soon: Hall of Flame"

        "title": "Residents regret welcoming Bitcoin miners in North Tonawanda - Buffalo News",
        "content": "In August 2021, a Los Angeles man named Alec Amar pitched state regulators a seductive vision for the future of North Tonawanda:\n\nWhat if the city could anchor a booming new industry, flush with global investment and high-paying jobs?\n\nThat nascent industry \u2013 cryptocurrency mining \u2013 had already made small, quiet forays into Western New York, thanks to the region\u2019s cheap electricity and real estate costs. But Amar, then in his mid-20s, hoped to expand his existing operation by acquiring the old Fortistar power generating plant and using it to fuel a fleet of the specialized computers needed to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoin and other virtual tokens.\n\nIf the state approved the sale, Amar wrote in a letter to the Public Service Commission, his company would retrofit the gas-burning plant with groundbreaking, state-of-the-art technologies that would allow it to run without producing greenhouse gas emissions. The project would also, he said, bring stable tech jobs and \u201cbillion-dollar international companies\u201d to the region.\n\nState regulators have since granted Amar\u2019s company \u2013 Digihost International Inc. \u2013 permission to buy the power plant.\n\nBut two years later, Amar\u2019s other visions have not yet come to pass.\n\nInstead, some North Tonawanda residents say, the Digihost cryptocurrency facility on Erie Avenue has become a persistent nuisance and environmental hazard \u2013 overseen by a mysterious, out-of-town firm that has hired few local workers and shared little about its plans for the future.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to turn into a Love Canal situation,\u201d said Karen Hance, who lives 600 feet from Fortistar.\n\nIn July, more than two dozen residents and 60 environmental groups appealed to Gov. Kathy Hochul, asking her to accelerate a pending review of the facility\u2019s air pollution permit. The \u201cresurrection\u201d of fossil-fuel plants to mine cryptocurrency has dramatically increased greenhouse emissions, water pollution and noise pollution, they said.\n\nNeither Amar nor his father, Michel, responded to several interview requests, and denied \u2013 through another Digihost executive, Luke Marchiori \u2013 a reporter\u2019s request to visit, citing ongoing construction.\n\nThe case forms part of a growing national backlash against cryptocurrency mining, still seen by some as a boon to small, post-industrial communities. At least five crypto facilities have located in Erie and Niagara counties.\n\nTechnologists have championed such projects, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as revolutionary \u201cdisruptors\u201d that could support the development of new renewable energy sources and forever change the financial system. But volatility and fraud in the cryptocurrency market \u2013 as well as persistent concerns about the industry\u2019s energy needs \u2013 have fueled calls for greater oversight, particularly of miners that seek to revive or retrofit fossil fuel power plants.\n\nIn November, New York became the first state to temporarily ban these types of operations, pending an environmental review. Regulators greenlit Digihost\u2019s North Tonawanda cryptomine before the ban, however.\n\nEnvironmentalists argue that timing should not save the project.\n\n\u201cPurchasing an entire gas plant to run all the time, 24/7, is fundamentally inconsistent\u201d with state climate law, said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney with the national environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, which has sued to block Digihost.\n\nAn ideal target\n\nLike other Bitcoin mining operations, Digihost came to Buffalo in pursuit of cheap power. Amassing new coins requires lots of it. The virtual currency is created, or \u201cmined,\u201d by solving complex computational puzzles with banks of specialized computers. In addition to the electricity needed to power the computers themselves, mining facilities also require energy for industrial cooling systems and network equipment \u2013 making electricity the largest operating cost for many mining firms, and a prime target for crypto-entrepreneurs looking to grow their margins.\n\nAlec Amar and Brian Yang were two such entrepreneurs, according to a lawsuit that Yang later filed against his former business partner. In 2017, the two men incorporated a new Bitcoin mining firm in California and chose to locate their first cryptomine in Buffalo.\n\nYang, then an engineer at Google, created the software that ran the mining computers. Amar and his father Michel, a French-American fashion executive, provided $36,000 of upfront investment.\n\nThe young company then developed a 60,000-square-foot data center in the former American Axle plant on East Delavan Avenue before transferring it in 2020 to Digihost, where Alec serves as president and Michel as chief executive. Yang alleges that the two men mishandled corporate funds and shut him out of the business, which the Amars dispute; the case is ongoing in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin climbed past $60,000 in 2021, and as Digihost amassed more than 11,000 computers, the Amars began looking for other sources of electricity. They found it in Fortistar, an old natural-gas-burning plant that the company said could power as many as 1.3 quintillion \u2013 or 1.3 billion billion \u2013 attempts to solve a Bitcoin puzzle every second.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely excited to have achieved this milestone in the evolution of our Company,\u201d Alec Amar said in a March 2021 news release, which estimated that the plant would give Digihost the capacity to mine roughly $11.8 million of Bitcoin per month, at current valuations.\n\nThe project represented a major shift for the 30-year-old Fortistar facility, a so-called \u201cpeaker plant\u201d that had previously kicked in only to supply the grid only at times of urgent demand. Digihost planned to continue those operations while also installing Bitcoin miners that ran 24 hours per day in as many as 40 small structures on the grounds, powering them with electricity from the Fortistar plant.\n\nAt a North Tonawanda City Council meeting in August 2021, Michel Amar pitched the venture as an economic boon that would create at least 20 to 30 high-paid Digihost jobs in Western New York and make the region a center of financial technology and green energy innovation. Digihost prided itself on being \u201cvery green and socially responsible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do the right thing for the community \u2026 we are here to work with you,\u201d he said.\n\nOne slide in his presentation addressed a specific concern that had dogged other crypto enterprises: \u201cNO NOISE WILL BE HEARD ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE PREMISES,\u201d it read.\n\nBenefits unclear\n\nBut noise is heard outside the premises, neighbors say: a dull, pitchless, intermittent roar like Thruway traffic or Niagara Falls. Even after Digihost installed a 26-foot sound barrier and $100,000 in trees and shrubs, the sound of the industrial fans used to cool its computers drifted into nearby residential areas.\n\nIn May and June, Jack Kanack \u2013 a meteorologist and trained noise-meter reader \u2013 set out to quantify the low rumbles around the plant. On several occasions, according to records he shared with The Buffalo News, he found it emitting high levels of low-frequency noises that spiked higher when the wind blew in his direction.\n\n\u201cThis used to be like living in a park,\u201d Hance said of her wide, well-gardened backyard, which has emptied of the possums, raccoons and other wildlife it once attracted.\n\n\u201cSeriously, it has come to the point where my family is considering moving out of the City. We can no longer relax in the quiet of our own home,\u201d wrote Kevin O\u2019Connor, a homeowner half a mile to the northwest, in a May email to North Tonawanda lawmakers.\n\nCritics say Digihost has not delivered on its economic promises, either. As of December 2022, the company directly employed 11 full-time staff in the U.S., according to corporate records filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While that figure does not include employees hired through subcontractors or subsidiaries, North Tonawanda Mayor Austin Tylec also said he did not believe the cryptomine had generated new local jobs besides a few security positions.\n\nNiagara County reassessed the value of the Fortistar plant this year to just over $77,000 to account for the new mining venture, from roughly $49,000 last year, according to the county property tax office. Digihost has not received assistance from the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency, though the company has told investors it receives a discounted rate on electricity from the state.\n\nTylec, who as a City Council member lobbied for a temporary moratorium on cryptomining facilities, faulted his predecessors for failing to better scrutinize Digihost and its impact on the surrounding community. Local staff members at the Fortistar plant have worked closely with the city to address noise complaints and \u201cbe a good neighbor,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cIt was not Digihost\u2019s responsibility when they first came here to make sure North Tonawanda had the right zoning codes in place,\u201d Tylec said. \u201cIt was up to city officials to make sure that was done before approval ... and they unfortunately didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nCosts to the community will soon grow steeper, neighbors and environmentalists predict.\n\nThe Fortistar plant still primarily operates to supplement the grid \u2013 a practice that yielded between 11,000 and 18,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year between 2017 and 2019, according to data filed with state regulators.\n\nThose emissions could spike dramatically, however, if Digihost runs the plant more frequently to power its on-site miners. In an environmental audit submitted to the state last September, plant operators wrote that they now \u201canticipate\u201d generating more than 300,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year \u2013 equivalent to the emissions from more than 66,000 motor vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions at a time when you can see all the impacts that climate change is having,\u201d said Deb Gondek, the former director of sustainability for Rich Products and a North Tonawanda resident who opposes the Digihost project. \u201cWhy are we allowing all these additional emissions for an industry that benefits just a few people? We have to rethink that.\u201d\n\nAn \u2018evolving\u2019 space\n\nA 2022 peer-reviewed study published in the journal Scientific Reports calculated that Bitcoin miners cause 35 cents worth of climate damage for every $1 of Bitcoin they unlock.\n\nBut Digihost sees itself as part of the climate solution, not the problem, said Marchiori, the company\u2019s chief renewable energy officer. Marchiori \u2013 who lives in Western New York and serves an \u201cadvisory\u201d role at Digihost \u2013 met the Amars when his energy marketing company began supplying power to their East Side project.\n\nSince then, he said, that cryptomine has become the anchor subscriber for a community solar farm in the Genesee County Town of LeRoy, and signed on to a number of statewide programs that reward major power-consumers for cutting their use during peak-demand periods.\n\nCryptomining operations, with their steady, consistent need for power, can also help drive demand for green energy projects and technologies, he said. In the coming months, Marchiori said Digihost will transition the Fortistar facility to run on a mix of conventional and \u201crenewable\u201d natural gas, an equivalent fuel derived from the decomposition of organic matter, like food waste and animal manure.\n\nMarchiori also said Digihost looks to blend hydrogen with natural gas to reduce carbon emissions, echoing a proposal Alec Amar made to the Public Service Commission in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe plant \u2026 will undergo upgrades at the end of 2023 to install and use hydrogen power,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCritics raise significant questions about the feasibility and benefits of both technologies, which some researchers and environmental advocates have panned as \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d Renewable and conventional natural gas leak similar amounts of methane, for instance \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency also has no record of a renewable natural gas producer in Pavilion, where Marchiori said Digihost planned to source much of its fuel. He declined to provide further details about the producer.\n\nMeanwhile, New York has no pipeline infrastructure to transport hydrogen \u2013 and most hydrogen in use today is extracted from natural gas.\n\nIn their September 2022 environmental audit, Fortistar\u2019s operators wrote that \u201cthere are numerous technological hurdles that need to be overcome before [hydrogen] can function as a viable alternative fuel for utility power generation.\u201d Marchiori acknowledged that hydrogen power \u201cis definitely an emerging technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you could have a windfall of new investment and development of renewables because you have this baseline\u201d energy demand, he told The News. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting space \u2013 it\u2019s evolving, it\u2019s maturing.\u201d\n\nThe same might be said for Digihost itself, which has operated for only three years in its current form. The company continues to signal interest in making green infrastructure investments in North Tonawanda, Tylec said, and has been in contact with the Mayor\u2019s Office about potentially installing electric vehicle chargers in the city \u2013 though \u201cnothing is set in stone.\u201d\n\nSome residents say they are no longer taking Digihost at its word. While local and state utility regulators have already approved the North Tonawanda project, Digihost must now renew a mandatory air pollution permit for the Fortistar plant with the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Gondek, Hance and O\u2019Connor were among the more than 80 residents and environmental groups who recently asked Gov. Kathy Hochul to speed up that review.\n\nA denial would, pending a likely appeal, shut down the Fortistar plant. In June, the state agency requested more information about how the facility plans to minimize emissions and other community impacts.\n\nEarthjustice is also appealing a lawsuit it filed against the Public Service Commission on behalf of two local environmental groups in January, arguing that the agency should have weighed New York\u2019s sweeping 2019 climate law when it approved the transfer of Fortistar. A judge dismissed the case in March.\n\nEven if New York continues its crackdown on cryptomining, history suggests the industry will regroup somewhere with more lenient regulations. Cryptomining exploded in the U.S. after China cracked down in 2021, citing \u2013 among other concerns \u2013 a desire to help the country meet its carbon reduction targets.\n\nDigihost has also acquired new facilities in Alabama and North Carolina during the past 18 months, announcing in July 2022 that it does not plan further expansion in New York.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of whack-a-mole right now,\u201d said Bridge Rauch, the environmental justice organizer with the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York."

        "title": "Dogecoin Founder Calls Bitcoin Maximalists 'Mentally Ill' - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBilly Markus, a co-founder of Dogecoin, has criticized Bitcoin fans\u2019 marketing strategies, calling them \u2018mentally ill\u2019\n\nHe said there are plenty of ideological divisions within the cryptocurrency industry\n\nMarkus said he stopped investing in crypto nine years ago, right after the DOGE launch\n\nUnsurprisingly, conflicts and heated arguments frequently arise in the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency \u2013 this time between Dogecoin founder and Bitcoin maximalists. These arguments often show the variety of viewpoints within the crypto community since fervent believers drive them on all sides.\n\nDogecoin founder, who isn\u2019t one to hold back when airing his opinions, has once again criticized the advertising tactics and overarching stories that Bitcoin advocates champion.\n\nIn the brief video , Robert Breedlove, a BTC maximalist, was seen speaking with Jason Lowery, who continued praising Bitcoin. According to Lowery, BTC is not a coin; rather, it is the future of conflict, security, and those who want to protect their data.\n\nMaximalists of Bitcoin: A Better Attitude Toward Other Cryptos\n\nBitcoin (BTC) maximalists, often known as \u201cBitcoin Maxis,\u201d are ardent proponents of the cryptocurrency and firmly think that it is superior to all others. They frequently minimize or even reject the worth and potential of other tokens in the wide crypto ecosystem because of their steadfast faith in Bitcoin.\n\nMarkus cited an occasion where a BTC enthusiast was advocating the cryptocurrency in an effort to shed insight on the thinking of these Bitcoiners.\n\nThe enthusiast extended an invitation to others to join the \u201cmentally ill group of insecure losers.\u201d Such utterances offer a window into the frequently divisive opinions of some inside the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin maximalists frequently disparage competing cryptocurrencies using the nickname \u201cs-coins.\u201d The person who most exemplifies this approach is Max Keiser, a well-known member of the Bitcoin community.\n\nHe once requested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order major cryptocurrency exchanges to cease operations, referring to them as little more than casinos. Keiser\u2019s ideas, which are similar to those of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, extend to classifying all altcoins as securities.\n\nNotably, Keiser had vehemently asserted that XRP was bound for failure and that it was Gensler\u2019s obligation to ensure its demise before Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security in July. These stories have influenced the SEC\u2019s recent activities as the organization has increased its examination of the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nMarkus Questions the Future of Bitcoin\n\nThe most recent criticism from Markus was in response to a video published by Udi Wertheimer, a crypto Twitter user. Interviewing Jason Lowery was Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove in the video. Lowery complimented Bitcoin and emphasized its unmatched potential throughout the interview.\n\nHe continued by saying that Bitcoin is more than just a coin. Instead, he characterized it as security, the future of warfare, and a guarantee for people who want to keep their data private.\n\nman bitcoiners are the literal worst at marketing \u201ccome join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers!\u201d \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 12, 2023\n\nMarkus, though, appears to have a strong problem with the content of the video based on his comments. Dogecoin founder\u2019s answer, therefore, supports the idea that innovation is not just restricted to Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency sector, several additional coins and protocols provide distinctive solutions and show great promise.\n\nNot the First Time Markus Takes a Jab on BTC\n\nIn April this year, Markus criticized Bitcoin as a currency, claiming there isn\u2019t enough for everyone.\n\nThe inventor of the most well-known memecoin on the market recently took to Twitter to criticize cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) investors, claiming that doing so amounts to investing in mental illness.\n\ninvesting in crypto is literally just investing in mental illness which i suppose is on the rise, so\u2026 \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) April 22, 2023\n\nThe world is getting dumber and sadder by the day, said Markus, adding that \u201cinvesting in cryptocurrencies is literally investing in a mental illness, which I assume is on the rise.\u201d\n\nMarkus then claimed that since non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a derivative of cryptocurrencies, investing in them causes people to become \u201ceven more mentally ill\u201d when challenged about doing so.\n\nMarkus responded to criticism of his restrictions by saying he was disgusted by the investors who, in his view, quarrel, behave erratically, and make poor choices as a result of an issue with the brain.\n\nAllegedly Owns Very Little DOGE\n\nThe Dogecoin creator\u2019s remarks have been provoking a flood of criticism from irate investors, who claimed that Markus was merely venting his rage at not being able to become wealthy with cryptocurrencies despite having knowledge of the sector for almost a decade.\n\nShortly after Dogecoin\u2019s debut, the project\u2019s inventor said he quit investing in cryptocurrencies nine years ago. because he thinks investing in digital currency is just another form of gambling for people. Additionally, he rejects Bitcoin as a kind of money.\n\nOn Reddit, he revealed he no longer represents the Dogecoin Foundation and owns very little Dogecoin.\n\nFor his criticism of Dogecoin supporter and billionaire Elon Musk, Jackson Palmer was blocked by Markus last year on Twitter. Palmer slammed Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, for his coding abilities and said he used cryptocurrency to inflate his ego.\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrency investors, who think that digital currencies are the future of banking and investing, hold the opposite perspective to Markus\u2019 criticism of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Bitcoin continues to lead the way in the cryptocurrency world, many different types exist. Billy Markus reminds the public that creativity is not limited to a certain token or protocol. Understanding and appreciating the numerous prospects and potentials presented by different cryptocurrencies is crucial as the cryptosphere continues to develop. The continuous arguments and conflicts, like the one between Markus and Bitcoin maximalists, show stakeholders\u2019 passion and commitment to their individual coins."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is exhibiting waning bullish momentum on the 12-hour chart, trading at $43,241.\n\nThe consensus forecast suggests a 180,000 increase in Nonfarm Payrolls in November.\n\nA strong labor market is likely to motivate the US Fed to maintain its 'higher for longer' interest rate policy narrative.\n\nBitcoin price just like other assets, is highly impacted by the macro-financial developments. This includes the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States. This time around, the NFP data is expected to cause a dip in the value of BTC.\n\nUS NFP: Forecasting an increase\n\nThe forecasts regarding the November figures of the Nonfarm Payrolls are currently at 180,000, marking an increase from October\u2019s 150,000. This would mean that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 3.9%.\n\nThe NFP report has proven to have a considerable impact on the crypto prices, just as it has on other investment classes. Strong jobs reports, i.e. increase in jobs, tend to strengthen the dollar as the increase is a sign of a stronger economy. This has a negative impact on stocks, commodities, etc, and since crypto happens to share a positive correlation with the share market, particularly BTC, it faces correction.\n\nConversely, a weak NFP report proves to provide a bullish outlook for crypto since a lower-than-expected increase in jobs weakens the US Dollar, causing a rally for stock and other markets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event the NFP figures are stronger than expected, the Federal Reserve tends to keep the interest rates high. This is done in order to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation. Thus, even if the Fed doesn't increase the rates in the next meeting, they might keep it stable at 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin price will most likely face correction; however, given the bullish developments in the stock markets, including the potential spot BTC ETF approvals coming soon, the decline may not be excessive.\n\nBitcoin price to note a dip\n\nBitcoin price is presently trading at $43,241 after failing to breach $44,500, resulting in minor corrections. While at the time of writing, the broader market outlook is bullish, the short-term picture is slightly leaning toward bearish.\n\nThis is evinced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The receding green bars suggest waning bullishness, which means that Bitcoin price is susceptible to a decline.\n\nHowever, BTC will, at most, fall back to $42,000 or $40,000 if the former support level is lost. This is the short-term scenario considering a stronger-than-expected NFP report.\n\nBTC/USD 12-hour chart\n\nBut if the report is weaker or the broader market cues switch to bullish, a bounce back from $42,000 is likely. This would boost the price rise, pushing Bitcoin price beyond $44,500 and invalidating the bearish thesis."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLeading cryptocurrencies finally broke a six-week spell of poor price performance or inertia this week.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) added a modest 1.5% to its market value over the seven days to trade at $29,408 on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the latest weekly report by CoinShares, last week was a strong indicator that institutional investors have stopped shorting the leading currency for the first time in fourteen weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin by market capitalization, appeared to match the top coin\u2019s pace, adding 1.3% to enter the weekend at $1,851.\n\nThere were no significant price drops among the top thirty cryptocurrencies. However, three altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nSolana (SOL) grew 8.5% to its current price of $24.55; Toncoin (TON) added 10.1% to hit $1.32, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) blew up 17.8% to trade at $0.00001108.\n\nShiba Inu appears to have kept up the momentum of last week\u2019s rally that commenced on news that the coin\u2019s makers are shedding their memecoin reputation and introducing a new identity protocol to all apps on the ecosystem for increased security and privacy.\n\nAltogether the market made small gains this week, as July\u2019s U.S. inflation readings indicated a continued cooling off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThis week brought a fairly busy and diverse news cycle, with institutional and global adoption stories commanding attention alongside the Fed\u2019s new stablecoin note and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s face-saving tactics in its failing war on crypto.\n\nOn Monday, payments giant PayPal announced it would be releasing an Ethereum-based dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThe currency will be issued by Paxos and is expected to become \"a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\" according to a media quote by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nStarting next month, Paxos will be publishing monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of PYUSD\u2019s reserves, enabling the public to keep track of the credibility and value of the assets underpinning the stablecoin\u2019s value.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) aired her concerns in a written statement: \u201cI am deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no Federal framework for regulation, oversight and enforcement of these assets. [...] Given PayPal\u2019s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil announced the name of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC): DREX, or the \u201cdigital real\u201d\u2014 the name being a near-acronym for \u201cdigital real electronic transaction.\u201d\n\nThe digital real is a centrally-issued tokenized real that utilizes distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it\u2019s not without controversy.\n\nEarly last month, the Brazilian Central Bank published the code of the pilot project on its GitHub profile. Developers thus discovered several problematic functions within the smart contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe capabilities given to the Central Bank include the ability to freeze users' accounts, decrease target balances, confiscate, and mint new units of the digital currency. This, in turn, has attracted criticism that the project enforces exactly the kind of centralization crypto was created to avoid.\n\nThat day, Binance announced it had secured licenses to operate in El Salvador, a country where Bitcoin is legal tender. Binance has been feeling the heat of the SEC\u2019s spotlight in the U.S. after the federal securities regulator sued it for breaching securities laws, alleging further still that Binance execs are involved in commingling customer funds and market manipulation.\n\nAlso that day, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing incoming guidance for chartered banks dealing with dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also said it was stepping up its \u201cnovel activities supervision program\u201d for banks dealing with crypto or crypto companies in its jurisdiction.\n\nIn particular, the Fed is looking to monitor the transaction validation process, including the \u201ctiming and finality of settlement of transactions, potential irreversibility of transactions, and the central authority of transaction records.\u201d\n\nThe statement hints that the Fed will implement know-your-client (KYC) measures and ensure that nationally-chartered banks demonstrate appropriate risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC announced it plans to appeal Judge Torres\u2019s landmark ruling in the agency\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple for\u2014you guessed it\u2014breaching securities laws.\n\nTorres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security by definition but could be presented as one depending on how it\u2019s sold. Her verdict essentially contradicted the SEC\u2019s claim that offerings to retail customers via exchanges constitute securities offerings.\n\nThe following day, the SEC once more played for time and delayed its decision to approve or reject a high-profile spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application from ARK 21Shares.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, on Saturday payments giant Visa announced an experimental solution on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to pay gas fees using Visa credit or debit cards."

        "title": "Bitcoin's sideways price action leads traders to focus on SHIB, UNI, MKR and XDC - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to form two successive Doji candlestick patterns on the weekly charts but a positive sign is that the price is sustaining above the 20-week exponential moving average ($28,072). This suggests that the bulls have not lost their grip.\n\nPopular pseudonymous trader TechDev used the three-week timeframe to show that Bitcoin\u2019s compression above the 20-period moving average was approaching values seen only four times since Bitcoin\u2019s creation. Interestingly, on all three previous occasions, the expansions happened to the upside, suggesting that history favors the bulls.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nHowever, in the near term, the lack of volatility has pulled Bitcoin futures trading volumes to their lowest levels since December 2022. Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman believes this shows that traders may have shifted to other markets or may be avoiding making moves at the current levels.\n\nWhile several altcoins are looking to Bitcoin for direction, some have outperformed in the near term. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that are looking positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($29,447) for the past two days, signaling indecision between the bulls and the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. That could keep the BTC/USDT pair stuck inside the $28,585-to-$30,150 range for a while.\n\nThe next trending move is likely to begin after the price escapes this range. If the price dives below $28,585, the selling could pick up momentum and the pair may dump to $26,000.\n\nOn the upside, a break and close above $30,150 may attract buyers. The pair could then surge to the $31,804-to-$32,400 resistance zone.\n\nBTC/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is stuck between the moving averages, suggesting uncertainty about the next trending move. If the price closes below the 50-day simple moving average, the short-term advantage will tilt in favor of the bears. That could drag the price toward $29,000 and then to $28,585.\n\nIf the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to seize control. The pair may first rise to $29,738, and if this hurdle is cleared, the rally could reach the overhead resistance at $30,350.\n\nShiba Inu price analysis\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is in a strong recovery, but buyers are facing resistance near the overhead resistance at $0.000012.\n\nSHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.000009) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. If buyers do not give up much ground from the overhead resistance, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $0.000012. If that happens, the SHIB/USDT pair could soar to $0.000014 and then to $0.000016.\n\nContrarily, if the price slumps below $0.000010, the pair may extend its pullback to the 20-day EMA. This remains the key level to watch out for because a break below it may signal that the recovery may be over.\n\nSHIB/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price has corrected to the 20-day EMA. The bulls are expected to protect the level with vigor. If they do that, the pair may again attempt to break and sustain above the overhead resistance at $0.000011.\n\nIf the price skids and sustains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then tumble to the next major support at the 50-day SMA. This level may witness aggressive buying by the bulls.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($5.79) on Aug. 7 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($6.09) on Aug. 8. This shows that buyers are active at lower levels.\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe UNI/USDT pair is witnessing a tough battle near the 20-day EMA, indicating that the bears have not yet given up. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA.\n\nInstead, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are trying to flip this level into support. If they manage to do that, the pair may rise above the immediate resistance at $6.35 and reach $6.70.\n\nUNI/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out on the four-hour chart. This suggests a balance between supply and demand. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bears. The pair may then plunge to $5.80.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying on dips. The pair could then rise to $6.35. Buyers will have to surmount this resistance to come out on top. The pair may then soar to $6.70.\n\nRelated: Voyager\u2019s token transfer to Coinbase sparks sell-off suspicions\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) has been trading above the breakout level of $1,200 for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are attempting to flip the level into support.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,204) is sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting that the bulls have the edge. Buyers will try to propel the price above the immediate resistance of $1,284 and challenge the local high at $1,370. A break and close above this level could signal the start of a new uptrend.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the uptrend, they will have to quickly yank the price back below the breakout level of $1,200. That could open the gates for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($1,041).\n\nMKR/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA on the four-hour chart has flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint. The price action has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.\n\nIf buyers drive the price above the triangle, the MKR/USDT pair may start an up-move toward the pattern target of $1,463. On the other hand, a break below the triangle could signal that bears are back in the game. The pattern target on the downside is $986.\n\nXDC Network price analysis\n\nXDC Network (XDC) has pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($0.062), which is an important support to watch out for.\n\nXDC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating that the bullish momentum may be weakening. If buyers want to gain control, they will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $0.073. That could start an up-move to $0.082.\n\nOn the contrary, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.056. Such a move could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nXDC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows a descending triangle formation, which will complete on a break and close below $0.061. If that happens, the pair could start a downward move to $0.054 and, thereafter, to the pattern target of $0.040.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues higher from the current level and breaks above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the bearish setup. The failure of a negative setup is a positive sign. That could open the doors for a potential rally to $0.082.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

During a hearing on Aug. 11, Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail and remanded him to custody, likely at the Putnam County Correctional Facility. Once his October trial begins, he could be moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Bankman-Fried was reportedly led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. In Kaplan\u2019s view, Bankman-Fried\u2019s interviews with NYT reporters resulted in sharing information with the likely intention \u201cto hurt and frighten\u201d former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, his former colleague and girlfriend.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed a decision on whether to approve or disapprove the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by ARK Investment Management and 21Shares.

In a letter to Judge Analisa Torres \u2014 the presiding judge in the case \u2014 the SEC said it believed her decision warrants a fresh look by an appellate court. The commission asked Judge Torres to put the case on hold during the appeal, saying there are multiple other pending court cases that could be affected, depending on the appeal\u2019s outcome. The SEC is currently in a legal battle with a number of crypto firms, including Binance and Coinbase, over alleged securities violations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network: Crypto's Flashy Scaling Solution - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network is gaining serious traction as the leading solution to BTC\u2019s scalability concerns. With industry heavyweights like Binance setting up Lightning Nodes and nations like El Salvador rolling out support for the scaling solution, the Bitcoin Lightning Network is primed for mass adoption.\n\nNew Bitcoin Lightning Wallets and channels are being created daily, demonstrating the demand for instant payments and low transaction fees.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll look into the Layer-2 network designed to improve upon Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s iconic crypto asset and explore how it works. Can this Bitcoin (BTC) scaling solution take on Web2 leaders like Visa? Or are Lightning Payments just a flash in the pan?\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is a \u201cLayer-2\u201d payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Think of it like a high-speed expressway that runs parallel to the main network that processes fast and affordable payments.\n\nDespite being a technical revolution in its own right, the Bitcoin network is ill-suited for mass adoption. Unlike modern blockchains, Bitcoin transactions are painfully slow and often charge high transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network aims to maintain the crypto asset\u2019s status as a store of value, like digital gold, while creating a scalable and secure payment system that rivals existing platforms.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nHow Does the Lightning Network Work?\n\nThe mechanics of the Lightning Network are as fascinating as they are innovative. Imagine a bustling network of tunnels, each connecting two individuals who wish to transact with each other. These tunnels, or \u2018payment channels,\u2019 are the core of the Lightning Network.\n\nWhen two people decide to transfer BTC using the Lightning Network, they establish a payment channel that runs parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain. Imagine this channel as a private highway allowing them to exchange unlimited transactions without congesting the main blockchain.\n\nThese off-chain transactions are not immediately broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. Instead, they are held within the channel, away from the prying eyes of the public ledger.\n\nWhen the channel is closed, The final balance of transactions is settled as a single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like Ethereum (ETH) Rollups, this method allows large groups of transactions to occur off-chain, with only the opening and closing of the channel being recorded on-chain.\n\nOn top of that, the Lightning Network has an ace up its sleeve. Thanks to smart contract technology, it doesn\u2019t require a direct channel between all users. For example, if Vitalik has a channel with CZ, and CZ has a channel with SBF, Vitalik can transact with SBF through CZ, creating a network of interconnected channels.\n\nIf you want to set up a Lightning Wallet and transfer digital assets, don\u2019t miss our helpful step-by-step guide on Lightning Payments.\n\nWhy Do We Need the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin soars, so does the strain on its network. The Bitcoin blockchain, while revolutionary, was not designed to handle a high volume of transactions simultaneously. The rise of Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens has proven this, with Bitcoin gas fees exploding to all-time highs in 2023.\n\nThis limitation led to slower transaction times and higher fees, making Bitcoin payments a poor way of exchanging funds. Think of it this way; you won\u2019t use BTC to pay for a coffee if the transaction fee costs more than the coffee itself!\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is designed to address these very challenges. By moving transactions off the main blockchain, the Lightning Network significantly increases Bitcoin\u2019s scalability, enabling it to handle millions of transactions per second. This starkly contrasts the Bitcoin network\u2019s capacity, which can handle fewer than ten transactions per second.\n\nMoreover, the Lightning Network drastically reduces transaction costs, making micropayments possible and economically viable. This opens up many new use cases, from tipping content creators fractions of a cent to paying per article read or video watched.\n\nLightning Network History\n\nThe concept of the Lightning Network was first introduced in a white paper by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in 2015. They envisioned a second-layer solution that could solve the scalability issues plaguing Bitcoin.\n\nSince then, the development of the Lightning Network has been a collaborative effort, with several teams working on different protocol implementations. These include Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ, each contributing to the evolution of Bitcoin\u2019s most popular scaling solution.\n\nThe first successful transaction on the Lightning Network took place in 2017, marking a significant milestone in its development. Since then, the network has grown exponentially, with thousands of active nodes and channels.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Lightning Network?\n\nThe future of the Lightning Network looks bright. While the network is still in its early stages, there\u2019s a flurry of ongoing development to enhance its capabilities and user experience. These include toolkits that help developers build DeFi applications and NFT functionality within the Lightning Ecosystem.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus is improving the network\u2019s routing capabilities to ensure transactions find the most efficient path across the network. As the network grows, seamless channel routing will be crucial for maintaining the speed and low cost of transactions.\n\nThere\u2019s also a growing interest in integrating the Lightning Network with other cryptocurrencies. This could enable instant, low-cost transactions across blockchains, further expanding the network\u2019s utility.\n\nThe Lightning Network is also expected to play a significant role in developing decentralized applications (dApps). Its ability to handle micropayments efficiently could pave the way for new types of dApps, from pay-per-use services to decentralized streaming platforms.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Network Alternatives\n\nWhile the Lightning Network aims to resolve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problems, it\u2019s not the first payment system to threaten Bitcoin\u2019s crown.\n\nAlternative decentralized payment networks like Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin forks like Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also provide fast and affordable solutions. However, the key difference between these platforms is that the Lightning Network still takes advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched security and decentralization.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, BTC is considered a \u2018safe haven\u2019 by cryptocurrency standards. BTC\u2019s price is far less volatile than its competitors, making it a more stable network for frequent transactions.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin Lightning Network\n\nAs we delve deeper into the Bitcoin Lightning Network, it\u2019s crucial to weigh the advantages and potential drawbacks of this innovative Layer-2 solution. Like any technology, the Lightning Network has its pros and cons that shape its utility and adoption.\n\nPros\n\nFast \u2013 As the name suggests, The Lightning Network offers lightning-fast transactions. Payments are processed in milliseconds to seconds, significantly improving over the ten-minute block time of the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u2013 As the name suggests, The Lightning Network offers lightning-fast transactions.

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Could Help Decarbonize Energy Grids, Researchers Say - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDoes Bitcoin mining help or hurt the environment? Blockchain experts sought an answer to that question in a newly released, first-of-its-kind academic paper on the matter. Their conclusion: It could help, with some key changes.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that renewable-based mining could potentially drive a net-decarbonizing effect on energy grids, although key adaptations in mining practices are needed to fully realize this potential,\u201d reads the abstract of the paper, written by blockchain researchers Juan Ignacio Ibanez and Dr. Alexander Freier.\n\nPublished earlier this week, their analysis examined the realities of the mining industry\u2019s carbon footprint and its potential to expand renewable energy capacity, providing a \u201cbalanced\u201d perspective between both sides of the Bitcoin environmental debate. After just two days, the paper has amassed more views than 95% of the 24 million papers ever published on Altmetric.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBIG UPDATE: In it\u2019s first 48 hours the #Bitcoin mining research paper is now #1 in views (6 months) and has an altmetric score of 344. This paper is now in the top 5% of all papers ever tracked (24+ million) by altmetric \ud83d\udc40 Read & share the paper: https://t.co/ZkTx7bSbDB pic.twitter.com/Yt9ae4Q6Hb \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) August 10, 2023\n\nThe analysis states that a series of \u201cunique characteristics\u201d set miners apart from other energy buyers, helping provide \u201cadditional income and ancillary services\u201d to renewable energy grids. Some of these characteristics include flexibility of load, interruptibility, portability, and waste heat utilization.\n\nFor example, miners can help absorb excess power generated by wind and solar facilities, helping those firms become more profitable. They also could be used to monetize stranded natural gas and landfill gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere as highly pollutive methane, using containerized mining and generator solutions.\n\nThough mining\u2019s impact on grid management and renewable power generation is already \u201cvisible,\" the paper notes that it still isn\u2019t large enough to impact the sector at large. \u201cShould the adoption of PoW mining intensify, this scale could change,\u201d it stated.\n\nSome challenges on the industry\u2019s road to decarbonization include the short-term price volatility of BTC itself \u2013which directly impacts mining profitability \u2013 alongside external regulatory challenges. Furthermore, alternative technologies may \u201csupplement Bitcoin mining in the process of grid decarbonization,\u201d such as water desalination, CO2 removal, and batteries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo far, estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s CO2 emissions vary widely, depending on the measurements and sources used. On Wednesday, the Bitcoin Mining Council\u2019s survey data suggested that the sector\u2019s sustainable power mix is roughly 59.9%.\n\nBut there are issues with studies that ask miners to self report, because most overestimate how green their operation is.\n\n\"There may be a selection bias in the sample,\" study author Ibanez told Decrypt. \"Forty-three percent of the miners report their energy mix to the Bitcoin Mining Council, but probably the greener miners are the most willing to report.\"\n\nEven if the methods for measuring industry greenness at the moment leave some room for improvement, Ibanez said he's sure of one thing: The industry will become more green over time.\n\n\"The competition within the Bitcoin mining market is becoming increasingly fierce, making cheap energy a key differentiator in the business,\" he said. \"Renewable penetration is growing, and there are increasing periods of energy 'excess supply' where energy is very cheap or even negatively priced\u2014making flexible buyers like Bitcoin miners key for financial sustainability.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This post was updated to add comments from author Juan Ibanez."

        "content": "Hacker was held in 2020\n\nBengaluru: Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths, who investigated the infamous bitcoin case in 2020, tampered with and destroyed the evidence in gadgets like mobile phones and computers seized from the accused persons, a Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) has alleged.An FIR has been filed by K Ravishankar, deputy superintendent of police, SIT, against then CCB investigating officer of the case, KG Nagar police and others.The FIR has been registered with Cottonpet police under IPC sections 120B (hatching criminal conspiracy), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or banker, merchant or agent), 204 (destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence) and 426 (punishment for mischief).The SIT was formed to investigate the irregularities in CCB probe in the bitcoin case. \u201cThen CCB officials had seized gadgets like mobile phones, hard disks, laptops and other materials from the accused. They were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for getting mirror images of the deleted data and further opinion. For the purpose our investigation, we received those gadgets and reports from FSL. Shockingly, the FSL reports say more files were created in those gadgets during the period of the seizure,\u201d the complaint read.According to FSL reports, additional files were created in two pen drives, a hard disk and two Apple MacBook laptops. \u201cThe addition of more files in these gadgets was done inside the CCB office. Prima facie, it shows that then CCB IO and others, with vested interest and ulterior motives, added more files to the gadgets during the investigation,\u201d according to the complainant.In November 2020, when the BJP government was in power, KG Nagar police had arrested an accused, M Sujay, 30, of Sadashivnagar, on drug-peddling charges. During investigation, police found that drugs were purchased through the darknet by paying in bitcoins. Later, police arrested Srikrishna alias Sriki, a hacker who had studied in the Netherlands, for his alleged role in dealing with bitcoins in the case. Sriki was accused of hacking into government portals too.Later, it was alleged that there were irregularities in the investigation by CCB, and names of many bureaucrats, politicians and cops, as beneficiaries of the irregularities, surfaced. In July,the Congress government formed the SIT to probe the allegations."
