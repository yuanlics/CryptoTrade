        "title": "Bitcoin slides after network congestion leads Binance to briefly halt withdrawals - CNBC",
        "content": "\"Only a break back below $25,000 would give reason for concern. Until then, we suspect dips will continue to be very well supported,\" he added.\n\n\"Reports of a large bitcoin outflow and withdrawals being paused at a major exchange could be factoring into some of the weakness we're seeing. Ultimately however, there haven't been any major developments as far as price action goes, with bitcoin still very much confined to a multiday bullish consolidation,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was lower by 5.3% at $27,420.73, according to Coin Metrics. It has fallen 7% since Saturday. Ether fell 4.3% on Monday to $1,833.72.\n\nBitcoin fell to start the week, extending losses from a sharp drop over the weekend following reports by one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world about \"congestion\" on the Bitcoin network.\n\nMonday's drop came after Binance tweeted Sunday that the Bitcoin network was \"experiencing a congestion issue\" and that it was temporarily closing bitcoin withdrawals as a result until the network stabilized. Some market participants have argued that the Bitcoin network is stable and Binance should have prepared for a high-fee environment on Bitcoin.\n\nThe issue has highlighted a long-known setback of the Bitcoin network: It wasn't designed to handle a large number of transactions at scale. It processes just seven to 10 transactions per second, making it unviable as a potential rival to companies such as Visa and Mastercard \u2014 an idea many have explored over the years but largely put to rest. This is why projects such as the Lightning Network, which helps speed up transactions without affecting the network, have gained in popularity.\n\nService on Binance resumed, but later on Sunday evening the exchange again halted withdrawals.\n\n\"To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted,\" the Binance account tweeted. \"We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.\"\n\nA 'parabolic spike'\n\nAlex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, noted a \"parabolic spike\" in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network last week, attributing it to users minting BRC-20 tokens. These are an experimental token on the Bitcoin blockchain that ultimately allow users to create NFTs on Bitcoin. They're inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20 token.\n\nOn May 1, about 50% of bitcoin transactions were BRC-20 mints, Thorn highlighted in a note Friday. In the 14 days preceding Friday, mean transaction fees on Bitcoin increased 297%.\n\n\"There is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on Bitcoin network,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. \"The Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network.\""

        "title": "How SpongeBob and Pepe Are Causing Big Problems for Bitcoin - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Nickelodeon\n\nIt\u2019s been a little while since the world of digital currencies has had a real blowup. After the collapse of FTX and the arrest of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, rattled both the financial and political systems of the United States, the scandal du jour is a nice return to familiar territory: one involving stupid memes.\n\nThe immediate crisis is that if you want to buy or sell bitcoin right now, it is very hard to do so. The network that processes bitcoin transactions is all jammed up \u2014 at its peak, there have been more than 400,000 orders that are essentially stuck in a queue. These are all transactions that have built up over days, causing the price for conducting one to spike to about $20. (Last month, it was as low as 87 cents.) It\u2019s not a perfect analogy (there are workarounds for bitcoin), but imagine paying for your groceries with a Visa card, but then being told you have to wait hours or days until all the transitions ahead of yours go through \u2014 and, oh yeah, there will also be a $20 fee.\n\nImagine you get to your bank's drive through and there are 400,000 cars in front of you.\n\n\n\nThat's #bitcoin right now. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) May 8, 2023\n\nBut what\u2019s funny here is that all those other people in the bitcoin queue aren\u2019t buying groceries. They\u2019re sending each other memes. These aren\u2019t elevated or important memes \u2014 we\u2019re literally talking about Pepe the Frog and SpongeBob. While the core bitcoin blockchain has long been dominated by data about transactions (account A sending account B a given amount of bitcoin currency), recent innovations have made it cheaper and faster for people to write all kinds of data into the transaction, including pictures and jokes \u2014 a process called \u201cinscribing.\u201d So now bitcoin is a platform for not only bitcoin transactions, but for NFTs \u2014 recall those blockchain-based images like the Bored Apes that everyone was (very) briefly excited about \u2014 and joke coins that are all basically aspiring dogecoins. Two meme-coin projects, one based on the amphibian Pepe and the other on SpongeBob, are currently enjoying a major speculative boom, both acting like it\u2019s 2021 again. The demand is so wild that meme coins like these did $2.3 billion in volume last week. The resulting network congestion was so bad that Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, was forced to temporarily suspend bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nSo the big questions today \u2014 at least, among the kinds of people who spend much of their time thinking about bitcoin \u2014 are around whether this kind of innovation is a good thing or a bad thing. Was the underlying system really built for handling these kinds of transactions? Was the bitcoin blockchain meant to be inscribed with millions of stupid, fleeting jokes and memes? Or is this all fine and are the queues just a momentary growing pain as bitcoin expands into new use cases (ridiculous as they may be)? \u201cThe Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network,\u201d an analyst at Oppenheimer wrote, according to CNBC, tentatively taking a position in the optimists\u2019 camp.\n\nThis whole mess came out of an upgrade to the bitcoin system last year, which was supposed to have made transactions faster and cheaper. When bitcoins are traded, the transactions are recorded on the blockchain, the immutable ledger of who owns what that\u2019s the founding innovation for the whole crypto economy. \u201cIt\u2019s always been possible to inscribe data into a transaction on bitcoin. That\u2019s nothing new,\u201d Cory Klippsten, CEO of the financial-services firm Swan Bitcoin, told me. After last year\u2019s upgrade made it easier to transmit data, \u201cit wasn\u2019t long before anyone could invent a more lightweight way to do it,\u201d he said. The new ways to do this are bitcoin-adjacent systems called Ordinals and Stamps.\n\nBitcoin is, of course, the original cryptocurrency and, until now anyway, its proponents have seen it as more pure, less junky and corrupt than the rest of the crypto world. It doesn\u2019t function like a backdoor equity offering for funding some other venture \u2014 a model that\u2019s led to all kinds of scammy tokens, as well as a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission for companies violating securities laws. Because profits from bitcoin-trading can\u2019t feed back to some corporate source (the network was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who mysteriously vanished afterward, and now nobody owns it or controls it), it\u2019s regulated as a commodity \u2014 like a barrel of oil, or a bushel of wheat.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest cheerleaders are called Bitcoin Maxis (or maximalists). For years, they have mocked other crypto projects (a.k.a altcoins) for being unserious and scammy. Now, after the spectacular run-up in Pepe coins, they face the uncomfortable reality that the shitcoiners (as they call their foes) are have, at least temporarily, taken over their precious network.\n\nKlippsten, himself something of a bitcoin purist, sees the rest of the crypto universe trying to borrow bitcoin\u2019s cred. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to altcoiners whose whole goal is to grab some shine from bitcoin, do the bitcoin affinity thing, and then do some pump and dump with their shitcoin projects,\u201d he said. From the outside, it sure seems like these newest meme coins are showing that the line between bitcoin and the rest of crypto was never really all that hard to begin with. Bitcoin Maxis like Klippsten don\u2019t see it that way though. \u201cFor bitcoin, this changes nothing,\u201d he said."

        "content": "The culprit is, ironically, Bitcoin\u2019s own Taproot upgrade, which (perhaps unintentionally) opened up a new design space which permitted users to inscribe arbitrary content on the blockchain. Image NFTs (\u201cOrdinals\u201d) have stolen most of the attention, but the immediate catalyst for this spike was actually the creation of the BRC-20 standard, which relies on an exotic distribution method. BRC-20s are issued with a \u201cproof of burned fee\u201d mechanic, in which users must sacrifice transaction fees in order to create new tokens. This has driven fees in the short term to eye-watering levels, pricing out other sorts of conventional usage.

        "title": "Are crypto markets correlated with macroeconomic factors? - S&P Global",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices seem to be less affected by macroeconomic factors than prices of more traditional financial assets. Key drivers for crypto assets include market confidence, adoption, technology and liquidity conditions (see Table)\u00b9. By contrast, traditional financial assets are strongly influenced by macroeconomic drivers, such as interest rates and inflation. These traditional assets also differ from crypto in being subject to government regulations and in being more transparent in terms of know your-customer requirements and anti money laundering measures.\n\nTable 1\n\nInterconnections between the crypto ecosystem and macroeconomic factors show up in the fact that favorable market conditions increase investors\u2019 appetite for higher risk assets, such as crypto currencies. Changes in interest rates and borrowing costs could impact crypto markets through different channels than for traditional assets. For example, financing costs influence venture capital firms\u2019 decisions to invest in startups that want to build applications on blockchains (such as Ethereum), and consequently drive blockchain adoption. Likewise, for blockchains that lack an application layer and only have a transaction layer (such as Bitcoin), higher costs for financing mining rigs and warehouse space will lower marginal profits for miners. This difference is explained by the crypto assets\u2019 different value proposition. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is determined by transaction volumes and mining of these transactions, while Ether\u2019s comes from transaction validation, and additionally through the utility of applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. Due to their short history and speculative nature, we acknowledge that existing trends may change. New trends might affect how macroeconomic factors impact the crypto ecosystem, especially as more retail and institutional investors expand their investment portfolios to include crypto.\n\nThe recent period of historically low interest rates fueled investors\u2019 appetite for higher-yielding assets. The 2021 bull run in the crypto market coincided with a period of ultra-loose monetary conditions, eliciting the question of what impact, if any, low interest rates had on crypto valuations. By the same logic, as we are in a period of tighter monetary conditions, driven by higher interest rates and the reversal of Quantitative Easing (QE) \u2013 known commonly as Quantitative Tightening (QT) \u2013 it is of interest to understand the impact these dynamics will have. To better understand this relationship, we dove into the crypto ecosystem and analyzed the relationship with key macroeconomic factors using data through March 2023.\n\nIn this article we address the following questions: 1. Does monetary policy matter to crypto markets? a. Do crypto prices correlate to changes in interest rates? b. Do quantitative easing and tightening make a difference in cryptocurrency markets? c. Is money supply important for the crypto ecosystem? 2. Does perception of a possible incoming recession matter for crypto markets? 3. Can crypto assets be a hedge against inflation? 4. What does a strong or weak dollar mean for crypto markets? 5. Do financial stress and market volatility spill over into the crypto ecosystem?\n\n1. Does monetary policy matter to crypto markets?\n\nThe past decade appears to show that crypto markets perform well when there is fast growth in a broad measure of money supply (M2), stemming from a reduction in interest rates, quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. Conversely, monetary tightening seems to have restricted appreciation of crypto assets, or even contributed to depreciation. In this section, we analyze how these relationships hold over time and focus on interest rates, and other monetary policy measures that influence money supply, such as quantitative easing.\n\nA. Do crypto prices correlate with changes in interest rates?\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed\u2019s) actions influence the global economy, arguably including crypto markets. Low interest rates increase appetite for assets with higher risk and higher returns. In reaction to the decline in economic activity as a result of the Great Recession (2007-2009), the Fed and other central banks lowered interest rates to zero and held them at that level for just shy of a decade. During that period, demand for higher-yielding assets, including speculative grade credit was very strong. Global high yield issuance increased from less than $50 billion in 2009 to more than $250 billion in 2014. This demand for higher-yielding assets could also have extended to crypto assets.\n\nConversely, when the Fed, and other major central banks increase benchmark interest rates, higher-yielding assets become less attractive. It could be argued that the same applies to crypto assets. We analyze whether this inverse relationship between interest rates and crypto prices is supported by the data.\n\nWe use the risk-neutral yield on the 2-year US Treasury bond to gauge short-term market expectations on the evolution of US interest rates \u2013 it reflects what markets are pricing in for the Fed funds rates two years from today, according to the ACM model developed by the Fed. To study the crypto markets, we use the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (S&P BDMI). We focus our analysis on data from February 2017 (when the index started) to March 2023. In some cases, we look at longer time periods and will use Bitcoin prices.\n\nThe S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (S&P BDMI) reflects a broad investable universe of digital assets listed on open digital exchanges. Assets have to meet minimum liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Lukka is the pricing provider. The index is weighted by the equivalent of market capitalization for cryptocurrencies (coin supply multiplied by coin price). Bitcoin represents 40% of S&P BDMI, so the index is highly correlated with Bitcoin prices.\n\nIn Chart 1, we plot S&P BDMI and the 2-year Risk-Neutral Treasury Yield. Since 2017, the two indices exhibit a historical correlation of \u20130.33.\n\nChart 1\n\nOn a daily rolling three-month basis (chart 2) interest rates and the crypto index have exhibited an inverse relationship 63% of the time since May 2017. This increases to 75% from May 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inverse relationship is generally in line with how we would expect traditional assets to behave.\n\nChart 2\n\nSome argue that crypto assets could be in demand in a high interest rates/high inflation environment because they could serve as a store of value. We think the track record for crypto is too short to prove this. We study the relationship between crypto assets and inflation in section three of this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Do quantitative easing and tightening make a difference in cryptocurrency markets?\n\nWhen interest rates hit the zero bound after the Great Recession, and economic growth remained sluggish, central banks sought additional tools to stimulate activity. One was Quantitative Easing, in which central banks purchase mostly government-issued fixed income securities, typically of relatively long maturities. This let central banks further ease financial conditions and reduce long-term financing costs by lowering term premia in government bonds.\n\nIn the US, three QE rounds took place in 2009-2014, leading up to the Taper Tantrum of May 2014 when bond yields surged after Fed officials announced plans to reduce the pace of Treasury bond purchases. Then in 2018, the Fed started reducing its balance sheet by lowering the amount reinvested from maturing securities through Quantitative Tightening. A new emergency QE program was introduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, before the resumption of QT in 2022. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet peaked at nearly $9 trillion in early 2022 and has since gradually fallen to roughly $8.7 trillion.\n\nQE fueled appetite for higher-risk assets (in search of higher yield). Arguably, increased global liquidity/money supply, in an environment of favorable market conditions, should also have a positive impact on the crypto market, all else held equal. Unprecedented levels of monetary easing by central banks across the world since 2008/09 have increased money supply to record levels. Chart 3 below shows the total assets on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and the price of Bitcoin since 2016. The markers highlight the fourth round of QE, which began in 2020, and the two periods of QT.\n\nChart 3\n\nAfter a Bitcoin rally in 2017, a significant price slump in 2018 coincided with the Fed\u2019s balance sheet reduction program. There was another bull run in 2020, in which Bitcoin appreciated 1,000%. It coincided with a QE program that started during COVID-19 in 2020 and with increased institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin reached a peak in November 2021 before entering a \u2018crypto winter\u2019 in which it lost more than two-thirds of its value over six months as market appetite for risky assets decreased. This downturn took place during a tightening monetary policy that started in June 2022. It was also coupled with crypto-specific events that followed the decreasing price trend, such as the collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022 and of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nChart 4 shows year-over-year changes for Bitcoin and the Fed\u2019s balance sheet since 2017. Some periods of balance sheet reduction and tightening measures, captured by negative changes, are associated with bearish periods for Bitcoin. The 2020 expansionary period is followed by a glaring crypto rally.\n\nChart 4\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally in 2020 coincided with a QE program that started during COVID-19 and with increased institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nOne can also look at QE and QT through the lens of the bond markets and study the relationship between bond premia and crypto prices. Term premia fell into negative territory during the 2020-2021 rally as another round of QE was implemented. This spurred investors\u2019 interest in higher-yielding assets and high-return speculative investments like crypto. Chart 5 plots S&P BDMI and the 10-year Zero Coupon Treasury Term Premia.\n\nBond yields and premia are not always consistently impacted by QE and QT. For example, during the QT period in 2018-2019, the 10-year Zero Coupon Treasury Term Premia was initially positive and then turned negative. It has oscillated between negative and positive during QT since June 2022.\n\nChart 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Is global money supply important for the crypto ecosystem?\n\nTo assess the impact of global liquidity on crypto markets, we start by looking at M2 (a measure of money supply). M2 has surged since the Great Recession as central banks lowered interest rates and implemented QE. Chart 6 shows the relationship between M2 and S&P BDMI. M2 is the US Federal Reserve\u2019s estimate of total money supply including all of the cash people have on hand plus money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles. Since the 1980\u2019s, M2 has exhibited exponential growth, particularly due to expansionary monetary policies during recessionary periods. In July 2022, M2 declined as the US reversed loose monetary policies.\n\nCorrelation between money supply and the crypto index is 0.75 over the historical period starting in 2017. This positive relationship notably broke down during 2018, as S&P BDMI fell, while M2 kept growing until July 2022. S&P BDMI\u2019s decIine followed a crypto boom in 2017, when the market was flooded with initial coin offerings and new ventures, many of which ultimately failed. Both measures moved in the same direction in the second half of 2022. M2 contracted while the crypto market was hit by a series of events that fueled volatility and price declines, including the collapse of stablecoin UST in May and the downfall of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November.\n\nChart 6\n\nChart 7 shows rolling three-month percent changes for M2 and S&P BDMI. Since 2017, changes for M2 have been generally positive, with a pronounced peak at the beginning of the pandemic, while the crypto index has exhibited several periods of negative returns. In the second half of 2022, both indices exhibited negative returns.\n\nIn general, crypto markets have performed well in periods of expansionary monetary policies, although we are not able to establish a causal relationship. Some of the large swings in crypto currencies have taken place following factors that are not directly related to monetary policy, such as the FTX collapse.\n\nChart 7\n\n2. Does the perception of a possible incoming recession matter for crypto?\n\nGrowing recessionary risk could weigh on crypto assets if economic concerns dent appetite for higher-risk assets. At the same time, a recession perceived to be driven by poor government policies could arguably boost demand for crypto because the assets\u2019 decentralized and borderless nature creates a potential shelter.\n\nTo understand whether recession risks weigh on crypto assets, we can use a widely followed gauge of economic expectations \u2013 the slope of the US Treasury yield curve. In particular, the difference between the yields on the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity and the 3-month Treasury Constant Maturity, which has historically been a better signal of an incoming recession than other tenors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is usually higher than that on the 3-month T-bill, giving the curve a positive slope. When this relationship inverts, it suggests that interest rates will fall in the future due to an economic slowdown. In the past, recessions have generally occurred whenever there was a sustained yield curve inversion. A notable exception is the current inversion that started in October 2022.\n\nThe yield curve has inverted three times since the 2008 recession. The first took place from March 2019 to October 2019, as above-target inflation prompted the Fed to increase interest rates, increasing expectations that the economy would fall into a recession. However, resiliency in the labor market prevented a recession during that period. The second inversion, at the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020, did not last long because of strong monetary and fiscal policies designed to mitigate the economic shock of COVID-19 restrictions. The yield curve inverted again in October 2022, as noted in the previous paragraph, and it remains in that state as of May 2023.\n\nChart 8 shows S&P BDMI and the difference between the 10-year and 3-month yields. When this difference is negative, the yield curve is inverted. The data is too short to find a consistent association between yield curve inversions and price declines for crypto.\n\nChart 8\n\nChart 9 below shows a more detailed view since late October 2022. Notably, S&P BDMI has more than recovered since losing 25% of its value in November 2022, even with the yield curve remaining negative. Some of the crypto volatility was linked to the implosion of digital-asset exchange FTX and its domino effect in the crypto lending space, as well as general uneasiness about crypto risks and governance.\n\nChart 9\n\nIf a recession is caused by inflation, or poor government policies, investors may look at crypto assets as a safe haven because they are decentralized, not tied to any country or government, and at least partially driven by factors such as technology and market sentiment. In countries where national currencies are unstable, the crypto market offers an alternative for preserving purchasing power. A handful of countries have adopted crypto as legal tender.\n\nFiat currencies in emerging markets can exhibit large and recurring depreciations, or be characterized by limits on convertibility to hard currency. By contrast, crypto assets have the potential to weather economic shocks and remain a unit of account and medium of exchange. This perception may have helped to fuel adoption of cryptocurrencies in developing nations. Crypto gained popularity as a means of remittance payments and for sending money across borders. It is now seen by many as an enticing investment opportunity as well, which has encouraged the launch of several asset management products that include crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Can Crypto assets be a hedge for inflation?\n\nIn countries with unstable currencies, crypto assets potentially offer an alternative for preserving purchasing power.\n\nDuring their limited life, crypto assets have had bull and bear periods that are not directly tied to macroeconomic inflationary shocks. This helps to explain why adding crypto to a traditional portfolio increases returns, at the cost of also raising volatility. We also observe that retail investors in emerging markets with weak currencies and hyperinflation have turned to crypto assets to protect their wealth.\n\nInflation is generally associated with an overheated economy after expansionary monetary and fiscal policies have increased aggregate demand. In some cases, it is also the result of negative supply shocks. Fiscal policies that increase disposable incomes above sustainable levels raise consumption, leading to demand-driven inflation. They also boost investment, including in assets that generate higher returns, such as crypto.\n\nA frequently asked question is whether crypto assets can be a good hedge for inflation. Bitcoin and other crypto assets should be less correlated to instabilities in a financial system due to their decentralized nature. High fungibility also makes crypto a potentially strong candidate to store value in unfavorable economic conditions. Still, this is a complex topic, and the data may be too short to confidently address it.\n\nWe analyzed the relationship between inflation and the crypto ecosystem over the past six years \u2013 a period featuring a transition from low inflation pre-pandemic to markedly high rates. We also used the relationship between inflation and gold (a traditional inflation hedge) since 1982 as a comparison. If crypto follows the path of \u201cdigital gold\u201d, returns should be positively related to changes in US inflation expectations.\n\nFor average US inflation expectations, we use 2-year and 10-year breakeven inflation rates, derived from the relevant Treasury Constant Maturity Securities and Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity Securities. The rates measure inflation expectations in the short and longer term. We use US inflation expectation as crypto tends to be priced in dollars and the market for financial instruments linked to inflation is liquid and well established. In countries with unstable currencies, crypto assets potentially offer an alternative for preserving purchasing power.\n\nChart 10 below shows S&P BDMI and breakeven inflation expectations. The 2-year breakeven inflation rate dipped into negative territory during the pandemic when the yield on Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities (TIPS) exceeded the yield on Treasuries.\n\nChart 10\n\nThe historical correlation between the daily returns of S&P BDMI and the inflation expectation indices is low, around 0.10.\n\nLooking at rolling three-month returns for S&P BDMI and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations in chart 11 shows no conclusive pattern. There is a notable number of periods where returns on crypto and inflation indices exhibit opposite signs, meaning an increase in inflation expectations is not associated with an increase in cryptocurrency prices. However, there are also periods where the two measures are both positive or both negative.\n\nChart 11\n\nOverall, the data to date does not support a conclusive answer on crypto assets\u2019 hedging capabilities with respect to inflation. By contrast, Chart 12 below shows that gold prices and the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index have tracked each other quite well since 2003. Additionally, there is evidence of Granger causality between the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index and the S&P GSCI Gold index at a 95% confidence level. The same test fails for Bitcoin. (Granger causality is a statistical test to verify whether one variable is useful in forecasting another.)\n\nChart 12\n\nIn developing economies, there are cases in which crypto assets have been used as an alternative to holding the domestic currency amid very high levels of inflation, rapid currency depreciation, or stringent capital controls. This could underpin reports that emerging markets rank among the top countries for cryptocurrency trading (according to Chainanalysis data for instance) . Still, in some countries, cryptocurrencies may also be used to bypass financial sanctions, which complicates the study of crypto as a counter-inflationary asset.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that supply matters in crypto markets, even if this isn\u2019t directly analogous to inflation. New coins are minted with proof-of-work mining or proof-ofstake validation. Supply of Bitcoin increases because miners get newly minted coins in return for their work. These rewards continually decrease and they will eventually end in about 2140. Ether, on the other hand, has recently had brief periods of burning more than minting. This will likely continue going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. What does a strong or weak dollar mean for crypto markets?\n\nWe measure dollar strength, using the Nominal Broad US Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a weighted basket of currencies used by US trade partners. Investors should favor other currencies when the dollar is expected to weaken (an index decline) and demonstrate the opposite amid dollar strength (a rising index). Arguably, the same logic should apply to crypto assets, which would lead to a negative relationship between crypto prices and the US Dollar Index.\n\nChart 13\n\nChart 13 shows the Nominal Broad US Dollar Index and S&P BDMI. The historical correlation between their daily returns is \u20130.16. That compares with a \u20130.40 correlation between the US Dollar Index and S&P GSCI Gold. In chart 14, a rolling three-month correlation analysis shows an inverse relationship (negative correlation) between the US Dollar Index and both S&P BDMI and S&P GSCI Gold 75% of the time.\n\nIdiosyncratic events may derail the expected relationship between crypto and the US Dollar Index over short time periods. Furthermore, because correlation does not substitute for causation, it is not obvious that a change in the US Dollar Index can provide insight into future movements in the crypto markets. In fact, there is no Granger causality between the US Dollar Index and Bitcoin prices.\n\nChart 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Do financial stress and market volatility spill over into crypto markets?\n\nIncreased financial stress and market volatility are generally associated with declining crypto prices. We use the Financial Stress Index (FSI) to measure stress in global financial markets. The index incorporates five categories of indicators: credit, equity valuation, funding, safe assets and volatility. The index is positive when stress levels are above average, and negative when stress levels are below average. Chart 15 plots the FSI index and S&P BDMI.\n\nFSI turned positive in early March 2020, around the day when WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. The shock was felt in crypto markets, with Bitcoin losing more than 40% of its value that day. Many other cryptos also plunged, along with stocks. Bitcoin then subsequently started a bull run, along with other assets, which continued until late 2021. FSI turned negative in June 2020. The FSI turned positive towards the middle of 2022, as the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict increased prices of several commodities, putting upward pressure on inflation, and consequently raising interest rate hike expectations.\n\nChart 15\n\nFSI turned positive most recently in mid-March 2023, though to a lesser extent than in 2022 or 2020. The failure of a few US banks added significant pressure to the banking system. These upheavals caused two major stablecoins (USDC and DAI) to depeg by 13%. Circle, the issuer of USDC, confirmed that $3.3 billion of cash reserves backing USDC were held at one of the failed banks. Both stablecoins recovered to their peg levels after the government confirmed that it would support the banks\u2019 creditors. These events highlight contagion risks from traditional finance to decentralized financial systems. Interestingly, Bitcoin rallied after the event, leading to speculation as to whether this was a response to the banking crisis, to the government intervention or to something else.\n\nWe also looked at another widely used metric for market volatility \u2013 The Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX). Also known as the market fear index, the VIX measures expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 index option prices.\n\nHigher levels for the VIX indicate expectations for increased volatility. That adds pressure and fear to financial markets, drives liquidity premiums upward and reduces investors\u2019 confidence. In such a market, it is expected that cryptocurrencies will exhibit more volatility.\n\nIn addition to VIX, we looked at the CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index (OVX), which measures the short-term volatility of crude oil as priced by the United States Oil Fund. We chose to analyze this index because considerable energy requirements mean that there may be a relationship between energy prices and Bitcoin miners. Chart 16 shows the VIX and OVX indices and S&P BDMI. The volatility indices both show sudden spikes in Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 period.\n\nChart 16\n\nCrypto prices have an inverse relationship with the VIX and OVX indices \u2013 prices fall when the fear indices go up. S&P BDMI\u2019s historical return correlation is \u20130.20 with VIX and \u20130.11 with OVX. Rolling three-month correlation is negative 90% of the time, reaching \u20130.60 in the past year. Interestingly, considering that both indices pertain to different asset classes, we found a Granger causality relationship between VIX and S&P BDMI.\n\nThe interconnectedness between traditional and decentralized finance is of particular importance because a healthy banking system is the backbone of a healthy economy. For example, in the US, the collapse of a few banks in March 2023 caused liquidity pressure in the banking industry. This in turn depegged some stablecoins, which are supposed to provide a stable bridge between the fiat and crypto ecosystems. There is no indication of how the wider crypto ecosystem would have reacted if the crisis hadn\u2019t been contained. At the same time, crypto-friendly banks are exposed to crypto instability and have no control over market trends. That means the banking industry may be directly affected by uncertainties stemming from the crypto ecosystem.\n\nChart 17\n\nAs more institutional investors turn to crypto, contagion risk between traditional and crypto assets may rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nCrypto assets are not exempt from the effect of macroeconomic changes, even if performance is also powered by other drivers such as technology and market sentiment. The market\u2019s relationship with macroeconomic indicators may become stronger \u2013 and more in line with that of traditional financial assets \u2013 as more institutional investors turn to crypto. If that happens, contagion risk between traditional and crypto assets may rise, potentially flowing in both directions. With regulators demonstrating a heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrency risks, the interconnections between the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem, the global economy and financial markets continue to develop.\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Depegging Highlights DeFi\u2019s Exposure To TradFi Risks, March 15, 2023\n\n\u2013 The Fed\u2019s Plan For US Banks Should Reduce Contagion Risk, March 13, 2023\n\n\u2013 DeFi Securitizations: A Credit Risk Perspective, Feb. 7, 2023\n\n\u2013 A Deep Dive Into Crypto Valuation, Nov. 10, 2022\n\n\u2013 Regulating Crypto: The Bid To Frame, Tame, Or Game The Ecosystem, July 14, 2022\n\n\u2013 Stablecoins: Common Promises, Diverging Outcomes, June 15, 2022"

        "content": "Last month, Standard Chartered released a report that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) can hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. The target seems steep, but cryptocurrencies have a history of skyrocketing in the blink of an eye.\n\nStandard Chartered cites stress in the traditional banking system as one of the catalysts for a Bitcoin rally. I believe that a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2023 will also contribute to the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin halving is due in 2024. Going by past instances, the halving event is followed by a rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With these positives, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate quality crypto projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment can also be considered in some of the best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally. If Bitcoin touches $100,000, the crypto stocks to buy can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these crypto stocks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the second largest crypto exchange in the world, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is among the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nOn the day of the Q1 2023 results, COIN stock surged by 18%. This was on the back of a revenue and earnings beat. With Bitcoin likely to trend higher, I believe that COIN will remain in an uptrend.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the rally in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space translates into higher trading and speculative activity. The recovery in revenue along with margin improvement is on the cards in the coming quarters.\n\nCoinbase is also expanding its addressable market potential. In Q1, the company made inroads in Canada, Brazil, and Singapore. With plans to expand into more markets, revenue growth acceleration is likely to be meaningful.\n\nThe company\u2019s subscription and services revenue has also continued to swell. For Q1, the revenue was $361.7 million, which was higher by over 100% on a year-on-year basis. With a strong retail and institutional client base, the outlook is positive for COIN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nblockchain\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has skyrocketed by 242% in year-to-date 2023. During this period, Bitcoin has surged by over 70%. The big rally is an indicator of the upside potential if Bitcoin touches $100,000.\n\nAs an overview, Riot Platforms is a Bitcoin miner. There are two reasons to like Riot over peers. First, the company has a solid balance sheet with zero debt and $230 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nFurther, Riot is a low-cost miner. Last year, the company reported a gross mining margin of 60.3%. With Bitcoin trending higher, I expect healthy EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside for the company.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Riot has been continuously increasing its mining capacity. As of April, the company reported a capacity of 10.6EH/s. Riot expects to boost capacity to 12.5EH/s in the second half of 2023. Considering the balance sheet health, I expect capacity expansion to continue. Therefore, there is visibility for robust revenue growth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nSquare, Inc. (SQ) logo seen displayed on smart phone. Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a sustained downtrend. However, it remains in my list of best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally.\n\nIt was back in December 2021 that Square re-branded as Block. The idea was to emphasize the company\u2019s focus on blockchain technology. The bear market for cryptocurrencies has impacted developments. However, as the crypto winter ends, there are reasons to be bullish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s Cash App is being used to buy and sell Bitcoin. Additionally, it was reported in 2021 that the company is building a decentralized finance business using Bitcoin. Last year, it was reported that Jack Dorsey was building Web5 based on Bitcoin.\n\nMy point is that there are developments in the background. Block has ample financial flexibility to invest in blockchain technology. With a big correction in SQ stock, it seems like a good time to accumulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Citing excessive energy use, noisy operations, pollution and electronic waste, Buncombe County put a one-year moratorium on any new cryptocurrency mining operations.\n\nThe vote in Asheville follows a ban on the server farms approved last year in Clay County, in the mountains southwest of Asheville. Neighboring Macon County is also considering a ban on the mining operations.\n\n\n\nWhat You Need To Know More western North Carolina counties are considering how to regulate or restrict new cryptocurrency mines\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operations use server farms to run complicated computer algorithms to \"mine\" for digital currencies, like Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponents say the server farms are noisy and waste electricity\n\n\n\n\n\nBuncombe County just voted for a one-year moratorium on crypto farms. Clay County passed a resolution banning the farms and Mason County is considering a similar ordinance\n\n\n\nIn December, Cherokee County passed a resolution asking the legislature for more power to regulate cryptocurrency mines.\n\nCryptocurrency mines use server farms to run complicated algorithms to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoin and similar digital currencies. They use warehouses full of powerful computers that require a lot of electricity. The operations have brought complaints from nearby residents over the 24-hour noise from the servers and cooling equipment in previously quiet rural areas in the North Carolina mountains.\n\nThe server farms are attracted to western North Carolina by low-cost energy and lax zoning regulations, according to a recent report from the Environmental Working Group.\n\nCryptocurrency miners have also been looking for new places to set up shop since China banned most of their operations two years ago, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBuncombe County Planning Director Nathan Pennington said the county is working on a new comprehensive plan.\n\n\u201cThis one-year pause gives us time to work with residents and craft standards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commission passed the moratorium unanimously last week.\n\n\u201cThe moratorium will maintain the status quo by limiting any negative effects in neighborhoods impacted by this use until a proper regulatory scheme can be developed,\u201d the ordinance states.\n\nThe ban would expire after a year or when the county comes up with new rules for where the server farms can be located. It only includes unincorporated areas of Buncombe County.\n\n\u201cThey have proven to be a nuisance to neighbors and a threat to our environment,\u201d Chris Joyell, with the environmental group Mountain True, said during a public hearing over the temporary ban in Buncombe County.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to greenwash crypto mining. Even if miners claim to rely on renewable energy, their operations are still hogging energy that we would need to meet the county and state carbon reduction goals,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everyone at the hearing supported the moratorium. Craig Deutsch told the commissions the moratorium could discourage new industry in the county.\n\nThe crypto mining operations, he said, could \u201cencourage innovation and bring new industry to the area.\u201d\n\nNoise problems should already be addressed by noise ordinances, said Dennis Fassuliotis, director of the South Carolina Emerging Tech Association, speaking during the public hearing.\n\nHe also countered the environmental arguments against the server farms.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining specifically does not produce any greenhouse gasses itself. It uses a mixture of the grid that everyone else uses,\u201d Fassuliotis told the commission. \u201cBitcoin is the industry leader in sustainability.\u201d\n\nNew York lawmakers last year passed a 2-year ban on new cryptocurrency mines that wanted to retrofit old fossil-fuel power plants to power their servers.\n\n"

As reported in local news, the micro-European nation continues to embrace blockchain technologies.\n\nRisch, who also serves as finance minister, is quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cA payment option with Bitcoin is coming.\u201d\n\nHowever, he did not give a timeframe. Moreover, the principality is unlikely to accept Bitcoin and \u201chodl\u201d (hold onto) the satoshis it receives. Instead, it will accept deposits in Bitcoin and immediately exchange them for Swiss francs, the national currency. The direct exchange into fiat money sidesteps the currency\u2019s volatility.\n\nDespite not being a European Union member, Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area, where the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could apply. This regulatory clarity could attract more crypto firms to the region.\n\nSimilar to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, Lichtenstein is a small but thriving cryptocurrency hub in Europe. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, which passed in 2019, provided clear crypto regulation, with several crypto-focused businesses setting up operations in the country since.\n\nThe nation follows a similar course to the nearby Swiss communities of Zug and Lugano, which accept Bitcoin for some taxes and public services, with retailers, including the likes of McDonald\u2019s, also accepting BTC.\n\nNonetheless, the sixth smallest nation in the world is cautious in its approach to investing in Bitcoin or crypto. Risch expressed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently too risky for the country\u2019s multibillion-dollar treasury, but the verdict may change in the future.\n\nRelated: Liechtenstein adapts blockchain laws to developing crypto landscape\n\nThis move by Liechtenstein coincides with a growing trend of smaller nations embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also fell back, with Litecoin leading the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat to lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday ahead of the latest inflation reading for the economy on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Largest banks should fill void left in crypto following collapses, says Standard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick\n\nTop 10 crypto lose steam\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin dropped 3.48% to US$27,594 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token has fallen 1.76% over the past seven days.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice within 12 hours on Sunday and Monday, citing congestion and higher transaction fees. The average transaction fee on the Bitcoin blockchain surged to US$19.21 on Sunday, almost seven times higher than the start of the month, according to data from financial information platform YCharts.\n\nThe jump in transactions is attributed to the Ordinal protocol introduced in January that allows users to mint memecoins and digital collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEther fell 2.04% to US$1,843 but held a weekly gain of 0.50%. The second largest cryptocurrency reached a low of US$1,818 earlier on Tuesday, but managed to hold the US$1,800 resistance level.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower for the past 24 hours, with Litecoin leading the losers, which fell 8.08% to US$77.65 and logged a weekly loss of 10.59%.\n\nPepe and Floki, two memecoins that surged after being listed on Binance last week, slid 32.88% and 12.36% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAdding to the pessimism, Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. The company closed the U.S. business on April 30 and faces charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged securities law violations. The company has rejected the charges. Bittrex Global will continue to service customers outside the U.S., the company said on Tuesday.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 3.26% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion.

        "content": "Amid Bitcoin\u2019s recent spike in transaction fees, block number 788695 marks a special milestone for miners: For the first time since 2017, the transaction fees in a single block surpassed the block rewards doled out to miners. Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They\u2019re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin \u201chalvening.\u201d\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\n'Attack on Bitcoin\u2019 Claims Circulate as Transaction Fees Climb Higher\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually \u2014 in more than a hundred years \u2014 transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn\u2019t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren\u2019t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don\u2019t increase over the years.\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: \"The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.\""

        "title": "$3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin: The Silk Road hacker's story - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Where would you hide $3.4 billion worth of Bitcoin? For James Zhong, the ideal spot was to store it on a computer \u2014 with its circuitry exposed \u2014 placed in a used Cheetos popcorn tin hidden in a bathroom closet under a pile of blankets.\n\nZhong, now 32, was sentenced to a year in federal prison last month for a hack that took place almost 11 years ago. His victim? Ross Ulbricht, the proprietor of the Silk Road dark web drug marketplace where Bitcoin found its first significant use case, as an underground currency. Today, Ulbricht is himself serving two life sentences plus 40 years for his part in operating the illegal marketplace, but darknet markets continue to flourish.\n\nSomewhat ironically, billionaire Zhong was caught due to a transfer of just $1,000 worth of BTC to an address he\u2019d used previously.\n\nProsecutors stated that Zhong spent lavishly on luxuries. (Zhong\u2019s social media)\n\n\n\nLifestyle of a crypto billionaire\n\nHow much is $3.4 billion? One could build another Burj Khalifa \u2014 the world\u2019s tallest tower, located in Dubai ($1.5 billion) \u2014 and make the winning bid on Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d \u2014 the most expensive painting ever sold ($450 million) \u2014 and still have over a billion left over to purchase a sports team, yacht and fleet of private jets. It\u2019s almost beyond comprehension.\n\nThe computer containing most of Zhong\u2019s Bitcoin, found in a popcorn tin. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nBut Zhong lived in the American city of Gainesville, Georgia, where around $1 million is enough to purchase the luxurious four-bedroom lakefront property he called home. According to some sources, gaining attention from women was among the key motivations of Zhong \u2014 who is autistic and was reportedly bullied in school. Court documents hint at his lavish lifestyle:\n\n\u201cIndeed, in the 51 months before law enforcement\u2019s overt search of Zhong\u2019s residences, Zhong dissipated approximately $16 million of crime proceeds, spending lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses.\u201d\n\nIf his online posts are anything to go by, Zhong can also be said to have been something of a party animal, using cocaine on weekends and bragging about being drunk while keeping an eye on the markets. Perhaps this comes with the territory of stealing billions from a drug kingpin.\n\nZhong memed about his party habits on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nAll this was presumably financed with the roughly 2,900 BTC that the government did not recover from his theft. Zhong stole 50,000 BTC and converted his free Bitcoin Cash into another 3,500 BTC. However, only 50,591 BTC was seized.\n\nSilk Road\n\nWhere did all this begin? Possibly with a Bitcointalk user named Teppy, who in June 2010 made a post titled \u201cA Heroin Store\u201d outlining \u201ca thought experiment about how a heroin store might operate, accepting Bitcoins, and ending drug prohibition in the process.\u201d The post connected Bitcoin to libertarianism and suggested that this would enable the new currency to become \u201ctruly disruptive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a cutting-edge concept. \u201cPizza Day,\u201d which saw Bitcoin exchanged for real-world goods for the first time \u2014 a pair of pizzas for 10,000 BTC \u2014 had happened just three weeks prior.\n\nEight months later, in February 2011, Silk Road opened for business in the hidden back alleys of the web. \u201cTo access the Tor dark web, users need to download special software,\u201d explains Ethan Lou, an occasional Magazine contributor and the author of Once a Bitcoin Miner. He speaks from experience. Tor, he notes, has many legitimate uses for those who value privacy, including leaking information to the press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy if you have some basic tech know-how. Once you get in, you see that it looks like the internet from the 1990s.\u201d\n\nSellers could list their items for sale on Silk Road, and the website would hold funds in escrow until items were received by the buyer, who could rate the item and seller. Often, administrators would adjudicate disputes. In months, the site grew to host over 10,000 listings of controlled substances, eventually processing around 1.5 million transactions. One early user was podcaster Peter McCormack, who called it \u201cAmazon for drugs\u201d and told Magazine how he wound up in hospital after three grams of cocaine arrived one day and he got carried away \u2014 literally, in an ambulance.\n\nAuthorities close in\n\nBy June, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin had written to the attorney general and the Drug Enforcement Agency, demanding they take action against the marketplace.\n\nSome of those actions were off-the-books, such as those by DEA Special Agent Carl Mark Force IV, the \u201clead undercover agent\u201d who in 2015 was sentenced to 6.5 years for various crimes connected with the case. This included demanding exchanges freeze BTC accounts in order to withdraw the coins for himself as well as faking the death of site administrator Curtis Green, whom he had actually arrested, in order to collect money from DPR, who allegedly wanted him dead.\n\nZhong had autism, and prosecutors said he spent lavishly. (Social media)\n\nThe website came to an end on Oct. 1, 2013, when a couple started bickering in San Fransisco\u2019s Glen Park Library. This caught the attention of the nearby Ulbricht, who turned his head from the laptop he was working on. It was a trap. At that moment, FBI agents swooped in from behind bookshelves and grabbed Ulbricht\u2019s laptop before he could log out and lock away his 144,000 BTC \u2014 the proof he was DPR.\n\nUlbricht received a double life sentence plus 40 years with no possibility of parole. Many in the Bitcoin community and beyond have criticized the sentence as unjust, particularly considering the nonviolent nature of his crime. FreeRoss, an organization dedicated to advocating for his release, archives statements by politicians and industry leaders speaking in favor of his release. As Lou asks:\n\n\u201cAre two life sentences reasonable for someone who did something that is nonviolent?\u201d\n\nI was arrested at the age of 29 and today I turn 39. I\u2019ve lost my 30s to prison.\n\n\n\nDuring that time, I\u2019ve done my best to learn from my mistakes, better myself, and help others do the same.\n\n\n\nI hope someday I can make amends as a free man as well. \u2014 Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) March 27, 2023\n\nA pirate\u2019s billions\n\nDuring Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing, the funds earned by the site were declared proceeds of crime, meaning the Bitcoin was confiscatable by the U.S. government. The approximately 144,000 BTC found on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop was now U.S. property.\n\n\u201cUnder U.S. law, authorities can effectively bring a case against money or other goods and seize them under civil forfeiture laws without necessarily arresting the person possessing them. This naturally extends to digital currencies like Bitcoin,\u201d explains Jason Corbett, a lawyer whose firm, Silk Legal, specializes in cryptocurrencies.\n\nCheetos, really? Where else would you keep billions in Bitcoin? (United States Department of Justice)\n\nThe government disposed of its newfound Bitcoin via a series of auctions held by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014. Venture capitalist Tim Draper famously purchased 30,000 BTC for $18 million. Functionally, the auctions legitimized Bitcoin by removing all doubt regarding its legality: How could the government sell something it considers illegal?\n\nBut some of the Bitcoin was missing, all traceable from the Silk Road addresses. About 50,000 had been stolen from Silk Road\u2019s hot wallets back in September 2012.\n\nIt was not a sophisticated hack. Zhong deposited 500 BTC into the Silk Road platform, only to make five withdrawals for 500 BTC a few seconds later, tricking the wallet software into returning 2,500 BTC to him. This was repeated several times using different accounts and increasing amounts, netting Zhong \u201capproximately 50,000 Bitcoin out of Silk Road in just a few days,\u201d according to court documents. At the time, this amount of Bitcoin was worth around $600,000.\n\nUnexpected Bitcoin Cash windfall\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin was forked in a move championed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. This allowed every Bitcoin holder to redeem 1 BCH for each Bitcoin they held.\n\nMany proponents believed that Bitcoin Cash was the \u201ctrue\u201d Bitcoin, but Zhong, writing as the aptly named \u201cLoaded,\u201d took to the Bitcointalk forum to disagree. That summer, he went on to exchange his 50,000 BCH for 3,500 additional BTC. As the U.S. government views the stolen Silk Road BTC as proceeds of crime, it similarly views the BCH later assigned to them as equally confiscatable.\n\nZhong, writing as the aptly named \u201cLoaded\u201d on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nAs a decade passed, the value of Zhong\u2019s stolen treasure grew exponentially into the billions. However, with Zhong\u2019s blockchain signature pointing to the lost Silk Road coins, it was only a matter of time before U.S. investigators took notice. There were, and probably still are, eyes on the forum at the center of the Bitcoin movement, where Ulbricht himself had posted under the name \u201cAltoid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the trail that eventually led Trevor McAleenan, a special agent with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division, to rummage through the contents of Zhang\u2019s bathroom closets in 2022 in search of \u201capproximately 53,500 [BTC in] Silk Road Crime Proceeds.\u201d He recovered 50,591 BTC, which, \u201cusing a conservative estimate of the lowest spot price of BTC on the date of the search,\u201d amounted to $3,388,817,011.90.\n\nlolllllllllllllll yeah, well, he did that too. \ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/W90vMwMaIR \u2014 Tay \ud83d\udc96 (@tayvano_) March 31, 2023\n\nNot a tin pot setup\n\nThough Zhong hid much of his BTC in a tin, Special Agent McAleenan described his setup as sophisticated, made up of \u201cmultiple computer servers, virtual private networks, cold wallets, virtual machines, numerous layers of encryption, and multiple Bitcoin nodes.\u201d Over the first several years following his 2012 heist, Zhong kept his loot on two addresses of approximately 40,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to make the connection to the hack appear more distant, he began periodically moving the Bitcoin \u2014 for example, splitting the 10,000 BTC address into 10 addresses holding 1,000 BTC each in 2020.\n\nThe lakefront home where Zhong kept his treasure. $3.4 billion could buy around 3,600 such houses. (Zillow)\n\n\n\nIn an apparent attempt to further obfuscate the funds, that same year he \u201cpushed approximately 750 BTC of the Silk Road Crime Proceeds through a decentralized Bitcoin mixer,\u201d which is software that effectively mixes cryptocurrency from various addresses together to make it unclear from which source a final balance comes, thereby aiming to break a connection to tracked coins such as those involved in Silk Road.\n\nWhile technically anyone can use a site like Blockchain.com to follow transactions \u2014 including Zhong\u2019s \u2014 on the Bitcoin chain, it is worth noting that the IRS went beyond this, using blockchain tracing and forensic software to string suspicious addresses together more easily. While such software does not add any new information, it makes interpreting the data easier.\n\nFeds swoop in\n\nDespite his VPNs and encryption and various attempts to hide the Silk Road coins, Zhong must have slipped up at some point, as the IRS was able to track him by his IP address \u2014 a unique identifier assigned to each device that connects to the internet. This IP address was then matched to records held with Zhong\u2019s internet service provider as well as an exchange where he sent some coins to be traded, presumably obtained by a warrant requiring these records to be released.\n\nZhong\u2019s floor safe. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nThe successful recovery of the Bitcoin came down to identifying the movements of the coins in question and following them to an exchange where Zhong had deposited and sold 119 BTC, worth somewhere in the region of $1 million, in 2019. Despite attempts to mix and obfuscate, the coins\u2019 connection to Zhong and Silk Road was confirmed by a transfer of a mere 0.07750842 BTC \u2014 around $1,000 \u2014 in leftover change that was sent from Zhong\u2019s account to a Bitcoin address previously used to move 1,000 BTC of Silk Road funds.\n\nThis suggests that Zhong was caught \u2014 losing him $3.4 billion \u2014 due to laziness in reusing an address instead of creating a new one, or perhaps even for worrying about 0.08 BTC when selling 118 BTC, to begin with. The Swan Bitcoin exchange, for example, explicitly discourages users from reusing addresses due to \u201cnegative implications such as diminished privacy and diminished security,\u201d which Zhong\u2019s case appears to demonstrate.\n\nAnd so, a search warrant was issued and executed about two years later, in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe same BTC address controlled by Individual-1 that received change of approximately 0.07750842 BTC in 2019, as indicated in the Exchange records, also is associated with a BTC address that Individual-1 used to transfer 1,000 BTC that Individual-1 had unlawfully obtained from Silk Road,\u201d wrote McAleenan.\n\nZhong\u2019s other loot\n\nIn addition to coins held on a computer, Zhong had other assets spread around his house within a kitchen drawer and a floor safe filled with tightly bound stacks of cash. There was also a tiny amount of silver and gold bullion and a collection of rather peculiar coins known as Casascius coins.\n\nThe Casascius physical Bitcoin found in Zhong\u2019s kitchen drawer, making the U.S. government an accidental collector. (United States Department of Justice)\n\nCasascius coins are physical Bitcoin on which the private key is hidden under a peelable hologram sticker. They are historical artifacts of the Bitcoin movement dating back to 2011. Magazine\u2019s 2021 piece on the topic declared such coins as \u201cthe ultimate privacy coins, as there\u2019s nothing to associate the owner with an address and they can be traded a million times without ever leaving a record on the blockchain.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTheoretically, of course, this would make physical Bitcoin a very attractive way to launder money or pay for drug deals.\u201d\n\nZhong appears to have done just that, effectively trading his red-hot \u201ccriminal proceeds\u201d for pre-Silk Road 2011 Bitcoin that appears entirely clean.\n\nAs far as we know, however, Zhong cooperated with authorities and returned all his remaining Bitcoin, a factor that played a role \u2014 along with his young age and autism \u2014 in his getting a short sentence and the more serious money laundering charges dropped, which would typically lead to many years in prison.\n\nIn Zhong\u2019s case, the government appeared far more interested in securing the \u201ccriminal proceeds\u201d for themselves rather than Zhong, whose criminal activity amounted to stealing from another criminal.\n\nHad Zhong hacked any other dodgy site, it\u2019s unlikely authorities would have been interested in catching up with him a decade after the fact. According to Corbett, wire fraud is the electronic equivalent of mail fraud and has become a sort of catch-all for prosecutors, as virtually any financial crime today involves the use of the internet.\n\n\u201cZhong was sentenced for wire fraud committed against Silk Road, which is a reminder that fraud is still fraud even if committed against a criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe dark side\n\nDespite Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing, the Dread Pirate Roberts may live on. The name came from the movie The Princess Bride, in which DPR was not a single feared sea captain but a title passed on from pirate to pirate. True to the myth, Silk Road 2.0 was launched within a month of the arrest, operating for two years until Blake Benthall, a former administrator of the original Silk Road, was also arrested by the FBI. Despite this, at least two sites calling themselves Silk Road 3.0 were soon again operational, along with a myriad of similar marketplaces using different brands.\n\nIn Once a Bitcoin Miner, Lou writes about his experience visiting one of these marketplaces out of curiosity while a student. He soon spent almost half a Bitcoin \u2014 about $100 \u2014 to purchase a small amount of LSD, which never actually arrived. Naturally, there was far more than just drugs offered:\n\n\u201cVarious marketplaces offered stolen credit card details and passwords, drugs and guns. You could also hire someone to say the right words to the police so that a tactical team would raid a house of your choice, a process called \u2018swatting.\u2019 My friends and I even found purported assassinations on offer \u2013 just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carnegie Mellon research professor Nicolas Christin, as much as \u201c4.5% to 9% of all exchange trades\u201d in the early days of Bitcoin were related to the dark web drug market. Considering this, there is no denying that the black market was among the first use cases of cryptocurrency, a fact that still fuels apprehension among the public regarding cryptocurrency. Lou, a journalist, takes a slightly more optimistic view:\n\n\u201cEven if the use case is not a very nice one, I think it still is a use case. As they say, any publicity is good publicity.\u201d"

        "content": "Binance has boosted BTC withdrawal fees in response to a significant backlog of pending transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe top crypto exchange by trade volume had for about an hour suspended bitcoin withdrawals early Sunday morning, and had suspended them a second time throughout the day.\n\nBinance increased its bitcoin withdrawal fees from 00002 BTC ($5.59) to 0.001 BTC ($27.94) per withdrawal, a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cDue to an increase in the overall network fee on the Bitcoin network, the operational cost of maintaining withdrawals for BTC also increases,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to increase the withdrawal fee charged on the Binance platform for the Bitcoin network to ensure users\u2019 transactions are picked up by mining pools.\u201d\n\nPending bitcoin transactions refer to those submitted by users but yet to be added to the blockchain by the network\u2019s miners.\n\nUnconfirmed transactions sit in the blockchain\u2019s \u201cmempool,\u201d which on Monday morning recorded its highest ever count in its 14-year history at 444,000.\n\nBitcoin has blown past its previous mempool records set during the 2017-2018 bull market (source)\n\nAt times like these, when demand for Bitcoin blockspace is competitive, miners will opt to prioritize transactions with higher fees attached. Binance had not accounted for the demand, which led to longer withdrawal times.\n\nThe average transaction fee has surged nearly five times since March, reaching its highest point in two years. Data from YCharts shows the current transaction fee has skyrocketed to $19.21, reflecting a staggering 789% jump compared to the same time last year.\n\nAn influx of Ordinals inscriptions and BRC-20 mints have been attributed to the surge.\n\nBinance said it was also working to enable bitcoin withdrawals on the Lightning Network, the layer-2 network intended to make transactions faster and cheaper, to help alleviate similar future scenarios.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBinance expects to provide another update once all pending transactions have been processed.\n\nAs for bitcoin\u2019s price, it has dropped 3% over the past five days to around $28,000, but still up 70% year to date.\n\nUpdated May. 8, 2023 at 6:19 am ET: Added confirmation of Binance\u2019s new bitcoin withdrawal fees.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.\n\nThe funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.\n\nCanadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose.\n\nWith no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.\n\nBull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto market had a turbulent weekend, which has extended into trading on Monday. The drop has been caused by some insiders selling Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) transactions slowing to a crawl.\n\nAt 2:40 p.m. ET on Monday, Bitcoin has dropped 5.3% in the last 24 hours, Ethereum is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) has lost 7.8% of its value. A lot of altcoins are down by double digits, so this is the best corner of the market right now.\n\nSo what\n\nThe drop in Ethereum really started on Saturday when the Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million of tokens to the Kraken exchange, indicating they may sell tokens to fund operations, which the organization does periodically. This selling pressure is something traders were getting out in front of over the weekend, and that continues today.\n\nBitcoin fell in part because on Sunday, Binance temporarily closed withdrawals. The Bitcoin network was extremely congested, and on Sunday, there were 395,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed. According to Coindesk, the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network jumped from $1.20 last week to $20 on Monday, which was the first time it hit that level since Bitcoin was over $60,000.\n\nDogecoin is one of the most emblematic memecoins or altcoins, and it's following its larger competitor today. But it's only down a small amount compared to the altcoins down double digits today.\n\nNow what\n\nThe last few months have seen a rapid recovery across cryptocurrency assets, and some of the drop today may simply be profit-taking. New tokens like Pepecoin have captured the market's attention and skyrocketed, but that euphoria rarely lasts.\n\nAt the same time, some of the biggest problems with crypto's wider adoption are being seen in just the last few days. Gas fees on Ethereum, which are the fees paid to complete a transaction, have gone up, and Bitcoin is facing the same problem. High fees make crypto almost unusable for anything but the largest transactions, and that's long been a criticism of the industry.\n\nI also think we need to be aware of what Binance does in crypto. When companies like FTX and Celsius froze withdrawals, it was a sign of future collapse. That hasn't happened at Binance, but as the largest crypto exchange, it's a critical cog to the industry.\n\nThe crypto industry seems to be in much better shape than it was a year ago before a lot of leverage was exposed in the ecosystem, but that doesn't mean there won't be similar drops in the market. That's what investors were concerned about, given the activities on Ethereum and Bitcoin. Whether they will have long-term impacts will take time to tell."

Though by doing so, you risk waiting around for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.\n\nBitcoiners can even choose to pay no transaction fee\u2014but miners may completely ignore such transactions and it will never reach its destination.\n\nThe Lightning Network is another option for lower fees: the \"second-layer solution\" speeds up transactions by skirting the main Bitcoin blockchain.

        "title": "Quantifying bitcoin patterns with PCA - Coinbase",
        "content": "Summary Our principal component analysis (PCA) framework looks at mutually orthogonal, linear combinations of bitcoin-related factors across four-month periods between early 2022 and 2023. Bitcoin performance year-to-date has been highly sensitive to the first principal component (PC1) represented by our results, which we interpret as a measure of the token\u2019s endogenous supply and demand dynamics. Indeed, at the moment, PC1 is most positively associated with gold prices and average miner difficulty \u2013 a notable shift from the previous four months where PC1 was negatively associated with gold and most positively associated with US dollar movements. That prior inverse relationship may have been associated with the idiosyncratic deleveraging events that took place in the crypto space last year, while gold prices benefited from central bank demand. Consequently, the US regional banking turmoil in 1Q23 has helped realign gold and bitcoin as alternatives to the points of failure witnessed in the existing financial system. This has been evident in the rising correlation between the daily returns of these two assets. But what this means for bitcoin\u2019s performance in the next few months may not be clearcut. We see two key risks in the short-term \u2013 the credit situation in US regional banks and the impasse on the US debt ceiling. Although these issues should help reinforce bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d fundamentals, we believe the high degree of uncertainty around potential outcomes complicates the outlook for digital assets and supports our preference for institutional investors to hedge their exposure via options.\n\nPCA: Data sensitivities We have seen a meaningful change in the common factors driving bitcoin performance in the short term, based on a principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Specifically, employing PCA provides an orthogonal representation of our standardized (mean-centered) dataset that includes US equities, gold, the (multilateral) US dollar index, bitcoin transaction volumes, bitcoin sentiment, average mining difficulty, miner fees, and bitcoin real volumes for the timespan between January and April 2023. Over this period, daily bitcoin returns had a high 75.0% sensitivity to the first principal component (PC1). This is a noticeable change from the previous four months (September to December 2022) when a linear regression between bitcoin returns and PC1 reflected an r-squared of 59.7%. During the four months prior to that (May to August 2022), the relationship between bitcoin and PC1 reflected an r-squared of only 26.6%. (Note that PC1 currently explains 35.7% of the variance in our data, while the proportion of variance explained goes up to 75.2% if we include the first three principal components. The explained variance ratios in the previous periods were comparable.) We partitioned the data into four-month increments not only for comparison purposes, but because the results suggest there were notable regime changes. A scatter plot of the first and second principal components compiled in 2022, for example (see chart 1), seems to show that the underlying structure of the data indicates three subgroupings of observations, divided by the periods January to April 2022, May to August 2022, and September to December 2022. Chart 1. PCA results for factors driving bitcoin performance If bitcoin prices are sensitive to changes in the combination of variables that make up the first principal component, what then is being captured by the first principal component? The loadings of the original variables on the first principal component suggests that between January and April 2023, it has been most strongly and positively associated with gold followed by bitcoin\u2019s average mining difficulty. Comparatively, the highest absolute values of loadings on PC1 \u2013 from May to August 2022 and September to December 2022 \u2013 indicate it was most strongly associated with US dollar movements and gold. But during these periods, it was negatively associated with gold and positively associated with the US dollar. That\u2019s an important shift. In our view, the first principal component\u2019s current association with gold and mining difficulty suggests PC1 is a measure of the impact of endogenous supply and demand dynamics on bitcoin prices. There may be several reasons for that. First, the inverse relationship between PC1 and gold between May and December 2022 may have had to do with the idiosyncratic deleveraging events taking place in the crypto space. These were concentrated in May , June , and November 2022. (Comparatively, gold was bid due to the unprecedented amount of central bank demand last year.) Those risk events may also explain why the second principal component (PC2) was most heavily (and positively) associated with bitcoin sentiment indicators like Tweet (Twitter) volumes during those 8 months in 2022. In contrast, between January and April 2023, PC2 was most highly and positively related to bitcoin transaction fees and volumes with an explained variance ratio of 25.7%. Second, we think the current strength and positive direction between PC1 and gold reflects an alignment of assets that exist as alternatives to the points of failure witnessed among US regional banks. The scarcity value that informs bitcoin\u2019s fundamental properties may also be evident in the relationship between PC1 and average mining difficulty, which is adjusted every 2016 blocks (around 2 weeks) based on the total computing power on the network. Rising difficulty levels this year have led to a decrease in the rate of new bitcoin supply entering the market, coupled with more bitcoin locked up in government and self-custody. This reinforces bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d properties by constraining supply versus available demand. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cstore of value\u201d properties may also be evident by looking at the correlation between daily gold and bitcoin prices. The positive relationship between these two variables has increased year-to-date, rising from a coefficient of 0.18 at the start of the year to 0.40 as of end-April based on a 40-day rolling window. See chart 2. Chart 2: Rolling correlation between daily bitcoin vs gold returns\n\nOutlook amid an uneasy background How this informs bitcoin\u2019s performance in the next few months may be trickier. We see two key sources of macroeconomic risk in the short-term: (1) the credit situation in US regional banks and (2) the standoff on the US debt ceiling. Regarding the former, it\u2019s difficult to assess the current situation with US regional banks and the potential risk of further contagion. After the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March, First Republic Bank was sold to JP Morgan Chase on May 1 while PacWest Bancorp has said it is exploring strategic options. Many of these banks were sitting on big commercial and real estate lending portfolios, and it\u2019s not clear how making those part of the assets at larger banks will affect risk appetite. Regardless, we believe a credit crunch is already underway. Since early March, around US$416B has moved into money market funds, accelerating a trend that has been ongoing since 4Q22 and acting as a constraint on lending. Chart 3. Increasing constraints on bank lending Meanwhile, a prolonged stalemate on the US debt ceiling could create a disorderly situation for all assets. The US Treasury Department believes the \u201cX date\u201d to raise the debt limit is sometime in early June, and previous showdowns have come down to the final hours of the deadline. Complicating matters is that in the unlikely event of a default, it\u2019s possible the Federal Reserve could stop its quantitative tightening program and enact policies that increase liquidity in the market - potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. In the case of a resolution, we also need to think about the impact that replenishing the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance could have on drawing liquidity from the market. Bitcoin\u2019s behavior after the collapse of SVB suggests it served its function well as a hedge against financial instability, so we think many market players see bullish short-term prospects for bitcoin in light of these two risks. As an analogue, gold rallied by 29% between early January 2011 and end-August 2011 during the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis, when ratings agency S&P downgraded US Treasury bonds from AAA to AA+. At that time, bitcoin was not as ubiquitous as it is today, so it\u2019s possible bitcoin could pick up some market share in the current standoff. On the other hand, gold weakened by 24% during the debt ceiling crisis in 2013, so there\u2019s no guarantee. It\u2019s also difficult to disentangle gold\u2019s 2013 performance from the Fed\u2019s tapering of quantitative easing around the same time. Ultimately, how digital assets perform amid the current backdrop is anyone\u2019s guess, as we expect countervailing factors may offset some of the positives. First, we have already seen a healthy amount of bitcoin appreciation post-SVB, absorbing the flows from a disenchanted depositor base. Second, we think that we could see more tactical rather than fundamental positioning into these event risks. Still, even if the extent of upside potential is unclear, we think the downside may be limited. Given the extent of the uncertainty, we believe bitcoin options may be the better way for institutional investors to hedge themselves as implied volatility levels have come down in recent weeks."

What is unclear is, what is the purpose?\n\nThey are, at this\u2026 \u2014 Toma B (@Toma_7_32) May 7, 2023\n\nThe account claimed that it was only a matter of time before those flooding Bitcoin\u2019s mempool with transactions run out of money, making any impact on the network short-lived.\n\nStill, others attributed the uptick in transaction fees and Bitcoin\u2019s sizable backlog to Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin. Called inscriptions, the total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets cruised past 4.3 million on Sunday, according to a Dune dashboard. Just last week, inscriptions totaled 2.5 million, based on Decrypt coverage.\n\nThe recent increase in inscriptions can be attributed to the growing popularity of BRC-20 tokens, which were originally pioneered as an experiment in March. Some exchanges like UniSat Wallet have created ways for people to trade these tokens built on top of Bitcoin, which bear a resemblance to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.\n\nOn Sunday alone, UniSat Wallet had done over $9.3 million worth of inscriptions trading volume, as of this writing, according to another Dune dashboard. The figure coincided with roughly 7,500 transactions.\n\nWhile the chatter surrounding Ordinals and Bitcoin transaction fees grew more intense on Sunday, Bitcoin was largely flat. The coin was down roughly 0.1% at around 28,800, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAnd though some on Twitter vocalized concerns, others like Kashif Raza pushed back against the notion of Bitcoin being under attack, pointing to the fact that Ordinals is an innovation partly enabled by Bitcoin\u2019s taproot upgrade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe developers are using it to explore new possibilities that you can't stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what you call a free market.\u201d\n\nIs Brc-20 killing Bitcoin? Bitcoin is not under attack and it will never be.! Taproot upgrade enabled ordinals and once something is available. The developers are using it to explore new possibilities that you cant stop! This is what you call a free market. Brc-20 tokens\u2026 \u2014 Kashif Raza (@simplykashif) May 7, 2023"

        "content": "The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees has lit a fire under one of the largest crypto exchanges to upgrade to the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Following a second halt in withdrawals, Binance announced it would work on \u201cenabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.\u201d\n\nTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.\n\n\n\nOur team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations. \u2014 Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a federated system for cheap, near-instant payments built atop Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin mempool (where transactions waiting to be confirmed gather) is full or busy, the Lightning Network is unaffected.\n\nSeveral large crypto exchanges have integrated the Lightning Network, including Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken and CoinCorner. If implemented correctly, the Lightning Network would allow users to withdraw and send Bitcoin immediately from wallets, sidestepping the congested Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFees on Bitcoin are rising, and there are still many Bitcoin (to fiat) exchanges that haven't adopted Lightning deposits and withdrawals\n\n\n\nTechnical challenges are not the reason. Solutions like @RiverRLS exist that make integration fast and easy for any business. The issue is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WR5u7cjMCx \u2014 Sam Wouters (@SDWouters) May 8, 2023\n\nThe largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase, is also warming up to the LN. Further to comments that CEO Brian Armstrong would integrate the LN soon, Armstrong finally sent Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall $100 over the Lightning Network, demonstrating that he is familiar with the layer-2 payments protocol.\n\nEuropean Bitcoin exchanges are also embracing the LN. Adem Bilican, the chief technology officer of Swiss-based Bitcoin exchange, Relai, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWe believe that Bitcoin is the best savings technology ever invented. But you should be able to spend and send BTC as fast and cheaply as possible. The Lightning Network is the best solution to tackle that, no matter how the on-chain transaction fees look.\u201d\n\nSwiss Bitcoin exchange Pocket Bitcoin recently tweeted it would \u201cget this Lightning thing started\u201d in response to higher and higher fees on the Bitcoin base chain.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Lightning Network capacity strikes 5K BTC\n\nHowever, given that the LN is a relatively new solution in the crypto space, payment failure can occur. The network is growing and scaling organically, but more liquidity may help the network scale faster. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, shed light on the situation:\n\n\u201cThe Bitfinex node is the most interconnected node on the entire Lightning Network. It is also the biggest, providing liquidity to most of the other nodes. Hence the chances of failure are extremely low.\u201c\n\nTrue to form, Ardoino tweeted in response to the high fees that users should ask their crypto exchange to integrate LN. Binance and Coinbase are hopping on board, with other large exchanges Gemini, KuCoin and Bybit yet to announce implementing the LN.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "The latest in crypto: Binance's bitcoin withdrawals, Coinbase, crypto mining tax - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo details several headlines emerging from the crypto space, including Binance's bitcoin withdrawals resuming after a second pause, Coinbase's assurances on its U.S. presence, and an energy tax the Biden administration is considering for crypto miners.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Crypto exchange Binance halted Bitcoin withdrawals earlier today. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, who has the details for us. Rachelle, how do we see some of the moves on the back of that?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, so we're taking a look at some of the takeaways from the selling action that we've been seeing in some of these cryptos, especially Bitcoin. You mentioned Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, suspending those withdrawals. And that was due to too many pending transactions, according to CEO CZ. He tweeted that the problem was due to an unexpected surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which had fluctuated an 18x from last month.\n\nHe also added in it was FUD, or fear, uncertainty, and doubt, also fueling this. But that skepticism and speculation about whether it was some of these big crypto whales selling their positions, that spread. So, of course, down went Bitcoin and dragged down other tokens with it on a day that already had a mixed picture in general for investors. Now, CEO CZ also tweeting, we're aware that some data are showing a large volume of outflows from Binance. This outflow is actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments.\n\nNow, if this had been just effective outflows, this would have marked the largest withdrawal in its history at over 162,000 Bitcoin, worth over $4.6 billion. Now, Julio Moreno, who's the head of research at CryptoQuant, he noted that these two transactions in question of 117,000 and 40,000 Bitcoin respectively were between Binance addresses. So putting those effective outflows closer to about 10,100 Bitcoin. So not as big of a deal as originally thought. But still, a lot of skepticism here.\n\nStory continues\n\n- There's a lot of skepticism there. Rachelle, let's also talk about what we're seeing take place at Coinbase because Coinbase shares were under a little bit of pressure today. The CEO there coming out, doubling down on criticisms of regulatory headwinds, also saying that they're not going to back down. They will gladly go face to face with the SEC. What are we learning there?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, this is quite the turnaround. We had Coinbase saying they're not leaving the US. CEO Brian Armstrong walking back those earlier comments on the possibility of having Coinbase leave the US because of those regulatory headwinds. He told CNBC this morning, Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas. We're always going to have the US presence. But the US is a little bit behind right now.\n\nIn terms of examples you could look to, he praised the more thoughtful approaches, as he called them, in the EU for passing comprehensive crypto legislation, as well as the UK he said being incredibly welcoming as a reason why it's a hub that they've decided to serve as well. But, of course, SEC is still in the headlights there. Armstrong called the SEC an outlier in the way it's approaching crypto to curtail it rather than regulate it. But he says that these lawsuits-- you look for a silver lining here-- they offer a chance for more clarity, which will benefit the industry as a whole. Hopefully, get some answers on some of these different criteria.\n\n- Yeah. Brian Armstrong has had some pretty strong words for the SEC on the back of some concerns around that regulation. All right. What's the latest coming out of DC when it comes to crypto mining?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, it's interesting because we thought we pretty much just had to look at the SEC in this. And we that the Biden administration was looking at not being fond of having people adding crypto to their 401(k). But now on the mining side, the Biden administration added the new Digital Asset Mining Energy. That's DAME. That's the excise tax. Its proposal to its budget last week.\n\nSo basically, what will happen is after a phase in period, crypto miners would face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of the electricity they use in crypto mining, essentially, the White House saying pay your fair share. Now, the White House estimates that in 2022, US crypto mining used about the same amount of electricity used to power the entire country's home computers or residential lighting. So to give you some context there. And, of course, the United States by far the biggest crypto mining country in the world. So this will really be a blow for crypto miners.\n\n- It will be something we will continue to track. All right. Rachelle, thanks so much."

        "title": "Does Bitcoin price risk losing $28K with BTC futures premium at 2-month lows? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For the past 17 days, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow 8.5% range, from $27,250 to $29,550, causing the 40-day volatility metric to drop below 40%. This wasn\u2019t restricted to cryptocurrencies, as the S&P 500 index\u2019s historical volatility reached 17%, its lowest level since December 2021.\n\nBut will $28,000 become the new resistance? Not according to the latest Bitcoin (BTC) futures and options data. Nevertheless, macroeconomic conditions remain the main driver for risk markets\u2019 price fluctuations in the near to medium terms.\n\nBTC price flattens as investors lose risk appetite\n\nA myriad of reasons could be given to explain the relatively small price oscillations in risk markets, including the expectation of a recession, investors unwilling to place new bets until the United States Federal Reserve ends its rate hikes, or increased demand (and focus) on fixed-income trades.\n\nThe problem is that no one can prove what has been causing investors to restrict their risk appetite and drive Bitcoin\u2019s price sideways. Many \u2014 including Warren Buffett, the multi-billionaire fund manager \u2014 fear that commercial real estate is a growing concern, which could trigger major turbulence ahead.\n\nWhile some believe that the U.S. debt ceiling discussion and the banking crisis could further cement the U.S. dollar\u2019s weakening, Buffett does not foresee alternatives. The finance mogul is a long-term critic of the precious metal gold, as his investment thesis prioritizes yield-providing assets.\n\nThe debt ceiling drama has caused Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to warn that a \u201csteep economic downturn\u201d would follow if Congress fails to act in the next few weeks.\n\nOn the one hand, the government is facing pressure to sustain economic activity and contain the banking crisis. Ultimately, increasing the debt limit would add liquidity to the markets, further triggering inflation.\n\nThis complex environment of inflation risks, an economic downturn and a weakening U.S. dollar might have caused investors to lose interest in risk assets and concentrate their bets on fixed-income trades as interest rates have moved above 5% per year.\n\nFor Bitcoin, an alarming sign would be a negative futures contract premium or increased costs for hedging using options. That\u2019s why investors should closely track those BTC derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin futures display weak demand from longs\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBitcoin traders have been extremely cautious in the past two weeks. Even during the recent rally toward $29,850 on May 6, there was no surge in demand for leverage longs. Moreover, the subsequent 6.8% correction down to $27,800 has brought the BTC futures premium to its lowest level in two months at 1.5%.\n\nBitcoin options risk metric stood neutral\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin is not under attack:\u2019 BTC maxis allay fears of a DoS offensive\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options 25% delta skew has recently flirted with excessive optimism, as the protective put options were trading at a 7% discount on May 7 relative to similar neutral-to-bullish call options.\n\nStill, the trend quickly reverted, as the Bitcoin price tested levels below $28,000. Currently, this is a balanced risk appetite according to BTC options pricing, as the 25% delta skew indicator stands near 0%.\n\nBitcoin options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are less confident, favoring sideways trading. Thus, traders should not flip bearish due to weakening derivatives indicators.\n\nIn other words, if there was enough conviction that $28,000 would become resistance, one would expect a much higher appetite for risk-averse put options and a negative BTC futures premium, or \u201cbackwardation.\"\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "It may be hard to imagine, but the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 actually laid the foundation for an entire new industry -- Bitcoin mining. In the 14 years that Bitcoin has been in existence, a slew of companies have decided to base their entire business model on the cryptocurrency, and some have even decided to go public.\n\nToday, there are around 17 different companies that investors can choose from, but deciding which company is worthy of your investment requires a little more research. However, when we do some digging, there is one clear-cut Bitcoin miner deserving of an investment today -- Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%).\n\n1. Production\n\nSimply put, Riot is one of the top-producing Bitcoin miners. Since the beginning of 2022, the company has mined the second most Bitcoins in the industry with more than 8,200. This production is likely a reflection of its massive facilities in West Texas that are continuing to grow and bring miners online by the year.\n\nThere's also the efficiency and power with which Riot miners operate. Riot boasts the third-highest hash rate of all public mining companies. Measured in exahashes per second (EH/s), hash rate is essentially a statistic that helps quantify mining power. The higher the hash rate, the greater the ability to mine Bitcoin.\n\n2. Extremely efficient with low costs\n\nYou may have noticed that Riot was consistently in the top three of the statistics previously discussed, but it wasn't No. 1.\n\nHowever, CoreScientific (OTC: CORZ), the company with the most bitcoins produced since 2022 and the highest hash rate, sold just about all of its bitcoins to stay afloat. In fact, the majority of mining companies in 2022 not only sold off the majority of Bitcoins mined, but even dipped into reserves just to keep operations going.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest of the crowd, Riot was able to actually add bitcoins to its reserves while also keeping costs low. Riot is extremely efficient at mining, and its ability to continue to add bitcoins to its reserves in a tough market deserves recognition.\n\nExpanding on those low costs, the company spent on average around $17,900 per bitcoin mined -- the second lowest of all mining companies. Along with the benefits of efficiency and low costs, Riot also has a debt-free balance sheet, a feat the majority of its competitors fail to accomplish.\n\nFurthermore, Riot has a competitive advantage over some of its peers. Because its operations are based in Texas, Riot can benefit from a flexible energy grid.\n\nIt can be a little complex to understand, but essentially, when demand for energy is high, like it is during a heat wave, Riot can sell energy back to the grid for a higher profit than would have come out of dedicating resources to mining Bitcoin. When the same situation occurs in other states, miners are left with no option but to keep on mining while energy costs skyrocket, thus making it more difficult to realize profits.\n\nThanks to this unique business model, Riot was able to generate more than $27 million in power credits through voluntary power curtailments throughout the year.\n\n3. A promising future\n\nWhile the crypto winter of 2022 presented challenges for Riot, there were still some significant accomplishments made. Thanks to expansion of its Rockdale facility, Riot actually notched a new all-time high hash rate. Surprisingly, it was able to accomplish this while two of its buildings had to shut down due to severe winter storms.\n\nNow that 2022 and the woes of the Bitcoin bear market look to be in the rear-view mirror, Riot is gearing up for a potentially lucrative future. The company's Rockdale facility is still expanding, with an additional building set to be brought online soon. Progress continues to be made at the recently purchased Corsicana facility, which is expected to be energized by the end of the year.\n\nOnce fully operational, Riot expects to reach a hash rate of more than 12.5 EH/s, a significant jump from its current 7.9 EH/s.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nWhile Riot may not be a leader in any one specific metric, it's difficult to ignore the company's well-rounded resume. It consistently has one of the highest rates of bitcoin production, on an extremely low-cost basis. When taking into account that the company is still expanding operations, it seems that Riot is in a position to gain even more market share by the end of the year.\n\nIt might be difficult to buy a stock after it has climbed more than 200% in the last five months, but Riot has the credentials to provide profits for the long haul. With its price still down more than 85% from its all-time high and the prospects of a Bitcoin bull market looming, consider me a buyer today."

        "content": "Warren Buffett moving into cash suggests he\u2019s bracing for a possible collapse in risk-on asset prices. With Bitcoin (BTC) up 70% year-to-date and correlated with equities, should BTC investors also prepare for a potential stock market crash?\n\nBuffett says \u201cincredible period\u201d is over\n\nBuffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway dumped $13.30 billion worth of equities and increased exposure in cash and United States Treasurys in Q1, its latest quarterly earnings report shows. Meanwhile, it channeled $4.4 billion toward purchasing its own stock and $2.9 billion on the shares of other publicly-traded companies.\n\nThe market considers Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s performance as a key indicator to gauge the U.S. economy\u2019s health, given the firm\u2019s holdings range from American railroad to electric utilities and retail businesses.\n\nBut the 92-year-old investor, who has credited the U.S. economy\u2019s growth for the success of Berkshire Hathaway in the past, is no longer optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,\u201d Buffett said last weekend at an event. The \u201cincredible period\u201d for the U.S. economy has been coming to an end over the past six months, he added.\n\nBerkshire raised its cash reserves by $2 billion to $130.60 billion in Q1 2023, the highest level since the end of 2021 when equities entered a bear cycle. Moreover, the firm holds a vast amount of its cash in short-term Treasury bills and bank deposits, thanks to higher interest rates near 5%.\n\nIn other words, Buffett is preparing for a potential stock market crash, particularly as the U.S. banking crisis unfolds, with shares of many banks, such as PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, sinking.\n\nBitcoin price stays correlated with Nasdaq\n\nThe increasing possibility of a global recession also risks putting downside pressure on Bitcoin, with its 100-week correlation with the Nasdaq reaching its highest level of about 0.42%.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone expects that BTC price would likely be the leading indicator for a stock crash.\n\n\u201cBitcoin could pace declines for risk assets \u2014 If the worst isn\u2019t over for risk assets, Bitcoin may lead the way lower,\u201d commented McGlone, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is up about 70% in 2023 to May 2 vs. 20% for the stock index, and those are maybe bounces within broader bear markets. The Fed [is] still tightening in May, and [is] more inclined to stay the course unless risk assets fall to ease inflation, may portend a lose-lose.\u201c\n\nBitcoin/Nasdaq correlation index. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nIn the short term, there are little expectations from the U.S. Consumer Price Index report on May 10 about easing inflation in April. According to Bloomberg\u2019s survey, economists expect core CPI to remain unchanged at around 5%, suggesting more rate hikes are ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant drop in inflation will likely prompt the Fed to consider pausing or even slashing interest rates in an extreme case scenario.\n\nCurrently, Fed funds futures\u2019 data suggests that at least five rate cuts between May 2023 and January 2024 are likely, which may pour cold water on Buffett\u2019s risk-off strategy.\n\nFed funds rate projections. Source: Bloomberg\n\nCould Bitcoin price fall below $25K again?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has declined roughly 6% over the past week, trading for as low as $27,350 on May 9.\n\nNotably, this has pulled BTC\u2019s price below its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), near $27,950.\n\nBitcoin bears are now eyeing $27,000 as the next downside target based on the level\u2019s recent history.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA decisive break below the $27,000 support, primarily in the event of further rate hikes, could then pull BTC/USD down to its 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $24,600. In other words, a 10% drop by June.\n\nConversely, a rebound from $27,000 increases the possibility of BTC price retesting $30,000 as resistance and resuming the uptrend of the last few months.\n\nRelated: Analysts at odds over Fed, US debt ceiling impact on Bitcoin price\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid Bitcoin\u2019s recent spike in transaction fees, block number 788695 marks a special milestone for miners: For the first time since 2017, the transaction fees in a single block surpassed the block rewards doled out to miners. Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They\u2019re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin \u201chalvening.\u201d\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually \u2014 in more than a hundred years \u2014 transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn\u2019t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren\u2019t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don\u2019t increase over the years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: \"The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.\""

        "content": "Binance unveils plans to integrate Lightning Network for Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nThe exchange paused Bitcoin withdrawals earlier, causing concerns.\n\nLightning Network helps scale the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBinance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, is grappling with changes happening on the Bitcoin network. Amid mounting issues, the exchange had to pause Bitcoin withdrawals and raise withdrawal fees.\n\nDue to other controversies surrounding Binance, the decision caused concern among users. However, Binance has since unveiled plans to use Lightning Network to solve all these problems.\n\nBinance Pauses Bitcoin Withdrawals, Unveils Lightning Plans\n\nThe revelation of Binance\u2019s plans to integrate the Lightning Network came amid a crisis for the exchange.\n\nOn Monday, May 8, Binance paused Bitcoin withdrawals for the second time in 12 hours, causing considerable concern among its users. At the same time, the exchange also significantly increased its fees for Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nFollowing the decision, some users questioned whether Binance was in trouble and compared the issue to that of FTX. However, the exchange offered a different explanation for the problems: a steep rise in Bitcoin network transaction fees.\n\nOn Sunday, April 7, the average transaction fee on Bitcoin\u2019s network surged to a staggering $19.21.\n\nThis uptick in fees and network congestion coincides with a surge in BRC-20 tokens and inscriptions through Ordinals. This new technology enables users to mint NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain and trade fungible BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThere is little Binance can do to tackle the congestion issue on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. However, Binance can use a level 2 scaling solution like the Lightning Network to enable lower fees for user withdrawals.\n\nWhat Is the Lightning Network?\n\nThe Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that aims to resolve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and high transaction fee issues. The network enables off-chain payment channels between users, without having to record every transaction on the main blockchain.\n\nSince Lightning Network transactions are off-chain, they do not require miner fees or compete for block space. This leads to significantly lower transaction fees compared to on-chain transactions.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOther exchanges, like OKX, already offer withdrawals using the Lightning Network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion issues are similar to those that Ethereum faced. In 2018, the NFT game CryptoKitties caused major congestion for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBinance\u2019s issues with Bitcoin withdrawals highlight the seriousness of Bitcoin\u2019s congestion. With the rise of the ordinals, Bitcoin could be facing similar problems that plagued Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes Binance use Bitcoin Lightning? Binance does not use the Bitcoin Lightning Network. However, the exchange announced plans to integrate the Lightning Network to improve transaction times and reduce fees for Bitcoin withdrawals. Can you buy Bitcoin Lightning Network? The Lightning Network is not a cryptocurrency that users can buy. It is a second-layer protocol built on the Bitcoin network to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions. However, users can use the Lightning Network to send and receive Bitcoin payments by opening a payment channel. Why am I unable to withdraw Bitcoin on Binance? Binance has briefly paused Bitcoin withdrawals in the past for several reasons, most recently because of a spike in trading fees. Any users experiencing difficulties with withdrawals should check official announcements or contact support. Other reasons for withdrawal issues may include insufficient account balance, incomplete security measures (e.g., address whitelisting, 2FA), or account restrictions due to incomplete KYC procedures. How do I unlock withdrawals from Binance? To unlock withdrawals from Binance, users should complete the KYC process, enable 2FA and possibly whitelist their withdrawal address (if necessary). Users should also monitor Binance\u2019s official announcements for withdrawal suspensions or maintenance periods.\n\nRead about Bitcoin NFTs that are driving up gas costs:\n\nBitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal?\n\nRead about the latest memecoin craze, the Pepe token:\n\nPEPE Jumps 132.31% as Binance, KuCoin List Controversial Token"

The leading digital asset was trading at around $27,350 at press time, down more than 5.5% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the bearish sentiment, including the rising popularity of the PEPE meme coin, which reached a market capitalization of over $1 billion before losing steam over the weekend and losing half its value.

        "content": "SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Over the past few months, Bitcoin and Gold have both witnessed noteworthy surges as investors have bet on the Federal Reserve slowing down the pace of interest rate hikes. The recent instability in the banking system has also further driven up the prices of these assets, leading some market observers to conclude that Bitcoin may in fact live up to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d promise and compete with gold for the safe haven asset status. Investors anticipating a sustained rally in both these assets are now able to generate enhanced returns by combining both exposures in a single product.\n\nOrbit Markets, the leading institutional liquidity provider in digital asset options, executed the trade with PI Digital, a regulated best-execution broker for high net worth individuals and institutional clients based in Switzerland. Antonio Pellizato, founding partner at PI Digital, commented \u201cWe strive to offer high-end bespoke services to our clients, always balancing performance and risk management in the most efficient ways.

        "title": "Would a U.S. Debt Default Really Send Crypto Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Just about everyone agrees that the U.S. government defaulting on its debt obligations in June would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order. For cryptocurrencies, the impact of a debt default would be far more consequential than the current banking crisis.\n\nAnd, yet, a number of prominent voices are actually suggesting that crypto might soar in the wake of a U.S. government default. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, is now suggesting that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) might soar by 70% as it becomes a safe-haven asset. But just how realistic is that prediction? Below are three possible scenarios for what might happen to crypto.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nLet's start off with a worst-case scenario, so we can understand how truly catastrophic a debt default would be. There would be an immediate backlash against every U.S. asset, including the U.S. dollar. And, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, there would likely be mass layoffs, payment failures across the economy, and a cratering of U.S. credit markets. Most likely, investors would immediately dump holdings of any risky U.S. cryptocurrency stocks, such as crypto mining stocks.\n\nBut what about cryptocurrencies themselves? Unlike in the current banking crisis, investors would not be able to pull money out of one place (i.e., the banking sector) and put it into another (i.e., the crypto sector). Debt instruments are not deposits. When a government defaults on its debt, all that's left is a worthless piece of paper backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of whoever issued it.\n\nThus, I don't see how there would be a massive influx of funds into crypto. Going forward, institutional investors might eventually ramp up their holdings of crypto as a further hedge against financial catastrophe, but there wouldn't be a sudden surge. More likely, investors would simply put their funds into the ultimate safe-haven asset: physical gold.\n\nMedium-case scenario\n\nA medium-case scenario is that the U.S. government \"technically\" defaults on its nearly $32 trillion in debt on June 1, but quickly finds some way to restructure the debt so it can be repaid. This would set into motion the ultimate \"too big to fail\" scenario -- once investors and lenders get a whiff of the chaos that might ensue after a debt default, they would surely work to provide some sort of liquidity backstop or short-term stabilization fund, just as we saw with the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nBut the damage would still be nearly irrevocable. Yes, the U.S. government would be able to issue new debt in the future, but at dramatically higher interest rates. Lenders that were part of the \"too big to fail\" coalition would probably also demand immediate austerity steps from the U.S. government, such as a commitment to scale back spending.\n\nBut that would be absolutely soul-crushing for the U.S. economy. And, again, I don't see any way that would really benefit crypto. Investors would likely turn to precious metals such as gold and silver, commodities, and other assets that have tangible value, such as real estate. Since crypto does not have any tangible value, I don't see how it would become a desirable investment in this new environment.\n\nIn fact, in a rising rate environment, crypto would become relatively less attractive than debt assets paying very high interest rates. This is a well-known phenomenon within the crypto sector that we've seen play out this year. Higher interest rates are bad for crypto, which is why Federal Reserve rate hikes are such a concern.\n\nBest-case scenario\n\nFinally, there's a best-case scenario. But it's only a \"best\" case on a relative basis. It would still be absolutely awful. The U.S. dollar would likely lose its current standing as the world's reserve currency, and it's almost impossible that Bitcoin would be able to fill the void this year. Most likely, we're talking about the Chinese yuan becoming the world's new reserve currency.\n\nWhere I do agree with Standard Chartered Bank is that there will be a set of winners within the crypto world and a set of losers. It's too simplistic to say all cryptos will go up, or all cryptos will go down. According to Standard Chartered Bank, a U.S. debt default would make a \"long Bitcoin, short Ethereum\" strategy optimal, given Bitcoin's much greater adoption as a form of payment and a store of value. But other cryptos -- as long as they are not linked to the U.S. economy -- might also get a bump in value.\n\nAt the end of the day...\n\nNobody would really benefit from a U.S. debt default. Thinking that a U.S. debt default is \"winnable\" is similar to thinking that a thermonuclear war carried out with tactical nukes is \"winnable.\"\n\nSo let's hope that U.S. politicians do the one thing that they are uniquely good at -- kicking the can down the road for someone else to deal with later. After a lot of last-minute political posturing and midnight sessions in Washington, Congressional leaders will likely emerge with an increase to the debt ceiling, freeing them up to continue spending until next year."

Discover SCENE\n\nMeme token fever is sweeping through Bitcoin, as the market cap of tokens built on top of the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain approached $1 billion on Monday after ORDI\u2014the very first such token\u2014was listed on major exchanges.\n\nAccording to brc-20.io, which tracks the nascent market for tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the market cap of all BRC-20 tokens combined totals around $991 million, as of this writing. The market has surged in value, as well as number of tokens in circulation, over the last few days.\n\nShort for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment,\" BRC-20 is an experimental framework for building fungible tokens on Bitcoin using Ordinals, the protocol that enables people to mint NFT-like assets on Bitcoin called inscriptions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBRC-20 tokens have existed for two months. They were pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, who took inspiration from the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and launched a token called ORDI on March 8.\n\nSince then, Ordi has reached a market cap of around $400 million, according to brc-20.io. Other BRC-20 tokens like PEPE (a different token than the currently-hot Ethereum meme token of the same name), MEME, PIZA, and DOMO have followed suit as Bitcoin goes through the kind of meme coin mania that has gripped the wider crypto market in the past with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and BONK.\n\nOn Monday, Ordi was listed for trading on Crypto.com and Gate.io, suggesting the experimental token is gaining mainstream adoption on cryptocurrency exchanges. As of this writing, the price of Ordi was $18.50 on Gate.io, a notable drop from its peak of $29.58 set earlier in the day.\n\nStill, the current price of Ordi represents a steep increase from its price just one week ago, when Ordi traded hands at $3.78 on May 1, according to brc-20.io.\n\nThe volatility of BRC-20 tokens highlights the emergent nature of the Ordinals space, as text-based inscriptions\u2014used to create and trade the tokens\u2014take over and image-based inscriptions become less common. Yesterday, over 399,000 inscriptions were text-based compared to 20 that were image-based, according to data from Dune.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA record number of daily inscriptions was recorded yesterday as well at over 400,000, pushing the total number of inscriptions made past 4.5 million since the Ordinals protocol took off in late January.\n\nThe popularity of BRC-20 tokens is having a noticeable impact on Bitcoin transactions, overall. On Sunday, 65% of Bitcoin transactions were related to BRC-20 tokens, according to another Dune dashboard, and leading crypto exchange Binance briefly halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion."

        "title": "Understanding the Pros and Cons of Bitcoin Investment Pros and Cons of Bitcoin Investment: A Comprehensive Guide - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has grown exponentially since its creation in 2009.\n\nAs more people become interested in investing in said currency, it\u2019s essential to understand the pros and cons of Bitcoin.\n\nAs such, we\u2019ll explore in this article the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin investment and help you decide if it\u2019s the right choice for you \u2013 keep up-to-date with the latest bitcoin news.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\u00b7 Decentralization and Financial Freedom\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature, meaning that it\u2019s not controlled by any central authority like a government or financial institution. Instead, it operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, thus allowing users to transact directly without intermediaries.\n\nThis level of financial freedom can be particularly appealing to those who distrust central banks and governments or reside in countries with unstable economies.\n\n\u00b7 Potential for High Returns\n\nMany investors are attracted to Bitcoin due to its prospective high revenues.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, Bitcoin has historically outperformed traditional investments like stocks and bonds. However, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results, and it\u2019s central to keep in mind that the market can change quickly.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u00b7 Anonymity and Privacy\n\nBitcoin transactions offer a level of inconspicuousness and confidentiality not available in traditional banking systems.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin isn\u2019t entirely anonymous, it provides a pseudonymous platform that can be used to protect personal information \u2013 this feature appeals to those who value their privacy or want to avoid potential surveillance from governments and other organizations.\n\n\u00b7 Low Transaction Fees\n\nCompared to traditional payment systems like credit cards and bank transfers, Bitcoin transactions typically incur lower fees. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses and individuals who engage in international trade, as it helps them save money on cross-border transactions.\n\n\u00b7 Accessibility and Inclusivity\n\nBitcoin is accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, making it a more inclusive financial system than traditional banking, which is particularly beneficial for those in developing countries, where many people don\u2019t have access to bank accounts or financial services.\n\nDisadvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\u00b7 Volatility and Risk\n\nThe most noteworthy disadvantage of investing in Bitcoin is its extreme price volatility \u2013 the value of Bitcoin can change rapidly, leading to sudden and dramatic gains or losses for investors, meaning that this level of risk may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with a low tolerance for risk or a short investment horizon.\n\n\u00b7 Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nAs Bitcoin gains popularity, supervisory authorities worldwide are grappling with how to deal with the cryptocurrency \u2013 this has eventually led to a lack of clear regulations and guidelines, thus cultivating reluctance among investors. In some cases, governments have banned or restricted the use of Bitcoin, which can negatively impact its value and acceptance.\n\n\u00b7 Environmental Impact\n\nBitcoin mining, the process of adding new transactions to the blockchain, consumes a significant amount of energy due to the computational power required, which has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrency, particularly in terms of its carbon footprint.\n\n\u00b7 Limited Acceptance\n\nWhile the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment is growing, it is still not widely acknowledged, thus limiting the practical use of Bitcoin as a currency for everyday transactions and making it more of a speculative investment rather than a functional currency.\n\n\u00b7 Security Risks\n\nAlthough the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is secure, the digital wallets and exchanges used to store and trade Bitcoin can be vulnerable to hacking and other security risks.\n\nInvestors must take necessary precautions to protect their assets, such as using hardware wallets and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nAdditionally, since transactions are irreversible, mistakes or unauthorized operations cannot be easily rectified, which adds to the potential risks associated with Bitcoin investment.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Worth Investing In?\n\nDetermining whether cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin) is worth investing in depends on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy.\n\nWhile there are numerous advantages to investing in Bitcoin, such as decentralization, financial freedom, and the potential for high returns, it also comes with significant disadvantages, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security risks, exactly as we have only just outlined.\n\nFor those with a high tolerance for risk and a long-term investment horizon, Bitcoin may provide an opportunity for diversification and potential growth. Then again, it\u2019s vital to understand that investing in cryptocurrency is not without its risks; furthermore, it\u2019s decisive to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nBefore committing to any investment, consider consulting with a financial advisor to ensure that you understand the risks involved and that your investment strategy aligns with your financial goals.\n\nMake sure you stay informed by keeping up with the latest crypto exchange news.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin offers both potential benefits and drawbacks \u2013 that much is clear, which is why understanding both the pros and cons of Bitcoin investment are crucial for making informed decisions about whether it\u2019s the right choice for you.\n\nBy carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages, you can determine if Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nSimply remember to keep up with the latest news and conduct thorough research when considering any investment, including cryptocurrency \u2013 it is absolutely key that you do this."

        "content": "Amid mixed sentiment on exchanges, cryptocurrencies are losing today. Bitcoin has retreated below $28,000. The Bitcoin network now has nearly 450,000 transactions still outstanding, and sentiment among risky assets was also weighed down by last Friday's surprisingly strong NFP report, which increased the chance of possible further Fed hikes and more difficult-to-manage inflation in the US. Along with Bitcoin, smaller cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano and Polygon also lost ground.\n\nMarket sentiment weakened as the world's largest exchange, Binance, froze BTC withdrawals for the second consecutive time citing technical problems;\n\nCoinbase (COIN.US) exchange is considering moving operations to the United Arab Emirates due to regulatory hurdles in the US;\n\nThe exchange's CEO stressed that the cryptocurrency market needs more capital investment to grow. The UAE is once again mentioned as a potential hub;\n\nAccording to Bloomberg reports, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein has stated that he is open to investing state reserves in BTC.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the cost of a BTC transaction is about $19 although information from exchange users indicates that a significant portion of the routing is even several times more expensive. The reason for the nearly 450,000 transactions waiting to be processed on the network is probably due to the emergence of so-called Ordinals, which enable the creation of NFTs on the BTC blockchain. Due to this fact, network fees have risen to new peaks. Source: Ycharts\n\nBTC addresses have recently taken a dive; both new and active addresses are approaching their annual average (365 DMA).\n\nNew addresses are now at their lowest levels since January 1, 2023, and active addresses are at 1-year lows. All this despite record volumes and transaction fees. This shows that the expansion of the BTC network is still in question. Source: Glassnode\n\nAmong the group of long-term (blue) and short-term investors (red), BTC exchanges are mainly sent by short-term holders (about 90% to 95% of all receipts). What is noteworthy at the moment, of course, is the increase in profits of short-term investors in 2023, which makes the willingness to realize them even higher now. On the other hand, however, due to the limited supply in the hands of STH investors - the supply is naturally limited.... Source: Glassnode\n\nIsolating the share of profits of short-term investors (STH) from the total inflows to the exchanges, we see that since the beginning of January there have been two waves of profit realization by this group, peaking around the 60% level of the total. Within the current market, the second wave of profit realization by short-term holders coincides with the recent correction. Looking historically, a period of correction followed such heavy selling pressure in STH. Source: Glassnode\n\nSell-side levels\n\nBITCOIN, H4 interval. The price has settled below the SMA200 and SMA100 signaling weakness, the first support level may be the 23.6 Fiboancci retracement, of the upward wave from the fall of 2022 - at $27,400. A deeper decline could herald a bearish reaction, toward the 38.2 Fibo retracement, at $25,000. In a situation of extremes, the $21,500 level appears to be the last bastion of the bulls - it coincides with the 61.8 Fibo retracement and the price level of November 2022, before the collapse of FTX.

        "title": "Op-Ed: Don't believe the hype: BRC-20 is shitcoins on Bitcoin, the new fool's gold - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Enrico Rubboli, Mintlayer CEO. This is an Op-Ed piece byCEO.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has been whipped into a frenzy by a new token standard known as BRC-20. But amid the hype and excitement it has unleashed, I\u2019m deeply concerned that this new breed of crypto assets is going to drag Bitcoin deep into the mud.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with BRC-20, here\u2019s a quick explainer: It\u2019s an experimental new token standard built on the Bitcoin blockchain network. Designed by a pseudo-anonymous developer who goes by the name of Domo on Twitter, BRC-20 is said to be a Bitcoin-based solution for the creation and transfer of new digital assets.\n\nBRC-20 is loosely modeled on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard, but its architecture is quite a bit different, using a concept known as \u201cordinals\u201d that\u2019s built into Satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin. Just as ERC-20 enables users to create their own cryptocurrencies on Ethereum, BRC-20 makes it possible for anyone to deploy their own tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAlthough it was started as an experiment, BRC-20 has spread like wildfire with hundreds of new tokens minted in the past couple of months. Their collective market cap has exploded and now sits at a startling $760 million.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible rise that tells us how millions of people are embracing the experiment, but there are many reasons to be wary of BRC-20\u2019s emergence. Its experimental and completely unregulated nature poses an acute danger to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of Bitcoin as \u201ca new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d\n\nNetwork congestion\n\nThe frenzy around BRC-20 has already caused problems for Bitcoin as transactions rise to drown out those of BTC itself. Between April 29 and May 2, BRC-20 token swaps accounted for greater than 50% of all network transactions. That isn\u2019t something I believe Bitcoin users will be happy to hear about. Bitcoin\u2019s network was already notoriously congested even before BRC-20 emerged, and with the addition of so many new tokens, it has only gotten worse, with some users reporting that they have to wait hours for regular BTC transactions to be processed.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees have increased too. According to Dune Analytics, BRC-20 transactions have already numbered more than 3.5 million in total, generating an additional 493 BTC (around $14 million) in miners\u2019 fees. What\u2019s more, due to the stacked nature of the user interfaces on which these tokens are built, transactions involving these tokens cost users twice as much, as they\u2019re required to pay gas fees not only with their BRC-20 coins but also in BTC.\n\nCongestion became so bad that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, this week briefly halted Bitcoin withdrawals, not once, but twice within a 24-hour period. According to Bloomberg, the exchange was forced to take action due to a \u201cbacklog\u201d of withdrawals that occurred because its fees fell short of what miners were charging. Binance has since restarted withdrawals, after increasing the fees it charges users.\n\nWorthless tokens\n\nIt\u2019s almost inevitable that the majority of BRC-20 coins will turn out to be \u201cshitcoins\u201d, AKA cryptocurrencies that have no value. Head over to YouTube and search for BRC-20 and you\u2019ll find dozens of \u201cinfluencers\u201d with their eyes bulging, screaming excitedly about this or that token going to the moon, with graphs depicting their meteoric rise in value. Make no mistake, most of these guys are making $$$ by promoting worthless tokens that are going to leave a lot of people burned.\n\nIf BRC-20\u2019s association with these showboaters doesn\u2019t put you off, consider that its creator Domo has already warned his Twitter followers that most of the tokens are worthless. The fact is, BRC-20 tokens have nothing to do with the real Bitcoin other than the fact that they use the same network. BRC-20 is simply a JSON script file that makes it possible for almost anyone to add metadata to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, create a new token in the process, and transfer it between users by sending Satoshis. But they\u2019re not creating anything with inherent value.\n\nDomo also warned that the inscription tools of some BRC-20 tokens are built to mint new assets in an intermediary\u2019s wallet, meaning that users will lose control of those coins at the time they are minted.\n\nI\u2019m quite convinced that most BRC-20 tokens are simply taking advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy as the world\u2019s best-known and most trusted cryptocurrency. By masquerading as something that\u2019s associated with Bitcoin, they\u2019re able to lure in unsuspecting users, who might assume that BRC-20 tokens are just as trustworthy as BTC is. That is not the case though, as BRC-20 tokens have neither the same level of security, decentralization, or recognition.\n\nAdded complexity\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s major benefits is that, compared to other cryptocurrencies, it is incredibly straightforward and user-friendly, especially with modern wallets. That isn\u2019t so with BRC-20 tokens, which markedly increase the complexity of managing crypto assets. For instance, a separate wallet is required to hold them, and they require a different protocol together with additional steps to transact.\n\nIt\u2019s an added headache that will cause more confusion among new users, raising the risk of human error during transactions. Users risk losing their assets as they could make mistakes with the unfamiliar transaction process and wallets, and this will likely mean that more people simply rely on a custodian instead.\n\nAs a result, the vast majority of BRC-20 token users will look to centralized exchanges to manage their assets for them. Rather than set up a new wallet, they\u2019ll leave their tokens in the custody of whatever CEX they purchased them from.\n\nHowever, smart crypto users know to be wary of keeping too much value on an exchange. As the recent FTX debacle showed us, not to mention Mt. Gox long before, it\u2019s not only the risks of hacking that we need to worry about, but also gross mismanagement, as you can never be sure what such platforms will do with your funds. Due to their complex nature, BRC-20 tokens encourage the use of CEXs, which undermines Bitcoin\u2019s founding principle of decentralization and ownership.\n\nRegulatory headaches\n\nBRC-20\u2019s misleading association with Bitcoin may well end up causing all sorts of regulatory headaches too. The danger is that by obfuscating the difference between these random tokens and BTC itself, new investors might be misled into believing they\u2019re acquiring a secure and established digital asset, when in fact they\u2019re exposing themselves to extreme risk.\n\nOne of my major concerns is the potential of BRC-20 to facilitate the trade of unregistered securities on Bitcoin itself. Scammers could create tokens that are claimed to represent shares in a company, crypto project or some other venture, skirting all regulatory oversight. This would put investors at considerable risk and could ultimately expose Bitcoin itself to increased regulatory scrutiny, simply because of a few bad actors.\n\nBRC-20 is best avoided\n\nBRC-20\u2019s creator Domo may well have had good intentions when he or she first created the standards. The ability to create new assets and trade them on Bitcoin\u2019s network might seem attractive to many, but as we\u2019ve seen with the frenzy that followed, most of these tokens are designed to make their creators rich. Meanwhile, they divert capital that would otherwise stay within Bitcoin itself. Very few, if any, BRC-20 coins represent genuine projects.\n\nWhatever the benefits of BRC-20 tokens may be, they are far outweighed by the risks I\u2019ve outlined above. In reality, BRC-20 is just the latest implementation of fool\u2019s gold, dressed up in an attractive wrapper that belies its lack of value.\n\nOf course, there will be some who are willing to gamble on the prospects of BRC-20 anyhow, and they\u2019re free to ignore all of the red flags I\u2019ve listed. But for anyone who\u2019s risk-averse and believes that Bitcoin is truly where the future of money lies, BRC-20 is clearly something best avoided.\n\nSteer clear of BRC-20 and focus on Bitcoin instead and you\u2019ll not only protect yourself from unnecessary risk but also contribute to the stability and growth of the one true crypto asset that\u2019s sure to outlive anything trying to hijack its success.\n\nWhen you hold Bitcoin, you\u2019re helping to make Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision become a reality and create a more equitable financial future for the world. Hold some BRC-20 shitcoin, and all you\u2019re doing is feeding the scammer or joker who created it.\n\nDon\u2019t be the next victim, steer clear of the fool\u2019s gold that BRC-20 shitcoins most certainly are."

        "title": "Walgreens brings crypto-enabled ATMs to stores - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "Walgreens has deployed more than 1,300 ATMs that not only accept cash but also provide cryptocurrency purchasing/selling and mobile send/receive cash capabilities.\n\nWhile the news cycle is churning stories decrying the decline of the ATM, stores are embracing ATMs \u2014 especially ones that deliver cryptocurrency. One example is Walgreens, which has more than 9,000 stores in all U.S. states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.\n\nNCR Corp. recently expanded its existing relationship with Walgreens to offer its services to nearly all of these locations and will install more than 1,300 Allpoint+ cash-accepting ATMs, offering surcharge-free cash access to customers.\n\nIn addition, customers can use the ATMs to purchase cryptocurrency due to NCR's LibertyX platform. With this platform, customers can use a debit card or cash to purchase popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nThese ATMs will also offer NCR Pay360, a mobile app which customers can use to send and receive cash with a single code.\n\nTo learn more about the partnership, ATM Marketplace reached out to a NCR spokesperson via an email interview.\n\nQ. Can you give a little background on the history of the partnership?\n\nA. NCR has been executing on bringing everyday financial services to Walgreens guests for more than 15 years. As the owner and operator of Allpoint, NCR is uniquely positioned to support Walgreens' financial services vision to deliver more joyful lives through better financial health. Our new, long-term agreement expands the Allpoint reach into new markets, promises to deliver many new Allpoint+ locations and is expected to expand our LibertyX and NCR Pay360 capabilities to the entire NCR-operated Walgreens fleet.\n\nQ. What are some innovative features of the AllPoint network?\n\nA. Allpoint is the largest retailer-centric, surcharge-free network in the U.S., and offers surcharge-free cash access to over 1,200 issuers, including two of the five largest U.S. banks by deposit, representing more than 70 million cardholders. Allpoint is an important element of distribution for each of our issuers.\n\nFinancial institution branch transformation: Since 2017, more than 4,400 bank branches have closed in the U.S. Transactions will continue to flow from branches to ATMs. This shift in consumer behavior positions Allpoint well as a platform for giving consumers access to financial services in some of the places they visit most often.\n\nContinued consumer reliance on cash transactions: ATM consumers make an average of 3.8 cash withdrawals and 2.5 cash deposits per month. Allpoint is the only retail-based network to accept cash deposits, via our Allpoint+ network of ATMs.\n\nFinancial services hub: Walgreens can leverage the power and unique capabilities of the Allpoint network to provide more financial transactions that consumers demand. Allpoint provides the platform as Walgreens shoppers seek a physical hub to complete their financial transactions.\n\nQ. How does Pay360 benefit customers?\n\nA. Innovation has always been at the heart of NCR, to meet the evolving needs of the market, including end consumers, retail partners and financial institutions. Our newest innovation, NCR Pay360, supports cardless cash-out and cash-in transactions. These cardless, code-based transactions can support over 30 new product categories, driving higher usage of our ATM estate while helping new companies and organizations find value in ATMs, benefiting the overall ATM ecosystem. Examples include digital wallets and employer and government benefits and rebates. In addition, our exclusive proprietary ATM network terminal software suite brings more control to the overall management of each terminal, improving speed to market, security and analytics capabilities.\n\nQ. Does the LibertyX bitcoin feature draw in a large amount of new customers or existing users?\n\nA. We wouldn't be in a position to share that level of detail on the customer base, but we are excited about the performance and growth we are seeing for LibertyX. LibertyX brings access to bitcoin purchases in a secure and compliant manner at places consumers already visit. At the same time, it brings a new transaction offering to our ATMs, with the potential to bring more foot traffic to the retailers that host these ATMs.\n\nWalgreens did not respond for a request to comment from ATMmarketplace on its ATM strategy."

        "content": "A temporary block on bitcoin withdrawals was lifted after Binance increased fees for pending transactions so that they would get picked up by miners.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has resumed bitcoin withdrawals after halting in twice in less than 12 hours amid a \u201clarge volume of pending transactions\u201d.\n\nAn increase in demand for bitcoin withdrawals is putting pressure on Binance systems, and the company says it did not anticipate the effect this would have on network gas fees, which are payments for crypto miners who use powerful computers to process blockchain transactions.\n\nAfter temporarily closing bitcoin withdrawals in the early hours of the morning today (8 May), Binance lifted the block hours later after increasing the fees so that the pending transactions get picked up by mining pools.\n\n\u201cTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed,\u201d the exchange wrote in a tweet.\n\n\u201cOur team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations. This is a learning opportunity for us, and we\u2019ll do our best to prevent this from happening again.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the disruption had a mild impact on the value of bitcoin which plunged as much as 3pc before recuperating a little.\n\nCryptoQuant data seen by Bloomberg shows that Binance had its highest ever daily outflow of bitcoin yesterday. Overall trading volumes on the platform in the last 24 hours has reportedly been in excess of $6bn \u2013 significantly higher than the exchange next in line, Coinbase.\n\n\u201cRest assured, funds are SAFU [secure asset fund for users],\u201d the company added in the tweet thread, assuring customers their funds are safe.\n\nBinance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao, has been facing regulatory turbulence around the world, particularly in the US.\n\nIn March, the exchange was sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for numerous alleged violations of US trading rules.\n\nThe civil enforcement action against Binance included Zhao and former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim, as well as the company\u2019s Irish subsidiary Binance Holdings (IE) Limited.\n\n10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC]: Of Epoch drawbacks and surging adoption - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin user adoption increased despite the decline in address growth.\n\nMore BTC transactions have taken place since the last halving.\n\nDespite its occasional hurdles, Bitcoin [BTC] has gained significant traction as the number of non-zero addresses reached an All-Time High (ATH). According to Glassnode, the metric was at 46.1 million at press time.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThis surge in adoption could be linked to a number of factors such as its growing recognition. And this year, the cryptocurrency has shown that it could be a hedge against inflation. This was after the coin\u2019s reaction amid the collapse of several traditional financial institutions.\n\nNew entrants have their eyes on the prize\n\nAlthough this growth might be considered impressive, there has also been a decline in another aspect \u2014 the Epoch. The Bitcoin Epoch keeps track of market patterns in terms of address growth between one four-year halving cycle and the following one.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the Epoch, at the time of writing, increased by 4.54%. However, the number of addresses added was 16 million, less than the previous cycle, which was 21 million.\n\n#Bitcoin adoption continues to soar as the number of Non-Zero Addresses reaches an ATH of ~46.1M. When comparing for growth across Epochs, we note a decline in relative growth, but an increase in absolute growth as the number of Non-Zero Addresses continues to expand: ?Epoch\u2026 pic.twitter.com/iXFw52Y5eD \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 6, 2023\n\nFrom Bitcoin\u2019s genesis to the first halving cycle, addresses increased by one million. The second Epoch recorded 8x the first, while the third cycle added another 3x. However, with approximately 368 days till the halving, there was still time for the fourth to follow the same pattern.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a notable revival in the Bitcoin market valuation growth since the unfortunate capitulation in 2022. For the unfamiliar, the Bitcoin demand and supply rate determine the market value.\n\nWith an indexed growth of 271% since the last halving, the market valuation had increased to $558 billion. This reflects an increase in the demand for the coin and its popularity over a longer period.\n\nBTC building up the hash\n\nBesides the indexed growth, one metric that has sustainably increased over the last halving period is the hashrate. The Bitcoin hashrate acts as a measure of computational power, and is used to determine the health, mining difficulty, and security within the Bitcoin network.\n\nAt press time, the hashrate had grown exponentially by 184.59% as it rose to 439.23 Exahash per second (EH/s).\n\nDespite the unfortunate events that rocked the crypto economy over the majority of the quarters in 2022, the realized profit/loss growth improved from the last halving.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nAt the time of writing, on-chain data showed that both realized profits and losses had increased by over 300%. This confirms the notion that demand had subsequently increased, and a lot of coins were used in transactions during the period.\n\nAs the halving nears, increased adoption could be bolstered, especially as institutions have been gradually embracing Bitcoin and allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to BTC. Additionally, more retail investors have also been recognizing the potential of Bitcoin as a potential investment tool."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other unbacked cryptocurrencies are \u201cPonzi schemes\u201d and should be treated with skepticism, according to Ireland\u2019s Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf. He has also suggested that regulators may crack down on crypto influencers who promote crypto products online without disclosing their related financial interests.\n\nIreland Against Unbacked Crypto\n\nIn a blog post published on the Central Bank\u2019s website, Makhlouf stated that the purchase of cryptocurrencies is similar to purchasing a lottery ticket: \u201cYou might win but you probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe added that such products should not be described as investments and that the Central Bank is concerned about the potential for consumer harm.\n\n\u201cIn the case of crypto, this market is developing at pace and the risks to consumers and investors are rising, particularly as these products remain unregulated\u201d.\n\nCriticizing the aggressive advertising of cryptocurrencies, he emphasized the need for transparency in the promotion of crypto products and said that influencers should disclose their related financial interests.\n\nRecently, on April 18, 2023, the Central Bank of Ireland granted VASP authorization to Payward Europe Solutions, an Irish affiliate of Kraken with its headquarters in Dublin. Binance and Coinbase expanded in the country last year in October and December respectively.\n\nThere is a case-by-case determination of whether a cryptocurrency can be regulated in Ireland. For example, currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether do not fall under the existing regulations in Ireland because they are not \u201ccentrally issued and give no rights or entitlements to holders.\u201d\n\nSupports EU MiCA Regulation\n\nThe European Parliament recently passed the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which set common standards across Europe for supervising crypto firms. Makhlouf welcomed the regulations and suggested that regulators in Ireland and the EU would be tightening controls on the industry following recent collapses of crypto assets like TerraUSD stablecoin and crypto exchange FTX.\n\nMakhlouf said that crypto would be supervised like any other financial market in proportion to the risks it posed, adding that crypto firms would eventually have to protect client funds, maintain high standards of governance and disclose relevant information just like mainstream financial firms."

This has resulted in instances where miners have liquidated their holdings.\n\nBut in most cases, these miners have preferred to maintain their positions.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nStepping on the brakes\n\nHowever, public mining companies were observed to be consistent in their behavior. According to Blockridge\u2019s data, all mining companies sold 100% of their holdings, in the latter half of 2022.\n\nHowever, for the first time in over six months, the liquidation ratio decreased to below 100% in March, subsequently dropping further to 95% in April. Indicating that these companies had slowed down on selling off their BTC holdings.\n\nWell, the decline in sell-offs could be attributed to the fact that the companies\u2019 faith in BTC has been restored as the coin\u2019s price has soared over the last three months.\n\nDue to the increase in BTC\u2019s price, the revenue generated by miners also witnessed a spike.\n\nTalking about mining pools, Foundry Pool, one of the largest mining pools in the sector, was observed to be having a successful run in terms of mining blocks. According to btc.com\u2019s data, over the last six months, the pool managed to mine 8,060 blocks.\n\nThe mining companies and pools have just started to hold onto their BTC, and the retail investors show no sign of stopping their accumulation.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data indicated that the number of addresses holding more than 0.1 coins has reached an all-time high.\n\nNo pressure\n\nAt the time of writing, the selling pressure on these investors was relatively low. According to data provided by Santiment, the 30-day MVRV ratio of BTC had turned negative.\n\nThis indicated that most short-term holders were not profitable and did not have an incentive to sell.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nOn the other hand, the Long/Short difference of BTC continued to increase, indicating that the majority of the addresses on the network were long-term holders of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite these factors, short positions on the network continued to increase.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and trading volume, sets another record with Block 788695 as transactions on its blockchain network spiral out of control.\n\nRecently, there has been an alarming rise in user transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to network traffic and congestion. This has increased miner profitability significantly as transaction fees skyrocket to control the situation.\n\nIn an interesting development witnessed by the crypto community yesterday, miners were seen to have profited highly as transaction fees contained in Block 788695 surpassed the block subsidy. This will be the second occurrence for the Bitcoin network where transaction fees contained in a block are greater than the block subsidy.\n\nRelated Reading: BRC-20 Token Standard A Hotspot For New Memecoins As PEPE Soars\n\nBitcoin Block 788695 Sets Another Record\n\nAccording to Bitcoin mining data reports from Mempool, transaction fees contained in Block 788695 were seen to be greater than the Block subsidy. The reports show that 6.7 BTC in transaction fees were contained in Block 788695, greater than the 6.25 BTC block subsidy.\n\nThe last time this occurred was in 2017 when transaction fees contained in Block 500546 were reported to have surpassed the block subsidy. This phenomenon occurs primarily when the Bitcoin blockchain network receives exceedingly high network activity from user transactions.\n\nMiners are seen to profit highly from these congested blocks, which contain high user transactions compared to regular blocks. They create blocks by collecting transactions from the Mempool and adding them to a block, and once the blocks are filled, it goes through complex mathematical computations. The miner who solves the math problem is rewarded with transaction fees and the block subsidy.\n\nRelated Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Crypto Market Takes Another Hit\n\nThe block subsidy refers to the amount of new Bitcoin created or minted in each block. For each block successfully created, the miner is allowed to mint a fixed amount of new Bitcoin, which is based on the \u2018current issuance rate decided by the Bitcoin protocol.\u2019\n\nThe Bitcoin block subsidy amount is determined by an algorithm in its source code and starts at 50 BTC per block, which is split in half every four years. The split process of the block subsidy, otherwise known as BTC halving, has trickled down to 6.25 from it 50 BTC where it started and is expected to be split further in 2024.\n\nWhy Are BTC Transaction Fees On The Rise?\n\nThe jump in BTC transaction fees can be attributed to recent user activities on its blockchain network. For one, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network for seamlessly minting fungible tokens has gained increased popularity in the blockchain and crypto community.\n\nThe recent hype of tokens, including meme coins minted using the BRC-20 standard, has led to increased FOMO of users carrying out multiple token purchases and transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBTC price opens on a negative on the daily chart timeframe | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFeatured Image from Istock & Mempool, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Cypherpunks, Galt's Gulch, and Bitcoin | AIER - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cypherpunks, a group of cryptographers, mathematicians, computer scientists and activists, many of whom had libertarian (or libertarian-esque) influences, worked to bring about a better world by peaceful means through mathematics and computer code. Although the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s founder remains unknown to the general public, it is widely understood that this stateless digital currency is a direct result of their work.\n\nIn 1992, Timothy C. May, a self-described crypto-anarchist and a founding member of the Cypherpunks, published an essay called \u201cLibertaria in Cyberspace.\u201d May wrote that \u201cit will be easier to form certain types of libertarian societies in cyberspace than in the real world of nations and physical locations\u201d and that \u201cthese \u2018crypto anarchy\u2019 ideas will further erode the power of physical states to tax and coerce residents.\u201d\n\nMay cited a number of key influences on the Cypherpunks, among them economists FA Hayek and David D. Friedman, as well as moral philosopher Ayn Rand. But crypto-anarchy as a political ideology was a recurring theme, and Ayn Rand was, according to May, \u201cone of the prime motivators\u201d of it. He wrote that \u201cWhat [Rand] wanted to do with material technology (mirrors over Galt\u2019s Gulch) is _much_ more easily done with mathematical technology.\u201d But the social change they sought to bring about wasn\u2019t just a passive interest. \u201cCypherpunks write code\u201d wrote Eric Hughes, another member of the group, in his \u201cCypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto.\u201d\n\nThe idea of building a crypto-anarchist Galt\u2019s Gulch in cyberspace was an intriguing idea. In 1998, Cypherpunk and computer engineer Wei Dai authored an essay explaining how a cryptographic money, which he called \u2018b-money\u2019, could work. In the very first sentence of the essay he wrote that he was \u201cfascinated by Tim May\u2019s crypto-anarchy\u201d and that in this cryptographic cyber-utopia, government was \u201cpermanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary\u201d because \u201cits participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.\u201d\n\nNick Szabo, another Cypherpunk and computer scientist, described the digital Galt\u2019s Gulch as a place where \u201cyou could form your own independent community and declare your independence from corrupt institutions,\u201d a place with its own private money, where private property is protected through non-violent means, and where contracts are enforced.\n\nAs the development of a privately-issued digital currency was very much a goal of the Cypherpunks, as they were inspired in no small part by Ayn Rand, and as Rand had much to say about money, it is worth reviewing some of her writings to derive what she might have thought about Bitcoin.\n\nAnarchy\n\nAs mentioned, Cypherpunk Timothy May\u2019s vision of Galt\u2019s Gulch in cyberspace was one that he described as \u201ccrypto-anarchy.\u201d But Rand dismissed anarchy as a political system altogether, calling it \u201ca naive floating abstraction.\u201d\n\nSo while both Rand and some of the more influential Cypherpunks imagined what a freer society might look like \u2013 both appreciating free trade and voluntary interaction \u2013 they certainly would not have agreed about whether a minimal level of coercion is necessary to fund, say, courts and military. As such, if we view a private, digital currency as an essential part of the crypto-anarchist vision, it is difficult to imagine Rand\u2019s supporting it. But taking a closer look at Rand\u2019s views on property rights and money itself can provide us with a more in-depth perspective.\n\nProperty rights\n\nRand wrote that it is only through property rights that any other right can exist, and that without property rights \u201cthere is no way to solve or to avoid a hopeless chaos of clashing views, interests, demands, desires, and whims.\u201d\n\nIn Bitcoin, to know something (your private key) is essentially owning it. It is, of course, possible to entrust your private keys with a third party (an exchange, for example), but this is both entirely unnecessary and highly discouraged among bitcoiners, as captured by the \u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoins\u201d ethos. So while it is possible to seize bitcoins by coercing someone to cough up their private keys, the nature of Bitcoin\u2019s functionality forces the coercive party to go to much greater (violent) lengths to expropriate in the first place. As such, Bitcoin radically shifts the balance of power between the individual and the state, as the state cannot go door-to-door violently forcing information from people\u2019s heads without falsifying the public image it promotes for itself as a \u201cbenevolent provider of social welfare.\u201d\n\nTo take it one step further, Bitcoin\u2019s portability allows wealth to move from one corner of the earth to another in a permissionless way. It also enables property owners to physically cross borders and carry their wealth with them, as bitcoins do not occupy physical space, and the private keys can be stored in their heads.\n\nIn sum, Bitcoin serves as a radical form of property rights, and as such, it is difficult to imagine Rand\u2019s not appreciating this aspect of it.\n\nMoney\n\nWhen Rand wrote of money, she usually referred to the value of making it by creating value for others; she distinguished between money made by just means and unearned money through unjust means (e.g. through political connections). She also gave us an indication as to what kind of money she considered to be sound:\n\nMoney is the tool of men who have reached a high level of productivity and a long-range control over their lives. Money is not merely a tool of exchange: much more importantly, it is a tool of saving, which permits delayed consumption and buys time for future production. To fulfill this requirement, money has to be some material commodity which is imperishable, rare, homogeneous, easily stored, not subject to wide fluctuations of value, and always in demand among those you trade with (emphasis mine).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that she would have appreciated Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity (with a fixed 21-million hard cap), which facilitates its store of value proposition, but would have probably been uneasy about its volatility in purchasing power.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged, the fictional character Francisco d\u2019Anconia gave a passionate speech about money, arguing that \u201cMoney is made\u2014before it can be looted or mooched\u2014made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can\u2019t consume more than he has produced.\u201d Here again we reflect on Bitcoin\u2019s real scarcity, with nobody being able to produce bitcoins out of thin air to pay for political favors (a standard practice for fiat).\n\nGold is a recurring theme in Rand\u2019s work on money. In her book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, Alan Greenspan authors an article entitled \u201cGold and Economic Freedom.\u201d He writes: \u201cGold and economic freedom are inseparable\u2026\u201d And, \u201cDeficit spending is simply a scheme for the \u2018hidden\u2019 confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, would Rand like Bitcoin? It is difficult to know exactly. She passed away in 1982 \u2013 long before most of us had ever heard of the internet. Whatever one\u2019s view on Rand, there is no denying her strong influence on the early Cypherpunks who \u201cwrote code\u201d in a decades-long attempt to realize some cyberspace version of the laissez-faire capitalism that she boldly advocated for in real space.\n\nRand had some important things to say about money and about the morally justifiable way of earning (making) it in the first place. In fact, her views on money were so firmly held that she proudly wore a dollar sign ($) as a statement. Perhaps if she were alive today and knew the extent to which Bitcoin serves as a technical solution to the political problem of a privileged class of people that live at expense of those who produce, she might have proudly embraced Bitcoin\u2019s \u20bf symbol instead. Her ideas inspired the very individuals who set out to make something like Bitcoin a reality in the first place. I like to think that she could be proud of that.\n\nSee also: \u201cHayek and Bitcoin\u201d"
