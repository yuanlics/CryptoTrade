        "title": "Why embracing Bitcoin would be a low-risk, high-reward strategy for Trump - Fortune",
        "content": "A central bank digital currency, or CBDC, was once an idea confined to water cooler conversations among economists. But last week, former President Donald Trump catapulted the CBDC controversy to the front of the campaign trail. At an event on Jan. 18, he promised supporters, \u201cAs your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency. This would be a dangerous threat to freedom, and I will stop it from coming to America.\u201d The crowd roared.\n\nSo what is a CBDC? Why is Trump suddenly talking about it? And what does a digital dollar have to do with Bitcoin and the future of money?\n\nIn short, a CBDC is a digital dollar created by the federal government. This may sound benign at first. But effectively giving the government digital control over consumer bank accounts has profound implications for privacy and freedom.\n\nBoth the virtue and the vice of a CBDC is that it is a form of programmable money. The programmability of a CBDC could empower governments to micro-target stimulus packages and transmit money more efficiently. But it could also enable governments to manipulate how and where we spend our money, going so far as to turn it on and off.\n\nNowhere is the threat of a government-controlled digital currency more evident than in China, which was the first major economic power to launch a CBDC. China is currently exploring ways to exploit the \u201cprogrammable features\u201d of its CBDC, which will empower CCP bureaucrats to put an expiration date on money, restrict spending to certain sectors, and even tie it to a citizen\u2019s social credit score.\n\nIn China, a CBDC will enable the kind of central planning Karl Marx could have only dreamed of. It\u2019s no wonder then that Democrats and Republicans alike despise the idea. Having seen the social experiment going on in China, many have a legitimate fear that a CBDC would allow the federal government to control their money and track their spending. That\u2019s why nearly 75% of Americans are opposed to a government-backed digital dollar where such tracking would be possible, according to a recent survey from Cato.\n\nTrump appears to have intuited that a CBDC is the undiscovered third rail of American politics. And so, he is railing against it in hopes of galvanizing liberty-minded Republicans in the primary with an eye toward privacy-minded Democrats and independents in the general. With this strategy, Trump aims to contrast himself with President Joe Biden, who signed an executive order in March 2022 to place \u201curgency on research and development of a potential United States CBDC.\u201d Biden has failed to recognize just how controversial a CBDC would be with his own supporters\u2014a mistake Trump is keen to exploit.\n\nBy opposing a CBDC, Trump aims to tap into a new well of support, particularly among experienced voters weary of government overreach. But beneath that well is an even larger reservoir of political energy just waiting to be unleashed: the younger and more diverse Bitcoin vote.\n\nFor many, waking up to the dangers of a CBDC is the first step in embracing Bitcoin. That\u2019s because Bitcoin is anti-CBDC technology. While a CBDC is a form of programmable money that governments can manipulate, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that no one controls\u2014one resistant to both central bank manipulation and government censorship.\n\nSo what does this all mean for the 2024 campaign? To shore up his anti-CBDC bona fides, the next logical step for Trump could be to embrace Bitcoin. This would not only cement his support among pro-privacy Americans, it would curry favor with the crypto vote, which is positioned to be one of the most consequential constituencies this November.\n\nIn 2020, the digital asset voter was all but non-existent. Bitcoin was just starting a historic bull run. Many Americans did not understand it yet, thought it was a \u201cscam,\u201d or had concerns regarding its relationship with the U.S. dollar.\n\nFast-forward to today: An eye-popping 52 million Americans own digital assets, including 18% of Republicans and 22% of Democrats. Coinbase reports that the population of owners is greater than the number of Americans who directly own stock or use rideshares each month. The owners tend to be younger and span ethnic and political demographics.\n\nIn light of this bourgeoning population, multiple presidential primary candidates have outlined policy agendas to protect the right to own Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. And premier financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have just launched the first spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn sum, digital asset enthusiasts have become a political force to be reckoned with.\n\nJust last month, an alliance of industry-aligned super PACs announced that they had collectively raised $78 million. They aim to increase that total to $100 million this quarter to support pro-innovation candidates. On a grassroots level, voters who own digital assets are poised to play a powerful role as well, especially in key battleground states.\n\nConsider New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. According to a Morning Consult poll, 18% of voters across these four states own digital assets. And of these voters, 55% said they would be less likely to support a candidate who stands in the way of crypto values. Those values include a desire to build an ownership economy, coupled with a distrust of the current economic system run by government agencies and large financial institutions.\n\nIn other words, these issues are top priorities for up to 1.9 million voters across these four swing states alone. In states that were decided by just thousands of votes in 2020, this new coalition of digital asset diehards could be enough to swing the election.\n\nThe question is, does Trump care?\n\nWhile he\u2019s been critical of digital assets in the past, there is growing evidence that he is changing his tune. Before raising the alarm on the dangers of CBDCs, Trump dipped his toes into crypto by raising millions of dollars through the launch of his own NFT collection.\n\nTrump has already embraced crypto to gin up support among voters\u2014and he could do so again by espousing a pro-Bitcoin agenda. In so doing, he could win converts among a voting group that the Biden administration has been openly hostile to. And he could gain instant access to millions of new voters and tens of millions of dollars in financial backing from heavyweight Super PACs.\n\nHerein lies the beauty of embracing Bitcoin: As a financial investment, it has historically been viewed as high-risk, high-reward. As a political gambit, however, it is low-risk, high-reward. Much like opposing a CBDC, supporting the right to own Bitcoin and crypto is a dealmaker for millions of Americans and a dealbreaker for almost none. And if anyone can recognize a good deal, it\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nBrian Morgenstern is head of public policy at Riot Platforms, Inc., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining enterprises in North America. He was a senior advisor and deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2017 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 served as White House deputy press secretary and deputy communications director in the Trump administration.

        "content": "With each step Bitcoin takes toward more widespread acceptance, it loses some of what made it appealing in the first place.\n\nTwo big things have happened in the crypto world this month: a public validation and a semi-private snub. Both of them bode poorly for its future.\n\nThe official validation came in the form of the SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which will make it easier for speculators to invest in Bitcoin. The slight came at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, which I attended, and where Bitcoin \u2014 or any cryptocurrency, really \u2014 was clearly on the outs. Last year crypto was everywhere in Davos. This year, the star of the show was AI. Crypto, like me, didn\u2019t even know about all the really good parties, much less get an invitation.\n\nThese may seem like contradictory developments: On the one hand, a Bitcoin ETF legitimizes crypto as an asset class. On the other, the annual jamboree of the elite establishment has all but banished the crypto community. Yet both are indicative of the fact that, as an asset class, crypto has gone fully mainstream \u2014 which means it has peaked.\n\nContinue reading the entire piece here at Bloomberg Opinion (paywall)\n\n___________________\n\nAllison Schrager is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal.\n\nPhoto by Nastco/iStock"

        "title": "The bitcoin ETF market's single point of failure - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at Coinbase\u2019s role in the industry\u2019s newly approved bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAfter two weeks of life, there are some things we know about the string of bitcoin exchange traded funds that have proliferated on US stock markets.\n\nThe largest, Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, is experiencing a huge outflow of assets. The regulatory approval that opened the door for more investors to get exposure to bitcoin can also be the passage to leave a service you\u2019re unhappy with, or simply exit the market altogether.\n\nWe also know that sometimes it\u2019s better to travel than arrive. Since approval was confirmed bitcoin is down about 15 per cent.\n\nBut an important point has thus far flown under the radar: the safety and security of the bitcoins on which the ETFs are built.\n\nLegally speaking the ETF sponsors such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark etc hold the bitcoins in a trust; in practice the assets are held by a custodian on behalf of the trust. Eight of the 11 sponsors have chosen Coinbase as their custodian. Fidelity is using its own digital asset custody business.\n\nThis raises eyebrows for two reasons: first, the exchange is being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly failing to register as a national securities exchange, among other things.\n\nIn one \u2014 narrow, legal \u2014 sense, that lawsuit focuses \u201conly\u201d on whether Coinbase filled in correct forms or not. It doesn\u2019t pass judgment on Coinbase\u2019s capabilities or business practices. Even if the SEC is successful, the lawsuit won\u2019t necessarily hinder Coinbase\u2019s ability to offer custodial services to clients.\n\nSecondly and more importantly \u2014 and I will emphasise this contradiction for as long as the word decentralisation is synonymous with crypto \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s dominance of the custody market is a major single point of failure for the new sector.\n\nAnyone who has paid attention to crypto for even five minutes knows the problems this market has always had in holding and protecting other people\u2019s assets.\n\nMt. Gox customers are still waiting for their money after a hack in 2014 caused the infamous exchange to fail. Investors in Celsius and of course, FTX, are still trying to get their money back.\n\nCoinbase is a different entity and says it maintains very strict walls between its operations. Its exchange and custody business shouldn\u2019t be at risk from market volatility.\n\nStill, imagine \u2014 hypothetically of course \u2014 that Coinbase was hacked or it suddenly collapsed in the manner of many crypto companies before it. What then?\n\n\u201cThere is always a risk that a custodian could collapse, and I think the risk is heightened whenever you\u2019re talking about a less mature market, like crypto is,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price.\n\nI reached out to each of the eight firms with Coinbase, and asked them what their Plan B was, as a back up. Only two responded. WisdomTree and Grayscale both said they could choose to change custodian at their own discretion.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen crypto companies collapse at speed: will the sponsors be fast enough to react? And if not, what happens to the stranded assets?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s prospectus \u2014 to take one example \u2014 makes things pretty clear.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that customers\u2019 assets \u2014 including the Trust\u2019s assets \u2014 may be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate of . . . the bitcoin custodian, and customers \u2014 including the Trust \u2014 may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s risk factors are similarly blunt: \u201cThe legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain.\u201d\n\nOuch. It\u2019s not much better if the custodian is hacked.\n\nBlackRock says its bitcoin custodian has insurance coverage \u201cof up to $320mn that covers losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients\u201d. That\u2019s not a lot to cover $2bn of assets under management.\n\nIn fairness to Coinbase, it recognises its unique position. \u201cWe are committed to sharing and creating transparent industry standards to develop the security capability of industry peers, and welcome the future diversification of custodianship,\u201d Philip Martin, the exchange\u2019s chief security officer, told me.\n\nCompetition for custody business seems to be on its way. Anchorage Digital Bank \u2014 which holds a bank charter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \u2014 has designs on the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the natural diversification partner for ETF issuers,\u201d chief executive Nathan McCauley told me on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time, energy and effort to make sure we capture that.\u201d\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, diversification is always handy. But if a crypto Willie Sutton appears, ETF investors large and small have the same minimal safety net that purchasers of cryptocurrencies have.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Coinbase\u2019s role as custodian for so many bitcoin ETFs? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin ETFs, don\u2019t miss my story this week on bitcoin losing 15 per cent of its value over the past two weeks. Underwhelming flows into the newly approved league of bitcoin ETFs have \u2014 so far \u2014 given the lie to the market\u2019s assumption that new investors would be drawn into bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England and HM Treasury on Thursday responded to a public consultation that brings the UK potentially closer to launching a digital pound. Concerns surrounding user privacy were raised last year, but this week the BoE and HMT committed to introduce primary legislation to parliament aimed at protecting the public\u2019s financial privacy should a digital pound be eventually rolled out.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Drawing battle lines\n\nYou may recall the US Office of Foreign Assets Control imposing sanctions on crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, alleging the platform helped launder billions of dollars worth of illicit funds linked to North Korea-backed criminal hackers.\n\nRoman Storm, one of the developers behind the service, also faces a criminal trial to answer charges of money laundering and the violation of sanctions rules. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow he is seeking crowdfunding to pay for his defence.\n\nFolks, I need your help. Whether you\u2019re a passionate developer like me involved with Web 3, or you just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you, so please help contribute to my legal defence because this case will set a major precedent for years to come.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Ether falls with bitcoin\n\nBitcoin went on a four-month surge on expectations that the SEC would finally approve exchange traded funds. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also on the same regulatory journey \u2014 but its price isn\u2019t enjoying the same boost.\n\nLike bitcoin, it has dropped since the SEC approved the first spot crypto exchange traded funds. This week the SEC pushed back the date for approval of an ether ETF again but there\u2019s still several months to go before the regulator runs out of road and has to make a decision.\n\nBut the market seems to have learned an important lesson: the approval of an exchange traded fund doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the price of the underlying asset is going to fly. Who knew?\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "content": "So much of Bitcoin lore is built around memes.\n\n\u201cStacking sats\u201d describes how to buy into bitcoin without timing the market. \u201cHODL\u201d shows how to survive the volatility without losing one\u2019s nerve, and \u201cBUIDL\u201d offers a blueprint for boosting adoption.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that bitcoin\u2019s next halving event is now expected to hit on April 20. Yes, 4/20.\n\nBitcoin seeps fresh coins into circulation through miners, who earn a reward each time they solve. The network slashes that reward by half every 210,000 blocks.\n\nThis is the network\u2019s fourth halving, which means it will take place at block height 840,000. As soon as that block hits, miners will suddenly go from earning 6.25 BTC ($259,000) to 3.125 BTC ($129,500).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin halvings are bull market things \u2014 Will this time be different?\n\nRight now, there are 12,510 blocks to go. There\u2019s however no precise date or time for when Bitcoin will reach that block height. Websites counting down the halving show widely different results, from April 11 to April 21.\n\nCarlos Mercado, data scientist at on-chain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, has meanwhile run 500 simulations of Bitcoin block times and found it will most likely coincide with the Superbowl for cannabis enthusiasts.\n\nBitcoin block times are regulated but random\n\nThe Bitcoin network is built to ensure blocks aren\u2019t solved too quickly, no matter how many miners are active on the network.\n\nMiners are directing more computing power (hash rate) to solving blocks than ever before, and more power means higher chances of mining a block in shorter periods of time. Left unchecked, this would mean the time between Bitcoin blocks would rapidly increase as more miners join the network.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto intended the 21 million bitcoins to be distributed over a long period of time, potentially more than a century; all supply would be issued too quickly if blocks were always mined within seconds rather than minutes.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018genesis\u2019 block of transaction was created 15 years ago\n\nBlocks are mined when a miner supplies a string of digits, known as a \u201chash,\u201d under a certain numerical limit. Bitcoin raises and lowers that limit \u2014 the \u201cdifficulty\u201d \u2014 depending on how quickly miners are supplying those hashes.\n\nOver time, this increases how long it takes for miners to guess those answers and successfully discover blocks.\n\nIn a blog post detailing his simulations, Mercado explained that around every two weeks, Bitcoin checks the time it took to mine the previous 2,016 blocks. If they were \u201cproduced faster than expected, difficulty goes up to decrease production. If the blocks were produced slower than expected, difficulty falls to increase production.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin hash rate, (the effort of miners to complete proof of work) is the defining factor of block production, but as or even more importantly, the difficulty adjustment every 2,016 blocks is a wholesale shift in how effective the hash rate is,\u201d Mercado told Blockworks.\n\nBitcoin has added 147 blocks per day over the past year. But the difficulty indirectly influences how long it takes to mine blocks and how it plays out in real time is still incredibly random.\n\nBlocks can be discovered within seconds of each other or, in the case of a block mined earlier this week, some aren\u2019t added for more than an hour, with no transactions processed in that time.\n\nMore than 40% of all simulations celebrated 4/20 with a bitcoin halving\n\nSo, Mercado ran hundreds of simulations based on the previous year to see if any patterns emerged. The simulations took into account potential difficulty adjustments forecasted by correlation rates between transaction fees and hash power.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price tracking ahead of the past 2 halvings \u2014 now 3 months to go\n\nAfter running 500 simulations on the next 100 days of bitcoin mining production, the results showed the bitcoin halving most commonly occurred on April 20 \u2014 more than 200 times compared to 153 for the day after.\n\n\u201cFor the math inclined: the bitcoin daily block production over the last 365 days has a skewness of -0.07 (very small skew to faster than expected block production),\u201d Mercado said.\n\n\u201cThis was because there were three raised difficulty adjustments in a row back in Q1 2023; but otherwise I\u2019d still say the system is working and blocks are generally pacing as expected.\u201d\n\nAnd after all, bitcoin\u2019s all-time high is currently $69,000. The next halving hitting on 4/20 would be only natural.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nFutures traders have jumped on the arrival of the first US spot bitcoin exchange traded funds, ramping up a lucrative bet that capitalises on the volatile moves of crypto-related prices.\n\nThe number of bitcoin futures contracts open at Chicago\u2019s CME Group has climbed to record levels in January as traders target a short-term return from the difference between those contracts and the spot price \u2014 aping a strategy that has long been popular in more established financial and commodity markets.\n\nThe open interest marker, a sign of the depth and liquidity of a futures market, has enabled CME to leapfrog Binance as the world\u2019s largest exchange for trading derivatives of bitcoin. While Binance has thousands of retail customers, CME has traditionally catered to big asset managers, hedge funds and proprietary traders.\n\nAverage open interest at CME has hit 24,100 contracts this month, equivalent to about $4.6bn, up from 16,500 contracts for 2023. It climbed as high as 27,000 contracts, around $6bn, on January 12, the day US regulators approved the 10 new bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAn average of 66,000 bitcoin futures contracts at CME changed hands daily in January, representing a nearly 50 per cent jump month on month and surpassing their previous high in November 2022.\n\nTraders say volumes have been boosted by applying a tried and tested strategy in other markets, known as a \u201ccash and carry trade\u201d, to bitcoin.\n\nA trader can sell the future, which typically trades at a premium, and hedge it by buying the underlying asset. A spot bitcoin ETF also offers traders a cheaper and safer way to buy the cryptocurrency. The two prices typically converge as the futures contract nears expiry; traders say the trade generates up to a 15 per cent annualised return for little risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple carry trade and we know this stuff in Chicago,\u201d said a longtime trader who declined to be identified. \u201cBitcoin presents a real opportunity for traders that understand forward curves to come in and provide liquidity and also take opportunistic positions.\u201d\n\nThe much-hyped launch of these stock market funds that invest directly in bitcoin had been expected to attract a new class of institutional investors to the world\u2019s most-traded cryptocurrency, further boosting its price. In fact, bitcoin has fallen sharply since the approval two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, the surging futures interest indicates the participation of a class of traders who care less about the markets\u2019 overall direction, and are instead focused on the arbitrage opportunities between bitcoin and its various derivatives.\n\n\u201cIn essence, this surge in activity indicates a substantial demand for Bitcoin exposure among institutional investors, an unprecedented development in the market,\u201d said Amberdata, a crypto derivatives trading research group, in a report last week.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the arrival of spot bitcoin ETF was \u201clikely to induce a significant change in the bitcoin market structure.\u201d\n\nHe noted that onshore crypto exchanges and the CME have benefitted from US regulators\u2019 crackdown on offshore exchanges like Binance. The shift \u201cechoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent,\u201d he said.\n\nDerivatives traders are also linking more of their strategies to the new bitcoin ETFs, particularly in the under-developed options markets, which allow wagers on swings in the price.\n\n\u201cThe most exciting aspect of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to significantly expand the nascent crypto volatility market,\u201d Amberdata said."

As that expiry approached, there were 94,000 bitcoin options set to expire, featuring a put-call ratio of 0.51, which is interpreted as a bullish indicator for the asset, as reported by Greek Live.\n\nBitcoin options open interest has declined significantly after Friday's expiry, lessening derivatives market constraint on the digital asset.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nBitcoin price correction forecasted\n\nEarlier in the week, BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes expressed his belief that the price of bitcoin would continue to decline. In a blog post on Tuesday, Hayes predicted a 30% correction for bitcoin, which reached approximately $48,000 immediately after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 10.\n\nAccording to Hayes, this correction could bring bitcoin down to the $33,600 level, ultimately establishing a new support zone between $30,000 and $35,000.\n\n\"A 30% correction from the ETF approval high of $48,000 is $33,600. Therefore, I believe bitcoin forms support between $30,000 to $35,000,\" Hayes wrote in the blog post."

        "content": "Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) are trending higher Friday morning following an upgrade from Oppenheimer. The firm upgraded Coinbase's stock from Perform to Outperform, setting a price target of $160 per share.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) is rebounding above $41,000 following a dip a week after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved\n\nYahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Coinbase shares are getting a boost with Oppenheimer upgrading the stock to outperform from perform. And initiating its price target at $160 per share. The analyst behind the call citing Coinbase as a stronger than many people-- has stronger than many people realize. Excuse me. There you're taking a look at the price target $160 here. We were taking a look at the shares a moment ago.\n\nAnd this is actually a lift for the broader kind of crypto and the crypto trading names out there as well. We were tracking Marathon. That's one of the top trending tickers on the \"Yahoo Finance\" platform right now this morning. Pre-market, with about six minutes until the start of trade, and Bitcoin, as well. Perhaps, we can take a quick look at that just to see how things are faring there. Because, ultimately, over the course of this week, there was a lot of concern about whether or not we'd be able to keep this 40,000 level. We eventually got back up to. And now, have exceeded it. We're up by about 3% for Bitcoin here today too.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, we are seeing some optimism creep back into the markets. Again, putting this in perspective, Bitcoin had been under a tremendous amount of pressure ever since we did get that decision from the SEC. A lot of that thought, though, some of that optimism of an approval already baked into the price. So we did see a bit of cooling. And you can see that a bit reflected in that stock chart that we have up there on the screen right now.\n\nSo we are above that 41,000 level now. Question is, how much higher can we climb? Can we get back to that 46,000, 47,000 level that we saw not too long ago. And again, because we're seeing the price of Bitcoin rise here, obviously, other names like Coinbase among the big leaders in today's market action.\n\nBut Oppenheimer here in this upgrade of Coinbase calling out a number of catalysts here. One, the prospect of stronger earnings, and also improving fundamentals. Because of that, they're raising the price target to 160. About $40 higher than where it's trading today."

Still, VanEck crypto research head Matthew Sigel said the flows remain in line with the firm\u2019s projections.\n\nNet inflows into the funds have shrunk to $745 million, Bloomberg Intelligence data shows, as the ETFs collectively bled about $420 million in each of this week\u2019s first four days.\n\nThe combined spot bitcoin ETF net inflow figure, since their launches on Jan. 11, goes up significantly \u2014 to more than $5.5 billion \u2014 when excluding the heavy outflows endured by Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nNearly $4.8 billion has left the Grayscale fund since its conversion to an ETF. The sales come after investors in recent years had no way to sell shares of the fund without doing so on the secondary market at a substantial discount. GBTC also carries a 1.5% fee \u2014 a price point significantly higher than the nine offerings it competes with.\n\nRead more: As GBTC outflows continue, will the largest bitcoin ETF be dethroned?\n\nGBTC\u2019s roughly $12 billion in trade volumes since Jan. 11 account for more than half of the $22.7 billion the 10 spot bitcoin ETFs have seen combined.\n\nThe net inflows seen by spot bitcoin funds from leaders BlackRock and Fidelity have not overcome the GBTC outflows of late. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) on Thursday saw $171 million and $101 million of net inflows, respectively. GBTC\u2019s spillage amounted to $394 million that day.\n\nThursday net outflows for spot bitcoin ETFs was $80 million on Thursday \u2014 down from $158 million the day before, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Net outflows for the segment totaled $76 million on Monday and $106 million on Tuesday.\n\nBut VanEck\u2019s Sigel said the spot bitcoin ETFs\u2019 aggregate flows are tracking in line with the firm\u2019s expectations.\n\nSigel wrote in December that he expected spot bitcoin ETFs to see $2.4 billion of net flows during the first quarter of 2024.

        "title": "Beware the crypto bull run predictions in 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "Aside from the high-profile court cases, much of 2023 was a fairly lackluster year for crypto. Market activity remained mostly flat compared to the historical average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways all year, and total volume locked (TVL) in decentralized finance ecosystems drifted within a narrow range, far below all-time highs. This lack of dramatic volatility was far from the norm we usually associate with crypto assets. The minor pricing pump in Q4 closed out the year on a positive note.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a year for making money. But the recent green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission for 11 Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications, featuring heavyweight players such as BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck has led to a notable upswing in the crypto market, expressing optimistic outlook. Speculation is rife that a sustained bull run will replace this latest crypto winter.\n\nWhile I remain bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry on a long-term horizon, there\u2019s reason to remain cautious going into 2024. Investors face mixed signals, and it\u2019s possible the good news regarding Bitcoin ETF approval\u2013which has been leading crypto headlines for some months\u2013has already been priced in.\n\nWhile markets didn\u2019t skyrocket last year, they also didn\u2019t crater. There has been sufficient optimism to maintain pricing stability. That optimism is largely related to two major events in 2024: the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF and the potential approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The ETF approvals are expected to bring improved trading volumes and liquidity to crypto markets in general, and the halving will prevent BTC deflation and thus support prices.\n\nMany pundits have attributed the Q4 pricing pump to these factors, and that\u2019s been coupled with bullish activity in the derivatives market as well. Investors overall appear to believe that central bank rate hikes are mostly behind us and that there\u2019s enough weight to these optimistic murmurings to look forward to a breakout bull run in 2024.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive impact of institutional endorsements and the market sentiment reflected by the recent pricing upswing, I believe there is some truth to the Wall Street saying \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d here. The crypto market is forward-looking, and traders who have already bought the rumor might be waiting to sell regardless of what the news is.\n\nAfter the initial surge on the back of the highly anticipated news, markets may quickly pare those gains as wider adoption fails to keep pace. A subsequent correction could take place before an actual bull run begins. ETFs are a big step\u2013but not nearly enough to declare we\u2019ve achieved mass crypto adoption. While the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is a big win, I won\u2019t be holding my breath for new all-time highs for crypto asset prices or total value locked (TVL) in the short run.\n\nAs for BTC\u2019s halving in Q2, it will support markets but it\u2019s unlikely to drive a full-fledged bull run. This anti-inflationary measure makes mining new BTC more difficult, restricting supply. In the absence of significant crypto adoption, this alone isn\u2019t enough to take us back to BTC\u2019s peak of nearly $69,000, let alone surpass it.\n\nOn the other hand, an additional reason for optimism is the fact that 2024 is an election year in the U.S. We can expect U.S. regulators to tone down their headline-seeking activities in this high-stakes year. As such, there ought to be less bad news on the horizon for crypto that has the potential to dent investors\u2019 enthusiasm. This can possibly set the stage for the next bullish trend.\n\nAll in all (and Black Swan events aside), 2024 is shaping up to be more of the same for crypto asset prices. My base case scenario is that the market will bottom out and begin recovering more meaningfully by Q4 2024. In the meantime, we can expect some minor volatility as investors whiplash from heady anticipation to mild disappointment.\n\nHowever, the overall relative lack of volatility indicates that the crypto finance market is maturing, and thus our investment and trading strategies must mature as well.\n\nRachel Lin is a co-founder and CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped on Friday, helping to give a boost to other cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks downs the market action.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Bitcoin soaring to close out the week. Jared Blikre here with a crypto watch for us today, but I suspect it's not making up for some of its recent declines.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: A little bit, fractional, and let's take a look at the chart here in a second. Bitcoin up 5.41%. That's the best 24-hour period in weeks.\n\nAnd here is a six-month chart. And this was looking a little bit toppy in here, and we did have a false breakdown. I'm calling it false now because we've had significant momentum to the upside from what could have been or what's looking like support that was looking like it just broke. But if you're following the logic here, false breakdown nothing new to Bitcoin, and we are seeing a run up.\n\nAnd we are seeing continuation and some movement in other Bitcoin-related cryptocurrencies here. Solana up 6.8%. But really Bitcoin, unusually, is in the pole position today.\n\nWant to show you, though, this year has not been about crypto. In fact, TRX is the only non-stable-coin in the green here. Lots of movement to the downside.\n\nAnd, of course, if you take a look at the last year, it's a different picture. Solana up 283%.\n\nBut let me show you the crypto-linked stocks as well, and I'll get back to an intraday basis. Crypto stocks really popping today, and you can see this in Galaxy. That's up 14%. Bakkt up 11%. Marathon Digital, that's up 8.79%. The list goes on, and a lot of these have just been underwater for the year, and here's a look at that.\n\nNow PayPal, arguably Bitcoin exposure is pretty low there. That's the only one in the green, and it's looking a lot worse for a lot of these other names there. So just kind of gaining some of that lost territory that we've seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd also want to get an update of the ETF situation for Bitcoin. We have all these spot Bitcoin ETFs. By the way, this board has more than just Bitcoin ETFs. If you take a look in the upper left, BKCH actually has exposure to blockchain companies. So it's more linked to, I believe, crypto stocks, and that's why you're seeing that up a bit more.\n\nAnd then we're seeing some of these other tech-- we're seeing some of these other ones tick to the downside. This is an inverse Bitcoin ETF, so that explains what we're seeing there. But all in all, a nice day for crypto.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Jared Blikre, thank you for that. Appreciate it."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin rebounded above $41,000 this morning, with outflows for Grayscale\u2019s GBTC converted spot ETF slowing for the third consecutive day.\n\nData from BitMEX Research shows GBTC witnessed outflows of $394.1 million on Jan. 25, down from $429.3 million on Wednesday and $515.3 million on Tuesday. While the GBTC outflows remain very high, yesterday\u2019s figure is the second-lowest since the first trading day for the spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\nThe nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), Ark 21Shares (ARKB), Invesco (BTCO), VanEck (HODL), Valkyrie (BRRR), Franklin Templeton (EZBC) and WisdomTree (BTCW) \u2014 are yet to witness any daily outflows.\n\nIBIT registered the largest inflows yesterday with $170.7 million. FBTC generated $101 million worth of inflows and BITB was in third with $20 million. However, total inflows from the nine of $314.30 on Thursday were not enough to overcome GBTC outflows, creating a net outflow of nearly $80 million.\n\nOverall, the spot bitcoin ETFs have witnessed net inflows of $744.6 million since launch \u2014 with the newborn nine totaling $5.53 billion of inflows and GBTC registering total outflows of $4.79 billion.\n\nBitcoin BTC -7.00% is currently trading up 3% over the past 24 hours at $41,328, according to The Block\u2019s price page. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had previously fallen over 20% from a high of around $49,000 on the day the spot bitcoin ETFs launched to $38,600 on Jan. 23.\n\nLiquidations spike after bitcoin uptick\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise above the $41,000 mark, caused over $110 million in liquidations on centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe majority of crypto liquidations involved short positions, leading to a loss of over $66 million, while long positions contributed around $44 million to the total liquidations, according to Coinglass data.\n\nIn derivatives markets, liquidations take place when a trader's position is forcibly closed due to insufficient funds to cover losses. This situation arises when market movements are unfavorable to the trader's position, resulting in the depletion of their initial margin or collateral.\n\nThe volatility that shook out many leveraged positions was elevated compared to the beginning of the month. The Block's data dashboard puts current annualized bitcoin volatility at 53.95%, an increase from a low of around 42% at the beginning of January.\n\nMore downside to come?\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect limited further downside for bitcoin as profit-taking in GBTC has largely concluded. The cashing in of profits by GBTC investors was behind the recent decline in bitcoin's price, according to the analysts, but the worst appears to be over now. However, they cautioned that if GBTC's 1.5% fee isn't reduced soon, the fund could experience ongoing outflows and lose market share to rivals with cheaper fees.\n\nGBTC investors \u2014 who over the past year had been buying the fund's shares at a significant discount to net asset value to position for a potential ETF conversion \u2014 were \"taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" the JPMorgan analysts previously noted last week.\n\nChris Burniske, Partner at Placeholder VC who previously led crypto at Ark Invest, is not so sure, speculating that bitcoin will fall to \u201cat least\u201d $30,000 to $36,000 before a local bottom. \u201c[I] wouldn't be surprised if we test the mid-to-high 20s before all is said and done, and we can make an actual move towards previous ATHs,\u201d Burniske posted on X.\n\nBurniske said he continues to believe the long-term trend remains robust but warned about volatility. \u201cDon't ignore we also just saw many of our first parabolas of the cycle, and they're now breaking... and macro looks precarious on a number of levels,\u201d he added. \u201cNew product innovations are close, but not quite there yet... things still feel insular.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Under $40,000 Might Be the Best No-Brainer Investment You Make All Year - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For months, Wall Street investors had been predicting that the price of Bitcoin (BTC -4.22%) would soar as soon as the SEC finally approved the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. But this didn't happen. In fact, quite the opposite. The price of Bitcoin is now down to $40,000, and concerns are growing that it could dip even lower.\n\nThis is all probably a bit jarring, especially for the first-time crypto investor who expected to become a Bitcoin millionaire overnight. But it's actually part of a pattern we've seen over and over again with Bitcoin, and there's no need to panic now. Let's take a closer look.\n\nBitcoin and tactical asset allocation\n\nThere's been intense media coverage of the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs, as well as an exhaustive list of possible reasons the price of Bitcoin has dipped in the aftermath of SEC approval. One possible explanation is related to the concept of tactical asset allocation, which simply refers to the process of reallocating funds among different asset classes to take advantage of short-term market situations.\n\nIn layman's terms, this simply means that money is being shuffled around among different Bitcoin investment products as people search for the best way to get exposure to Bitcoin. The process of doing this, unfortunately, is causing downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nKeep in mind that people have different options when they want to buy Bitcoin now. They can invest in Bitcoin proxy stocks (such as Bitcoin mining companies). They can invest in Bitcoin futures contracts. They can buy futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. They can buy Bitcoin directly in the spot market via a cryptocurrency exchange. And they can invest in the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFor the Bitcoin tactical asset allocation thesis to make sense, you would expect to see certain things. You would expect to see people selling off Bitcoin proxy stocks as they look for more direct exposure via the spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. This has happened. You would expect to see people moving out of the higher-cost futures Bitcoin ETFs into the lower-cost spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. This has happened. And you would expect Bitcoin trading volume on crypto exchanges to fall as people instead buy ETFs. This, too, appears to be happening.\n\nFrom my perspective, this explanation makes a lot of sense if you assume most investors are rational as they search for the best way to invest in a certain asset. Moreover, I find this explanation strangely comforting, because it means that nothing has changed in the grand macro thesis of Bitcoin adoption. It means that there has been no major change in the long-term growth prospects of Bitcoin. The only downside, really, is that less \"new\" money might be flowing into Bitcoin than we expected. Instead, it's just \"recycled\" money from other Bitcoin products.\n\nHistorical evidence from Bitcoin\n\nStill not convinced? Well, let's consider the historical evidence from Bitcoin and similar types of product launches.\n\nOne of the best graphics that I've seen over the past two weeks appeared on CNBC. As Markus Thielen of 10x Research pointed out, the same pattern has occurred with every major launch of Bitcoin-related financial products. A lot of early hype leads to a surge in the price of Bitcoin, followed by a swift downward correction on the actual news.\n\nThis happened with the first Bitcoin futures contracts, which launched in December 2017. It happened with the April 2021 initial public offering (IPO) of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which brought Bitcoin trading to the average investor. It happened with the launch of the Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. And it is now happening with the launch of the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. If you take a trading chart of Bitcoin and highlight these dates, the trend is unmistakable. Peaks follow listings, with dips in their wake. And the long-term price gains continue after a pause.\n\nWhile you could argue that correlation does not imply causation, there does appear to be a strong pattern here, right? It suggests that as soon as there is a new way of investing in Bitcoin, people start reallocating their Bitcoin funds, and that causes a short-term price downturn.\n\nBuy the dip on Bitcoin\n\nLong story short: You should buy the dip. Bitcoin under $40,000 is a no-brainer investment opportunity in my eyes. By my analysis, there is simply no way that a sustained surge in new retail and institutional money into Bitcoin won't help to prop up its price. And if many investors decide to allocate just 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, that's going to provide long-term price support -- and it's easier than ever to do it thanks to the new spot-price ETFs.\n\nThat's why I'm still strongly bullish on Bitcoin. The process of democratizing crypto for the average investor continues, and the spot-price Bitcoin ETFs are a welcome new addition. Yes, it's been messy for the past two weeks, but I'm more convinced than ever that investors need to hold Bitcoin for the long term and learn to embrace its volatility."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Under or Overvalued? What Fundamental Analysis Tells Us - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Is Bitcoin Under or Overvalued? What Fundamental Analysis Tells Us\n\nBitcoin investors face an uncertain future following mixed reactions to the spot ETF approvals on the one hand, and the upcoming block reward halving on the other. Here we use fundamental analysis to determine if Bitcoin is under or overvalued.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a revolution within modern investing, with a set of characteristics distinct from traditional assets. As we venture into valuing Bitcoin we find ourselves in a landscape where the conventional tools of financial analysis encounter uncharted territory. This article delves into the heart of this new frontier, exploring the fundamental analysis of Bitcoin, a digital asset that defies traditional valuation methodologies.\n\nWe aim to determine whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued, using fundamental analysis valuation techniques. It is a particularly pertinent question today, as Bitcoin investors face an uncertain future in between two major bullish events, a spot ETF approval and an upcoming block reward halving.\n\nFundamentally Analyzing Bitcoin\n\nThe goal of fundamental analysis (FA) investment research is to ascertain an asset\u2019s true or inherent value. Intrinsic value is calculated without taking into account an asset\u2019s market value or speculative considerations. Instead, analysts employ different types of modeling tools that focus on factors other than market pricing to arrive at an intrinsic value. Fundamental analysis tries to answer the simple question of \u201cwhat is an asset really worth?\u201d\n\nFundamental analysis looks at both internal and external factors that may impact a company or product\u2019s value. New changes to a company\u2019s flagship product or the health of the global economy, for example, can have an impact on an investment\u2019s value. Importantly, these elements may have an impact on an asset\u2019s intrinsic worth before they have an impact on its market value.\n\nUsing fundamental research, investors can be alerted to purchase assets when they are undervalued and similarly, sell them when their intrinsic value exceeds their market price (overvalued).\n\nThe investment philosophy at play is that assets will inevitably move towards a fair market value. This means that there may be a trading opportunity if the fundamental analysis shows that an asset\u2019s intrinsic worth differs from its market value. In this report we explore 5 key fundamental indicators and whether they suggest Bitcoin is currently over or undervalued.\n\nFundamental analysis of Bitcoin is not straightforward\n\nFundamental analysis has been used for decades in the traditional share market, but the challenges of using fundamental analysis for cryptographic assets are distinct. Due to the cryptographic asset class\u2019s numerous distinctive qualities, it cannot be evaluated using the same framework as conventional enterprises or commodities. As detailed in this article, tools do exist, but given the nascent nature of the sector, each of them has its proponents and detractors. For potential investors, this offers both an opportunity and a challenge.\n\nThe various crypto assets have a wide range of uses and a useful reference overview is provided by Brave New Coin\u2019s General Taxonomy Of Cryptographic Assets. Since Bitcoin (BTC) assets don\u2019t produce cash flows, it is difficult to evaluate them using typical stock investment indicators, such as future cash flow.\n\nSome protocol tokens may be evaluated using a modified version of a conventional fundamental analysis model such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), which provides holders and token stakers a percentage of platform revenue. A DCF model might be used to evaluate a token like the LOOKS token, for example, which gives token holders 100 percent of the trading fees on the LooksRare trading platform.\n\nBitcoin is not unique in that its intrinsic value cannot be determined based on its cash flows. Hard assets, such as Gold and Silver, are comparable, and this class of assets needs to be evaluated depending on where the asset\u2019s price may be headed in the future. The availability of the asset \u2013 and the demand for it \u2013 will determine this.\n\nAlthough none are perfect, several rational and straightforward models have been developed to predict changes in Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value. They have all been used to give helpful signals to traders who lean towards a fundamental approach to investing.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Supply-based value indicators\n\nThe circulating supply of BTC can be determined quite easily. The predetermined, finite, and fixed monetary policy of the network means future supply is also clearly defined. This means assessing the intrinsic value of the Bitcoin network though its supply is an appealing option.\n\n1. Stock-to-flow\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s most popular valuation models, stock-to-flow (S2F), is focused almost exclusively on supply metrics. Stock-to-flow is a measure of how much new supply of an asset is being created over time (flow), relative to the existing supply (stock).\n\nIt measures how many years, at the current production rate, for production to achieve the current stock of an asset. The higher this number is, the higher the expected price. For instance, a commodity where the current stock takes 100 years to produce, S2F suggests, is more valuable than a commodity where the current stock only takes 20 years to produce.\n\nThe more difficult it is to produce a commodity and the less of it there is, the more inherently scarce it becomes and the more its assumed value rises. Stock-to-flow was around before Bitcoin. It was a model used to determine the intrinsic value of mined hard assets like gold and silver.\n\nThe stock-to-flow model only works for Bitcoin because of its scarcity. Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity means it has value as money. Computer scientist Nick Szabo says scarcity creates \u201cunforgeable costliness\u201d and this in itself, creates intrinsic value for an asset. It should mean that as the supply of Bitcoin tightens and becomes more scarce, then it becomes more valuable.\n\nBitcoin cannot be copied, duplicated, pirated, or forged. Bitcoin comes packaged in blocks of ~500 transactions that contain all other necessary information required to secure the network.\n\nBlocks are 1MB and are generated roughly every 10 minutes. The Bitcoin network has been generating blocks uninterrupted since its inception. When the network was first launched on the 3rd of January 2009, as a reward for validating transactions and publishing blocks to the Bitcoin ledger, miners earned 50 Bitcoins (BTC). This 50 BTC is freshly minted supply. New Bitcoin will continue to be minted until a pre-determined final supply of 21 million is reached.\n\nBitcoin was built with a pre-planned deflationary monetary policy. Every 210,000 blocks a halving occurs. The halving cuts the miner\u2019s Bitcoin reward in half, reducing the rate at which new BTC supply is issued.\n\nThe halving events will keep occurring until no new BTC is issued to miners. Bitcoin can be fractioned to a maximum of 8 decimals, so miner rewards can reduce to 0 BTC. This should be around the 33rd halving in the year 2140 when the 21 millionth BTC will come into existence and the final total supply will be reached.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s position as a verifiable scarce asset, with some demand, means that as it becomes more difficult to acquire with each new halving, its value increases. This deflationary mechanism has significant implications for BTC\u2019s stock-to-flow model, given the \u2018flow\u2019 or production rate of the asset halves every 4 years.\n\nThe conceptualizer of the Bitcoin for stock-to-flow model, a pseudonymous analyst who goes by PlanB, has stated in the past that his model may not work for other proof-of-work altcoins like Litecoin because they do not have the same \u2018unforgeable costliness\u2019 that Bitcoin does.\n\nHow To Calculate Bitcoin Stock-to-flow\n\nS/F=Stock/Flow\n\nThe stock-to-flow of an asset is equal to the total current available stock of an asset divided by the yearly production. There are presently around ~19,400,000 BTC in existence as circulating supply, and about 328500 new bitcoins are created each year. There may be some debate about the exact value of circulating supply given factors such as lost Bitcoin, or coins that have never moved from Satoshi\u2019s wallet, but because of the uncertainty surrounding these factors, we internalize their impact on circulating supply.\n\n19,600,000 \\ 328500= 59.7\n\nThis means that it would take around 59 years of current BTC production to produce the current stock of Bitcoin. What is important to remember with BTC, is that up until the last halving, 1,800 new BTC was produced each day and 657,000 per year. It had a significantly lower stock-to-flow number before the last halving and was theoretically less valuable than it is now based on stock-to-flow logic.\n\nThe above chart displays how Bitcoin\u2019s dynamic S2F drives up the intrinsic value of Bitcoin over time. Every four years as indicated by the vertical dotted red line, the emission rate of Bitcoin halves. The total stock of Bitcoin is fixed but because the production of BTC slows every 4 years, its scarcity, potential purchasing power, and intrinsic value grows. Based on a 463 day variation, the stock-to-flow model has the current intrinsic value of BTC at ~US$115,83. This is well above the current US$ value of BTC \u2014 ~US$39,912.\n\nThis suggests that BTC is significantly undervalued and offers an excellent buy proposition at its current price. Interestingly, the S2F model of Bitcoin predicts that after the next two halvings, by which Bitcoin\u2019s production rate would have quartered, the intrinsic value of BTC will be above ~US$508,000.\n\nValuing Bitcoin Based on Demand\n\nSupply-based valuation models are imperfect because they don\u2019t consider the demand. This is perhaps a larger determinant of price and value.\n\nWhat drives the demand for Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was originally designed to be a digital cash alternative that acted as a decentralized alternative to central bank-controlled fiat money. It can and has been used as a fiat money alternative.\n\nBitcoin does not need the backing of a government or a banking system to function. It is operated by a decentralized network of independent nodes that coordinate, but do not collude, to manage the network. The network is trustless, it does not need a monetary authority like a central bank to act as a counterparty to risk and be a lender of last resort if its ecosystem fails.\n\nIt is also borderless and almost impossible to counterfeit. Bitcoin may be counterfeited through a double-spend attack but the likelihood of an attack like this being successful is extremely low.\n\n2. Network Value to Transactions Ratio (NVT)\n\nA key indicator for evaluating the correlation between market cap and transfer volume is the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio. Numerous commentators, including Willy Woo, the model\u2019s developer, compare NVT to the price-to-earnings (PE) model, which is used to determine the worth of company stocks in conventional markets.\n\nNVT is one of the earliest developed on-chain valuation models and brings together the utility of Bitcoin and its value. Bitcoin was primarily built to be a network that enables payment and settlements. This is its characteristic that should drive intrinsic value outside of speculation. On-chain transaction volume (value of transactions and not the number of transactions) measures how much Bitcoin is being used as a settlement layer for payments by whales or everyday users in developing countries.\n\nWhen combined with market cap, it offers a useful tool to determine whether there may be an active divergence between the intrinsic value and market value of BTC.\n\nThe above chart compares the Bitcoin NVT signal, a modified version of NVT, with its price. The NVT signal is calculated as:\n\nNVTS = Network Value90 day MA of daily transaction\n\nWhere market cap is used as a proxy for market value and MA means moving average. The usage of moving averages helps to create a smooth line that adjusts for very short term jumps in transaction activity. The blue line above, adjusted NVTS is a further extrapolation that is designed to compensate for upward drift in the NVT signal. The drift is caused by investors moving Bitcoin volume off-chain and then handling it there, unseen and unrecorded by the blockchain.\n\nThe adjusted NVTS displays how many standard deviations NVTS is above or below its historical norm. The historical norm is the two-year moving average of NVTS, the standard deviation calculation uses 2-year sampling. NVTS offers a simple, easy-to-read signal. When the NVTS is high and rising, the signal is bearish and indicates declining fundamentals. Market cap is rising faster than transaction volume suggesting that the market is overvaluing BTC and a correction may be incoming.\n\nThe simplest way to read the NVTS is via its upper bound and lower bound bands. When NVTS has historically been close to its upper bound band, this has signaled price bearishness. NVTS suggests when it is around this point, the market cap of Bitcoin, or its extrinsic value, is high in comparison to its intrinsic value, the number of transactions on the network.\n\nCurrently, the NVTS signal is close to its upper bound suggesting that Bitcoin is overvalued and may be set for a price reversal.\n\n3. Thermocap Multiple\n\nThermocap is an indirect metric that measures the intrinsic value of Bitcoin based on how much miners are being paid. The model has been developed by an anonymous analyst named GeertJanCap.\n\nThe metric measures the implied value paid to Bitcoin miners who are in charge of validating transactions and securing the network. Miners are the workhorses of the network and the thermocap measures how much they earn for their services, they are the entrepreneurs of Bitcoin. Price and market cap measure the investor side of Bitcoin\u2014the investors, savers, and speculators. Thermocap may be considered equivalent to a fundamental metric used in traditional finance valuations\u2014 Enterprise value-to-earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, or EV-to-EBITDA.\n\nThe thermocap of Bitcoin is calculated by taking the miner reward and transaction for each block and multiplying it by the BTC price at the time the new Bitcoin was minted.\n\nThe thermocap multiple used in the chart below is a slight variation of this calculation that takes the Bitcoin price on a given day and divides it by the total historical block subsidy.\n\nThe total historical block subsidy is calculated by taking the number of Bitcoins mined each day and multiplying them by the end-of-day price on that day. The final value is then calculated by adding together the daily subsidies for every previous day before the present day.\n\nThere are some interesting things the thermocap multiple can tell us about the price. When it is high and blowing off it likely means that miners are being paid too much, users are perhaps overvaluing their services, and a pullback of both intrinsic and market value is intuitively set to occur. A low thermocap suggests that miners are being paid too little and a mean reversion is set to occur.\n\nCurrently, the Thermocap appears to be middling. It sits currently around the 75 level, which is well below the heights between 200-and-500 it has hit in the past. This suggests that there is more room to pay miners in the form of more expensive BTC.\n\n4. Market Cap/Realized Cap (MVRV)\n\nWe can also measure a fair value for Bitcoin based on investor behavior using metrics like Market Cap/Realized Cap (MVRV). These metrics view Bitcoin as an asset that is likely to be sold cyclicly and that size of profit, more than utility, determines whether BTC is bought or sold.\n\nThe MVRV was developed by analysts Murad Mahmudov and David Puell, and soon after Realized Cap was developed by Nic Carter and Antoine Le Calvez of the Coinmetrics team. Market Cap in the context of the cryptocurrency space is the total number of coins that have been mined or are in circulation multiplied by the price of a single coin.\n\nRealized Cap is a variation of Market Cap, instead of multiplying every coin by the current market price of BTC, it multiplies each coin based on the price it last moved. Accurately knowing the price of a coin when it last moved is possible because of Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO technology.\n\nThe realized cap is a more accurate reflection of the network\u2019s value than market cap because it reduces the impact of lost or dormant coins. If coins are moved more recently at a price higher or lower than when it was last moved then this change in the value of the realized cap.\n\nGiven that realized cap is the price of coins when they last moved, it is often considered a useful proxy for value stored on the network. When Realized Cap is combined with other metrics like Market Cap it can be an indicator to determine whether BTC is over or underpriced. If the market value is higher than the value stored on the network then this may signal a selling opportunity. Vice Versa if the stored value of the network is higher than the market value.\n\nMVRV is a tool to indicate the aggregate Bitcoin investor behavior and can be a leading indicator to determine whether investors will sell or buy based on the difference in the current market price from the cost that investors paid for their Bitcoin.\n\nWhen the MVRV value is very high, this means that the market price of BTC is much higher than what the aggregate investor has paid for it. This suggests that in the near future, a sell-off may be coming as investors look to realize profits. Vice versa when MVRV is low, investors are likely hoping to hold and wait for profits.\n\nIn the past, blow-off tops for the MVRV have preceded price drops of BTC and have been useful tools for identifying selling opportunities. Likewise, MVRV hitting floors and the trough of downtrends has often worked as a buy signal. It should be noted that the tops of MVRV tend to be much more extreme than the bottoms.\n\nLike many other indicators mentioned in the article, the signal being sent by the MVRV is neither bullish nor bearish. It is middling, in between the \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018sell\u2019 zones indicated in green and red. This suggests that there is room for the price of Bitcoin to drop or fall.\n\n5. Mayer Multiple\n\nBitcoin pioneer Trace Mayer, developed the straightforward Mayer Multiple indicator for which the 200-day moving average is used to compare the current Bitcoin price to a long-term historical price range for BTC. The Mayer Multiple, like many other indicators, reveals Bitcoin as being potentially under or oversold in the context of longer time frames.\n\nAn indicator called a moving average (MA) averages out the value of any quantity over a predetermined amount of time. The \u201cmoving\u201d aspect of the average refers to how frequently it is updated depending on fresh pricing information received. Any time period can be used to calculate a moving average. Historically, the 200-day MA has been a well-liked time frame in crypto for identifying the bull and bear cycles in the market.\n\n\n\nThe Mayer multiple is calculated by dividing the current price of BTC by the average price of BTC over the last 200 days. Historically, a cycle bottom is strongly indicated by the Mayer multiple dipping below or very near 0.5. A cycle top is indicated by a Mayer Multiple value of 2.3. Currently, the Mayer Multiple sits at 1.24 and is trending downwards. This is another middling value suggesting that the price of BTC has room to go up or down.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we conclude our exploration into the fundamental analysis of Bitcoin, it becomes evident that this digital asset demands a nuanced approach, one that accommodates its unique characteristics and the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market. The models and indicators we\u2019ve discussed \u2013 Stock-to-Flow, Network Value to Transactions Ratio, Thermocap, Market Cap/Realized Cap, and Mayer Multiple \u2013 each provide a lens through which we can discern facets of Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value. However, they also underscore the complexities and uncertainties inherent in this space.\n\nInvestors venturing into this domain must navigate with caution, armed with research, a robust investment strategy, and a keen awareness of the market\u2019s volatility. Ultimately, the fundamental analysis of Bitcoin is not just a quest to ascertain its intrinsic value but also a testament to the innovative spirit that characterizes the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nMost fundamental indicators send a broadly middling signal, neither bullish nor bearish. The stock-to-flow indicator, however, sends a strong bullish, buy signal suggesting Bitcoin is undervalued. The NVTS, however, sends a bearish signal indicating that Bitcoin is overvalued. The mixed signals make it difficult to develop a bitcoin strategy based on fundamentals. Bitcoin traders may be better off using Technical Analysis (TA) or taking a swing trading approach based on news events. Or, they can choose to invest based on signals from their preferred fundamental indicator."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs cause concerns for financial advisors - Financial Planning",
        "content": "Brett Bernstein has a simple question for clients who come to him with curiosity about bitcoin and other digital assets .\n\n\"If you were to go with me to Las Vegas for the weekend, how much would you be willing to put on one number and one color at the roulette wheel?\" said the CEO and co-founder of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nWith the Securities and Exchange Commission's historic approval on Jan. 10 of 11 exchange-traded funds tracking the value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, Bernstein and other advisors are likely to hear only more questions about the possible benefits and downsides of digital assets.\n\n\n\nLet's have some fund\n\nFor many advisors, exchanged-traded funds are one of their clients' best friends. ETFs tracking broad market indexes like the S&P 500 offer investors exposure to a vast array of stocks. And because the funds are bought and sold on public exchanges just like equities and bonds, they also make it easy for clients to pull money out as needed.\n\nBut the new bitcoin ETFs are a different animal . Rather than tracking all the stocks in a particular index, they offer ownership in only one particular asset: bitcoin. And bitcoin has proved to be fairly volatile.\n\nThe most widely known cryptocurrency now trades at around $40,000 and, in the past three or so years, has seen its price rise as high as $65,000 and fall below $12,000. Its value increased by 160% in 2023 amid widespread expectation that the SEC would approve bitcoin ETFs only to fall slowly in recent weeks.\n\nSuch fluctuation is reason enough for many advisors to be skeptical. Bernstein said he does not rule out cryptocurrencies, especially for clients who have enough money to shoulder losses and enough appetite for risk to try something outside the norm.\n\nBut he does caution them to not put down anything they can't afford to lose. The new ETFs may have made it easier to invest in bitcoin, Bernstein said, \"but we as a firm have not changed.\"\n\n\"It's still a very speculative investment,\" he added. \"And I think it's inappropriate for a lot of clients.\"\n\n\n\nFlowing in\n\nThe 11 new bitcoin ETFs have proved popular to investors, drawing in about $4 billion within a week of their approval. Lori Van Dusen , the CEO and founder of LVW Advisors in Rochester, New York, said her clients have taken note of the new opportunity.\n\nShe said even some of the large and mid-sized institutional investors her firm works with have begun to ask about digital assets, whereas in the past they had \"zero interest in even talking about this.\" Van Dusen said some of her clients \u2014 who tend to be high net worth and ultrahigh net worth \u2014 like to buy gold as a hedge against the possibility that the U.S. dollar will plummet in value amid ballooning federal deficits.\n\nSome now think bitcoin and similar assets can serve a similar purpose. Others, Van Dusen said, look at cryptocurrencies as offering them an opportunity to be a venture investor supporting one of the next great leaps in technological innovation.\n\nAn advisors' chief responsibility in all of this, she said, is to help clients gauge how much they can afford to put into crypto with the understanding that \"you could lose everything.\"\n\nAs a rule of thumb, Van Dusen said she thinks no investor should have more than 5% of a portfolio in digital assets, a figure that of course should be adjusted down depending on individual circumstances. Van Dusen said she herself has invested in bitcoin \u2014 partly as a hedge against the U.S. dollar \u2014 and has \"done pretty well.\"\n\n\n\nRegulatory mixed blessing\n\nAlthough the funds have received the government's official sanction, many regulators still view them with skepticism. SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler backed approval for the ETFs only after his initial attempt at blocking them was swatted down by a lawsuit . In giving them funds the greenlight, he cautioned that bitcoin is a \"speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\"\n\nRegulators have also been urging financial advisors to take care in their discussions of bitcoin and other digital assets with clients. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , the brokerage industry's self-regulator, released a report on Tuesday suggesting that firms are violating its communications rules in a good deal of what they tell investors about crypto.\n\nLooking at 500 communications that firms had with their clients on digital assets and similar topics, FINRA discovered possible violations in 70% of them. Among other red flags, some brokerages were found to be implying the crypto assets can act like cash or cash equivalents.\n\nAlmost all advisors agree that caution is due with digital assets. But some take a slightly more favorable view than others.\n\n\n\nMany investors already have it\n\nRic Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals , or DACFP, said 40% U.S. adults already own bitcoin and thus are likely to have taken some notice of the SEC's approval of bitcoin ETFs. Financial planners, he said, should jump on the opportunity to explain to investors what these new funds mean.\n\nHe said DACFP, which offers financial planners an online certificate in blockchain and digital assets, has seen a sharp increase in the number of advisors who are reaching out for help understanding bitcoin ETFs. In response, it released an Advisor Toolkit offering answers to some of the more commonly asked questions.\n\nIn keeping with his belief that more investors could benefit from putting money in digital assets, Edelman cheered the arrival of bitcoin ETFs. Giving the usual caveat about every investor's circumstances being different, Edelman said, \"Bitcoin is still a very risky investment, so a 1% to 5% allocation would not interfere with a client's ability to retire in financial comfort if it were to become worthless. Meanwhile, a 1% to 5% allocation can materially improve the overall return of the portfolio if bitcoin performs as well as many predict.\"\n\n\n\nYou can always walk away\n\nOthers remain skeptical. Ryan Kenny, a director and portfolio manager at Crestwood Advisors in Boston , said it's incumbent upon him to listen to his clients' investing ideas and try to accommodate them within reason. That's true even if they're considering a risky asset like bitcoin.\n\nKenny agreed that anyone committing part of a portfolio to digital assets should take care to keep the allocation small. Even then, his preference is to guide clients to long-term investments in well-understood assets like quality stocks and bonds.\n\nThe trouble with cryptocurrencies, he said, is not only in their volatility.\n\n\"It doesn't produce earnings or dividends, making it difficult to assign any intrinsic value to it,\" he said. \"Those things combined don't line up with our investment philosophy.\"\n\nBernstein of XML Financial Group said advisors of course can't be forced into doing something that they firmly believe would go against their clients' best interest. If an investor insists on putting an unreasonably large sum of money into cryptocurrencies or other unusually risky assets, sometimes the best response is to walk away.\n\n\"If someone comes to me and says, 'I want you to put 65% of my portfolio into bitcoin,' I'm going to say, 'I think you are committing financial malpractice and potentially financial suicidal,'\" Bernstein said. \"And if they insist, I'm going to say they need to take their business elsewhere, because I have a responsibility not to allow clients to do something that would potentially cause them serious harm.\""

Just ignore them, one Wall Street legend says.\n\n\"That's useless, and it's the wrong way to think about investing,\" Burton Malkiel told Business Insider this week. \"Nobody knows what the market's going to do in the short term.\"\n\n\"Don't try to time the market \u2014 you can't do it and you're more likely to get it wrong than right,\" he continued. \"And don't think you can be a stock picker this year, it never works. You're much better off being an index investor.\"\n\nMalkiel is the chief investment officer of investment platform Wealthfront, a professor emeritus of economics at Princeton University, and the author of \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\" He spoke ahead of publishing a letter to Wealthfront investors on Thursday that trumpeted the power of dollar-cost averaging, low-cost index funds, portfolio diversification and rebalancing, risk management, and tax-loss harvesting for everyday people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren Buffett and Jack Bogle, who Malkiel hailed as \"two of my heroes,\" have offered similar advice. The legendary stock picker has said that almost everyone should steadily invest in a S&P 500 tracker fund over the course of decades. Meanwhile, Vanguard's founder has underscored the danger of fees by saying that \"in investing, you get what you don't pay for.\"\n\nBack in 2020, Malkiel rang the alarm on the day-trading boom as the antithesis of that approach. In the interview this week, he called out the same kind of mindless speculation on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"Absolutely that still is in my view a real danger,\" he said. \"Most people are going to lose their shirts.\"\n\nMalkiel singled out bitcoin as especially worrisome, given its volatility and lack of utility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is not a useful currency, its only uses are to hide things from the government and for ransomware,\" Malkiel said. \"I don't want to go in and buy my Starbucks coffee in the morning with bitcoin which might be worth $45,000 one day and $40,000 the next.\"\n\nThe former Vanguard director, dean of Yale's management school, and White House economic advisor also weighed in on the stock market.\n\n\"There's no question about the fact that valuations are high,\" he said, although he noted that price-to-earnings multiples on the hottest technology stocks are still a fraction as high as during the dot-com bubble.\n\nStill, he warned that lofty prices would likely weigh on portfolio performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When valuations are above average, long-run returns are going to be somewhat lower\" than their roughly 10% annual average over the last century, he said. \"There's probably somewhat greater optimism about returns than there should be. People ought to be very modest in their expectations.\"\n\nAs for the economy, Malkiel emphasized the futility of trying to call the next downturn.\n\n\"Not only do I think you can't predict the stock market, but neither the market, the Fed board of governors, or economists can tell you if we're gonna have the recession,\" he said. \"I don't have any idea, and neither does anybody else.\"\n\nMalkiel concluded by reiterating the core message of his letter: \"Regular saving, even for people of very modest means, can get you a wonderful retirement portfolio,\" he said. \"The American dream is not over.\""

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars More Than 3,000%, According to This Wall Street CEO - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the wake of the landmark approval of 11 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Cathie Wood, chief executive officer of Ark Invest, once again made headlines with her ambitious price target for Bitcoin (BTC -4.22%).\n\nDoubling down on her claim that Bitcoin could soar to a price of $1.5 million by 2030, Wood emphasized in an interview with CNBC that the approval of the ETFs only increases the chances of the cryptocurrency reaching her lofty estimates.\n\nHer remarks might seem overly optimistic, but they aren't baseless. Citing multiple factors from her firm's annual Big Ideas report, the case for a seven-figure Bitcoin isn't as crazy it seems. Here's why Wood and her team think its future is so bright.\n\nThe institutions are knocking on Bitcoin's door\n\nFor years, there was anticipation that deep-pocketed institutional investors would enter the Bitcoin market. Aside from a few companies adding the cryptocurrency to balance sheets, this assumption remained nothing more than speculation. But with the launch of several new Bitcoin ETFs, this all changes.\n\nWithout the ETFs, there were simply too many barriers discouraging companies from holding Bitcoin. Complications related to the intricacies of compliance, procurement, and general legalities all posed significant obstacles.\n\nBut now, as Wood sees it, a legitimate tipping point of institutional adoption is here. With several Bitcoin ETFs trading on the stock market, there is an accessible and easy on-ramp for exposure. With increased access, the crypto's finite supply will come under even greater pressure.\n\nMore so than any other development, Wood and her team believe institutional adoption will be the single greatest catalyst for price appreciation as Wall Street's biggest names accept Bitcoin as the leader among a burgeoning asset class.\n\nThese traditional financial juggernauts have significant capital at their disposal -- literally trillions of dollars. Should just 1% trickle into Bitcoin, Wood says it will result in enormous price appreciation for it.\n\nA flight to quality\n\nWhile this is all still evolving, Wood and her team expect the market will move to more resilient and durable assets like Bitcoin in a flight to quality. Performance lapses and a lack of stability in existing financial structures are becoming more evident, and Bitcoin will benefit from this due to its decentralized and secure nature.\n\nAn example of this was seen in the banking crisis of 2023. Over the course of five days in March 2023, several midsize U.S. banks failed. In the wake of these collapses, Bitcoin surged more than 35% as investors flocked to the cryptocurrency as a way to mitigate contagion from trickling into portfolios.\n\nAnother example is persistent inflation. Wood thinks that as fiat currencies around the world continue to be debased, Bitcoin's role as a way to preserve purchasing power will gain credence. For decades, investors had no other option than to play the game of government-backed currencies, but now things have changed.\n\nBorn out of the Great Recession, Bitcoin returns financial sovereignty to individuals rather than entrusting it to banks or governments engaging in risky and irresponsible financial practices. As this realization becomes clearer, Wood foresees Bitcoin's prominence as a safe haven gaining credence in the coming years.\n\nHere for the long haul\n\nLast but not least is the continued expansion and resilience of Bitcoin's blockchain. Consider that for the past 15 years, the crypto has operated without a single entity overseeing its day-to-day functioning, without skipping a beat. It is an accomplishment nothing short of remarkable. Even better, though, it is growing stronger and more capable by the day.\n\nWood pointed out a handful of metrics that back up just how impressive this feat is. Take transactions, for example. Bitcoin is currently closing in on its one-billionth transaction. And in 2023, the network facilitated more transactions than Visa.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Bitcoin's security continues to increase. Its hash rate, a metric that measures computing power, is currently at an all-time high and has been on an upward trajectory for most of its existence. Today, Bitcoin is estimated to be 500 times more powerful than the world's most advanced supercomputer.\n\nHow Bitcoin hits the seven-figure mark\n\nEach of these aspects individually hold the potential to add to Bitcoin's journey of price appreciation. But Wood says a confluence of forces could produce an effect that is orders of magnitude larger than anything in Bitcoin's history.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs was just the first domino to fall and should kick off a series of catalysts over the coming years. With Wall Street's acceptance of the cryptocurrency, Wood says that it will take center stage among the financial and political elites. Naturally, general interest from the public will likely grow, and recognition of the crypto's unique qualities will become more common.\n\nAdd it all up, and you have Cathie Wood's expectation that we are witnessing something akin to the early days of the internet. Considering just how influential and monumental the internet proved to be, a $1.5 million Bitcoin doesn't sound like such a long shot."

Its price fluctuations have been a source of fascination, concern, and intense speculation. What are the dynamics impacting the price of Bitcoin, and how can investors best navigate this complex landscape?\n\nThe Good: Explosive Growth and Monumental Wealth Creation\n\nIn its relatively short existence, Bitcoin has demonstrated a capacity for staggering financial returns unrivaled by traditional investment vehicles. This phenomenon has not only created substantial wealth for early adopters but also continues to attract a broad spectrum of investors, lured by the prospect of potentially outsized gains.\n\nStrategies to Optimize Bitcoin's Potential:\n\nEmbracing a Long-Haul Investment Philosophy : Many investors adopt a buy-and-hold strategy with Bitcoin, weathering short-term fluctuations with a focus on long-term value appreciation.

Incorporating Bitcoin into diverse portfolios: Savvy investors often use Bitcoin to diversify their investment portfolios, leveraging its low correlation with traditional financial assets. However, caution is advised to prevent overexposure to the asset's inherent volatility.\n\nThe Bad: Unpredictable Swings in Bitcoin's Market Value\n\nBitcoin's market price is characterized by extreme fluctuations, making it a high-risk investment option.

        "title": "Crypto may have become boring, but it still isn't legit - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt was easy to poke fun at crypto back in late 2022. The market had tanked by about two-thirds in the space of a year; many of the industry\u2019s biggest companies and coins had collapsed into oblivion, their flagrant practices exposed; and the bubble that had driven receipts for pixelated images of apes (remember NFTs?) to sell for millions of dollars had burst. Longtime critics like me were being encouraged to take virtual victory laps, while the crypto crew had egg, clearly, all over their laser-eyed faces.\n\nJust over a year later, however, poking fun might seem less straightforward. Crypto prices have recovered significantly, with the market valuation having roughly doubled over the past twelve months. Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of 11 spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs), giving investors exposure to the cryptocurrency via regulated products that can be bought and sold like stocks, and are issued by some of the best-established asset managers. Meanwhile, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world and one of those offering a bitcoin ETF, has become something of bitcoin evangelist, calling it \u201can asset class that protects you\u201d.\n\nIs it time for the likes of me to admit we were wrong? Was the approval of the ETFs a game-changer? Is crypto now kind of . . . legit?\n\nThe hyperbole has come in thick and fast, certainly. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest that [the SEC\u2019s approval] may be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years,\u201d Michael Saylor, executive chair of software-company-turned-crypto hoarder MicroStrategy, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe significance of this moment cannot be overstated,\u201d gushed Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of crypto firm Ripple on X. \u201cToday\u2019s news is further legitimisation of crypto as an asset class,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd yet despite these lofty proclamations, and the fact that this was heralded as a landmark event by both the crypto and mainstream press, what has happened is distinctly dull. The only tiny glimmer of excitement came when the SEC\u2019s X account was compromised, meaning the ETFs\u2019 approval was announced ahead of time. We haven\u2019t suddenly found out the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. There is no newfangled initialised asset class on offer that can magic up money out of thin air (before NFTs, you might remember ICOs, STOs, and IEOs).\n\nNo, all that happened is that crypto has gone from being an exciting and rebellious alternative to traditional finance, a way of \u201cbeing your own bank\u201d, to simply providing a means for regular investors to diversify their portfolios and for asset managers to eke out a bit of extra revenue.\n\nCrypto in 2024 is, in other words, rather boring. But boring does not equal legitimate, as SEC chair Gary Gensler himself pointed out when the announcement was made. The commission\u2019s approval of the bitcoin ETFs was not an endorsement of bitcoin or crypto more widely, but rather the result of a court ruling that found the SEC\u2019s long-standing opposition to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 on the grounds they could be subject to fraud and manipulation \u2014 was arbitrary.\n\nIn a statement, Gensler said that \u201cthough we\u2019re merit neutral, I\u2019d note that . . . bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing\u201d.\n\nFor context, some of the other ETFs that have been approved by the SEC include the \u201cGod Bless America\u201d ETF (ticker: \u201c$YALL\u201d), an anti-woke \u201cinvestment for God-fearing, flag-saving conservatives\u201d; the \u201cInverse Cramer\u201d ETF (SJIM) that aims to invest in the opposite of whatever TV personality Jim Cramer recommends; and a \u201cVICE\u201d ETF (VICE) that invests in \u201cvice-related business activities\u201d.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not as if boring crypto is all there is now. For anyone who feels bereft of the non-boring variety, there is still plenty of that. For instance, the online pastor charged with civil fraud earlier this month after he and his wife created and sold a cryptocurrency to Christians, telling them God had told him directly they would get rich if they bought it. He has since said it\u2019s possible he \u201cmisheard God\u201d, and has also defended himself by saying that although it\u2019s true that he and his wife pocketed $1.3mn, some of that was spent on a \u201chome remodel that the Lord told us to do\u201d.\n\nThe truth is that, whether the crypto is encased in a nice regulated wrapper and sold to you by BlackRock, or whether you buy it from a pastor who says that the Lord told him to make the sale, there is still no there there. So while it might be more difficult these days, I will continue doing what I consider to be God\u2019s real work: taking the mickey out of it.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com"

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight Banmeet Singh, 40, who was extradited from the United Kingdom in March 2023, pleaded guilty to money laundering and another charge Friday at a federal courthouse in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio said it is believed to be the \u201clargest single cryptocurrency financial seizure in DEA history.\u201d\n\nThe cryptocurrency was worth at least $150 million at seizure, officials said. According to the plea agreement, Singh is forfeiting more than 8,100 bitcoin.The price of bitcoin fluctuates, and the amount being forfeited was more than $340 million Friday at 2 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingh is accused of using dark-web sites to sell heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, LSD, MDMA, Xanax and Tramadol to customers in cities across the United States between 2012 and 2017. Customers paid with bitcoin, MoneyGram, PayPal or cash, according to court records, and Singh would then arrange shipments of the drugs to the United States through mail carriers or package delivery services.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nSingh was one of eight members of the ring convicted in the United States, DEA Special Agent in Charge Orville O. Greene, whose field office covers Ohio and Michigan, said at a news conference Friday.\n\nHe used dark-web marketplaces including Silk Road, Alpha Bay, Hansa and Dream Market, according to the plea agreement unsealed Thursday.\n\nSingh, an Indian national living in England, was indicted in Ohio in 2018 and arrested the following year. He was not extradited to the United States until last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plea agreement states that Singh would plead guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. He is expected to be sentenced to eight years in prison, though a judge will ultimately have to approve the terms of the deal. No sentencing date has been set.\n\nHis attorneys, David Thomas and Paul D. Petruzzi, declined to comment.\n\nNow shuttered, Silk Road was a notorious marketplace for illicit drugs. Earlier this month, judges sentenced a Maryland father and son \u2014 who sold drugs on Silk Road and similar marketplaces under the screen name XanaxMan \u2014 to prison on money laundering charges. They forfeited nearly 3,000 bitcoin. In another case tied to the marketplace, the Justice Department in 2022 announced it seized cryptocurrency stolen from Silk Road worth $3.36 billion.\n\nAlso in 2022, the Justice Department announced it seized bitcoin worth more than $3.6 billion that had been stolen from the Bitfinex exchange. A married couple from New York later pleaded guilty to money laundering in the case."

At the time, BTC\u2019s price was around $36,000.\n\nSince the first reported BTC balance on Feb. 8, 2021, Tesla\u2019s stock price is down roughly 40% against Bitcoin, specifically:\n\nTSLA vs. BTC: -40.1%\n\nBTC vs. USD: +7.39%\n\nTSLA vs. USD: -35.7%\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart ft.

Then, in the second quarter of 2022, the company sold approximately 75% of its Bitcoin reserves. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted, these sales intended to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity and to bolster Tesla\u2019s balance sheet during uncertain financial periods.\n\nHad Tesla retained its entire Bitcoin investment, the company could have seen a hypothetical profit of over $300 million, considering the current Bitcoin value of approximately $41,500.\n\nNonetheless, the company\u2019s remaining Bitcoin holdings, estimated at around 9,720 BTC, have remained steady in recent quarters, reflecting a more conservative approach in what traders anticipate to be a bullish year for Bitcoin.\n\nTesla still holds 9,720 #Bitcoin worth $385m and did not sell anyone Q4, 2023. pic.twitter.com/lFFBy6v9I4 \u2014 Radar (@RadarHits) January 25, 2024\n\nTesla may not sell the remaining Bitcoin\n\nInterestingly, Tesla\u2019s previous Bitcoin sales appeared in the quarters reporting weaker free cash flows. It is the cash that a company generates after spending the money required to maintain or grow its business operations.\n\nFor example, in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla\u2019s sale of Bitcoin, valued at $272 million, constituted a staggering 93% of the company\u2019s free cash flows during that period.\n\nTesla free cash flows performance by quarter.

He may not need to employ the same strategy now, however, given Tesla\u2019s increasing free cash flows throughout 2023.\n\nIn Q4, 2023, for example, Tesla\u2019s free cash flow was strong at $2.1 billion, contributing to a total of $4.4 billion for the year.\n\n$TSLA Tesla Q4 FY23:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Revenue +3% Y/Y to $25.2B ($0.6B miss).\n\n\u2022 Gross margin 18% (-6pp Y/Y).\n\n\u2022 Operating margin 8% (-8pp Y/Y).\n\n\u2022 Capex +24% Y/Y to $2.3B.\n\n\u2022 Free cash flow +45% Y/Y to $2.0B.\n\n\u2022 Non-GAAP EPS $0.71 ($0.03 miss).\n\n\u2022 Deliveries +20% Y/Y to 485K.\n\n\u2022 FY24: Volume\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pnOzZkCAde \u2014 App Economy Insights (@EconomyApp) January 24, 2024\n\nNumerous analysts forecast a rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value in 2024, attributing their optimism to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States and the anticipated impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as key drivers behind their predictions.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has risen over 4% in the past 24 hours, buoying the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis price increase has led some investors to speculate that Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), the presale Stake-to-Mine project, could ride Bitcoin\u2019s coattails as it gears up for exchange listings soon.\n\nBitcoin Breaks Crucial $40k Barrier Amid Growing Bullishness\n\nBitcoin is moving again, with the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency pushing past the crucial $40,000 resistance level.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,050, the same level it was on Monday.\n\nThis latest surge has allowed Bitcoin to move past its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart, which could signal growing momentum behind the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin has established strong support around $38,500 over the past few days, giving bulls confidence that any dips could find eager buyers.\n\nThis return of positive sentiment is also evident in Bitcoin\u2019s trading volumes, which are up 14% across major spot exchanges in the last day.\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also seen a slight uptick to 49, although it remains stuck in \u201cNeutral\u201d territory.\n\nIf Bitcoin can continue building on these technical milestones and growing trading volumes, its price could be poised to challenge resistance around $43,500.\n\nGBTC Outflows Slowing While Planned BTC Sale Seen as Minor\n\nTwo recent developments suggest growing bullishness around Bitcoin\u2019s price prospects.\n\nFirst, analysts from JPMorgan believe the majority of selling pressure from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust is likely complete.\n\nThe fund has seen over $4 billion in outflows since converting to a spot ETF on January 11, putting downward pressure on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, with competition from BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot ETFs, additional selloffs from GBTC seem unlikely.\n\nSecondly, the US government\u2019s planned sale of nearly $130 million worth of seized Silk Road Bitcoins has been viewed as relatively small \u2013 less than 2% of the estimated 194,000 BTC the government currently holds.\n\nWith the planned sale just a drop in the bucket, the coast looks clear for Bitcoin to continue pushing higher if positive momentum builds.\n\nProminent crypto analyst CryptoMocro on Twitter even said we are now in a \u201cbull run\u201d and will \u201cprint a lot more.\u201d\n\nInnovative Bitcoin Minetrix Poised to Ride Potential Bitcoin Bull Run\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been grabbing headlines, new crypto projects like Bitcoin Minetrix stand to capitalize on any renewed retail interest in the space.\n\nThis fresh project offers a unique Stake-to-Mine structure whereby BTCMTX holders can stake their tokens to earn cloud mining credits.\n\nThese cloud mining credits can then be burned to obtain hash power for mining Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix seeks to tap into the booming cloud mining industry, allowing BTCMTX holders to passively earn BTC without needing expensive equipment.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Minetrix offers its own native staking protocol with up to 70% APY.\n\nAs Bitcoin regains momentum, previously cautious retail investors may flock back to the crypto market \u2013 and to innovative new altcoins like BTCMTX.\n\nThe project has already raised over $9.4 million in its ongoing presale, offering BTCMTX tokens for $0.0131.\n\nWith sights set on exchange listings and a mobile app down the line, Bitcoin Minetrix seems primed to ride any bullish momentum coming from Bitcoin.\n\nIf Bitcoin resumes its push back to local highs (and potentially beyond), BTCMTX could indirectly benefit.\n\nFor this reason, investors have been clamoring to get involved in the Bitcoin Minetrix presale and join the project\u2019s Telegram channel to stay on top of any vital updates.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Beyond Bitcoin: Unlocking Blockchain's Potential - American Enterprise Institute",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has the potential to transform financial services, supply chains, and efficiency. Yet as innovators like Digital Assets seek to modernize infrastructure across industries, questions emerge around balancing efficiency, privacy, and regulatory needs in complex blockchain applications.\n\nTo unpack some of these key questions around blockchain, privacy, and regulation, I spoke with Yuval Rooz. Rooz is the cofounder and CEO of Digital Asset, a blockchain technology company that works to modernize the industry underlying today\u2019s economy \u2013 enabling companies to better balance efficiency with privacy.\n\nBelow is a lightly edited and abridged transcript of our discussion. You can listen to this and other episodes of Explain to Shane on AEI.org and subscribe via your preferred listening platform. If you enjoyed this episode, leave us a review, and tell your friends and colleagues to tune in.\n\nShane Tews: You are doing a lot in the market to modernize the financial infrastructure around blockchain, so start us off with some basics about your company, Digital Assets.\n\nYuval Rooz: At Digital Assets, we\u2019re using blockchain technology and smart contracts to bring the financial infrastructure to the 21st century. We can talk in more detail about what that means, but really, there\u2019s quite a lot of inefficiency that exists in today\u2019s infrastructure due to a lot of reconciliation and this hub and spoke model that traditionally is how enterprise software was built. We\u2019re trying to bring standardization\u2014which is where you use smart contracts\u2014and one source of truth\u2014which is where blockchain comes in\u2014to remove a lot of these inefficiencies.\n\nOne of the things that people don\u2019t always understand in the smart contract language is the ability to utilize it for both privacy as well as efficiency. There\u2019s sometimes a misconception that everything on blockchain is wide open, but you have said that you can only share the information that is needed for a transaction. Is that right?\n\nSpot on. When you think about public chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their architecture was created in a way that everybody gets to see every transaction. So there is no privacy. When we started Digital Assets, we were not trying to recreate Bitcoin or Ethereum, but use some of the ideas behind blockchain to build regulated financial infrastructure. That one element that I just said about everybody seeing every transaction and having no privacy, was not possible for us to have if we wanted to work with regulated financial institutions.\n\nWhen we were designing these smart contracts and our infrastructure, we were not just saying, what is the transaction, but explicitly defining the parties that are part of that transaction. Meaning, who are the eligible parties that can see this transaction and who are the parties that are eligible to interact with this transaction?\n\nI\u2019ll give a very simple example. Imagine, Shane, you and I are moving money from one to another. Both you and I can decide how much money we want to move. But, we also know that there are Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering requirements. If a money transfer happens over $10,000, that needs to be reported to the authorities. In a smart contract, we can define that Shane and Yuval are parties to a transaction where they can define how much money they will move. But imagine there is another party, like a regulator, and if the transaction is above $10,000, that regulator gets to see the transaction. They suddenly have visibility into the transaction because it triggered an anti-money laundering rule. They cannot define how much money gets moved, they can\u2019t touch the money, but they have visibility. So, when we built the technology, we wanted to have this fine-grained control over the privacy of a transaction, who gets to interact with it, but also who gets to see it.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion in Congress about stablecoin, though there are friction points in the space including places where regulators are regulating from the analog rulebook. So, where are you seeing this have a quick uptick in adoption?\n\nPeople are compiling all aspects of blockchain technology into a narrative of these bad actors that are deceiving investors and creating these assets that terrorist organizations and criminals are using to move value. In reality, we at Digital Assets are just using the underlying technology to manage real-world assets in a much more efficient manner.\n\nWhen you look at how financial institutions are being regulated, the regulations have no context to technology in the rules that they have to follow. Meaning, that a financial institution needs to satisfy all kinds of conditions, independent of the technology that they\u2019re using. For example, if you are a bank, you need to make sure that your customer information is confidential. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bank is using a MongoDB database if they\u2019re using a SQL database, if it\u2019s on-prem, if it\u2019s on the internet, is it in the cloud. It doesn\u2019t really matter. At a high level, it says if you are a bank, you need to protect your customers\u2019 information.\n\nThis is where the world starts to conflate ideas. People will say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re using blockchain. Well, how can you protect someone\u2019s information because everything is public? There\u2019s no privacy.\u201d Because of this idea, if you\u2019re using blockchain in the description of your projects, you now need to get approval from a regulator. That stifled a lot of innovation that had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe technology is proving itself and it is getting used. For example, we have mortgages that are being issued on a blockchain and getting acquired in a much more efficient manner. Historically, it would take about a month to settle a mortgaged purchase. Now it\u2019s being done in hours. And many other use cases have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, that are using that blockchain technology. The challenge is that when you go to launch these applications, it ends up being much longer than if we were to just use a traditional database in the cloud since our customers are heavily regulated because the word blockchain shows up. That\u2019s the unfortunate part of this connection to cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn another episode of this podcast, I had a guest who owned a chain of car dealerships and he realized the amount of friction there was in the chain of custody from all the different parts of selling a car, then owning a car, and then selling a car again. He went to the Ohio banks said, \u201cDo you know how much real estate you\u2019re spending keeping paper on these car loans?\u201d They slowly migrated their process, and saved billions of dollars just by getting rid of the warehouses that were maintaining the records of the information on cars.\n\nThat reflects a concept I\u2019m 100 percent behind, which is the tokenization of real-world assets. We don\u2019t need to create these made-up assets for a store of value. Think of gold: you don\u2019t have different versions or gold; like gold one, gold two, gold three, gold 10,000. So, this idea of tokenization of real-world assets is really where the value is. Which is, can we use this technology to streamline the processing and movement of value as close as possible to real time of real-world assets.\n\nIf done correctly, tokenization is really taking digitization to the next level. I think that people dislike digitization because digitization is a term that has been used for the last 15 or 20 years, so people wanted a cool new term. I think the problem with that is that it insinuates that if I represented an asset as a token, I solved all the problems. That\u2019s just not true. You really have to digitize the process: all of the transfer rules, and all of the components of the life of an asset. I think that that is the big potential around this technology.\n\nDo you think the US needs to lead? What if somebody else takes charge and gets ahead of us?\n\nI think the US needs to be involved in the conversation. I think that that\u2019s more important. A lot of times, people will bring up the point of China, but at the end of the day, the Yuan is not going to become the reserve currency because it\u2019s on a blockchain. It might not be a component of why countries will consider doing trade with China, because maybe it\u2019s easier, it\u2019s more efficient. But in my opinion, it\u2019s not going to be the primary reason. I think the absence of the US from the conversations around standards is much more damaging than the lack of actually implementing the technology.\n\nRight now, most developed countries are thinking about, what does this technology mean? What is the value of it? We\u2019re still many years away from developed countries moving all of their payment solutions to this technology, but the US should be at the forefront of those conversations."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nPeter Schiff, a critic of Bitcoin, concedes its price could surge in the event of an extreme US dollar crisis.\n\nDespite his long-standing bearish stance on BTC, the cryptocurrency has continued to grow in value.\n\nA Bullish Prediction at Last?\n\nThe well-known economist and one of Bitcoin\u2019s harshest critics \u2013 Peter Schiff \u2013 touched upon the primary cryptocurrency again, claiming that its supporters would praise it even in the case of a severe crash:\n\n\u201cNo matter how low the price of Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim it\u2019s outperformed gold. For example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x.\u201d\n\nHowever, BTC could also rally in the following years, with one X (Twitter) user provoking Schiff with a $10 million forecast by 2031.\n\nInterestingly, the economist claimed this could become a fact should the US dollar experience the same collapse as the German Papiermark approximately 100 years ago.\n\nThe hyperinflation in Germany between 1921 and 1923 is among the most dramatic financial crises in modern history. Back then, the country struggled with numerous economic challenges following the heavy war debts after World War I, so it started printing more money to meet its obligations.\n\nThe process led to a devaluation of the national currency, which plummeted at an unprecedented rate. At one point, one US dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German Papiermarks, with people carrying wheelbarrows full of money to buy basic goods.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Previous Bearish Statements\n\nThe economist\u2019s harsh stance toward Bitcoin dates back to the early years of the cryptocurrency. In 2013, he opposed the theory that BTC resembles gold, arguing it is more like a \u201ctulip mania 2.0.\u201d\n\nHe also called the asset \u201ca digital pyramid scheme\u201d and forecasted its doom numerous times. In January 2023, he counseled HODLers to use BTC\u2019s rally as an opportunity to cash out. Nonetheless, the price kept advancing, being 120% up since that advice.\n\nMost recently, Schiff gave his two cents on the approved spot BTC ETFs in the USA, arguing that Gary Gensler (Chairman of the SEC) was \u201cbacked into a corner\u201d to give the thumbs up. As such, he expects the agency to implement \u201conerous crypto regulations\u201d that could negatively impact the industry and Bitcoin\u2019s value."

        "content": "BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) reached $2 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Jan. 26, just two weeks after it debuted on the Nasdaq.\n\nAccording to data released by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price performance intraday has pushed the fund\u2019s market capitalization to $2.11 billion. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has broken through $42,000 for the first time in nearly seven days after a sell-off following the launch of ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\n\u201cAssets under management\u201d is a term used to describe the total market value of all the financial assets held by a fund on behalf of its clients. This means that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is leading in the race for investors\u2019 capital, just ahead of Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.8 billion in flows over the previous 10 days.\n\nBlackRock is leveraging its market reputation as the world\u2019s largest asset manager to attract broader audiences to its crypto-based product.\n\nUnlike asset managers such as VanEck, which targeted early adopters and the crypto community with Bitcoin ETF television ads, BlackRock chose to communicate to baby boomers with a two-minute video featuring one of its executives outlining Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition and how investors can receive exposure to its new ETF.\n\nThe annual fees charged by issuers may also be contributing to capital attraction. BlackRock set its fee for the iShare ETF at 0.12% for the first 12 months or until the first $5 billion in assets under management, then plans to increase it to 0.25%.\n\nSeveral other issuers offer competitive fees as well, with ARK Invest charging 0.21%, VanEck listing a fee of 0.25%, and Bitwise charging 0.20%. Fees on ETFs are not billed directly to investors but rather deducted from the ETF\u2019s performance, which reduces investors\u2019 return.\n\nSeyffart anticipates Bitcoin ETFs to gather $10 billion in capital over the first year.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency , has weathered recent market volatility with resilience, bouncing back 5% to hit the $42,000 mark on Saturday. Despite this recovery, Bitcoin remains 14% below its post-ETF approval highs.On January 24, Bitcoin was at $39,500, down nearly 20% from around $49,000 \u2014 the three-year high it hit on January 11 in the wake of the decision by the US SEC to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.Siddhartha Gupta, SVP - Business and Strategic Alliances, CoinDCX said, \"Bitcoin's dip below $40,000 post-ETF launch isn't solely due to the event. A prior 15% surge in less than 20 days pushed it into overbought territory. The decline reflects profit booking by major crypto players rather than signalling long-term negativity.\"\"With the imminent halving and potential ETH ETF approvals, our medium and long-term perspective for Bitcoin is bullish and we can look at newer 1-year highs in a short-term period,\" Siddhartha said.In early trade on Saturday, Bitcoin was trading over 5% higher at $42,003. Also, as per reports, over $4 billion of funds have flowed into the new spot bitcoin ETFs, particularly to products operated by BlackRock and Fidelity.Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, highlighted the success of spot BTC ETFs, attracting a remarkable $4.8 billion in inflows within their initial days. Notably, BlackRock leads with almost $1.8 billion in Bitcoin holdings, followed closely by Fidelity with an additional $1.5 billion. Chaturvedi underscores the potential for sustained demand driven by these ETFs and anticipates upward price pressure, particularly with the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving in April.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, notes that the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has triggered a surge in the cryptocurrency landscape, with both Bitcoin and Altcoins experiencing a rally. Despite a market dip due to profit-booking and GrayScale outflows, Bitcoin has maintained its position at the $40,000 level, reflecting confidence from institutional and retail investors.Patel predicts substantial inflows of $5-7 billion in the next three months, with a broader perspective foreseeing institutional commitment and potential inflows reaching $500 billion within 2-5 years.Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, draws parallels with the historic ascent of the SPDR Gold Trust in 2004, signalling a growing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin within the traditional financial ecosystem. Shekhar sees BlackRock's achievement of a $1 billion holding in just four days as indicative of a significant shift in the investment landscape.(Subscribe to ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Eleven of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) miners may struggle to mine Bitcoin profitably if the price of BTC fails to increase significantly after the halving, analysts at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald have reportedly found.\n\nA Jan. 25 post to X (formerly Twitter) by CleanSpark executive chairman and co-founder Matthew Shultz \u2014 which cited research from Cantor Fitzgerald \u2014 found that many Bitcoin miners, including Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Core Scientific, may come under increased pressure following the Bitcoin halving, as the value of the Bitcoin that the miners receive from their operations may fail to outweigh the costs.\n\n*BREAKING - new today!\n\n\n\nNo matter the department, the entire team at @CleanSpark_Inc is committed to efficiency.

This would only be worsened if the price of Bitcoin failed to reach a level that would cover these costs.\n\nMany market commentators also believe Bitcoin will experience a significant jump in the price in the months following the halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 shares tank 23% amid accusations from short-sellers\n\nDan Rosen, the associate director of derivatives at Bitcoin miner Luxor, told Cointelegraph that miners often employ a range of strategies to hedge their exposure to BTC. This typically looks like purchasing derivatives products, such as hash rate futures contracts and BTC-related options to try and smooth out any potential volatility.\n\nCointelegraph contacted several Bitcoin miners listed in the report for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: MakerDAO\u2019s plan to bring back \u2018DeFi summer\u2019 \u2014 Rune Christensen"

For the time being, however, he sees a reprieve for Bitcoin bulls.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, local bottom is in for a while.

        "title": "Bitcoin bounces even as ETF outflows mount - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin moved back into the $42,000 range Friday after a disappointing week of trading. Meanwhile, stocks slipped even as the latest economic data bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve can achieve a soft landing after all.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), which struggled to break out above $40,000 this week, posted a recovery Friday, gaining more than 8% since its Tuesday\u2019s low. Ether (ETH) was also on the recovery path, trading around 2% higher Friday.\n\nAnalysts are cautiously optimistic that bitcoin\u2019s ETF-driven selloff could be easing, even as outflows mount. The new spot products end their third week of trading Friday, and outflows are increasing. Spot bitcoin ETF net outflows hit a high of $158 million Thursday.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETFs see net outflows for 4 straight days\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the GBTC outflows are over,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, said. \u201cYesterday, they were $394 million, which sounds like a lot but is the lowest outflow since launch day\u2026rather, it reminds us that flows matter but are not the main driver of the BTC price.\u201d\n\nPersonal consumer expenditures price (PCE) index data released Friday was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, showing a 0.2% increase in December and 2.9% high year-over-year. The numbers are a sign that while inflation is still elevated, it is trending lower.\n\n\u201cSpending last month increased 0.7%, comfortably exceeding the 0.5% that was expected,\u201d Criag Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said. \u201cIt also came on top of the upward revision to the November reading, which increased to 0.4% from 0.2% previously. All things considered, it\u2019s another sign that the US consumer and economy are in very healthy shape going into the new year.\u201d\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF net outflows hit highest level yet on day 9 of trading\n\nStill, traders seemed skeptical. The S&P 500 traded sideways and the Nasdaq Composite lost around 0.4% toward the end of Friday\u2019s session. Both indexes remain modestly higher over the week ahead of the Fed\u2019s Open Markets Committee Tuesday.\n\nMinimal yield moves Thursday and Friday, thanks to the expected economic data releases, are a positive sign for traders, Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday.\n\n\u201cIn order for economic data to move yields, it must be so good or so bad it alters the market\u2019s outlook for rate cuts and either pushes it back more (yields higher) or pulls it forward (yields lower),\u201d Essaye said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, the calmer yields are \u2014 like yesterday \u2014 the more they\u2019ll support these gains in stocks.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, believes there is a risk the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be misinterpreted as firm regulations in place for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nIn a keynote speech on Jan. 26, Behnam clarified there is a potential for retail and institutional investors to misunderstand the legal ruling for spot Bitcoin ETFs following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision to approve 11 applications on Jan. 10.\n\nWhile the approval now allows investors to expose themselves to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset itself, supervised by an SEC-regulated stock exchange, he argued there is no regulatory oversight for the cash market of digital assets, such as a crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cThere remains nothing firmly in place to address the opaque and inconsistent practices in the cash markets for digital assets.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Behnam explains that this has repercussions for the transparency of Bitcoin ETFs, since asset management firms acquire the underlying assets for the ETF from the cash market.\n\nHe raised concerns regarding trade settlement, conflicts of interest, data reporting, cybersecurity, customer protections, transparency and general market integrity.\n\n\u201cThe ETPs have taken a speculative and volatile asset, wrapped it in a thin layer of indirect regulation, and packaged it as a shiny new product,\u201d Behnam stated.\n\nRelated: CFTC pays whistleblowers $16M this year for mostly crypto tips\n\nThe enforcement of crypto regulations has been a prominent topic of discussion within the U.S. government in recent times, prompted by the demand from the crypto industry.\n\nIn September 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham advocated for a limited pilot program to address crypto regulation.\n\nPham warned that the U.S. may soon need to \u201cplay catch-up\u201d to crypto-friendly jurisdictions. She suggested that the program would be similar to regulatory sandboxes previously introduced at the state level.\n\nHowever, many in the crypto industry anticipate that there could be increased regulatory clarity following the U.S. presidential election in November.\n\nA recent survey on Jan. 2 by the Crypto Council for Innovation indicated that most crypto-focused individuals stated that a candidate\u2019s position on digital assets would be somewhat, very or extremely important to their vote.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF guru Eric Balchunas has the last laugh at doubters: X Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Stare long enough and you\u2019ll see all sorts of things in crypto price charts.\n\nTrade volume patterns and fractal candles that seem to predict major pumps. Inverted cup-and-handles hover over your positions like a bad omen.\n\nThere\u2019s then the odd correlation between X posts from Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao and bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin tends to go up after Zhao tweets \u201cgm.\u201d Although the subsequent rallies are often short-lived, it happens almost every time.\n\nThe frequency of CZ\u2019s gms increased after bitcoin bottomed out in November 2022\n\nGood morning (gm) posts spread like wildfire five or six years ago. They were so popular on WhatsApp in India that one-in-three local smartphone users \u2014 many of which had only recently gained access to the internet \u2014 were running out of space on their devices every day, on account of the fact that each \u201cgm\u201d was usually accompanied by a slapdash image of beaches, roses or sunrises over mountain ranges.\n\nThe habit has persisted in crypto as wholesome engagement bait and Zhao has so far shared posts containing \u201cgm\u201d 10 times over the past two years or so.\n\nBitcoin rose between 3% and 40% in the days following each gm.\n\nA post last July about Threads, Meta\u2019s answer to X, which started with \u201cGM\u201d is so far the only exception.\n\nBitcoin slipped about 1% shortly after but did reach more than 3% higher in the following two days.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nCZ\u2019s first gm. Bitcoin was worth $50,000\n\nThe correlation between Zhao\u2019s \u201cgm\u201d and bitcoin\u2019s price has been so strong that it was possible to base a dollar-cost averaging strategy around the former Binance CEO\u2019s Twitter timeline.\n\nHypothetically, buying $1,000 worth of bitcoin every time Zhao tweeted \u201cgm\u201d would\u2019ve accumulated 0.31 BTC ($13,000) for $10,000 \u2014 almost 25% unrealized profit.\n\nBitcoin has fallen more than 20% over the same period. So, Zhao\u2019s \u201cgms\u201d have outperformed bitcoin by nearly double.\n\nStacking sats at the end of every month, a pureplay dollar-cost averaging strategy, would\u2019ve made only marginally more than buying alongside Zhao\u2019s \u201cgms,\u201d netting about 0.346 BTC ($14,500).\n\nAll this only goes to show that timing the market, whether by superstition, technical analysis or some other prediction, can easily go wrong.\n\nVitalik tweets a lot about Ethereum\u2019s roadmap\n\nOne way it would\u2019ve easily gone right would\u2019ve been to snap up $10,000 worth of ether (ETH) shortly after Vitalik Buterin ever tweeted about Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap is something of a meme, mostly due to the years of delays surrounding the blockchain\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake and the sprawling nature of the diagrams shared by Buterin.\n\nButerin has tweeted about Ethereum\u2019s roadmap 29 times since 2016 (not counting any posts that may have been deleted over time).\n\nBuying $10,000 worth of ether shortly after his first roadmap post would\u2019ve got you about 888 ETH \u2014 now worth $2 million with unrealized gains of 20,000%.\n\nThe bulk of Buterin\u2019s roadmap tweets came as ETH was ramping up during the last bull market\n\nAlthough that probably had more to do with time in the market than timing the market, albeit with some degree of luck.\n\nDollar-cost averaging the same amount into ETH each time Buterin tweeted about the roadmap would have otherwise returned 2,500%.\n\nDoing the same at the end of every month since 2016 would get about two-thirds of those gains.\n\nBuying ETH when Vitalik tweets about the roadmap is just a different form of DCA\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Buterin has tweeted \u201cgm\u201d only once, in March 2021 with an attached image of a \u201cbeautiful field full of flowers.\u201d\n\nAny still-held positions taken alongside Buterin\u2019s gm would be down 16%, on account the post was made in the midst of an aggressive bull run which ETH is yet to run back.\n\nAll these scenarios are purely fun ways to express that correlation does not always mean causation.\n\nLoading Tweet.. We like the roadmap\n\nBasing investment decisions on spurious signals like the wording of social media posts is not a legitimate strategy and any implication otherwise is only for entertainment. Sometimes dumb strategies pay off \u2014 a dart-throwing chimpanzee, a camel and other primates have previously beaten swathes of US funds for returns.\n\nWe know social media and news headlines (real or fake) can impact crypto markets, but the likelihood of real connection between Zhao\u2019s gm posts and the prices of bitcoin are basically zero.\n\nButerin\u2019s roadmap posts may contribute to the transparency of Ethereum development \u2014 boosting value proposition in some tangential way \u2014 but any effect is practically unmeasurable.\n\nAs for the debate between dollar-cost averaging and lump-sum investments, check out these academic studies or even these reports from major investment banks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

That confirms a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d element to one of the most ballyhooed events in ETF industry history.\n\nHowever, that retrenchment isn\u2019t an indictment of products such as the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). Arguably, it could prove to be a buying opportunity. That\u2019s because spot bitcoin ETFs bring more investors in the cryptocurrency space in the U.S. It\u2019s also because the digital currency\u2019s recent pullback could encourage buying in other regions.\n\nChina could be a prime example. Burned by what\u2019s now a more than three-year losing streak by China stocks and amid concerns about the state of the country\u2019s real estate market, investors in the world\u2019s second-largest economy are evaluating other asset classes, including bitcoin.\n\nWhy It Matters to BTCO\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d The debuts of BTCO and friends were compared to the launch of the first gold-backed ETF nearly two decades ago.\n\nThe comparisons are pertinent. That\u2019s because, particularly in the case of spot commodities and ETFs, market participants outside the U.S. affect pricing. In recent years, that scenario has played as various central banks have gobbled up physical holdings of gold. That has provided price support for the yellow metal. It\u2019s possible China investors could have a similar effect on spot bitcoin. That potentially benefits ETFs such as BTCO along the way.\n\nIndeed, China investors have good reasons to consider asset classes beyond the country\u2019s stocks. So under siege are equities there that the government is increasing access to capital and considering reforms to further liberalize its financial markets in an effort to lure more international investors.\n\nCrypto trading and mining are currently banned in China. That means interested investors must find loopholes to access bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\n\u201cMore and more Chinese investors are using creative ways to own bitcoin and other crypto assets that they believe are safer than investing in crumbling stock and property markets at home,\u201d reported Reuters. \u201cThey operate in a grey area. While cryptocurrency is banned in mainland China and there are strict controls on capital movement across the border, people are still able to trade tokens such as bitcoin on crypto exchanges such as OKX and Binance, or through other over-the-counter channels.\u201d\n\nShould China permit traditional access to bitcoin in the future, BTCO could benefit.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "The US government is auctioning over $130 million in Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road case, involving digital assets linked to criminal activities. This significant move reflects the evolving approach to handling cryptocurrencies in law enforcement.\n\nThe US government is set to auction over $130 million in Bitcoin, previously seized in the high-profile Silk Road investigation, marking a significant move in the handling of digital assets linked to criminal activities.\n\nIn a recent decision by the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 2,874.9 BTC (valued at around $129 million) and an additional 58.7 BTC (approximately $3.3 million) were cleared for sale. This action follows the court-approved forfeiture of 69,000 BTC connected to the Silk Road case, a notorious digital black market\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Silk Road, operational from 2011 until its shutdown in 2013, was a digital marketplace infamous for facilitating illegal activities like drug trades and money laundering using Bitcoin. The seized Bitcoin stems from the criminal activities of individuals like Ryan Farace and Sean Bridges. Farace was involved in a money laundering conspiracy linked to the sale of Xanax on darknet marketplaces, while Bridges, a former US Secret Service Special Agent, was deeply involved in the Silk Road investigations and subsequently found guilty of stealing Bitcoin\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe auction includes two lots of Bitcoin. The first, approximately 2,800 BTC, is valued at roughly $129 million, while the second, smaller lot consists of 58 BTC worth about $3 million. The bitcoins were linked to Farace, who was sentenced to 54 months in prison on a charge of money laundering conspiracy. Alongside his father, Joseph Farace, they were found guilty of attempting to transfer over 2,874 Bitcoin to a foreign bank account. Shaun Bridges, another figure in this story, was a member of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force and was sentenced to a six-year prison term for the theft of BTC during the US government's investigation of the Silk Road\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis move represents a significant step in the US government's approach to handling digital assets derived from criminal activities. The US Attorney General will oversee the sale, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory standards. This initiative not only reflects the government's efforts in combating crime related to digital currencies but also sets a precedent for future actions involving cryptocurrencies \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe sale of these Bitcoins is not just a mere transaction but symbolizes a broader narrative in the digital age \u2013 the intersection of digital innovation, crime, and law enforcement. It highlights the evolving landscape of digital currencies and the continuous effort of law enforcement agencies to adapt and respond to crimes in this sphere.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "The Anatomy of a Cryptocurrency: Breaking Down Bitcoin - Coloradoan",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nBitcoin can easily be considered the pioneer and the most widely recognized cryptocurrency. With its skyrocketing popularity and acceptance, understanding the underlying architecture and inner workings of this revolutionary form of money is necessary. Let\u2019s break down its anatomy and explore the intricate mechanisms that power this decentralized digital currency.\n\nBitcoin operates on a distributed ledger technology called the blockchain. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the blockchain, it is essentially a decentralized network made up of countless computers, known as nodes, that collectively maintain a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Unlike traditional banking systems, where a central authority oversees transactions, the blockchain empowers individuals to participate in the verification process, and view current prices on cryptocurrencies such as the Ethereum price.\n\nEvery transaction made using Bitcoin is recorded in a \"block,\" which is essentially a bundle of data containing information such as the sender, recipient, and the amount of Bitcoin transferred. These blocks are linked together, like a chain, forming the blockchain. Miners, specialized participants in the network, compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add new blocks to the chain. Once a block is added, it becomes virtually impossible to alter, ensuring the security and immutability of the Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTo incentivize miners and maintain the integrity of the network, Bitcoin introduced a concept called \"proof-of-work.\" Miners compete to solve these puzzles by dedicating their computational power and energy to the network. The first miner to successfully solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of newly minted Bitcoin, a process known as mining. This not only provides an incentive for miners but also regulates the creation of new Bitcoin, preventing inflation.\n\nBitcoin's architecture also incorporates sophisticated cryptographic techniques. Each user in the network possesses a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive funds, while the private key acts as a digital signature, authenticating the user's ownership and authorizing transactions. The cryptographic nature of Bitcoin ensures the security and privacy of users, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to forge transactions or access sensitive information.\n\nOne of the defining features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Unlike traditional currencies that can be printed at will, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. This scarcity, combined with the increasing demand, has driven the value of Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. Moreover, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks, to reduce transaction fees and enable borderless transactions.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to evolve, developers are constantly working on improving its architecture and expanding its capabilities. Proposed upgrades, such as the Lightning Network, aim to address scalability issues by enabling faster and cheaper transactions off-chain while maintaining the security of the main blockchain.\n\nBitcoin's architecture represents a groundbreaking departure from traditional financial systems. Its decentralized nature, built on the blockchain, ensures transparency, security, and immutability. Through the use of cryptographic techniques and proof-of-work, Bitcoin has revolutionized the concept of digital currency. With its limited supply and increasing adoption, Bitcoin has proven to be a remarkable store of value and a transformative force in the financial landscape. Understanding the anatomy of Bitcoin helps us better realize its potential and welcome the future of decentralized finance.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

On January 19th, it skyrocketed above $41.5K in a violent green candle and consolidated at that level for a few weeks, but it was on the 22nd when things started taking a turn for the worst. BTC started bleeding out.\n\nThe correction took it all the way down to $38,500 \u2013 a price that we hadn\u2019t seen for around two months. Contrary to what many analysts were claiming, BTC did, in fact, fall below $40K. It took a few days of consolidation around that level, but today, it finally managed to break out.\n\nFortunately, it was for the better.\n\nThe price exploded today, charting an increase of around 4% on the day, which adds up to some 8% from the lows on January 22nd. This also brought enthusiasm across the rest of the market, which is also trading in the green today.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

        "title": "BlackRock warned SEC lack of in-kind orders for Bitcoin ETF shares could hurt investors - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "A novel aspect of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, as approved by the SEC, is the cash-creation mechanism for issuing and redeeming shares. The ETFs are considered commodity-shares ETFs, yet, as BlackRock points out in its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) prospectus, \u201call spot-market commodities other than bitcoin, such as gold and silver, employ in-kind creations and redemptions with the underlying asset.\u201d\n\nIn its filings, BlackRock strongly advocated for in-kind orders for shares, but the SEC guided applicants toward a cash-creation model due to the nature of specific regulatory processes. People allowed to buy and sell shares of the trust (Authorized Participants) have to be registered broker-dealers, which means they are officially recognized and must follow certain financial rules. Right now, it\u2019s not clear how these broker-dealers can follow these rules if they\u2019re dealing with Bitcoin directly.\n\nDue to this uncertainty, it\u2019s risky for these broker-dealers to use Bitcoin to buy or sell shares of the trust. The SEC probably would not have allowed a product like this on the stock exchange if it\u2019s unclear how the rules apply. Therefore, all the ETF applications were updated from in-kind to cash-creates in December before approval.\n\nIf the \u201cNASDAQ receives the in-kind regulatory approval\u201d to allow buying and selling shares with Bitcoin directly in the future, the ETFs will likely request a change to enable in-kind orders. However, we don\u2019t know when this will happen or if it will happen at all.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s view on the cash creation model for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThis information has been available to investors since the Dec. 19 update to BlackRock\u2019s S1 filing. However, following the successful launch of the Newborn Nine ETFs and billions of dollars in volume, revisiting the world\u2019s largest asset manager\u2019s warning to the SEC concerning cash-creates seems worthwhile. It\u2019s important to note that BlackRock is required to state any material risks in its prospectus, so the inclusion of a potential scenario means it is possible, not probable.\n\nThat said, BlackRock does not believe the cash-creation method is efficient, stating that the trust\u2019s current practice of buying and selling shares with cash instead of using Bitcoin directly could cause problems in keeping share prices aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s actual value.\n\nIt cautions that this mismatch might happen because cash transactions are more complex and take longer than direct Bitcoin transactions. It continues to identify that delays in these transactions could mean that the prices used to calculate the value of the trust\u2019s shares (NAV) may not accurately reflect the real-time price of Bitcoin.\n\nFurther, under a section entitled \u2018Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares,\u2019 BlackRock also warns of reduced arbitrage opportunities for Authorized Participants,\n\n\u201cThe use of cash creations and redemptions, as opposed to in-kind creations and redemptions, may adversely affect the arbitrage transactions by Authorized Participants intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of bitcoin and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV.\u201d\n\nFinally, BlackRock warned that there is a possibility that Authorized Participants might not want to continue facilitating the trust if they think these delays and extra steps have become too risky or costly. This reluctance may also make it harder to keep the trust\u2019s share prices close to the actual value of Bitcoin. If this system doesn\u2019t work well, investors might buy shares for more than they\u2019re worth or sell them for less. This could cause losses for the shareholders.\n\nBlackRock is a more prominent advocate for in-kind orders than the model approved by the SEC. The prospectus says in-kind share creation and redemption is \u201cgenerally more efficient, and therefore less costly, for spot commodity exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF NAV correlation with cash creation model.\n\nMost interestingly, BlackRock identifies cash-creation commodity-shares ETFs as \u201ca novel product that has not been tested and could be impacted by any resulting operational inefficiencies.\u201d Specifically, BlackRock highlights times of \u201cmarket volatility or turmoil\u201d where cash-creates could materially affect the ETF\u2019s ability to trade.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the Trust\u2019s inability to facilitate in-kind creations and redemptions, and resulting reliance on cash creations and redemptions, could cause the Sponsor to halt or suspend the creation or redemption of Shares during times of market volatility or turmoil, among other consequences.\u201d\n\nSince launch, the NAV premium to discount spread has been less than 100bps, ranging from +40bps to -30bps over ten trading days. By comparison, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has not deviated more beyond +5bps and -11bps over the past twelve months.\n\nIn a more direct comparison, however, the iShares Gold Trust (IAUM) has seen a spread of around +300bps over the past twelve months. Its highest premium to gold was over +200bps, and the lowest discount was around -140bps.\n\nGiven that IAUM can use in-kind orders for gold and BlackRock believes cash-creates could create a more volatile discount or premium for IBIT, investors may wonder if we should expect it to see deviations from the NAV beyond 3% in the future. Alternatively, perhaps BlackRock\u2019s resolve for in-kind orders was a foretelling of the exodus from Grayscale, which, if handled in-kind, may have simply seen Bitcoin leaving one ETF and flowing directly into another instead of being resold several times.\n\nThe next filing to look out for regarding potential in-kind Bitcoin ETF orders is whether the Nasdaq requests that Bitcoin be considered a viable asset for buying and selling shares. Until then, the cash creation of shares will continue.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Two Possible Reasons Why the Bitcoin Price Crashes Toward $40K - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price is down 4.4% in the past seven days and about 16% from its January 11th highs at $48,500. The cryptocurrency is now getting dangerously close to the pivotal psychological level of $40K, triggering a discussion on whether or not the correction will continue.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s have a look at a few of the potential reasons behind the recent decline, as well as a couple of possible catalysts for positive developments in the not-so-distant future.\n\nUnderwhelming Bitcoin ETF Launch\n\nFollowing many years of rigorous attempts on behalf of multiple ETF providers, the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund is now a fact. The US Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted the product earlier this month.\n\nIf you want to check out the complete timeline leading to that event, please take a look at our article below:\n\nTimeline of Events Leading to Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval in the US\n\nThe launch wasn\u2019t without hiccups. In fact, it was particularly underwhelming. Days before the expected confirmation date, the X account of the agency was compromised. The perpetrator tweeted falsely that the Bitcoin ETF was approved, triggering a bidirectional price spiral, which led to many millions of dollars worth of leveraged positions being liquidated.\n\nFinally, when the date came, and the official announcement came, the SEC took the link containing the order down because they had published it during trading hours, as opposed to after that.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s price increased massively the day after, reaching its January peak at around $48,500.\n\nAnd yet, it appears that the launch was indeed a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event as the ETF inflows failed to compensate for the selling pressure, which continues to this date. as BTC trends toward $40K.\n\nOverheated Crypto Markets\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets, in general, were trending upward without considerable corrections for a prolonged period of time before the current decline.\n\nThe main reason behind the increase was largely the anticipation of the approval of a spot BTC ETF.\n\nAs seen in the chart, the price went from around $26K in the middle of October to a high of $48,500 in January without almost any corrections. This represents an increase of about 86%.\n\nAdditionally, the popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been giving signs of an overheated market for quite a while. It\u2019s been trending in the higher numbers for quite a while. As CryptoPotato recently reported, on January 15th, it dropped to Neutral for the first time in three months.\n\nPrior to that, it was sitting mostly in Greed or Extreme Greed, indicating overly enthusiastic market participants based on multiple metrics.\n\nWhen Will the Bulls Come Back?\n\nAt this rate, it\u2019s clear that the sellers have had the upper hand for the past couple of weeks, and many are wondering if and when the bulls will come back.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to gauge potential developments in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the fact of the matter is that the halving is right around the corner.\n\nIn April this year, the Bitcoin network will undergo this major shift, which will slash the block rewards in half, limiting the supply of freshly-minted BTC on the market while also halving its pre-programmed inflation.\n\nThe event has historically preceded major bull markets, and many analysts are of the opinion that this cycle will not be any different."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin is rising again today\u2014but so is nearly every cryptocurrency near the top of the pile. Crypto tokens kicked off the day basking in the green glow of optimism with bullish candlesticks all over the place.\n\nApart from Maker (MKR) and the usual band of stablecoins, which are designed to be immune to such volatility, all of the tokens in the top 100 enjoyed a buoyant uplift. This optimistic tide marked a stark contrast to yesterday's bearish undercurrents that saw the market caps of many tokens take a dip.\n\nBitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and often regarded as the market's bellwether, has marked a significant rally. The currency opened the trading day at $39,929 and rode a wave of bullish trading to a high of $42,159 at the time of publication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe candlestick is still forming and has not major shadow in the upper part\u2014meaning that the actual price is the highest of the day. This surge not only eclipsed the day's lows, but also sent a strong signal that investors might be regaining their confidence after the previous day's slump.\n\nThis spike cancels a major dip that started four days ago, which took the coin below the psychological support of $40,000, spooking investors and increasing the possibility of a major bearish correction. Now, the gap between the average prices of the last 10 and 55 days is closing, which is good for those still expecting to watch Bitcoin go to the moon.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin bouncing?\n\nThe trajectory of Bitcoin's price is often swayed by the complex interplay of market instruments and investor behavior. JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou sheds light on a recent factor, suggesting that the worst may be over now that Grayscale is reducing the pace of its BTC sales following the conversion of its Bitcoin Trust to a proper spot ETF.\n\n\"Profit-taking on previous GBTC investments, made at a discount to NAV last year, has likely been a major driver behind Bitcoin\u2019s correction; $4.3 billion has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis outflow, Panigirtzoglou argues, may have caused the temporal disruption in the markets behavior as some investors rushed to cash out gains. \u201cWe believe that most of this $4.3 billion GBTC outflow reflects profit taking rather than a shift towards cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs (needless to say that such a shift would have had little market impact),\u201d he added.\n\nShifting dynamics in Bitcoin's price discovery mechanisms also play a crucial role in the price, according to JPMorgan. The firm observes a \"significant change\" in the market structure.\n\n\"The emergence of spot ETFs is introducing another dimension in the Bitcoin price discovery process, along with onshore spot exchanges and onshore futures that echoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system,\" Panigirtzoglou notes.\n\nThis evolution, far from fragmenting the market, is anticipated to enhance the efficiency of price discovery as it aligns with patterns observed in other established financial assets like equities. It is important to remember that each dollar worth of Bitcoin traded in an ETF is supported by a similar amount in the underlying asset (aka satoshis, the smallest denomination of BTC).\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of novel ETF products by Grayscale could introduce additional liquidity into the market. JPMorgan elucidates. And this is a positive thing for traders, both legacy and crypto-native. Such financial instruments, common in equity markets, could provide investors with a more risk-mitigated approach to gaining Bitcoin exposure.\n\nThis means that once markets find that balance between the usual way to trade and the new financial instruments that have been introduced, the price trend may be normalized and the increased liquidity would make it harder to manipulate prices. Some analysts may be taking that into consideration with their strategies.\n\nAltcoins follow Bitcoin\u2019s path\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the backbone of many decentralized applications, has mirrored Bitcoin's ascent.\n\nThe digital asset, which is in the midst of preparing for a significant network upgrade aimed at enhancing transaction speed and cost-efficiency, saw its price climb from an opening of $2,217 to its current price of $2,266. The day's high touched $2,281, suggesting that anticipation around its forthcoming technological advancements could be fueling investor interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum still looks bullish on a longer trend\u2014it\u2019s just that the trend is not as strong as it was a few weeks ago. The indicators show that the coin is slightly oversold, but considering how weak the average directional index (or ADX, an indicator that measures how strong a trend is) looks, traders must be careful and probably wait for Bitcoin to set the course that altcoins usually will follow.\n\nOn a lighter note, the Solana-based meme coin BONK, which has been making waves recently, bounded up by an impressive margin. Opening the day at $0.00001126, it reached a peak of $0.00001249, and managed to find its way to its current $0.00001217 for an impressive 7.8% spike.\n\nAnd, at least today, the disciple beats the master: Dogecoin grew only 2% in the same time, but still remains the undisputed king of the dog-themed coin by market cap and by far the funniest token in the top 10 cryptocurrencies.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

Finally, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) added over 9% in Friday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe reasons behind the sudden surge weren\u2019t exactly clear, as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has already been priced into the market for some time now. Following that, Bitcoin seemed to undergo what some called a \u201csell-the-news correction,\u201d which sent prices back down. But the selling frenzy seems to have passed, at least for now, and Bitcoin prices are making their way back up once more.\n\nCore Confidence Dropping?\n\nIn what may be a problem for Bitcoin\u2014and the stocks so closely connected to it\u2014there are signs of concern from retail investors. Yet, word from 10x Research\u2019s head of research, Markus Thielen, suggests that now is \u201c\u2026not the time to turn bearish,\u201d instead looking for positive catalysts from the U.S. election cycle to boost asset prices.\n\nWhich Bitcoin Stocks are a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, HIVE stock is the clear leader right now. With an average price target of $6.17, this Moderate Buy-rated stock offers an upside potential of 86.12%. Meanwhile, COIN stock is the laggard, as this Hold-rated stock with an average price target of $128.58 can only offer a 2.54% upside potential.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nIf Bitcoin price sees a daily candlestick close above resistance at $41,466, it is likely to invalidate the bearish thesis and send BTC towards its next key resistance at $43,074.\n\nBitcoin price is in a tight range close to the psychologically important level of $40,000. BTC price is $40,132, at the time of writing. The asset yielded nearly 3% weekly losses for holders. The ETF approval likely catalyzed a correction in Bitcoin, ushering a decline in BTC from its 2024 peak of $48,989.\n\nBitcoin price is range bound close to the psychologically important $40,000 level, nearly two weeks post Spot ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Retail traders holding less than 1 BTC have shed their holdings, evident by the decline in Bitcoin wallets since October 2023.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Peter Schiff says Bitcoin could hit $10 million if this happens - KITCO",
        "content": "Economist and long-time Bitcoin (BTC) critic Peter Schiff has felt vindicated over the past week as his warning that BTC\u2019s price would fall victim to \u201cselling the news\u201d after the recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs on the U.S. market has come to fruition \u2013 with the top crypto seeing a pullback of 21.5% at its lowest point.\n\n\u201cThe #Bitcoin \u2018experts\u2019 who ridiculed me and anyone else who claimed the new #BitcoinETFs would be a \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 event, are now dismissing the significance of the decline, claiming it's just a classic \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 event that was to be expected,\u201d Schiff tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nDespite the launch of the ETFs and the potential inflows that could follow, Schiff maintains his position that BTC will ultimately go to zero.\n\n\u201cThe new #BitcoinETFs aren't creating additional demand, but merely shifting demand,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors who might have bought actual #Bitcoin, Bitcoin-related equities like $MSTR, or $GBTC are simply buying the new ETFs instead. Rearranging the deck chairs won't stop the ship from sinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is how #Bitcoin works,\u201d he added. \u201cWe create something with no value, then artificially limit its supply. Then we all pretend it has value and buy it. Other people see the price going up and they buy it too. Then we all [keep] #HODLing it hoping everyone keeps pretending it has value.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how low the price of #Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim its outperformed #gold,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x.\u201d\n\nX user Trendonomics followed up Schiff's last post with the question, \u201cWhat if #bitcoin goes to $10,000,00 by 2031?\u201d\n\nTo which he replied, \u201cIf the U.S. dollar goes the way of the German Papiermark then I supposed that's possible.\u201d\n\nSchiff was referring to the hyperinflation that occurred in Germany between 1921 and 1923 when the German Papiermark national currency plunged at an unprecedented rate, at one point reaching an exchange rate of 4,210,500,000,000:1 with the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhile Schiff might have been responding in jest, hyperinflation does indeed remain a risk, as the U.S. debt \u2013 along with the debt of many nations around the world \u2013 is starting to increase at an exponential rate.\n\nData provided by usdebtclock.org shows that the U.S. national debt currently stands at $34.1 trillion, an increase of more than $1 trillion since the end of Q3 2023. In January alone, the debt expanded from $33.990 trillion to $34.1 trillion, an increase of 122 billion in 26 days.\n\nHas no one else noticed this from Q4 GDP report? Annualized interest on the federal debt now exceeds $1 trillion and is projected to breach $3 trillion, annualized rate, by Q4 2030 - INSANE and UNSUSTAINABLE: pic.twitter.com/7uHEpHk4WA \u2014 E.J. Antoni, Ph.D. (@RealEJAntoni) January 25, 2024\n\nThe federal deficit currently stands at -6.460% of the GDP, meaning government expenditures significantly outweigh revenues. This means the government will need to borrow more funds to make up the difference, further increasing the total debt.\n\nThe matter has become so dire that it is one of the few things in the current political climate that has bipartisan appeal in Congress.\n\nSenators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Representatives Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Scott Peters (D-CA) wrote an op-ed on The Hill warning that the U.S. national debt is exploding at an unsustainable rate.\n\n\u201cIn just 10 years, the national debt has more than doubled. Not only is this level of debt unsustainable, but it is growing at the largest rate seen in the history of this country,\u201d they said. \u201c$34 trillion is a staggering amount of money. To put this in context, the national debt has now exceeded $100,000 for every person in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterest payments on the debt totaled $659 billion in the last fiscal year, making it the fourth largest expenditure in the budget,\u201d they added. \u201cIn the next few years, interest payments are on pace to exceed both defense and non-defense discretionary spending, which includes education, transportation and more. And if we continue at this rate of fiscal imbalance, in the not-so-distant future, interest payments will be our largest expenditure.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, we must find bipartisan solutions that stabilize our nation\u2019s finances for future generations\u2026 The national debt is the greatest threat our country faces \u2013 and we are rapidly approaching the crisis point,\u201d they warned. \u201cGiven the imminent nature of this crisis, continuing to turn a blind eye will only put the American Dream further out of reach for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nTo help start the process of addressing this issue, they proposed \u201cthe establishment of a bipartisan, bicameral fiscal commission tasked with finding solutions to strengthen our fiscal health and meaningfully decrease the national debt.\u201d\n\nThe 16-member commission would include 12 members of Congress and four outside experts, equally appointed by congressional leaders, they said.\n\n\u201cWe were elected to lead, and that involves making sacrifices and tough decisions,\u201d they concluded. \u201cThere is growing appetite on both sides of the aisle to address our national debt. It is time for Congress to put the interests of the country ahead of political expediency and get us on sound fiscal footing before it is too late.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009 during the great financial crisis and was intended to combat the issues we now face. While Schiff has lambasted the top crypto for more than a decade, he may have inadvertently highlighted one of the best arguments for holding Bitcoin in a digital world that is headed toward a currency reckoning."

        "title": "A 'bad recession' is a trigger for massive market selloff, Bitcoin price at risk of falling to $15000 \u2013 Gareth Soloway - KITCO",
        "content": "(Kitco News) - With just over two weeks since the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs and millions of inflows, the price of Bitcoin is down around 14% off its recent highs. However, a bigger risk for the world's largest cryptocurrency is a market selloff triggered by a bad recession, according to Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at VerifiedInvesting.com.\n\nFollowing the spot Bitcoin ETFs approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, assets under management (AUM) of those funds beat that of silver ETFs. More specifically, AUM of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is currently at around $25 billion, while silver ETFs are at about $11.5 billion in assets. The only commodity ahead of Bitcoin is gold, with approximately $96 billion in assets.\n\nDespite opening the door to institutions and more general investors, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop from a recent peak of around $49,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $41,953.\n\nSoloway, who correctly forecasted a \"sell on the news\" event for the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs back in October, told Michelle Makori, Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News, that it is all about previous Bitcoin trading patterns.\n\n\"If we go back to the 2017 Bitcoin bull market high \u2014 that was when the futures basically debuted,\" Soloway said. \"There was a lot of hype that took us up into that news. And that was the high of the cycle. If we go to the first high in 2021, that was the IPO of Coinbase. And that marked the high. These big news stories create so much hype and the top in Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe breakdown of the ETF inflows and outflows reveals additional information on what has been happening in the market.\n\nBlackRock and Fidelity have dominated the Bitcoin-ETF flow race, with about $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of inflows, respectively, according to the latest Bloomberg data. On the other hand, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) \u2014 the world's largest cryptocurrency fund with $20.2 billion in assets \u2014 saw around $4.8 billion of outflows since it converted into an ETF.\n\n\"GBTC is selling bitcoin \u2014 a lot of smart money bought ahead of this news. GBTC was trading at a big discount, so it was also an extra bonus to them. They're taking profits. And that creates this move to the downside,\" Soloway noted.\n\nAnother reason for the outflows is the GBTC's fee of 1.5%, which is much higher than that of its competitors. In comparison, BlackRock and Fidelity's fees are 0.25% after a waiver period. \"So there's going to be a certain amount of money that is going to sell the GBTC and then eventually rotate into these other ETFs that have much lower fees,\" Soloway said.\n\nThis is the next risk for Bitcoin\n\nSoloway pointed out that the selling in Bitcoin will likely balance out in the next couple of weeks but warned that another risk could hit the cryptocurrency.\n\n\"My bigger fear and this is the one bearish case that I have for Bitcoin, is what happens if we get a market top in the S&P? What happens if we get a de-risking event in the overall markets, in the equity markets?\" Soloway asked.\n\nA selloff in equities could spell more trouble for spot Bitcoin ETF inflows as people get fearful. \"I do worry that Bitcoin could head back down. If we saw a 50% drop in the stock market, I do see Bitcoin retesting that $15,000 level,\" Soloway said.\n\nSo far this year, the stock market has been performing well, with the S&P 500 and the Dow hitting new all-time highs and the Nasdaq trading close to record highs. However, Soloway said past Bitcoin trading patterns point to a potential top in the market.\n\n\"Right now, we see new all-time highs almost daily. But why is Bitcoin stalling out? One thing I'd like to point out is that if you look at the past cycles of Bitcoin, it topped out in December 2017, and the S&P topped out six weeks later in early 2018. If you go to 2021, the Bitcoin $69,000 high was put in November, and six weeks later, the S&P topped out. I'm a little bit on alert here. Let's watch now what happens over the next three-plus weeks,\" he stated.\n\nSoloway also highlighted that the mainstream narrative about the market's solid performance is false, noting that only the tech sector is performing well.\n\nFor Soloway's technical analysis of the stock market and the specific levels he is watching on the Nasdaq, watch the video above.\n\nIf Bitcoin starts to sell off, the first level Soloway would be buying more is the $30,000-$32,000 level. But there is a chance it might drop even lower. For his call on the timing of the move down, the potential bottom in prices, and the long-term upside potential, watch the video above.\n\nSoloway remains bullish on the gold market in 2024; for his price forecast, fundamental drivers, and technical analysis, watch the video above."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe U.S. government is set to auction more than 2,930 BTC, which was confiscated in the Silk Road investigation.\n\nThis decision comes after the Court authorized the forfeiture in the case involving Joseph Farace.\n\nThe auction represents a move in the government\u2019s strategy for managing digital assets linked to criminal activities.\n\nThe U.S. government has announced its intention to sell $130 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) that was confiscated in connection with the Silk Road darknet marketplace.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s statement , they plan to dispose of two separate lots of Bitcoin as directed by the U.S. Attorney General.\n\nU.S. to sell $130 million worth of Bitcoin seized from Silk Road\n\nThese lots include 2,874.9 BTC, valued at approximately $129 million, and a smaller lot of 58.7 BTC, estimated at $3.3 million.\n\nThe notice issued also permits third parties, excluding defendants, to assert their interest in the confiscated property through an ancillary petition.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US Government files notice to sell $130 million worth of #Bitcoin seized from Silk Road. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 25, 2024\n\nThis opportunity is available for a period of 60 days starting from January 10. Additionally, the notice provides for the submission of petitions for remission or mitigation, which could potentially lead to the exemption of some or all of the seized Bitcoin from being forfeited.\n\nSeized Bitcoin from Xanax Dealer and Rogue U.S. Agent Up for Sale\n\nThe Bitcoin set for U.S. government sale originally belonged to two individuals involved in separate criminal activities. The first batch was confiscated from Ryan Farace , a Maryland man convicted alongside his father in a money laundering scheme linked to darknet Xanax sales .\n\nThis lot also includes Bitcoin stolen by Sean Bridges , a former U.S. Secret Service agent who was involved in the Silk Road investigations and pilfered Bitcoin earlier seized by the government. The second, smaller batch was exclusively seized from Bridges.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 U.S Government files notice to sell $130 million of #Bitcoin seized from Silk Road FBI agents that stole it from the Silk Road #FreeRoss pic.twitter.com/MV1zIiDc2w \u2014 TMG \u20bf (@MartiniGuyYT) January 26, 2024\n\nThese seizures occurred on February 10, 2021, in Memphis, Tennessee, and May 11, 2021, in Arlington, Virginia, respectively. A Maryland District Court ordered the forfeiture of this Bitcoin to the U.S. government on January 8, 2024.\n\n\u201cThe United States hereby gives notice of its intent to dispose of the forfeited property in such manner as the United States Attorney General may direct,\u201d court documents stated .\n\nUS Government Holds $9 Bn in Bitcoin Seized From Criminals\n\nThese assets are just a fraction of the Silk Road-related Bitcoin seizures made by the U.S. government. Previous significant seizures include Bitcoin from Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht around 2013, $3.6 billion from James Zhong in 2022, and approximately $1 billion around 2020.\n\nSo now the U.S. government is making a massive profit on the #bitcoin it seized from the Silk Road, and Ross Ulbricht is still in prison serving a double life sentence for creating an open website\u2026 Meanwhile, not a single Big Banker ever goes to jail for their crimes\u2026 \u2014 Walker\u26a1\ufe0f (@WalkerAmerica) January 25, 2024\n\nAs of December 2023, the U.S. government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at about $9 billion, not all of which stemmed from Silk Road-related seizures.\n\nImpact of Upcoming Bitcoin Auction Post Silk Road Case\n\nThe impending auction of the seized Bitcoin marks a critical moment in the fight against the financial operations supporting illegal dark web marketplaces such as Silk Road. This step taken by the U.S. government underlines its commitment to combating cybercrime and emphasizes the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in both lawful and unlawful activities.\n\nThe US Government is selling their seized Silk Road #bitcoin and is helping give you a once in a lifetime buying opportunity. STFU and BTFD, Piglet! pic.twitter.com/3gfQ9NbYii \u2014 WeAreSatoshi (@We_Are_Satoshi) January 25, 2024\n\nThis auction, involving a significant volume of Bitcoin, could potentially influence the cryptocurrency market, though the extent of this effect is yet to be determined. The event is poised to draw significant interest from cryptocurrency investors and observers monitoring the government\u2019s continuous efforts to counter cybercrime and illegal online activities."

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin unveiled its stealth mining unit that has been operating since last summer.\n\nMining unit's capacity planned to almost double by March, in advance of April halving.\n\nBitcoin financial services company Swan Bitcoin finally shined a light on its mining subsidiary, Swan Mining, which has been operating in stealth mode since last summer and has already mined more than 750 Bitcoin, it said in a statement.\n\nSwan Mining already supplies 4.5 exahash to the Bitcoin network, which means that about one of every 100 Bitcoins mined globally comes from Swan.\n\n\u201cSwan Mining developed and deployed at warp speed, \" said Rapha Zagury, CIO at Swan and head of Swan Mining. \u201cOur understanding is that this is the fastest-ever initial deployment of hashrate at this scale in Bitcoin history.\u201d\n\nThe unit has purchased and taken delivery of mining equipment that will bring its total capacity to more than 8 exahash, with full deployment expected by March.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe timing is interesting, because as DL News has reported, Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving most likely in April.\n\nHalving is the mechanism by which the protocol slashes by half the number of Bitcoins it gives to miners who successfully add a block to the network\u2019s distributed ledger.\n\nScheduled roughly every four years, halvings have historically led to increases in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The usual explanation: Fewer coins are mined, so fewer coins enter the market, creating a supply shock.\n\nBut with almost 93% of the total supply of Bitcoin already issued, it\u2019s worth questioning whether the forthcoming, modest reduction from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins given to miners per block mined will have the same impact.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe halving\n\nWithout an accompanying increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the halving will simply slash mining revenues in half, while operational costs will remain the same.\n\nStill, the funding model for Swan\u2019s mining business uses no debt, and its entities are legally segregated from the rest of Swan\u2019s business, according to the statement.\n\nZagury noted: \u201cWe bring financial expertise and operational excellence, while our investors provide equity capital to our mining unit in exchange for priority on initial payouts and continued shared upside.\u201d\n\nCalifornia-based parent Swan raised and deployed $205 million of capital across its equity, credit, and hedge funds last year, and currently generates $125 million of revenue annually, it said in a statement.\n\nSwan founder and CEO Cory Klippsten said the company is actively working to achieve a public listing within the next 12 months."

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency services firm, has announced the launch of its mining operations. The company, which is preparing for a public listing, aims to achieve a hash rate of 8 exahashes per second (EH/s) by 2024.\n\nThe newly unveiled mining unit is already operational, as reported by CoinDesk, and is part of Swan Bitcoin\u2019s strategic growth ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The mining operation is expected to bolster the company\u2019s revenue streams and provide a foundation for its public market debut.\n\nBitcoin mining is the network\u2019s consensus mechanism by which new Bitcoins are entered into circulation. In this process also known as proof-of-work, node operators, or miners, validate transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards.\n\nBitcoin adds a new block of transactions to its blockchain every 10 minutes which comes with 6.25 Bitcoins as the miner\u2019s reward. This amount is cut in half roughly every four years, in an event known as \u201cthe halving.\u201d\n\nAs halving slows down the amount of Bitcoin generation, some market watchers argue that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity increases every halving cycle which can have a positive effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nThe next halving is expected to occur this coming April and will reduce mining rewards to 3.125 Bitcoins per block."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin surpassed $42,000 on Jan. 26 amidst significant spot Bitcoin ETF flows and an upgrade to Coinbase\u2019s stock rating.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was valued at $42,040.36 with a market cap of $824.4 billion at 8:05 pm UTC on Friday. That marks 5.3% growth over 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price also represents a five-day high, as prices were close to $40,000 on Jan. 24 and 25 and as low as $38,678 on Jan. 23\n\nThe cryptocurrency market in its entirety was up 4.6% over 24 hours. Other top ten assets saw comparable price gains today: Avalanche (AVAX) was up 7.3%, Solana (SOL) was up 5.9%, XRP was up 3.7%, BNB was up 3.5%, Cardano (ADA) was up 3.3%, and Ethereum (ETH) was up 1.9%.\n\nThe market saw $116 million in liquidations over 24 hours, according to Coinglass data, with Bitcoin (BTC) accounting for $43.23 million of liquidations and Ethereum (ETH) accounting for $23.52 million of liquidations.\n\nGains may be due to ETF flows, Coinbase rating\n\nThough it is not entirely known why Bitcoin has gained value today, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows are one major influence on the market.\n\nOutflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC ETF are now slowing and may have largely concluded, according to a report from JP Morgan on Jan. 25. High GBTC outflows put more Bitcoin (BTC) onto the market, providing a larger supply in comparison to investor demand. Such outflows likely contributed to falling Bitcoin prices in the weeks following various spot Bitcoin ETF approvals on Jan. 10.\n\nConversely, inflows into other funds have taken Bitcoin off the market and may be helping to raise prices. Although most spot Bitcoin ETFs have positive inflows, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) notably crossed $2 billion in total inflows on Jan. 26. Net inflows for all spot Bitcoin ETFs amount to $744 million.\n\nOther positive developments may have influenced crypto prices as well. Yahoo! Finance analysts noted that Coinbase (COIN)\u2019s stock rating has been upgraded by Oppenheimer & Co. The price of COIN is also up 3.40% today.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Discover SCENE\n\nAre you shocked to see the price of Bitcoin (BTC) take a nosedive since the historic approval of long-awaited crypto spot ETFs?\n\nWell, it\u2019s going to fall a lot further, according to one expert.\n\nEchoing comments this week from mega-rich crypto trader Arthur Hayes\u2014Chris Burniske, partner at venture capital firm Placeholder\u2014said that BTC could keep dipping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason? Burniske on Friday wrote on Twitter that it comes down to \u201cmacro adoption [and] new product development.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin [will go] to at least $30-36K before a local bottom, and [I] wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we test the mid-to-high 20s before all is said and done,\u201d he said.\n\nContinue to think we go lower to consolidate than most people expect due to variables that are too many to explain in detail via tweet (eg, crypto-market specific, macro, adoption, new product development). As for the denial out there... takes time for partiers to sober up, saw\u2026 \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 25, 2024\n\nBut the former crypto lead at ARK Invest also said that over the long-term, BTC would go up and eventually touch new all-time highs.\n\n\u201cAs always, patience is your friend,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe path to get there will be volatile.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBTC was one the best-performing assets globally last year. It started 2023 at below $17,000 per coin and finished priced at over $42,000.\n\nBut despite some experts claiming that the price would rocket following the approval and trading of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on Wall Street, the largest virtual coin has taken a battering after briefly closing in on $49,000.\n\nIt is now priced at $42,083, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nThe biggest and oldest cryptocurrency is still well-below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

While Bitcoins (BTC) still flow to exchanges, Ethereum (ETH) reserves started leaving CEXes. Is the crypto correction close to ending?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price tanks on GBTC FUD and institutions taking profit, IntoTheBlock says\n\nThe price correction of Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is caused by the FUD about Grayscale's mass-selling and profit-taking initiated by largest players. Such statements were made by top research platform IntoTheBlock in its recent on-chain insights report.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we evaluate the claims behind the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF FUD. We analyze ETF flows, look at Bitcoin whales\u2019 holdings, and underreported factors potentially dragging the market. \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/s4bIgKq1VK \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 27, 2024\n\nBased on its tracking mechanisms, IntoTheBlock confirmed a $4.3 billion outflow from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Technically, Grayscale's GBTC, which had been at a discount relative to the firm's Bitcoin (BTC) holdings for two years, was converted into an ETF. This caused whopping outflows that contributed to the BTC price tumbling.\n\nEven being accompanied by a $1 billion outflow from the FTX holdings portfolio, this catalyst should not be overestimated. Despite these negative processes, Bitcoin ETFs registered a significant $820 million net inflow, which hints at solid interest from large buyers.\n\nThe addresses holding over 1,000 BTC each are buying en masse, data says. They were increasing their holdings through the entire year of 2023, but in January this process accelerated.\n\nAt the same time, large hedge funds decided to take profits, which is also a major bearish price catalyst. Their activity pushed the price to new local highs in Q4, 2023, but now the situation looks the opposite:\n\nAs the ETF approval window began we see that premium in futures quickly turning into a discount suggesting firms began taking profits\n\nBy printing time, Bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $41,715; the largest cryptocurrency recovered almost 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBTC price's negative catalysts losing steam?\n\nHowever, in the last days, some positive news for Bitcoin (BTC) arrived. IntoTheBlock says GBTC outflows have also slowed down in the last two days.\n\nAlso, China's central bank announced its readiness to inject $140 billion into its financial system, which might be another catalyst for the crypto capitalization surge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today yesterday, digital assets expert Ilan Solot from Marex Solutions said that \"the worst was over\" for crypto as the GBTC bearish narrative failed to push the Bitcoin (BTC) price lower."

Seemingly, Blixt is opening the channel with a second on-chain transaction while the other wallets conceal that second transaction somehow, because the channel opened immediately after the first transaction confirmation. Not with Blixt: I sent the first transaction and the confirmation took some hours, it was evening already, so I had to leave the friend's house. As soon as it was confirmed, Blixt carried out the second on-chain transaction, which took again several hours because the mempool was full. When the second transaction was confirmed I was back in the house where I'm living, with internet speed only around 3 Mbps download, 0.26 upload and a Ping over 300ms. Blixt wasn't able to open the channel in these circumstances . I needed to go back to my friend's house to finish the channel opening. It's hard to say how other wallets would have performed under these conditions."
