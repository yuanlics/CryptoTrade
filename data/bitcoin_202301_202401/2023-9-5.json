        "title": "Texas paid a bitcoin miner more than $31 million to power down during heat wave - Texas Public Radio",
        "content": "Get TPR's best stories of the day and a jump start to the weekend with the 321 Newsletter \u2014 straight to your inbox every day. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) paid a bitcoin miner $31.7 million in energy credits in August to not mine bitcoin.\n\nDuring the August heat wave, ERCOT issued eight calls for voluntary energy conservation.\n\nPeople were asked to adjust home thermostats or delay doing laundry during the energy call.\n\nBut for the bitcoin miner Riot \u2014 located in Rockdale \u2014it was an opportunity to cash in.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s monthly report, it curtailed its power usage by more than 95% during peak demand by powering down its computers that were grinding out bitcoins.\n\n\"Texas experienced another month of extreme heat in August 2023, causing demand for electricity to spike, in some cases approaching total available supply,\"the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Riot continued to execute its power strategy by curtailing its power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand, forgoing revenue from its Bitcoin mining operations to instead provide energy resources to ERCOT. The company\u2019s curtailment of operations meaningfully contributed to reducing overall power demand in ERCOT, helping to ensure that consumers did not experience interruptions in service.\n\nRiot received an estimated $24.2 million in power curtailment credits under its contract with ERCOT and $7.4 million from ERCOT\u2019s demand response program.\n\nRiot made more from energy credits in August than it did from actual bitcoin mining.\n\nThe company has plans to build another facility in Corsicana, with 1GW of capacity approved by ERCOT.\n\nThe credits Texas offers to the bitcoin mining industry has made it a sought-after state for these companies to do business.\n\nA bill that would have done away with those credits passed the State Senate earlier this year, but it failed to advance past committee in the House. The Texas Legislature ended up passing two bills that expand the credits. They took effect Sept. 1."

        "title": "Bitcoin: What You Need to Know - Ramsey - Ramsey Solutions",
        "content": "Bitcoin, and digital currencies like it, are best known for two things: They\u2019re really hard to understand and their value is all over the map. Just last week, the value of the cryptocurrency market dropped by $150 billion in 24 hours!1\n\nEven so, investors have been looking for ways to make money on Bitcoin since it was created in 2009. Businesses are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon too, with more than one-third of small- and medium-sized businesses accepting it as payment.2 And it\u2019s gaining popularity with bigger businesses like AT&T, Microsoft and Overstock. Even Wikipedia takes donations in bitcoin.3\n\nSo, is bitcoin just another get-rich-quick scheme or a legit investment worthy of your hard-earned cash? Let\u2019s talk about it.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the most widely known type of cryptocurrency\u2014aka digital money. There are no bills to print or coins to make. It\u2019s all done over the internet using complex computing and coding. Like gold, bitcoins are worth what people are willing to pay or exchange for them.\n\nThere are currently over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies floating around the internet, and most play off of Bitcoin\u2019s concept: anonymous and nationless digital cash. These include Ethereum, Ripple\u2019s XRP, Litecoin, Tether and Bitcoin Cash (a totally different currency, despite its namesake).4 But none are as accepted as their prototype, Bitcoin.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin users exchange their digital \u201ccoins\u201d for goods and services or trade them for cash. They pay electronically using a computer or mobile app, sort of like sending money via PayPal. Both bitcoin mining (don\u2019t worry\u2014we'll explain that later) and trading are handled anonymously, making the cryptocurrency scene prime for cybercrimes, like phishing and blackmail schemes.5 All that, combined with the fact Bitcoin is not regulated by any bank or tied to any country, makes for a scary combination.\n\nSo why is Bitcoin such a buzzword? In 2017, Bitcoin began building credibility when a large financial firm created a futures exchange for the currency.6 Let\u2019s break down what that means: Futures exchange is fancy investment lingo for a central marketplace where you buy and sell futures contracts. Futures contracts obligate a buyer or seller to buy or sell a certain type and amount of an asset (like gold) at a certain price. Depending on what people are willing to pay for these assets, futures contracts help determine the value of the asset. The Bitcoin futures exchange allowed investors to participate in the rise and fall of its value without actually having to buy the currency.\n\nIn 2020, more investment companies began to embrace Bitcoin, and many large, household-name companies started to buy and hold bitcoins as assets, adding to Bitcoin\u2019s credibility.7 And it looks like a bitcoin-associated exchange-traded fund could be approved this year.8\n\nHow Do You Buy Bitcoin?\n\nIf you are willing to take on the risk, you only need a digital currency account, like Coinbase, CEX.IO or Kraken to purchase a bitcoin. PayPal also allows its users to buy, hold and sell bitcoins. These accounts act as a digital wallet\u2014just upload your information and money and you can buy bitcoins. The process is actually scarily easy.\n\nHow Do You Mine Bitcoin?\n\nMining is the only way new bitcoins are released. It\u2019s super technical and complicated, but when you boil it all down, these anonymous miners are essentially validating a block (one megabyte) of bitcoin transactions\u2014and they have to be the first to solve a numeric problem to get paid. A miner who\u2019s lucky enough to jump through these hoops is paid 6.25 bitcoin per block ($100,000).9\n\nMarket chaos, inflation, your future\u2014work with a pro to navigate this stuff.\n\nThis is a weird, not to mention uncertain, payment agreement \u2014especially when you think about the vast brain and computing power it takes to mine bitcoins. We definitely don\u2019t recommend it\u2014even as a side gig.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin limited the overall supply to 21 million, but the last bitcoin won\u2019t be mined until sometime in 2140.10\n\nHow Much Is Bitcoin Worth?\n\nBitcoin is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay. Without a governing authority\u2014like we have for nationally based currencies\u2014or the correlation to earnings\u2014like we have for stock prices\u2014it\u2019s really up to buyers. This is another huge risk that comes with the cryptocurrency world. The lack of a consistent pricing tool is one of the major reasons we see such huge swings in a bitcoin\u2019s worth.\n\nIn July 2010, a bitcoin was only worth eight cents. Its value had ups and downs in those early years, but continued to trend up until it broke the $1,000 mark in November of 2013. It dropped off before rising to $1,000 again in early 2017. That\u2019s when things started to get crazy. Bitcoin\u2019s value reached $5,000 in October that year, then doubled to $10,000 in November. By mid-December its value was almost $20,000! The bubble finally burst, and the value dropped to about $3,500 by November 2018.11\n\nThen, in 2020, the bitcoin roller coaster started trending up again. Its value climbed more than 300% to an all-time high of just under $42,000 per bitcoin before the latest cryptocurrency crash.12\n\nWhat Are The Risks of Bitcoin?\n\nThe biggest and most obvious risk of investing in bitcoin is its volatility. Sure, it sounds great to have your money grow by 300% in a year, but how will you feel when the bottom drops out? And based on the past performance and volatility it most likely will.\n\nWe want you to invest your money in something you can fully understand\u2014something that has a track record\u2014so you can see how it\u2019s performed over the long-term. We are not interested in seeing money grow 300% in a year. We're interested in long-term compound growth that builds real wealth for your retirement dreams.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s other big red flag? It\u2019s downright mysterious! Bitcoin\u2019s creator goes by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who he or she really is.13 All the transactions are anonymous, which is really shady. Plus, there\u2019s no basis for a bitcoin\u2019s value and it\u2019s completely unregulated. That adds up to a lot of unnecessary risk\u2014and we don\u2019t want you to take unnecessary risks with your retirement or your future.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: If you can\u2019t explain an investment to a seventh grader, don\u2019t put your money in it. Your family and your retirement are too important.\n\nShould You Invest in Bitcoin?\n\nIn case you missed the point, we\u2019ll say it again: Never risk your retirement on an investment that\u2019s too complicated or unreasonably risky just because it\u2019s the new, trendy thing to do. Build your wealth slow and steady by investing in mutual funds with a history of strong performance.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re investing at least 15% of your income for retirement, and you\u2019re on track to meet your retirement goal , there\u2019s room to talk about investing some of your money in other ways. After you talk to your investing professional about your mutual fund investments and get that all squared away, ask them about the best way to invest in your financial future. That way your retirement is secure, and you might choose to participate in other new ways to invest.\n\nOur SmartVestor program is a free and easy way to connect with an experienced investing professional in your area who can answer all your questions about investing for retirement and, when you\u2019re ready, investing for fun."

        "content": "Hundreds of millions of people have crypto investments. A new report shows how many crypto millionaires and billionaires exist.\n\nHundreds of millions of people around the world have some form of crypto holdings, whether that is in bitcoin or one of the many other digital currencies.\n\nTo be exact, 425 million people use crypto, according to Henley & Partners' Crypto Wealth Report, which was released by the investment migration consultancy on Tuesday.\n\nCrypto may no longer be booming in the same way as it did at the peak of its popularity, but it remains a highly common investment. For example, over half of Gen Z (between the ages of 18 and 25) have invested in it, a report by the CFA Institute and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's Investor Education Foundation showed earlier this year.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Americans however aren't sure that investing in, trading or using cryptocurrency is currently safe or that they can rely on the currently available tools to do so, a Pew Research survey found in April. Forty-five percent of those surveyed also said their investments hadn't done as well as they thought they would \u2014 and only 15% said it had exceeded expectations.\n\nBut some seem to have found more success with crypto, and now have holdings worth millions or even billions of U.S. dollars, according to Henley & Partners.\n\nThe firm's report on Tuesday says says 88,200 people have crypto assets worth at least $1 million \u2014 less than 1% of overall crypto users. Some 40,500 of them hold their investments in bitcoin, just under 46% of the total.\n\nFar fewer people are so-called centi-millionaires who have crypto holdings valued at over $100 million. Just 182 such investors exist, with a reported 78 of them focused on bitcoin.\n\nAnd 22 people have crypto holdings worth at least $1 billion. Six of them hold their investments in bitcoin \u2014 a far smaller proportion than among the crypto millionaires and centi-millionaires.\n\nFor comparison, the total value of the crypto market, at the time the report was written, was $1.18 trillion."

        "content": "Almost half a billion people around the world have invested in some form of cryptocurrency\u2014but only 22 of those investors have billions of dollars of those holdings.\n\nIn its 2023 Crypto Wealth Report, published Tuesday, Henley & Partners said 210 million people globally were invested in Bitcoin by the end of June, while a total of 425 million held cryptocurrencies of some kind.\n\nAccording to the report, six\u2014or almost one in three\u2014of the world\u2019s crypto billionaires reached that status by holding Bitcoin.\n\nThat means just 0.000003% of those who hold Bitcoin have Bitcoin assets worth more than $1 billion.\n\nIn the wider crypto space, 0.000005% of cryptocurrency investors\u2019 assets are valued at more than $1 billion, according to the figures in the report.\n\nInvestors were much more likely to have gained millionaire status than a 10-figure net worth via their crypto holdings, Henley & Partners said, with 88,200\u2014or 0.02%\u2014of the world\u2019s crypto investors owning cryptocurrencies worth at least $1 million.\n\nBitcoin has created a similar proportion of millionaires, according to the investment migration consultancy, with 40,500 of those invested in the most widely traded cryptocurrency seeing their assets reach a value of at least $1 million.\n\nThe industry also created a number of centimillionaires\u2014people with crypto holdings of $100 million or more\u2014with 78 individuals deriving that wealth from Bitcoin and 182 gaining it from any form of cryptocurrency, the report said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the individuals referenced in the report initially invested in the cryptocurrencies, or how much their crypto assets had gained or lost since they held them. Henley & Partners did not immediately reply to Fortune\u2018s request for comment.\n\nWhich countries are most keen on crypto?\n\nAs part of its deep dive into the world of crypto investors, Henley & Partners also analyzed which countries had adopted cryptocurrencies most widely.\n\nThe consultancy found that the U.S. had the third-biggest public adoption of cryptocurrencies, trailing behind the UAE and Singapore.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada rounded out the top five.\n\nHenley & Partners created the Crypto Wealth Report in partnership with New World Wealth, using public information from major crypto platforms like Binance and Etherscan, as well as their own in-house databases.\n\nThe organizations measured public adoption of cryptocurrencies via the level of awareness, interest, and engagement in the general population. To score individual countries, researchers used indicators such as the percentage of crypto users relative to the total population, Google search interest, and the number of institutions in each location that offered courses on blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto misfortunes\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are notoriously volatile, and being prone to wild swings in value has prompted warnings from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon about their worth as investments.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, U.S. regulators have taken steps to crack down on malpractice allegedly being undertaken in the crypto sector, suing Binance and Coinbase in quick succession earlier this year.\n\nThe legal action weighed on an already suffering crypto industry, with crypto assets across the board still reeling from 2022\u2019s widespread selloff that became known as the Crypto Winter.\n\nLast year\u2019s downturn saw more than $200 billion wiped off the market in a single day back in June, with some experts predicting the phenomenon\u2014which saw many crypto investors\u2019 life savings wiped out overnight\u2014could last through 2023 and possibly into 2024.\n\nThe spectacular implosion of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 led to some speculation over whether the world was witnessing \u201cthe end of crypto,\u201d with some heralding the company\u2019s collapse as the cryptocurrency market\u2019s \u201cLehman moment.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has recovered somewhat from last year\u2019s lowest point, but at today\u2019s price of just below $26,000 the digital token is still far from its all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nInvestors \u2018shouldn\u2019t put blind faith in crypto\u2019\n\nCarl Hazeley, head analyst at retail investor platform Finimize, told Fortune on Wednesday it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d only 22 of the 425,000 people who held crypto assets had become billionaires through those investments.\n\n\u201cIn fact, most retail investors actually lost money from investing in the space,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ever since [the Crypto Winter], headlines have predominantly been filled with negative crypto stories and the collapse of prominent companies. This means the mainstream audience isn\u2019t putting, and shouldn\u2019t put, any blind faith in crypto.\u201d\n\nHazeley, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who led the IPO of food delivery giant Just Eat during his time with the banking giant, added that investors determined to put money in crypto should be watching out for signs of real-world use cases that could lead to mass adoption, like central bank digital currencies and popular payments platforms integrating digital tokens.\n\n\u201cFor those who are interested in individual crypto projects, coins like bitcoin and Ethereum seem to be a safer, more promising bet than early-stage projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say you should throw out your digital coins immediately. It could be worth holding onto the crypto you have, just in case it ramps up one day\u2014but don\u2019t bet on it.\u201d"

        "title": "Long-Awaited Bitcoin Accounting Rules to Capture Rises, Dips (2) - Bloomberg Tax",
        "content": "Crypto companies and other businesses with significant holdings of digital currencies will get long-awaited accounting rules to measure the value of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto in their coffers, US accounting standard-setters unanimously voted Wednesday.\n\nUnder new rules expected to be published by year end, companies that hold or invest in cryptocurrency will be required to report their holdings at fair value, a measurement that aims to capture the most up-to-date value of an asset\u2014including rebounds in value after prices dip. While the new standard will inject volatility into the earnings of companies that are heavily invested in crypto, the ability to record recoveries will be an improvement over the current practice, companies and accountants have told the Financial Accounting Standards Board for months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that we can both take cost out of the system and improve the decision usefulness of information, and it makes it a really easy vote to do both of those,\u201d FASB member Christine Botosan said.\n\nThe rules will go into effect as soon as 2025, but companies will have the option to apply them early, FASB agreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great step forward for the entire crypto market. I think it\u2019s a great step toward mainstream adoption,\u201d said Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at accounting software company Cryptio. \u201cI can see finalizing this proposal to help large corporations that are maybe scared to hold crypto on their balance sheet because they\u2019re scared of the technical complexities.\u201d\n\nRulebook Gaps\n\nNo part of the rulebook for US accounting specifically addresses how companies like enterprise software maker MicroStrategy Inc., automaker Tesla Inc., or crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. should recognize and measure the digital currencies they own.\n\nCompanies currently default to an American Institute of CPAs practice guide that treats most cryptocurrency as an intangible asset, a category that includes things like trademarks, copyrights, and brands\u2014all items that, unlike crypto, are rarely traded. This means companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and assess their holdings every quarter for impairments, or value declines. If the price of Bitcoin drops even briefly during the period, it\u2019s considered impaired. Companies can\u2019t revise values upward if the market recovers.\n\nThis accounting method routinely dings the earnings of MicroStrategy, the largest public company holder of crypto.\n\nFair-value crypto reporting \u201cwould enable us to provide investors with a more relevant view of our financial position and the economic value of our bitcoin holdings, which in turn would facilitate the ability of investors to make informed investment and capital allocation decisions,\u201d MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang wrote to FASB in May, responding to the board\u2019s original proposal.\n\nThe accounting rules will be mandatory for all companies\u2014public and private\u2014for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. This means 2025 adoption for calendar year-end companies. Companies will be allowed to adopt the rules once FASB formally publishes them later this year.\n\nCompanies are already required to present intangible assets as a line item in their balance sheets. Under the new rules, companies will have to make a separate entry for their crypto assets so investors and other readers of financial statements get a clear picture of how much a company is invested in crypto.\n\nIn addition, they will disclose in their footnotes every reporting period significant holdings of crypto and any restrictions on those holdings. On an annual basis, they will have to reconcile\u2014or disclose changes in the opening and closing balances of\u2014their crypto assets, broken out by category. They will not need to include within the reconciliation activity information about crypto assets received as payments and immediately converted to cash, FASB agreed Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, since crypto will be measured at fair value, companies will be subject to the disclosures required in the appliacable accounting rules, ASC 820, so financial statement readers know how companies came up with their measurements, FASB agreed.\n\nLong Journey\n\nFASB has rejected three separate requests since 2017 to write rules for crypto, reasoning that too few companies use Bitcoin in a material way. The board changed its tune once major companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy started investing in the blockchain-traded asset.\n\nThe board kept its focus narrow, covering assets that are created or reside on distributed ledgers based on blockchain technology and are secured through cryptography. The crypto assets have to be currently classified as intangible assets, as defined by US accounting rules, and fungible, meaning they can be interchanged with assets of the same type.\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs\u2014unique digital tokens that can be anything from video clips to digital sports trading cards\u2014won\u2019t be covered by the rules. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens\u2014digital tokens that allow crypto from one blockchain to be used on another\u2014also aren\u2019t covered.\n\nSeveral groups, including all four Big Four accounting firms, pressed FASB to include wrapped tokens in the final plan, saying they are held for similar purposes and trade at prices similar to the underlying crypto assets.\n\nThe majority of board members on Wednesday said they needed more information about the market before expanding the scope of the board\u2019s work, and rejected calls to include wrapped tokens.\n\n\u201cIntentionally keeping this project narrow has really allowed us to get this information in the hands of investors sooner,\u201d FASB member Susan Cosper said.\n\nFASB has said it will continue monitoring the crypto market and take additional action if necessary.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be the last crypto project; there should be more to follow,\u201d said Aaron Jacob, vice president of enterprise accounting at software company TaxBit. \u201cThis is the right first step.\u201d"

        "title": "Who Needs a Bitcoin ETF? Actually, the SEC Does. - Bloomberg",
        "content": "Should the US Securities and Exchange Commission approve an exchange-traded fund focused on the spot market for Bitcoin? The question has yet again gained relevance, thanks to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which last week reversed the SEC\u2019s decision to reject a Bitcoin ETF proposed by Grayscale Investments.\n\n\n\nThe answer is yes: With a revised approach to the issue, the SEC could turn its loss into a win.\n\n\n\nSet aside the irony of using an ETF to bet on Bitcoin, a technology supposedly designed to displace such traditional intermediaries. Maybe enthusiasts expect that Bitcoin\u2019s many flaws \u2014 including extreme volatility, high transaction costs, inadequate throughput, and a large carbon footprint \u2014 will eventually be fixed, and that the benefits will somehow accrue to token holders. It isn\u2019t regulators\u2019 job to stop people from making bad decisions.\n\n\n\nSo why not just let it happen?\n\n\n\nIn a way, the SEC is already doing so: It has approved ETFs that track Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It\u2019s less partial to ETFs like Grayscale\u2019s because they would directly track the price on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which don\u2019t face the same requirements for safety, soundness and investor protection that the CME does. This distinction makes little sense: If, say, \u201cwash\u201d trades on exchanges artificially inflate spot prices, they\u2019ll affect futures, too. But given that the SEC is suing Coinbase for operating an illegal securities exchange, it\u2019s understandably reluctant to approve an ETF with the company\u2019s involvement.\n\n\n\nA different approach could both establish more consistency and give regulators much-needed authority over crypto. The SEC could approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, provided that the exchanges involved meet the same standards that their regulated competitors do. Such conditionality would rationalize the rules while motivating big ETF sponsors (such as BlackRock and Fidelity) to monitor compliance.\n\n\n\nIt would also help resolve another persistent challenge. Because Bitcoin is defined as a commodity, it doesn\u2019t fall under the SEC\u2019s direct jurisdiction. Instead, it\u2019s overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 but only when it comes to futures, not spot trading. The ETF approval could thus become an important step toward setting consistent standards across crypto, including for products that don\u2019t fit into traditional categories. And it would in no way undermine the SEC\u2019s enforcement of securities laws.\n\n\n\nIn the absence of action from Congress, regulators should do what they can to bring crypto into line without killing it off. Here\u2019s an opportunity. People would still be free to lose their money on ill-considered bets. But they\u2019d be much less likely to get ripped off along the way.\n\nMore from Bloomberg Opinion:"

        "title": "State Street sees opportunity in court win for spot bitcoin ETF - American Banker",
        "content": "Gabby Jones/Bloomberg\n\nTraditional financial institutions are inching ahead on cryptocurrency custody and other services as exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin take a step closer to hitting Wall Street.\n\nA recent court decision may push the Securities and Exchange Commission to reevaluate its previous rejection of a spot bitcoin ETF, and banks should be ready to meet the market, experts said.\n\nWall Street has dragged its feet on touching volatile digital currencies, but last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC's rejection of the crypto-asset manager Grayscale's application to list a spot bitcoin ETF was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs would give investors exposure to bitcoin on an exchange without having to own the underlying asset since the manager of the fund would hold the bitcoin. The SEC has already approved bitcoin futures ETFs, which track contracts to buy and sell bitcoin at a predetermined price on a later date. The appeals court ruled that the federal regulator couldn't provide a \"coherent explanation\" as to why it approved futures bitcoin ETFs, but not the proposed spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe court's decision has stirred optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved, said Carl Fornaris, co-chair of the digital assets and blockchain technology group at the law firm Winston & Strawn. He added that financial institutions are monitoring developments so they can keep up with regulation.\n\n\"I think this is something that is very much on [banks'] radar, and they will want to be poised and ready to go if and when the SEC does issue an approval so that they have a product with the right team ready to launch,\" Fornaris said.\"\n\nFornaris said it's also important that financial institutions discuss digital-asset plans with federal regulators, which he said have been \"skittish\" about banks offering crypto products and services.\n\nState Street, one of the largest custodian banks in the world, is ramping up crypto services to take advantage of the potential opportunities presented by the court ruling, like custody and administration for ETFs. The Boston-based bank sees a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. as a way to increase accessibility to the currency for institutional investors, without them having to own it, said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF solutions at State Street.\n\nThe court decision could also open the door for other spot bitcoin ETF applications, including from major players like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, Fornaris said. Banks like State Street then act as the fund administrator of the ETF, providing custody of ETF shares, fund accounting and transfer agency.\n\nState Street is slated to be the fund administrator for a spot bitcoin ETF listed by the investment manager VanEck, if approval goes through. Head of Digital Assets Jay Biancamano said the institution is working to start offering custody of bitcoin and ethereum by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.\n\n\"For most clients, building to have custody and administration under the same umbrella is preferable,\" Biancamano said. \"So that's what we're looking to do. Offer not only our fund administrator services and ETF services, but also custody \u2014 all to the same clients.\"\n\nThe bank had previously been working with the crypto custody firm Copper on the service, but pivoted away in March and is working with a different undisclosed partner, Biancamano said. Bank of New York Mellon also announced last fall its plan to hold digital assets in custody for some clients, but the bank declined to comment for this story.\n\nCryptocurrency BNY Mellon crypto custody application didn't anticipate SEC accounting rule Bank of New York Mellon didn't think it would need to record on its balance sheet digital assets held in custody when it asked the New York State Department of Financial Services for permission to offer the service, according to a filing obtained by American Banker. The SEC has since said otherwise. June 28\n\nBiancamano said providing administrative services for spot bitcoin ETFs is similar to other ETFs, but that State Street has more stringent rules and requirements around crypto because it's unregulated and volatile. Koudelka said a spot bitcoin ETF provides end investors with the same benefits of other ETFs, like intraday liquidity and access on an exchange.\n\n\"We continue to see more innovation, bringing in innovative asset classes, to allow for better diversification and asset allocation for end investors,\" Koudelka said. \"So when I look at spot bitcoin \u2026 it's really what the ETF issuers are trying to bring. 'How do we get investors married up with products that they're interested in and put it in a very liquid wrapper?'\"\n\nKoudelka and Biancamano said that spot bitcoin ETFs are just the tip of the iceberg, and that State Street is hearing from clients that plan to eventually operate crypto ETF strategies that offer more than just bitcoin, such as an index or a multi-asset basket.\n\n\"I think what you'll see in the market is hopefully we'll have a crypto ETF approved within the next year,\" Biancamano said. \"That will result in a stampede of others looking to get into the space. \u2026 Then you'll start to see clients or asset managers look to diversify and offer more sophisticated products with exposure to the space.\"\n\nThe appeals court ruling, which came out Aug. 29, isn't an automatic win for spot bitcoin ETFs. Now, the SEC could appeal the decision, which would send the case either to the Supreme Court or an \"en banc\" appellate-panel review. If the regulator doesn't appeal, the court could mandate that the SEC approves Grayscale's application, or it could direct the SEC to reassess, in which case it could either approve or reject the application on different grounds.\n\nBut sentiment among the traditional financial market around crypto is shifting, experts said.\n\nCaitlin Long, CEO of the crypto-focused institution Custodia Bank, said that BlackRock's application for a spot bitcoin ETF similar to Grayscale's in June was a watershed moment for banks. She added that she isn't optimistic about SEC approval of the ETF in the near future but thinks that the $9-trillion-asset-under-management firm's filing, since it came from a traditional financial firm, was a signal to Wall Street that \"bitcoin is not going away.\"\n\n\"I am not expecting a positive decision on the ETF,\" Long said. \"But I think the punchline is everyone sees what's going on. Bitcoin did not go away. Now the regulators in Washington, D.C., are coming to the realization that they need to do something to create a regulated pathway for the industry. And if they don't do it, the courts are going to do it for them.\"\n\nCustodia is currently awaiting federal approval to custody bitcoin."

        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks in Focus as Bitcoin Gears Up for a Comeback - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in August. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $25,000 mark in late August, its lowest level since mid-June, as volatility continues to grip markets ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September policy meeting.\n\nBitcoin staged a solid turnaround from its 2022 lows and was trading above $31,500 in early July. However, the rally stalled in late July, and August saw somewhat of a bloodbath for Bitcoin, with a nearly 10% decline.\n\nIn fact, the start to September is also rocky, holding below the psychological level of $26,000 over the past 24 hours. So, what\u2019s in store for Bitcoin in September?\n\nTraditionally, the price of Bitcoin has been closely correlated with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This is because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are viewed as risky assets, and investors often respond to market conditions in a similar manner when assessing their investment strategies.\n\nRight now, there are a lot of positives for having faith in Bitcoin despite its recent lows. Last month, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA came up with robust earnings. This gave not only investors confidence to invest in tech stocks but also cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, a boost.\n\nMoreover, the long-date Treasury yields hit multi-year highs in August. The 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since 2007 last month. However, it has since fallen to 4.23% as of Sep 5.\n\nThe Fed has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. The measure has resulted in inflation declining sharply over the past year. However, inflation remains a lot higher than the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. This has kept the Fed open for more interest rate hikes, which has been putting pressure on the bond yield.\n\nHowever, a series of economic data released over the past week indicates that the labor market is cooling. This has raised hopes of the Fed keeping interest rates unaltered in its September meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that around 95% of the market participants are now confident about the Fed pausing its interest rate hikes in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis definitely bodes well for high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among financial giants is expected to drive up the prices of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the near future.\n\nFor instance, BlackRock, Inc. BLK has urged regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that could boost retail investor involvement.\n\nSimilarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW is backing a new exchange called EDX Markets, indicating a growing institutional interest in the crypto space. These developments could have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally may have taken a pause but the future holds promise. Currently, it is advisable for investors to contemplate accumulating cryptocurrencies through a buying-on-the-dip strategy. Each decline in cryptocurrency prices may present an advantageous opportunity for acquisitions, potentially resulting in significant gains as the market's volatility eventually settles.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.3%.

Shares of COIN have increased 20.7% in the past three months. Coinbase currently has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE operates as a cryptocurrency mining firm.

        "title": "FASB Votes In Favor of Fair Value Accounting For Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a long-anticipated move, Bloomberg Tax reported that the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is set to introduce new fair value accounting rules for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These new rules aim to provide a more accurate reflection of the market value of digital assets and bring greater transparency to the financial reporting of companies that hold cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe rules, expected to be published by the end of the year, are set to go into effect as soon as 2025, but companies will be able to apply them earlier than that, the report said.\n\nFor years, the valuation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has been a challenging aspect of financial reporting for companies. The volatile nature of these digital assets has made it difficult to accurately assess their fair market value. Under the current accounting standards, companies often struggled to present a true picture of their financial health, as the value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fluctuated wildly.\n\nThe FASB's move to introduce fair value accounting rules will require companies to regularly assess the fair market value of their digital assets and report any fluctuations in value as part of their financial statements. This means that if the price of Bitcoin surges or plummets, companies will have to reflect these changes in their financial reports, providing stakeholders with a more accurate picture of their financial position.\n\nThe old treatment accounted for Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which meant if the price went lower than what companies bought it for, they had to take an impairment charge on their books, even if they didn't sell. But if the price went up, they couldn't receive any benefit on their books unless they sold. Now, with fair value accounting, periodically (i.e. every quarter) companies can report the unrealized gains and losses to get an actual benefit on their books if the price of the asset increases (without having to sell to capture it). This could make companies more likely to add bitcoin to their balance sheet and become long-term holders as they can report the appreciation without having to sell anything.\n\nInvestors and regulators will now have access to more timely and accurate information about the financial health of companies involved in the Bitcoin space. This increased transparency is expected to foster greater trust and confidence in the industry, which has often been plagued by concerns over its lack of oversight and regulation.\n\nThe move towards fair value accounting also aligns with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin in mainstream finance. As it become more integrated into the global financial system, it is essential that accounting standards evolve to accommodate digital assets. The FASB's decision to implement fair value accounting rules is a recognition of the maturing market and its importance in the broader economy.\n\nHowever, implementing fair value accounting for cryptocurrencies is not without its challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin and other digital assets means that companies will need to invest in robust valuation methods and procedures to ensure accuracy in their financial reporting. Additionally, auditors will need to develop expertise in assessing the fair market value of these assets, which can be a complex task.\n\nDespite these challenges, the introduction of fair value accounting rules for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a significant step forward for the industry. It will provide much-needed clarity and transparency, ultimately benefiting investors, companies, and regulators alike. As the Bitcoin market continues to grow and evolve, having a standardized accounting framework in place is essential to maintain trust and ensure the responsible integration of BTC into the global financial system.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. \u2013 It\u2019s a mind-boggling, eye-opening story involving your friends and neighbors losing millions of dollars and an investigator who got much of it back.\n\nTwenty percent of Americans have gotten involved in cryptocurrency, mainly the popular Bitcoin, so scam artists have too \u2013 even in Central Florida.\n\nJust in Brevard County, more than 100 people have reported they\u2019ve been ripped off.\n\nBrevard County realtor Isabel Castro is one of them.\n\n\u201cSo one of my friends on Instagram was posting the screenshots of pretty hefty deposits on his Cash App account,\u201d Castro said. \u201cAnd so it was late at night and I messaged him and asked him if it was legit and he was like \u2018yeah.\u2019 And we went back and forth a little and I thought I was talking to him. I trusted my friend, I\u2019ve known him since grade school.\u201d\n\nShe painfully discovered it wasn\u2019t her friend at the other end of an Instagram message urging her to buy Bitcoin cryptocurrency and send it off to a crypto-exchange site for a big return.\n\n\u201cSo I was seeing my deposits inflate as I sent money from my Bitcoin wallet, but then I couldn\u2019t pull any of the money out,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAnyone can buy digital currency online; Bitcoin is the most popular.\n\nBut these days, more people are buying Bitcoin at their local pharmacy or gas station and paying an obnoxiously high commission. News 6 found crypto ATMs inside several convenience stores and pharmacies in Rockledge, just down the road from the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nAnd most of the people using the new-age ATMS are buying Bitcoin not for an investment, but because they\u2019re being scammed and don\u2019t know it, according to Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office Agent Justin Wood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThis is one of the fastest growing frauds.\u201d\n\nAgent Wood is the lead cryptocurrency investigator at the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s Economic Crimes Unit. He\u2019s also on the Secret Service\u2019s Cyber Fraud Task Force.\n\nWood said more than 100 crypto fraud victims in Brevard County have lost more than $4.5 million in total. Isabel Castro is one of them. Agent Wood handled her case.\n\n\u201cThe coach told her to send bitcoin to this address and you\u2019ll see a great amount of return on your investment,\u201d Wood said.\n\nCastro kept buying more Bitcoin and transferring more to the crypto exchange site. She poured in $9,000 of her money until she realized she was being scammed.\n\n\u201cUntil I realized this is going to go on forever, I\u2019m never going to see this again,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAgent Wood, through his unique crypto-fraud training, followed the funds.\n\n\u201cAnd we can see they\u2019re sent to a series of different digital addresses and ultimately they funnel into one digital address,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd we can see it\u2019s located at an exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange company.\u201d\n\nWood sent the exchange company a search and seizure notice to freeze the funds and get back Castro\u2019s money. The exchange complied and returned Castro\u2019s $9,000.\n\nCastro\u2019s case was only the latest where Wood got results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done probably about a hundred cases and I\u2019d say we successfully made probably about 30 recoveries,\u201d Wood said.\n\nAgent Wood is one of the few investigators in Florida who\u2019ve trained with the Secret Service at their digital currency course in Alabama. He alone has closed 80 cryptocurrency cases in Brevard County.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years we\u2019ve successfully seized and recovered about $700,000 worth of cryptocurrency,\u201d Wood said.\n\nWood said as much as people would like to believe that cryptocurrency can make them a quick buck, anyone offering quick and high returns is likely a scammer.\n\nAnd anyone who pressures you into buying cryptocurrency is likely a scammer, Wood said.\n\nCastro said she wishes she had picked up the phone and called her \u201cfriend\u201d to discover his Instagram account had been hacked.\n\nBrevard County residents who need help can reach out to Wood at justin.wood@bcso.us.\n\nGet today\u2019s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:"

        "content": "During the crypto boom of 2021, Riot Platforms was raking in cash from bitcoin mining. Now the company is losing so much money that it's counting on energy credits from selling power back to the Texas grid to keep its costs under control.\n\nRiot said on Wednesday that it earned $31.7 million in energy credits last month from Texas power grid operator ERCOT. The company generated the credits by voluntarily curtailing its energy consumption during a record-breaking heatwave.\n\nThe total value of the credits dwarfed the 333 bitcoin the company mined in August, worth about $8.9 million dollars as of the end of the month.\n\n\"August was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy,\" said Jason Les, CEO of Riot, in the company's press release. \"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine Bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry.\"\n\nIt's a dramatic strategy shift for Riot, whose revenue soared almost 8,000% in 2021 from booming demand for bitcoin. The crypto market reversed in 2022, leading to a net loss of over $500 million for the year. In the latest quarter, the company lost $27.7 million.\n\nBitcoin's recovery this year from 2022's lows has boosted Riot's stock, which is up about 230% so far in 2023, closing Wednesday at $11.24. But it's still way down from its 2021 peak of $77.90.\n\nBitcoin miners broadly have struggled amid low trading volume, according to an analyst note from JPMorgan Chase on Sept. 1. The firm found that the market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin miners it tracked fell 21% in August to $9.7 billion. Riot was the worst-performing stock in that list, falling 39% for the month.\n\nBallooning energy prices have also helped to drag down profits for the sector, so companies have turned to alternative sources of income."

        "title": "Bitcoin remains tied to the US economy, and that needs to change - Blockworks",
        "content": "One of the many narratives surrounding Bitcoin is that it represents a pathway to an alternative global economy that might contest the US dollar\u2019s supremacy. After all, Bitcoin did emerge as a counterpoint to the 2008 US financial debacle, a digital champion for free markets and sound money.\n\nYet bitcoin the asset remains intricately linked to the US economy. Factors like dollar-pegged stablecoins, US regulatory sway and the sheer weight of US financial entities anchor the cryptocurrency to the old greenback.\n\nWill this continue to hold true in an increasingly multipolar world? The simple answer is \u201cyes, for now.\u201d Is this the outcome we should expect in the long term? That would be a hard \u201cno.\u201d\n\nWhat hinders Bitcoin\u2019s independence\n\nThree principal factors are roping bitcoin to the dollar, hindering its complete global currency independence:\n\nDollar-pegged stablecoins\n\nStablecoins such as USDT and USDC have amplified crypto\u2019s reliance on the US economic landscape. Bitcoin predominantly trades against the US dollar on numerous crypto platforms, often indirectly via stablecoins.\n\nThe controversial issuer of USDT, Tether, recently shared its Q2 attestation report, where it grew to a $71 billion market cap, and it\u2019s even larger today. In total, stablecoins are a $124 billion market, with significant influence over bitcoin\u2019s own $500 billion one.\n\nWhen a single asset makes up roughly 25% of another\u2019s market cap, the two are correlated.\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s value so closely intertwined with the US economy, bitcoin users around the world are prey to any instability the currency faces, meaning it truly isn\u2019t a free market yet.\n\nRegulatory dynamics\n\nThe US regulatory landscape has a significant impact on bitcoin\u2019s market sentiment. Any positive or negative news regarding policy can have ripple effects on the entire crypto market, including bitcoin.\n\nGlobally, crypto\u2019s legality and mainstream acceptance are at stake. The US exerts influence on global crypto policies, framed mainly by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\u2019s 2021 guidelines. And the US, given its stature, plays a pivotal role in directing FATF\u2019s advice.\n\nUS legislative moves also shape institutional investor inclinations. The unfolding saga of the prospective Bitcoin ETF is a prime example of this, with entities like BlackRock and Fidelity patiently awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict. The recent Grayscale victory is a sure sign that institutional adoption isn\u2019t a dream but a reality.\n\nInstitutional acceptance\n\nUS institutional adoption has further intertwined bitcoin with the nation\u2019s economy. ETF outcomes aside, significant financial bodies now include bitcoin in their asset arrays, tying its value to US market sentiments.\n\nThis means that those using bitcoin as an alternative investment are still at the whims of US firms. Let\u2019s remember the impact Tesla\u2019s purchase of $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin had on the market.\n\nThe path to decoupling\n\nMany investors turn to bitcoin as a hedge against US dollar depreciation in uncertain economic climates. Yet, if current conditions continue, bitcoin might more closely mirror traditional US investment avenues like equities.\n\nThis scenario is problematic, to say the least. Free markets shouldn\u2019t hinge on the US economic climate, legislative landscape or decisions by its major corporations. Bitcoin was envisioned to counter exactly this.\n\nFortunately, the bond between Bitcoin, the US and the broader American economy is breakable. As the crypto realm matures, multiple factors can help Bitcoin evolve into a truly global, uncorrelated asset.\n\nEmerging stablecoins with diverse denominations could promote a shift from USD-centric tokens. Enthusiasts advocate for stablecoins tethered to varied currencies to lessen dependency on the US dollar, fostering a truly diversified crypto market.\n\nAlternative fiat currencies include the Japanese yen or Chinese yuan as dominant bitcoin trading counterparts. Europe\u2019s MiCA legislation might lead to more diversity in the form of EUR-denominated stablecoins. But this potential shift will take time \u2014 likely many years.\n\nThere\u2019s also notable momentum toward augmenting bitcoin\u2019s global adoption, reducing US market dependency. Efforts include regional partnerships, educational drives, and crafting use cases specific to areas like Africa and Latin America, where Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a sovereign currency resonates.\n\nCrypto champions are continuing to actively working with regulators globally, striving for balanced rules that spur innovation without undue US influence. This regulatory diversity poses challenges for regions reluctant to welcome Bitcoin and its peers.\n\nTechnological strides are boosting Bitcoin\u2019s reach and applicability, rendering it more apt for regular global transactions. Universal adoption for purposes beyond just a value reserve could insulate Bitcoin from single-economy volatilities.\n\nReflecting on what\u2019s to come\n\nBitcoin\u2019s intrinsic potential to foster free markets has remained unchanged since 2009. Roughly fifteen years after its inception, stakeholders \u2014 both within and outside the US \u2014 are still unlocking its possibilities.\n\nIn this narrative, the US dollar, economy and geopolitical clout remain pivotal in the cryptocurrency\u2019s evolution. Yet as bitcoin and its ecosystem evolve, its reliance on the US dollar has a chance to diminish, heralding a more balanced global economic landscape.\n\nDanny Oyekan is the founder and CEO of Blockfinex, a Dubai-based digital asset exchange platform.

        "content": "Grayscale Investments is urging the SEC to approve its request to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF and has asked the agency to meet with them as quickly as possible after a court ruled against the agency's refusal to review Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nThe crypto asset manager delivered a letter on Sept. 5 to the regulator urging it to approve the conversion of the $16 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe letter sent by Grayscale\u2019s lawyers argued that the filing to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF has been \u201cpending for nearly three times the length permitted\u201d for the SEC to act. It also sought to address security issues raised by the agency, saying that if safety differences between a spot bitcoin and currently available futures bitcoin ETFs existed, the firm is \u201cconfident it would have surfaced by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no available rationale that would distinguish a bitcoin futures ETP from a spot bitcoin ETP,\u201d according to the letter sent by attorney Joseph Hall of New York\u2019s Davis Polk.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Court Victory Over SEC\n\nThe request follows Grayscale\u2019s watershed legal win over the agency on Aug. 29. The company had sued the SEC after the agency, which has to date not approved a spot bitcoin ETF, refused to permit the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit last month sided with Grayscale and called the SEC\u2019s decision \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has 45 days after the ruling to appeal.\n\nInvestment managers from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments have pending spot bitcoin ETF applications in front of the SEC. Approval of the Grayscale application would open the door to their spot bitcoin ETFs being available to investors.\n\nWhile the regulatory body allows ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, it thus far has blocked firms from rolling out ETFs that track physical bitcoin, which is the product investors are vying for.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is by far the largest bitcoin futures ETF, which has $952 million in assets under management. The SEC has denied more than 30 spot bitcoin proposals since 2021.\n\n\u201cGBTC is ready to operate as an ETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale and its investors look forward to more information from the SEC,\u201d said a Grayscale spokesperson in the company\u2019s statement on the letter.\n\nSEC Meeting With Grayscale\n\nGrayscale is now seeking to meet with the SEC \u201cas soon as practical\u201d to \u201cdiscuss the way forward in view of recent developments,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said the agency is \u201creviewing the next steps\u201d after the Grayscale lawsuit decision.\n\nGrayscale also argued that dragging out the approval process is hurting investors by pushing down the price of the trust. It also said that a spot bitcoin ETF is the least complicated and best product structure for bitcoin ETF investors.\n\nThe firm also said that its security measures, known as surveillance sharing agreements, handled by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are as effective as other firms\u2019 proposed agreements with Coinbase.\n\nGrayscale currently has one ETF, the Grayscale Future of Finance ETF (GFOF), which has $5.3 million in AUM.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

But within 48 hours bitcoin (BTC-USD) gave back those gains and the rally soon fizzled.\n\nIn the last 24 hours bitcoin has fallen slightly, trading below $26,000 by Tuesday afternoon.

It has said it is reviewing the decision.\n\n\"We must not get too excited, too carried away,\" Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"The court did not order the SEC to approve these ETFs.

        "content": "Taking a look at the crypto markets. Let's let's discuss more about the charts with none other than fair lead strategies, founder and managing partner, Katie Stockton. Hello, Katie Happy September. Oh, yeah, thanks. You too. That was the exciting month in trading. And I know you're, you're all excited about the charts here that you have, we have several. Um I I kind of want to look at uh the first chart we have here is Bitcoin because uh yeah, you, you kind of see Bitcoin in a very, in a cloudy situation. Uh explain how cloudy it really is for Bitcoin. Well, it's a really good way to put it, Lawrence, the, the cloud model that you see on the chart, it's the shaded area and it's a trend following model based on price solely and it is really widely used by FX traders. Now we see that it has held a lot of relevance for Bitcoin and many other AL coins as well in that the last relief rally or the sort of intermediate term up move met resistance right at the upper boundary of that cloud and there and it kind of preserved the downtrend that started in 2022. So now, unfortunately, we have a corrective phase that left that resistance intact and that does reflect weak intermediate term momentum. So we, we have some setbacks here on the chart. There's very strong support that's uh just, just below current levels. And you'll see that it's roughly 25,200. It defines former resistance, which was the upper boundary of a trading range. It'd be a natural place for Bitcoin to stabilize at least temporarily. However, we have seen some others including Ether take out equivalent support. So that doesn't give us much peace of mind. Yeah, I, I kind of want to take a look at that Ether chart because again, Ether and Bitcoin are so highly correlated uh that you, you, you wonder if Ether is sort of, uh, how am I say leading the situation or at least, um, serving as a for, for Bitcoin. But it certainly has, uh, some scary warnings for people who are trading Bitcoin, correct. Uh We have to have the same. Mhm. Yeah. So with, with the Ether trade, I mean, they have been very positively correlated and, and actually somewhat neutral, relative strength between the two of late. But it, it is within the context of a broader relative up trend favoring Bitcoin. We tend to usually see Ether underperform when both are moving lower because it's seen as a bit riskier perhaps than Bitcoin or Bitcoin just being the stalwart in the Cryptocurrency markets. So right now, you know, we have a, a relatively fresh breakdown and ether below some support. It puts next support or around 15 30 which is based on the bottom boundary that cloud that you see. So there is of course room to that level, you see that there's downside momentum for the weekly MAC D indicator that's pictured on our chart. And that means that oversold conditions might not be something to get excited about. At least not yet. What we have up actually is, is the relative price of, of Bitcoin it priced as E um And so when it goes up, that's Bitcoin strength. And I don't want to say Bitcoin strengthening against E because they're both going down. But it's more like eth is weakening more steadily or, or, or more severely that if you will than Bitcoin in that chart. So, so that's a relative strength comparison, right. So in this situation, you, you see that as an uptrend, in other words that they might both be falling, but eth is gonna fall for some time in the future more than Bitcoin, correct? Is that, is that right? Right. Yeah, the, the relative strength of course, will be a read on just how they relate to one another. It won't give you a sense of what's happening in absolute terms in a market where both are going down in absolute terms. We would expect either to underperform in that environment given again, it's sort of position as your perception perhaps as being a bit riskier uh but also potentially higher reward than, than Bitcoin. So it does depend on whether they're going up or down in absolute terms, usually the way we see that ratio play out, but the long term trend is gradual and it does support Bitcoin still, even with what we've seen of late, you know, everyone's been talking about ETF S we of course, have the Ether futures ETF that folks are thinking may be approved by the end of the year if that does get approved. Do you see Ether overtaking Bitcoin and maybe um something a little bit different happening? Well, I think anything that fosters institutional demand for cryptocurrencies is probably a positive for the whole space longer term. It doesn't mean that it has a real short term impact or anything that's meaningful. And next year, for example, we did see a favorable reaction on the G BT C news recently from Bitcoin, but it was really just a blip on the chart. I think it's folks sort of anticipating that as ultimately being a positive, but I don't think it's really necessarily a near term positive. Uh but anything that does foster that institutional adoption, especially if it is lopsided towards one and not the other. Well, then that, that would probably favor that Cryptocurrency in terms of its um you know, sort of uptake, right, Katie. And finally, we need to take a look of look at this very cool animated chart that you sent to us. And I have to say you are the first guests since I've been on this show, which has been like a few months now who sent an animated chart. And I love it. It shows the 12 week Lawrence I it, it, it seems like the, the graphic was designed by someone who spent a lot of time at fish concerts. I think it's yes, perhaps a little trippy, right? But it is a great way to visualize uh sort of normalized relative performance in the Cryptocurrency market. So what we've done there is taken in the top 10 sort of market cap um oriented cryptocurrencies and and taking their ratios versus Bitcoin. So using Bitcoin as the anchor, the anchor being represented by the crosshairs in that graph and anything that's pointing up into the right is outperforming Bitcoin with stronger momentum as a kind of hook over while they're still, you know, outperforming. But doing so with less momentum as the idea. And I know you were just discussing Solana quite a bit. You see that Solana is one that still has a very favorable relative trajectory versus Bitcoin. And this is a 12 week view. So that provides an intermediate term takeaway. We can look at this kind of comparison which is called a relative rotation graph and we can look at it on a daily time frame, weekly, monthly. So you can really um sort of be fractal in how you're analyzing the time frames. And what I think is sometimes interesting from our perspective is when you can see, you know, a shift perhaps from risk on to risk off or some kind of emerging leadership on the coin front. And lastly, light coin is seeing a drop off. Why do you think that is? Oh, I, I don't know why the chart won't tell us that answer, unfortunately. Uh but, but we know that it is and, and my hope is that folks will see that and can infer what's happening there and, and listen, if it's happening before there is any uh you know, sort of obvious negative um news or influence around Bitcoin. Well, perhaps it's a heads up that these rotations are, you know, suggesting that investors are less interested in it for some reason. So it basically deserves more. Research is the way I'd see that Katie, thank you very much for joining us this morning. Of course, have a good day. That was fair strategies founder and managing partner, Katie Stockton."

        "content": "Yeah, when I said that that would represent a five X increase in Bitcoin in only about a two year period does sound ridiculously bullish. Although there are others even more bullish than me. There are a lot of reasons that I offer this. Number one, we are beginning to see a sea change while we've been in the crypto winter for far longer than any of us want. And we've had massive amounts of fraud and abuse and cc enforcement actions, many of which have been justified. We are also beginning to see the turnaround of this. We're getting rid of the bad boys of crypto. Those crypto bros need to be gone. Many of them are the few remaining will soon be gone. And we're beginning to see the continued development of the technology, the further integration, the adoption and engagement at the institutional level, pension funds and other major institutions, endowments and such all engaging in crypto. We also see the sec major lawsuits ripple unis and now most recently gray scale, we are also seeing that over the next six months, we're going to be facing the next Bitcoin having, which historically has always been extraordinarily bullish for the price of Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin you earn as a miner gets cut in half that naturally calls for a price doubling for miners to keep their economic rewards intact. So all of these things are spelling really good news for crypto. Uh We're seeing legislation coming out of Congress. We're looking at stable coin adoption on a global basis. So all the signs are pointing really strong and if history is any guide as a result of the having by the summer of 25 I fully expect we'll see Bitcoin well into the low single digits. And even if I'm wrong and way wrong and Bitcoin merely doubles. Should me how any other investment has the potential of doing in the next 18 to 24 months? What crypto is the opportunity of doing? So it's a very exciting time for crypto. And that's why I wrote my white paper on what's happening with the ETF applications. Uh Why I wrote my book, The Truth About crypto and why we offer our certificate program so you can become certified in Blockchain and digital assets, all of that available at DFP dot com."

Ether dipped to near the US$1,600 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP posted the biggest gains while Solana led the losers. Digital asset investment products saw a minor outflow last week accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating mixed sentiment among institutional investors. U.S. stock futures traded mixed ahead of regular trading following the long holiday weekend.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,000\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.57% in the last 24 hours to US$25,804.63 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 1.15%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading in the US$26,000 range since Friday. It briefly breached US$28,000 last Tuesday as an apparent victory for Grayscale Investment against the U.S. Securties and Exchange Commission boosted sentiment. That optimism has now cooled.\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,627.26, losing 1.58% over the past seven days.\n\nThe crypto market is suffering from regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., said Samer Hasn, market analyst for online brokerage XS.com, in an emailed comment. He also noted the effect of large transactions on the market, including a US$213 million XRP transaction and a US$37 million Shiba Inu transaction recorded over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAlthough the reasons behind the series of huge transfers that we are witnessing in the cryptocurrency market are not yet completely clear, I believe that they may continue to fuel a state of anticipation and caution in the markets, especially since these transfers come amid weak sentiment among market participants, with the continuing battle in the judicial arena in the United States,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance\u2019s global head of product Mayur Kamat resigned from the company, Reuters reported on Monday. The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces lawsuits from the U.S. SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, with movement within the 1% range across the board. XRP led the winners with a 0.61% gain to US$0.5082, but remained 3.01% lower for the week.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw a minor outflow of US$11.2 million in the week ending Sept. 1. That was a slowdown from US$168 million last week, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Despite the small outflow, digital investment products\u2019 trading volume totaled US$2.8 billion, a 90% rise on the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe recent minor outflows from digital asset funds may be due to uncertainty around the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 following an initial surge of enthusiasm upon their announcement,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, it will be interesting to see how these regulatory uncertainties are balanced,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event will see the amount of new tokens issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024.\n\nElsewhere, crypto exchange Bybit introduced TradeGPT on Monday \u2014 an artificial intelligence-powered education tool that uses ChatGPT to generate market analysis and answer technical questions based on Bybit\u2019s real-time market data. Other crypto exchanges including Binance, Crypto.com and OKX also launched A.I.-powered analyzing tools earlier this year.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.56% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 20.65% to US$23.77 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures dip; China services activity slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower ahead of the opening bell Tuesday after a holiday-extended weekend for markets. Despite closing mixed on Friday, all three major U.S. indexes posted weekly gains, with Friday\u2019s jobs data easing rate hike worries.\n\nAll the main stock indexes across Asia were showing losses as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nChina\u2019s release of key economic data Tuesday morning cast a cloud over markets. The Caixin China services purchasing managers index (PMI) \u2014 a private gauge of the business activities in the country\u2019s service industry \u2014 dropped from 54.1 in July to 51.8 in August, the lowest level in the past eight months. A PMI reading above 50 indicates a growth in business activities, while a sub-50 reading indicates a contraction.\n\nThe PMI report followed an unexpected expansion in China\u2019s manufacturing industry on September 1. But a slowdown of growth in the services industry provides more evidence of a wider economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe marginal slowdown in the services sector\u2019s supply and demand expansion offset the improvement in manufacturing production and demand,\u201d Wang Zhe, an economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters. \u201cThere was still considerable downward pressure on the economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose from 53.8 in July to 54.3 in August \u2014 the highest reading in three months, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA stronger improvement in new orders received by Japanese service firms underpinned an acceleration in business activity growth,\u201d Usamah Bhatti, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Reuters. \u201cThat said, service providers signalled a steeper increase in inflationary pressures during August.\u201d\n\nInvestors now await a decision on interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia expected later Tuesday. Analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to keep the rate unchanged at 4.10% for the third straight month, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 78% on August 28.\n\nFurther indication of how the Fed\u2019s plan for rates will arrive with a series of official speeches on Thursday. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Solana led the winners after Visa announced it would expand stablecoin payments to the Solana network. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after a down day Tuesday. Oil supply restrictions from Russia and Saudi Arabia have aroused inflationary concerns and fear among investors of more U.S. interest rate hikes to come.\n\nSolana surges on Visa partnership\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.01% in the last 24 hours to US$25,764.10 as of 07:10 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 6.72%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been trading between US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It was trading at the same range in June before U.S. investment giant BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application sent the price over US$30,000\n\n\u201cThe market seems to underestimate the potential impact of U.S. BTC spot ETFs. A spot ETF approval should attract enormous inflows, creating significant buying pressure on BTC. Conversely, if the BTC spot ETFs are rejected, nothing changes,\u201d wrote crypto research firm K33 Research in a report Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPrices are now the same as before the Blackrock news that injected new life into BTC spot ETF chances. In the same time span, the Nasdaq 100, often a good indicator of the market\u2019s general risk appetite, is up 2%. The BTC spot ETFs will be huge, and with improved odds of approval, it looks evident that the market is mispricing it,\u201d the report continued.\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale Investments sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday urging the regulator to approve its application to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. That followed a favorable court decision on August 29 for the digital asset management firm requiring the SEC to review an application it rejected last year.\n\n\u201cGBTC is ready to operate as a bitcoin ETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC,\u201d said Grayscale in a Twitter thread on Tuesday.\n\n$GBTC is ready to operate as a #bitcoinETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC.

The second largest cryptocurrency has been trading around US$1,640 since the weekend. But K33 analysts said they expect the token\u2019s price to rise in the near future.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October favor overweight exposure in ETH, as ETH carry stronger ETF momentum in the short term,\u201d wrote K33 in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cFutures-based ETH ETFs are scheduled to receive their final verdicts in mid-October, with strong chances of approval.\u201d\n\nNearly a dozen companies including Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have filed to launch Ethereum ETFs in the U.S.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL led the winners, rising 4.43% to US$20.22 but still posted a loss of 7.19% for the week.\n\nVisa Inc. announced on Tuesday it would expand its USDC stablecoin settlement services to the Solana blockchain. The global payments giant has been supporting USDC settlements on the Ethereum blockchain since March 2021.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we\u2019re helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury,\u201d Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in the announcement.\n\nSolana said in a tweet Tuesday that Visa\u2019s addition of the blockchain to its payment network follows an extensive period of planning and infrastructure evaluation.\n\n1/\ud83c\udfe6Breaking: Visa Expands Stablecoin Settlement Pilot to Solana@Visa is scaling their USDC settlement pilot to include the Solana blockchain, enabling enterprise-grade throughput at virtually no cost for Visa issuers and merchant acquirers on Solana. https://t.co/rF5ouZaISM \u2014 Solana (@solana) September 5, 2023\n\n\u201cThe partnership between Solana and Visa is a positive development for the blockchain ecosystem,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cIt broadens the range of use-cases beyond just Ethereum-based applications. Additionally, Solana offers faster and more cost-effective transactions which makes it a great option for settling transactions internally,\u201d Stefanidis said.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase launched a new crypto lending platform for U.S. institutional investors on September 1. The platform has raised over US$57 million in investment, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made Friday.\n\nThe platform\u2019s launch follows the bankruptcies of major crypto lenders including Celsius Network, BlockFi and Genesis Global. Those collapses opened up a vacuum in crypto lending services that the new Coinbase platform could come to occupy.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.15% to US$1.04 trillion.

The Dow led the losses with a 0.56% drop.\n\nThe main stock indexes across Asia mostly posted losses. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved lower, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose by 0.58%.\n\nThe benchmark Brent Crude Oil price reached a high of US$90.38 per barrel on Tuesday, the highest price since November 2022. The rise came after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their unilateral oil supply cuts by three months to the end of the year, contributing to the declines in the Asia equity market.\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its estimation for a U.S. economic recession in the next 12 months from 20% to 15%. The figure is much lower than a Bloomberg analyst consensus of 60%. The Goldman Sachs report cited continued positive inflation and strong labor market data as the reasons for its improved outlook.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC that \u201ca hell of a good week of data\u201d for August, including a better-than-expected jobs report, points to a slowdown in inflation. But he said it is still too early to tell if the Fed is done with its monetary tightening policies.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about saying we\u2019ve kind of done the job on inflation until we see a couple of months continuing along this trajectory before I say we\u2019re done doing anything,\u201d Waller said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one more hike would necessarily throw the economy into recession if we did feel that we needed to do one,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019re in real danger of doing a lot of damage to the job market, even if we raise rates one more time.\u201d\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was more hawkish. She said in an interview with German news outlet B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung Tuesday that the Fed \u201cmight have to go a bit higher\u201d in its policy rates to handle a still high level of demand in the economy.\n\nThe Fed will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, down from 94% on Sept. 1. It also gives a 41.3% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike in November, up from 33.5% on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cFed officials are unlikely to move quickly toward easier policy unless growth slows more than we are forecasting in coming quarters,\u201d said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, in a Tuesday research note viewed by Bloomberg. \u201cWe therefore expect only very gradual cuts of 25-bps per quarter starting in 2024Q2.\u201d\n\nA series of official speeches Thursday will provide further indication of the Fed\u2019s plan for rates. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August later Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Is a Bitcoin ETF Coming? These 3 Stocks Could Benefit From It. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A big catalyst could soon be coming for crypto investors. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.84%) could become the first exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to Bitcoin. This comes after a judge recently sided with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which blocked the company's attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nThe ETF could attract many new crypto investors and lead not only to a surge in the value of cryptocurrencies but also more trading activity. That can be great news for Block (SQ -3.02%), PayPal Holdings (PYPL 0.93%), and Coinbase Global (COIN -4.85%). Here's why they can benefit from this development.\n\n1. Block\n\nBlock is a financial services company that makes it easy for vendors to process payments through its point-of-sale terminals. Through its Cash App, the company also makes it easy for people to buy, sell, and send Bitcoin. It's such a big part of Block's business that it now generates the most revenue for the company.\n\nThrough the first half of the year, Block generated $4.6 billion in Bitcoin revenue. That's up around 30% from a year ago, when it brought in $3.5 billion from that area of its business. And this year, it has accounted for more than 43% of its top line.\n\nThe downside for Block is that it's also costly as its year-to-date expenses related to Bitcoin total just under $4.5 billion.\n\nIt may not generate huge profit growth for Block, but more transactions to process will definitely lead to more revenue growth for its business, and that could attract investors. A Bitcoin-focused ETF could be what helps give the stock a boost as Block is trading near its 52-week low.\n\nThere's some risk here as the business has incurred a loss in each of the past four quarters, but if you're bullish on crypto, Block could make for an underrated growth stock.\n\n2. PayPal\n\nAnother place where you can buy and sell crypto is through PayPal. The company allows its users to trade other cryptocurrencies as well, including Ethereum and Litecoin. Even if the new ETF would be focused on Bitcoin, all cryptocurrencies could rise in popularity as a result.\n\nThe company doesn't break out crypto revenue, but as of the end of June, it held more than $1 billion in crypto assets on its books, which is 68% higher than the $604 million it reported a year ago.\n\nOn Aug. 7, PayPal also announced the launch of a stablecoin, PayPal USD, as it looks to extend its exposure to crypto. It will be redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars, which could entice risk-averse crypto investors.\n\nPayPal generated a modest 7% growth last quarter when it reported sales of $7.3 billion for the period, ending June 30. More trading through its platform could help give its top line a much-needed boost. Trading near its 52-week low, PayPal could make for a good buy right now.\n\n3. Coinbase Global\n\nCoinbase operates a top cryptocurrency exchange, and it might see the most significant boost from an uptick in crypto trading. This year, it has been the hottest stock of the three listed here, achieving gains of 118% thus far (Block is down 7% while PayPal declined by 11%).\n\nThe company generates revenue from transaction fees and subscriptions. Unlike the other stocks listed here, its success is most directly related to the success and popularity of cryptocurrencies. For that reason, it's a much riskier stock to hold -- but it also has more potential upside.\n\nThe business has been struggling through the first six months of 2023, however, as revenue of just under $1.5 billion was down 25% year over year. The positive is that its net loss during that stretch was $176.3 million, a small fraction of the $1.5 billion loss Coinbase incurred over the same period last year.\n\nCoinbase is a stock that's most suitable for investors with high risk tolerance. But even if you do invest, you should tread carefully with the stock as it's a volatile investment."

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn't a Security, But Other Cryptos are? - We Speak to the Lawyers - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC has labeled ADA, SOL, MATIC, and other cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nThis labeling has been questioned in the light of the XRP case\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has been unofficially cleared of being a security.\n\nCCN spoke to legal experts to highlight the centralized nature of some tokens as key reasons for the SEC\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nLegal uncertainty continues to cloud several of the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s most influential blockchains and respective tokens after high-profile enforcement actions from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe SEC has been a common feature of news headlines through 2023, with its decision to institute legal action against Binance.US and Coinbase raising concerns of far-reaching consequences for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nKey arguments laid out by the SEC against the two major exchange operators in the U.S. include allegations that many cryptocurrency tokens are deemed to be securities offerings. Both Binance.US and Coinbase are facing a raft of charges for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s allegations against Coinbase also list the likes of Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) as unregistered securities on the exchange, which had a marked effect on the value of these smart contract blockchain ecosystem tokens over the past few months.\n\nThe legal considerations are broad, with the SEC arguing that many cryptocurrency ecosystems and their tokens are securities and should fall under its remit. In having not registered with the agency, the likes of ADA, SOL, and MATIC have potentially fallen foul of its regulations.\n\nCCN reached out to legal experts to unpack how the SEC has approached Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem and what makes BTC exempt from being classified as a security while other tokens are currently in the crosshairs of the U.S. watchdog.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Stance on Bitcoin\n\nPreston Byrne has been advising technology companies on commercial law as a partner at BrownRudnick , with a keen focus on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He tells CCN that the question of whether a token is a security or not is a legal consideration which depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding its creation and existence through the application of legal precedent.\n\nByrne notes that the only entity entitled to make this type of determination in a legally binding way is a U.S. judge or jury.\n\n\u201cThe SEC seems to have concluded, in my view correctly, that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t satisfy these criteria, as evidenced by the total absence of enforcement action in this area and some offhand remarks by then-SEC Chair Jay Clayton in 2018 and subsequently by current SEC Chair Gary Gensler,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nByrne says that despite the SEC not making any official judgments on Bitcoin itself, arguments that the preeminent cryptocurrency does not meet the criteria of the long-established Howey Test have seen the SEC lean towards this direction of classification.\n\n\u201cThe three-prong Howey test requires a finding that a contract, transaction, or scheme needs an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits arising from the efforts of others. There are colorable arguments for Bitcoin and indeed many other coins also that not all these elements are present.\u201d\n\nByrne adds that the SEC is taking a stern position on MATIC, SOL, and ADA in the Coinbase litigation. However, the judicial fact-finder, either a judge or jury, would be \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d in terms of deciding whether the U.S. exchange is operating an unregistered securities exchange or not.\n\nDavid Hoppe, the managing partner of Gamma Law , gave a more detailed breakdown of how Bitcoin does not fall within the scope of the SEC\u2019s Howey Test. He outlines the SEC\u2019s decision to not deem Bitcoin as a security based on the Howey Test based on four factors:\n\nAn investment of money. In a common enterprise. With a reasonable expectation of profits To be derived from the efforts of others.\n\nHoppe notes the SEC concluded that Bitcoin did not meet the second factor, reasoning that Bitcoin is not a common enterprise because it is not managed by a central authority but by a decentralized network controlled by its users.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not a financial investment. It is not a claim on the future profits of a company or project. Bitcoin is not sold with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others. Its value is determined by supply and demand, not by the efforts of developers or manager,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nWhy are ADA, SOL, and MATIC under fire?\n\nHaving outlined why the SEC does not view Bitcoin as a securities offering, Hoppe then touched on the agency\u2019s view on other tokens perceived to be securities.\n\nThe SEC has not publicly stated the specific criteria it uses to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security, but Hoppe put forward three factors that the agency is using to make these determinations.\n\nHoppe notes that the level of centralized control is one aspect. Where Bitcoin is decentralized in nature, other tokens are managed by a core team.\n\n\u201cThis is in contrast to other cryptocurrencies, such as MATIC and SOL (at least), which are arguably controlled by central development teams or large holders,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nThe purpose of a cryptocurrency is another consideration for the SEC. Given that Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, BTC was not intended to be held for capital appreciation, which Byrne suggests is at odds with tokens under SEC scrutiny.\n\n\u201cMATIC, SOL, and ADA are all designed to be used in decentralized applications, but arguably intended to provide a capital appreciation opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the SEC has taken the position that the marketing of a cryptocurrency can be a factor in determining whether it is a security. If a cryptocurrency is marketed as an investment, then it is more likely to be considered a security.\n\nSEC Taking Advantage of U.S Crypto Legal Stance\n\nFrom a legal perspective, there is consensus that Bitcoin is not judged to be a security. However, the status of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, which features a plethora of tokens operating on a variety of multi-purpose blockchains, is not so clear cut.\n\nByrne believes that SEC has been forthcoming about the logic behind its recent enforcement actions against the likes of Coinbase, Binance.US as well as the ongoing Ripple/XRP court case.\n\nThis is despite not providing more detailed information about how the likes of ADA, SOL and MATIC have been ruled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cIts reasoning is fairly clear. The SEC waited a very long time to take the position it did regarding altcoins and exchanges \u2013 roughly 10 years \u2013 but the interpretation they have adopted is one which was within their power to adopt,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoppe says the SEC could have been more forthcoming with its reasoning behind its decisions to label a number of tokens as securities in recent lawsuits. However, there are reasons why there has been a perceived lack of regularity clarity from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n\u201cThe nature of cryptocurrency is still evolving. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new technology and business model, and its legal status is still being debated. This makes it difficult for regulators to develop clear rules for the sector,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nHe also notes that the global nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it difficult for regulators to coordinate efforts and develop consistent rules. From a U.S. perspective, Hoppe says that the SEC and CFTC have different views on how to regulate cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has taken a more aggressive approach to regulating cryptocurrency, while the CFTC has taken a more hands-off approach. This has led to confusion and uncertainty in the market.\u201d\n\nThis has led to a number of challenges for the cryptocurrency sector. Instances of crypto-related companies struggling to raise capital and list their tokens on exchanges is a prime example.\n\nSigns of Change\n\nWhile the U.S. cryptocurrency ecosystem has expressed fears that regulatory oversight in the country will drive businesses abroad and negatively effect the industry, Hoppe anticipates clearer regulatory guidelines for in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe SEC and CFTC have been working on developing regulations for cryptocurrency, and there is a growing consensus among regulators that a regulatory framework needs to be developed for cryptocurrency in order to provide clarity for companies in the space, protect investors and reduce the risk of fraud,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nHoppe added that the SEC could be more forthcoming with the industry to address repeated concerns. This could be done by providing more detailed explanations of its reasoning in its lawsuits, publishing guidance on how to comply with securities laws for cryptocurrency companies as well as holding public hearings on the regulation of cryptocurrency.\n\nThis would allow the SEC to hear from a variety of stakeholders and to get feedback on its proposed regulations."

        "title": "September has been a bad month for Bitcoin. This year could be among the worst - Fortune",
        "content": "September has never been a great month for Bitcoin, and, according to analysts, this year could be worse than usual.\n\nBitcoin has only recorded positive monthly returns in September twice since 2013. Otherwise, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency has consistently taken modest drawdowns, according to crypto data firm CoinGlass. A year ago, the coin fell 3% in September, and while it typically falls by single digits during the month, it fell as much as 19% in 2014, a year in which the coin lost half its value.\n\nThis year, some analysts are predicting a monthly decline of up to 10%, which as of Wednesday would put Bitcoin around the $23,000 range. The top crypto had been trading consistently at around $30,000 between June and mid-August before falling back to earth. Since then, barring a few spikes, it has floated between $25,000 and $26,000. That said, it\u2019s still up 55% year to date, but far from its 2021 high of more than $68,000.\n\nOn Crypto Twitter (now X), pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital said in a Tuesday tweet that they expected a decline of 7% to 10% based on historical data. Benjamin Cowen, another crypto analyst and influencer, said 10% is more likely.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission last week sent Bitcoin up as much as 8%, to $28,000, but in just a few days those gains were erased.\n\nRic Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said investor eagerness following the Grayscale decision was misplaced. \u201cThis was a euphoric response from those who naively believed that the ruling would instantly translate into a spot Bitcoin ETF becoming available for purchase,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAlthough the court vacated the SEC\u2019s decision to deny Grayscale\u2019s proposal to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, the agency isn\u2019t being forced to approve one immediately. But that could happen in October.\n\nIn the wake of the Grayscale decision, some analysts have said the odds of the SEC eventually approving a spot Bitcoin ETF have improved. Valkyrie Investments chief investment officer Steven McClurg said in a TV interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday he thinks the odds of his firm\u2019s application being approved in October are greater than 50%. Still, the SEC has already delayed its final decision on several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from Valkyrie and BlackRock, until mid-October.\n\nValkyrie CIO Steven McClurg says he believes there is \"a greater than 50% chance\" that the SEC will approve a spot-Bitcoin ETF this year https://t.co/epvKek1dXa pic.twitter.com/oJsWZy1TSe \u2014 Bloomberg (@business) September 5, 2023\n\nEdelman pointed out that the agency has several other options that don\u2019t include approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe SEC could instead appeal the court\u2019s decision, demand that Grayscale refile its application, delay all pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications for 240 days each, or even rescind its prior approval of bitcoin futures ETFs (which would seemingly satisfy the court, which objected to the ETFs being treated differently),\u201d Edelman added via email. \u201cAny of these actions would send Bitcoiners into despair, and likely cause Bitcoin prices to fall 20% or more.\u201d\n\nStill, some analysts, including Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at digital assets brokerage K33 Research, believe now is the time to buy. In a Tuesday note, Lunde said Bitcoin should not be trading at a three-month low, given that the last quarter brought about several positive developments\u2014BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application and Grayscale\u2019s court victory among them.\n\n\u201cThe last three months have greatly enhanced the odds of an ETF approval,\u201d Lunde wrote, \u201cyet prices are far from reflecting this.\u201d"

        "content": "The state of crypto is presented by Tron connecting the world to the power of Cryptocurrency. JP Morgan. Analysts predict more likely that the SEC will be forced to approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several asset managers after a federal court ruled that the regulator must review its rejection of grey scales attempt to convert the great scale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Joining us now to discuss is the founder of Digital Assets Council of Finance Financial Professionals, Rick Adelman. Welcome to the show. Rick. Great to be with you. Thanks, great to have you here this morning. Now, we've been talking about ETF S uh what, what feels like forever. Um And while we, we've had some developments, it feels like we've had none. So I'm so happy you're here with us this morning to kind of unpack uh what might happen next? Let's talk about your white paper. You recently wrote a white paper called, what you need to know about spot Bitcoin ETF S. Tell us what you think. Uh we need to know what are the important points here. Well, this is uh you know, referring to the, the gray scale lawsuit which uh the SEC lost. This is probably the most bullish signal for crypto in years, but we mustn't get too far ahead of ourselves. Uh Although uh everyone in the crypto community is very excited about the fact that gray scale won the lawsuit, which frankly was widely expected because the S ECs position was absurd. The court did not take the SEC to approve of the spot coin ETF applications. That's not what the court said. The court said that what the SEC did is unreasonable uh was arbitrary and capricious and simply said that it must vacate its prior decision. So what does that leave us? Well, we're all expecting that as a result of the lawsuit, the SEC is going to approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications gray scales as well as nine other applications that are pending before the SEC. Um But that isn't necessarily what the SEC might do. Gary Gusler still remains very opposed to crypto and he seems to have it in for Bitcoin in particular. Uh And so he may do any one of a number of other things. Uh then he may uh appeal the ruling. He's got 45 days to make that decision. Uh If that happens, we're going to go through months, maybe even years of another legal process. Uh The SEC may uh stall uh as they did this past week. Uh right before the, the holiday uh in the US, we uh had the SEC kick the can on the bit wise applications and several others giving them an extra 240 days to make a decision as to what they're going to do here. Uh Third, the SEC could act yes and say, well, ok, fine. Can't say no to gray scale. Then we're gonna tell gray scale to ref file their application. That won't, that's not an approval that's starting the clock over again. And it could take another six months to a year for that process to go through. And finally the SEC could do something that I think a lot of folks are not really talking about the SCC could take the court literally, Jen, the, the court told the SEC that you, that you can't say yes to futures ETS and no to spot ETS. That's kind of like saying you can eat ketchup, but you can't eat tomatoes. It makes no sense. Futures are derivatives. So how can you say yes to the derivative without saying yes to the underlying asset. And that's why the court said no good. Well, the SEC could take the court literally and say, well, if we can't say no to the spot, we'll also say no to the futures and they could pull the futures ETF s off the market, which is the exact opposite of what anybody would ever suspect the SEC to do. So there's a lot of things the SEC could do that are not equating yes to the spot ETF S. So while there's a lot of optimism and I share the optimism that we're going to see the spot ETF applications approved. Let's not get carried away into thinking that that's the only course of action the SEC may take that last point you brought up. There was one of the most interesting points in your notes as I was going through them. What's the likelihood that the SEC comes back and says actually, this Bitcoin futures ETF is going to be rescinded and not allowed in the US anymore. I think it's really low. It's very rare for the SEC to pull a product off the market, especially when you want a product that has been operating perfectly fine, especially now that it has a massive amount of assets in it. The disruption in the both the crypto and financial communities would be massive, the outcry would be huge. It would clearly be demonstrating that that Gary Gentler is operating in a manner that is not in the best interest of investors, uh or the uh industry. So I find it very unlikely, but Gary Gs has done some pretty dramatic things over the past couple of years that are unsustainable, unsupportable. He's gotten thumped by the courts many times ripple now, gray scale, it's expected he'll lose the coin based lawsuit. Uh And uh so it's unlikely but, you know, look at the ripple lawsuit instead of saying, ok, I lost, I'll do what the court said gentler is appealing the decision. Uh So it's hard to say what he'll do, Rick. I got to get your opinion on this. Bloomberg, senior ETF analyst, Eric Walsh said on the Unchained podcast that exchanges like coin base will suffer when the SEC finally approves a spot. Bitcoin ETF S. Do you agree with that? Yes and no. Uh I certainly see the argument and I think, um, it will reduce coin base's business volume. Um Let's, let's put it this way. The overwhelming majority of investment advisor, we're talking 77% say that they are not investing in crypto. They're not recommending it for their clients without the uh existence of an ETF. So when the ETF comes into the market, those advisers are going to be recommending the ETF, they're not gonna be recommending that their clients open Coinbase accounts. So in that sense, people who are currently going to Coinbase and Gemini and crack in and other platforms to uh obtain their crypto are going to turn to the ETF instead because the ETF is so much easier, so much more convenient, so much more liquid lower in cost. Uh high transparency. This is why ETF S are the favorite investment vehicle on the planet for all of those investment opportunities and benefits. So people who are currently buying crypto in other, more cumbersome, more complicated, more expensive ways are going to abandon those and go to the ETF. That's bad news for exchanges uh like coin base. But on the other hand, let's remember something really important. This new spot, Bitcoin ETF is only Bitcoin. It isn't ether, it isn't solana, it isn't polygon, it isn't anything but Bitcoin. And eventually people are going to remember that portfolio diversification is what really matters. Owning only Bitcoin is not necessarily the end all so long term, this could work out well for, for a coin base, as people realize, oh, I do want to have access to other coins and tokens and I can't get that in this Bitcoin. Ef that would mean that we're using the Bitcoin ETF as a foot in the door. This is your first journey down that rabbit hole and it could actually spell good news for the exchanges as investors look for broader ways to engage in the crypto space. So I agree with this point that in the short run, it may hurt coin base but longer term, I think it legitimizes uh Coinbase existence. Uh On that note, there is a report that came out of Bernstein that said, quote, the crypto ETF opportunity won't stop at just Bitcoin but will extend into multiple crypto assets. We of course have the Ether futures. ETF um on the books right now, waiting for an sec approval or denial. Do you see ETF S kind of spanning into other crypto assets that will as well will ETF S become the norm? There's no question. This is just the very beginning. And that's why this is such an exciting moment, not just for Bitcoin, but for crypto broadly, uh this is gonna be a rising tide scenario. Uh And it's great news across the board for Bitcoin or coins and tokens for the platforms and exchanges for the uh S ma separately managed accounts for the Ira custodians that allow you to buy crypto in your ira. This is great news for everybody everywhere. So, yeah, this is just the beginning and maybe this is why Ginzler has been so reticent to say yes to anything because he, he's opposed to this slippery slope. Uh And while we see it as a RS tide, he sees it as a downward problem. Uh But yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think Bernstein is right on the money and we're going to see in the future that this will be remembered as the initial uh movement into the market place. And it is by far going to be the only one rick before we go. I have to ask you about a webinar. You did last month. You were reportedly predicted that Bitcoin would be in the neighborhood of 100 and $50,000 by the summer of 2025. Talk to me about what went into that prediction um and what needs to happen for us to get there. It seems like a far shot away from the markets check we did at the beginning of the show. Yeah, when I said that that would represent a five X increase in Bitcoin in only about a two year period does sound ridiculously bullish. Although there are others even more bullish than me. There are a lot of reasons that I offer this. Number one, we are beginning to see a sea change while we've been in the crypto winter for far longer than any of us want. And we've had NASA amounts of fraud and abuse and SCC enforcement actions, many of which have been justified. We are also beginning to see the turnaround of this. We're getting rid of the bad boys of crypto. Those crypto bros need to be gone. Many of them are the few remaining will soon be gone. And we're beginning to see the continued development of the technology, the further integration, the adoption and engagement at the institutional level pension funds and other major institutions, endowments and such all engaging in crypto. We also see the sec losing major lawsuits, ripple unis and now most recently gray scale, we are also seeing that over the next six months, we're going to be facing the next Bitcoin having, which historically has always been extraordinarily bullish for the price of Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin you earn as a miner gets cut in half. That naturally calls for a price doubling for miners to keep their economic words intact. So all of these things are spelling really good news for crypto uh we're seeing legislation coming out of Congress, we're looking at stable coin adoption on a global basis. So all the signs are pointing really strong. And if history is any guide as a result of the having by the summer of 25 I fully expect we'll see Bitcoin well into the low single digits. And even if I'm wrong and way wrong and Bitcoin merely doubles, show me how any other investment has the potential of doing in the next 18 to 24 months. What crypto is the opportunity of doing? So? It's a very exciting time for crypto. And that's why I wrote my white paper on what's happening with the spot ETF applications. Uh Why I wrote my book, The Truth About crypto and why we offer our certificate program so you can become certified in Blockchain and digital assets, all of that available at DFP dot com. All right, Rick, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show this morning. It was a pleasure chatting any time Jen, that was the founder of Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, Rick Adelman. Before we go, we shipped out that coin desk and gray scale are both owned by digital currency group."

        "title": "Bitcoin Up 365999% Since Krugman Dismissed It at $7 - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Twelve years ago, economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman first addressed Bitcoin and his opinion was skeptical to say the least.\n\n\n\nIn that now-famous article, penned for The New York Times on September 7, 2011, Krugman criticized and dismissed the cryptocurrency, which was then trading at an average of $7.03 per Bitcoin across exchanges.\n\nFast forward to today, and Bitcoin's remarkable journey has proven Krugman's skepticism to be one of the most costly missed opportunities in financial history, as demonstrated by the reaction to an X post today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.\n\nWhen Krugman's article was published, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. The digital money, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, had only been around for a couple of years. It was largely unknown to the mainstream, with a small but passionate community of early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\n\nIn his article, Krugman argued that Bitcoin was a bubble waiting to burst. He questioned its viability as a currency, criticized its decentralized nature, and expressed skepticism about its long-term prospects.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin's price of $7.00 seemed trivial, and many shared Krugman's doubts.\n\nHowever, history has proven Krugman and other early Bitcoin skeptics wrong. Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived over the past 12 years. Its price has experienced unprecedented growth, reaching highs of over $69,000 in early 2021.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $25,000 per coin, representing a staggering 365,999% increase from its price when Krugman penned his critique.\n\nStill, it's worth noting that Krugman acknowledged at the time that Bitcoin had been a good investment, even while he questioned it could serve as a currency, writing:\n\n\n\n\"The dollar value of that cybercurrency has fluctuated sharply, but overall it has soared. So buying into Bitcoin has, at least so far, been a good investment. But does that make the experiment a success? Um, no. What we want from a monetary system isn\u2019t to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that\u2019s not at all what is happening in Bitcoin.\"\n\nIn addition, he criticized Bitcoin for being deflationary, adding that there is an \"incentive to hoard the virtual currency rather than spend it.\"\n\nBut while this has proved largely true, Krugman's claims have been undermined by Bitcoin's continued utility as a currency, BTC's rise to $25,000 demonstrating its potential as a means of transferring value across borders with relative ease.\n\nBitcoin has even been adopted as a currency in El Salvador, where it serves alongside the U.S. dollar as a form of legal tender, in wide use by small merchants. Further, Bitcoin, 15 years on, retains a niche in online commerce.\n\nAll this in mind, in retrospect, Krugman's dismissal of Bitcoin at $7 serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of financial markets and the potential for revolutionary technologies to reshape the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action suggests that the asset remains in a precarious position, and a recent report from ARK Invest says that short-term Bitcoin investors had no choice but to capitulate in August, as the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit fell by 14 percentage points.\n\nBitcoin market sentiment and monthly valuation change in August. Source: ARK Invest\n\nAlthough many traders view significant price dips as buying opportunities, at this point in the Bitcoin (BTC) halving cycle, a notable bearish move was Bitcoin\u2019s price falling below its 200-week moving average (MA) for the first time since June 2023.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, the 200-week MA generally acts as a key support level during major downtrends, and ARK suggests that any future bearish catalysts could see the BTC price fall as low as $20,300, where its realized price currently resides.\n\nBitcoin 200-week moving average and realized price. Source: ARK Invest\n\nDespite the rather dismal short-term outlook for the crypto market, a more optimistic view of Bitcoin\u2019s dip below the 200-week MA would highlight the fact that dips below the realized price and the long-term moving averages presented cyclical buying opportunities. Investors who accumulated when the price dipped below both metrics in 2019, 2020 and early 2022 found themselves in deep profit within the next six months.\n\nAnalyst Ben Lilly recently alluded to a similar occurrence within the Bitcoin dominance metric, suggesting that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s about to take the driver\u2019s seat again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin market cap dominance. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to Lilly:\n\n\u201cIn terms of price action, right now I see a lot of similarities to what took place in 2019. And it has me anticipating a trend to unfold regarding Bitcoin over the next few weeks and possibly months. It has to do with Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a measure of Bitcoin\u2019s market share of crypto based on its market cap. In the chart below, we can see that that rally in 2019 started back in 2018, when we got a nice double bottom (red box), followed by a solid run up until Q1 2019. Then, we trended down for a few months (first red arrow) before getting the massive reversal on April Fools\u2019 Day (first green arrow).\u201d\n\nComparing market participant sentiment from 2018-2019 to the current market sentiment, Lilly suggested that today\u2019s price action reminds him of the pre-reversal period in 2019 when \u201cwe were in a winter, everybody was low energy, nobody cared about bitcoin or crypto.\u201d\n\nStablecoin market cap data also reflects the absence of bullish investor sentiment, and according to ARK, the fact that \u201cthe 90-day supply of aggregate stablecoins has dropped more than 20% from $162 billion in March 2022 to $120 billion today\u201d is illustrative of the decline in market liquidity and investors\u2019 confidence in engaging with Bitcoin and altcoins.\n\nStablecoin aggregate market cap 90-day percentage change. Source: ARK Invest\n\nObviously, the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are on nearly every retail and institutional investor\u2019s mind, and until one is approved or the narrative of the upcoming Bitcoin halving takes precedence over the \u201cETF approval triggering a bull market narrative,\u201d the market dynamics described above are likely to persist.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "When you hear the word mining, your first thought probably goes to miners wearing dirty overalls and helmets with flashlights on them carrying pickaxes and shovels into dark tunnels in a quest to strike gold.\n\nBut there\u2019s a new \u201cgold rush\u201d happening that replaces pickaxes and shovels with powerful computers and advanced software programs. And instead of mining for gold nuggets, this new crop of miners is trying to unearth a new kind of commodity that you can\u2019t see or touch: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining has captured the imagination of thousands of folks with dreams of making a fortune overnight, very much like the wave of travelers flocking to California in the 1800s to dig up gold. It\u2019s a frenzy that has gone from a few folks with computers in their basements to warehouses filled with computers as far as the eye can see in an attempt to mine for bitcoins\u2014the most popular and widely accepted form of cryptocurrency in the market today.\n\nBut how do you \u201cmine\u201d for something that only exists in the digital realm? Here\u2019s what bitcoin mining is, how it works, and whether or not it\u2019s worth your time (and money).\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins by solving complex math problems meant to confirm that transactions made with bitcoins are legit. Don\u2019t worry: You don\u2019t have to do any actual math yourself with a calculator or anything like that\u2014your computer does all the work for you.\n\nBitcoin mining basically does two things. First, it releases new bitcoins into the market (and it is the only way that new bitcoins are created). And second, bitcoin mining helps make the Bitcoin payment network more trustworthy, with thousands of computers working to validate transactions made with bitcoins to prevent fraud and double spending. (We know\u2014this is a lot to digest. Keep reading, this will make more sense in a second!)\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a second. Before we can really dive into bitcoin mining, we need to cover some Bitcoin basics first. It\u2019s a completely digital currency, which means there are no actual paper bills or metal coins involved. Instead, everything is done over the internet and bitcoins are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them.\n\nOne of the biggest fears surrounding digital currencies like Bitcoin is that someone can hypothetically \u201ccopy\u201d a bitcoin and send it to someone else while still holding onto the original bitcoin. This is called double spending, and it\u2019s something you have to worry about with any virtual currency.\n\nHow does a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which isn\u2019t regulated by or tied to any government, fight against the risks of cybercrime and fraud to create a safe and secure network? That\u2019s where bitcoin mining comes in.\n\nYou see, Bitcoin is powered by something called blockchain technology. A blockchain is basically a digital record of transactions that is copied and passed around across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. This makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system\u2014because everyone in the network has access to the ledger and can see if something doesn\u2019t match up.\n\nJust think of the blockchain as a really, really big book. This book contains every transaction ever made with bitcoins, and each page in that book represents a \u201cblock\u201d of transactions made with bitcoin.\n\nMarket chaos, inflation, your future\u2014work with a pro to navigate this stuff.\n\nBitcoin mining is just a way to make sure that the transactions on a new page are legitimate. If they are, that page is added to the book. So if you think about it, bitcoin mining is really bitcoin transaction verification (but that sounds even less fun than mining\u2014which doesn\u2019t really sound fun at all).\n\nBitcoin miners add blocks of the transactions to the blockchain by using specialized computers to solve math puzzles that help confirm whether or not a block of transactions is valid. These computers perform millions of calculations at lightning speed to try and quickly solve those math puzzles through a process of trial and error. It\u2019s basically a race between your computer and thousands of other bitcoin mining computers around the world to solve the puzzle first.\n\nWhen a block gets added to the chain and the new bitcoins are rewarded to the miner who solved the puzzle first, the process then starts again.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reward for Successfully Mining Bitcoins?\n\nIf you\u2019re the first to solve the puzzle, congratulations! For successfully adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain, you get rewarded with some newly created bitcoins\u2014also known as a block reward. If you successfully mined bitcoin today, you would receive 6.25 bitcoins as your block reward.\n\n(Side note: The reward for successfully mining bitcoin gets cut in half after 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, or roughly every four years. In 2024, the reward for mining bitcoin will be chopped down to 3.125 bitcoins.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a limit to how many bitcoins can exist. There\u2019s a maximum of 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Right now, there are about 19 million bitcoins in existence\u2014meaning there are roughly 2 million bitcoins left to be mined.\n\nOnce that 21 million mark is reached, no more bitcoins can be created . . . which means bitcoin miners will rely on transaction fees instead of block rewards for profits. But experts say the last bitcoin probably won\u2019t be mined until the year 2140 . . . so there\u2019s plenty of time to figure out what comes next.1\n\nWhy Bitcoin Mining Isn\u2019t Worth It\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached all-time highs in 2021, almost hitting $69,000 per bitcoin in early November.2 So if someone successfully adds a block of transactions to the blockchain and gets 6.25 bitcoins as a reward at around that price, those bitcoins would be worth almost $431,000!\n\nSounds great, right? But the bad news is that bitcoin is so expensive, complex and time-consuming that you\u2019re better off staying away from it altogether. Here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t quit your day job to become a bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin prices are very unpredictable.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is more up and down than the Tower of Terror at Disney World\u2014with the price rising and falling by thousands of dollars in a matter of days. Just how volatile is Bitcoin?\n\nIn October 2021, Bitcoin made headlines by crossing the $66,000 per coin threshold.3 Bitcoin owners were feeling pretty good at that point! Fast forward to one week later, and the price tumbled back down to under $58,500 per bitcoin, an 11% drop.4 That means in seven days the value of Bitcoin lost $7,000 in value. And that\u2019s just a typical week in the life of a Bitcoin owner.\n\nAll this means one simple thing: You never really know what your bitcoins will be worth if you ever wind up successfully mining for them (and that is a very big if). And then there\u2019s the risk of everyone waking up one morning and suddenly agreeing that Bitcoin is worth as much as Monopoly money . . . if that happens, that\u2019s the ballgame\u2014and you\u2019ll be left with nothing for all your efforts. Do not pass \u201cGo\u201d and do not collect $200.\n\n1. The competition for bitcoin mining is fierce.\n\nAs time goes on, it\u2019s going to get more and more difficult to successfully mine for Bitcoin (and the reward for successfully mining Bitcoin will become smaller and smaller). That\u2019s because there will be more miners getting in on the hunt to compete for the next block reward.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s harder to mine for bitcoin today than it has ever been\u2014with mining difficulty reaching an all-time high of 25 trillion back in May 2021.5 Translation? That means it is insanely more difficult than ever to successfully mine for bitcoins because there are more and more miners trying to get in on the action and it will take a ton of computing power just to keep up with them.\n\nYou\u2019ll be going up against firms that have built warehouses filled with thousands of computers that are mining for Bitcoin all day, every day. If you\u2019re trying to compete with them with a single mining computer in your basement, good luck with that! You probably have a better chance of winning the lottery and then getting hit by lightning on the way to pick up your prize than successfully mining bitcoins.\n\n2. Bitcoin mining is very expensive, complex and time-consuming.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly by design. You need a specific kind of computer hardware that is known as \u201capplication-specific integrated circuits\u201d (or ASICs) and those puppies can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $14,000 each\u2014maybe more.6\n\nThese computers also require massive amounts of energy to operate (upsetting many environmentalists in the process), which can rack up your electric bill and cut your profits. Fun fact, if Bitcoin was a country made up of bitcoin miners, it would consume more electricity than Argentina (yes, the country) as a whole!7\n\nThe Proven Way to Building Wealth\n\nBuilding wealth is a marathon\u2014not a sprint. And bitcoin mining is just the latest in the long line of get-rich-quick schemes that will more than likely leave you broke and broken.\n\nMost millionaires in America today didn\u2019t build their seven-figure net worth by rolling the dice on risky investments they didn\u2019t understand or pouring money into a long shot. Here are three things they did do:\n\nDave Ramsey\u2019s new book, Baby Steps Millionaires: How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth\u2014and How You Can Too, will show you the proven path that millions of Americans have taken to become millionaires\u2014and how you can become one too!\n\nTalk With a Financial Advisor\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to get started on the path to building wealth the right way, get in touch with one of our SmartVestor Pros.

Positive regulatory developments coupled with the upcoming halving event of Bitcoin in 2024 have the potential to lead to a strong price increase for Bitcoin,\u201d wrote Ermolaev, referencing the below chart.\n\nmr5E5lnTO1U6PcgM8UTe4mNOyDPK eq9IWgD36rXgwLaYuefWql2yagbz5K 8525eYpqxJBZM2z4LCmuKTwd79QkI571pQSKHwuLvADg6ODPSUdxlZ AanNwf0cGs7H6k7 NJrWsZlwoPl09Xib8NAY\n\nAs for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether slipped 0.12% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,629 and declined 5.06% during the past week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.15% to US$1.04 trillion while market volume increased 0.04% to US$24.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nMutant Ape Yacht Club sales rise over 200%\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.26% to 2,176.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 0.78% during the week.\n\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s 400% sales surge for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, 24-hour sales for it\u2019s twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 213% to US$762,915, making it the third-largest NFT collection across all blockchains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nBoosted by the collection, Ethereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 32.74% to US$6.62 million. Sales for Milady Maker strengthened 596% to US$287,012.\n\nMythos Chain remained the second largest blockchain by 24-hour sales volume, despite sales falling 6% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 million. Sales for the DMarket collection fell 6.38% to US$1.13 million, remaining the second-largest NFT collection by daily sales volume.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, tokenized real estate platform Roofstock OnChain successfully completed its third property sales through its NFT marketplace, with a property in South Carolina sold for US$204,000 worth of USDC, marking another milestone for tokenized assets.\n\nAsian equities rise despite yuan falling to 10-month low, U.S. equities fall after Cleveland Fed chief hints at more rate hikes\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMost major Asian equities \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shanghai Composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 \u2013 rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except the Shenzhen Component.\n\nChina\u2019s yuan fell to a 10-month low against the U.S. dollar, before the People\u2019s Bank of China stepped in, offering support for the yuan to prevent a further price fall. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that major state-owned banks were actively selling U.S. dollars onshore in early trading, while mopping up yuan liquidity, to slow the yuan\u2019s decline.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures \u2013 fell on Wednesday.\n\nThe declines followed hawkish comments from Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester, who said that the central bank may need to raise rates \u201ca bit higher,\u201d but did not mention what officials should do at the next interest rate meeting that is scheduled for Sept. 19-20.\n\nOver in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 fell 0.63% while Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 fell 0.34%, following hawkish remarks from European Central Bank official Klaas Knot, who cautioned that traders betting against an interest rate increase next week might be underestimating its likelihood.

        "content": "The Solana logo on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this photo taken in Krakow, Poland, Aug. 21, 2021.\n\nThe native token of the Solana blockchain jumped Tuesday after Visa announced it will expand its stablecoin capabilities to the Ethereum alternative.\n\nSolana's sol token was last higher by 4.39% at $20.25, according to Coin Metrics. At one point it rose as much as 6%. Other cryptocurrencies were little changed, with bitcoin hovering below the flat line at $25,803.25 and ether up slightly at $1,640.06.\n\nThe move came after Visa announced it will introduce settlement of the USDC stablecoin over the Solana network. The payments giant said in a statement that the development could help \"improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa's treasury.\"\n\nSolana is one of several networks aiming to rival Ethereum. It's loved among developers, who may choose to build applications on it instead of Ethereum because of its speed and cost effectiveness. It's year-to-date gain is one of the biggest in the crypto market at 101%.\n\nThe announcement follows the launch of PayPal's company-branded stablecoin, PayPal USD. The company said the function of PayPal USD is to reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual settings and allow direct flows to developers.\n\nVisa has been experimenting with USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in the market, since 2021, exploring how it could be used inside its treasury operations to make currency conversion in cross-border payments shorter and cheaper.\n\nBernstein has called stablecoins the \"monster killer app\" for crypto, identifying them as a nearly $3 trillion market over the next five years.\n\n\"We expect major global financial and consumer platforms to issue co-branded stablecoins to power value exchange on their platforms,\" Bernstein said. \"Going forward, we expect tokenized stablecoins to be a $2.8 trillion market, led by regulated, onshore stablecoins.\""

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through September 5, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged last week following the Grayscale ruling, but the initial excitement has quickly died down as Bitcoin\u2019s price has since dropped over 5% from last week. Nevertheless, BTC is now up ~55% year to date.\n\nRead more about the Court of Appeals ruling here.\n\nAfter a brief uptick last week, XRP\u2019s price resumed its general decline that had begun in early July. XRP is currently up ~47% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price hike from last week was also short lived as the price swiftly declined, hitting its lowest point in nearly six months. ETH is currently up ~36% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

According to the press release, the company increased its U.S. operational hash rate by 2% month-over-month to 19.1 exahashes in August, and it increased its installed hash rate by 1% month-over-month to 23.1 exahashes. The rise occurred due to the upgrade of Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro miners to more efficient S19 XP models.\n\nMarathon reached its primary domestic growth target of 23 exahashes and now aims to hit 30 exahashes, with two planned to be obtained through international facilities and five by contract from other entities.\n\nRelated: Marathon Digital Q2 results miss revenue and earnings forecasts\n\nMarathon is also finalizing paperwork on its new mining facility in Garden City, Texas, with its joint venture in Abu Dhabi mining 50 Bitcoin in August.\n\nAs to the relative decrease in BTC production, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel blames it on climate conditions:\n\n\u201cThe decrease in Bitcoin production from July was largely due to increased curtailment activity in Texas due to record high temperatures. These temporary shutdowns more than offset the progress we have made to increase our operational hash rate and optimize our operations.\u201d\n\nIn August, Marathon published its Q2 2023 financial results, claiming a 228% increase in revenue over Q2 2022. The company reported a $23.4 million gain from selling 63% of the Bitcoin mined in the quarter, which it used to fund operating costs.

        "title": "Bitcoin and crypto are about to embark on a 'much stronger fundamental' rally, Bernstein predicts - CNBC",
        "content": "The setup for the next bitcoin bull run has become even clearer after last week's landmark ruling in Grayscale's suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivered what Bernstein calls a \"game changer\" for asset managers. This time, however, it will be led by institutions rather than retail investors, which helps explain why crypto prices remain stagnant despite having several positive catalysts in recent weeks. \"The strong showing in the courts (Ripple and Grayscale in two months), improved ETF chances and the progressive institutional interest are positioning crypto for an unprecedented institution capital led cycle, unlike the retail led crypto cycles of the past,\" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani said in a note Monday. \"This is a cycle slower to take off, but is being laid on much stronger fundamental grounds of regulatory clarity and more strategic long-term players entering the space.\" Last week, bitcoin rallied more than 7% after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC was wrong to deny crypto investment giant Grayscale permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust, known by its ticker GBTC , into an exchange-traded fund. The rally failed to hold, however, and by the time the SEC had delayed its decisions on the first spot bitcoin ETFs two days later, bitcoin had given up all of its gains from the news. BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin is back to hovering under the $26,000 level. \"The existing crypto market remains a low liquidity market, with limited new capital entering the space. As a result, traders position around events and sell the good news,\" Chhugani wrote. \"The lack of follow through in the market should not be interpreted as lack of progress towards a new capitalization cycle.\" Investors remain optimistic about the recent developments and what they could mean for the crypto market over the long term, however. The ruling is just one step forward, but could open the door to the approval of the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S., ushering in a wave of new demand for the digital asset. However, it's unlikely to free the market from the regulatory uncertainty that has pressured it all year. Specifically, the details of the ruling show that the SEC would have to find a new reason to deny these applications again. The agency for years has maintained that various attempts at a bitcoin ETF didn't satisfy concerns about fraud and manipulation in the market. The ruling shot that down, noting that \"bitcoin futures prices are ultimately based on spot market prices.\" Several bitcoin futures ETFs have been green-lit to launch. \"Thus, we believe, the crypto industry will get its first Bitcoin ETF between mid October and mid March 2024 (the scheduled review dates),\" Chhugani said, adding that it probably won't stop there and could open up a \"massive commercial opportunity\" for asset managers \"to generate fees (at healthy rates 50-75 bps) for a growing asset class.\" \"The industry push for Ethereum spot ETF follows immediately after, given ETH also has a similar market structure of a traded CME futures market ( > 2 years) and a spot market,\" he added. \"In fact, the asset management industry would push beyond BTC, ETH into areas [such as] top blockchains (Solana, Polygon etc) and even extend into segments such as leading DeFi assets.\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "In the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s The Market Report, analyst Marcel Pechman explores the drivers that point to Bitcoin heading to $22,000, with investor sentiment worsening after Grayscale Investment\u2019s much-hyped legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Aug. 29 and its postponement of multiple spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund applications.\n\nAccording to Pechman, on the side of the bears are multiple lawsuits from the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, including a potential indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding money laundering and facilitating trades from Russian entities. But, more importantly, U.S. inflation has come down to 3.2%, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is draining liquidity from the markets.\n\nPechman also analyzes BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes\u2019s claims that the Bitcoin bull market began in March. Hayes pinpoints the Silicon Valley Bank fallout and the subsequent intervention by the U.S. Treasury Department as the turning points for the crypto market.\n\nPechman agrees with Hayes but raises the issue of the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies, such as the euro or the Swiss franc, and now sits at the same level as six months prior. Pechman says investors have realized that other countries would likely collapse before the U.S. in the event of a global economic recession.\n\nUltimately, Pechman believes it doesn\u2019t matter to the Federal Reserve if salvaging the banks could trigger economic turmoil, given that U.S. Treasurys and the U.S. dollar are still considered the safest options.\n\nListen to the full episode of The Market Report on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Severance Taxes Saved by Diverting Flared Gas to Bitcoin Mining - FORVIS",
        "content": "Well and pipeline operators in Texas have a new opportunity to apply for a severance tax exemption on otherwise vented or flared gas.\n\nTexas House Bill 591 (HB 591)\n\nHB 591 was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 2, 2023 with an effective date of September 1, 2023. This bill allows for an exemption of severance taxes on natural gas wells that would have legally vented or flared gas. HB 591 may be specifically of interest to those diverting flared gas for use in on-site consumption in mobile centers for bitcoin mining and other mobile or modular data centers. Data center demand continues to rise, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) gains steam.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe gas must be consumed \u201cnear\u201d the qualifying well, which has been defined as 1,000 feet.\n\nA qualifying well is one that: Is connected to a pipeline whose capacity is not expected to meet the demand for gas produced from the well, or Is not connected to a pipeline and would be economically unfeasible to connect to a pipeline, but is operated by a well operator that has contracted the produced gas to a pipeline operator, or Is not connected to a pipeline and is operated by a well operator that has not contractually dedicated the well, the gas produced by the well, or the land or lease on which the well is located to a pipeline operator.\n\n\n\nApplication\n\nThe well operator\u2014and pipeline operator, if applicable\u2014may apply to the Texas Railroad Commission (the TX-RRC) for a severance tax exemption with the following: Attestation of pipeline takeaway capacity not expected to meet the demand for gas produced from the well, and Certification of TX-RRC authorization for gas from that well to be flared for at least 30 days during the preceding year in which the application is filed.\n\nOnce the certification of the well is approved by the TX-RRC, the operator of the well will receive a certificate from the TX-RRC.\n\nUpon TX-RRC certification of the application, a separate application must be filed with the Texas Comptroller.\n\nThis is an annual application process.\n\nQuantifying the Opportunity\n\nA report published in the July 2022 issue of NAPE magazine helps quantify the opportunity well and pipeline operators may have. The publication looked at 185 wells in Reeves County, Texas, that are estimated to be flaring 275,000 Mcf per month. The report estimates that selling this vented or flared gas to data centers would generate about $3.4 million in monthly revenue. This does not consider the additional severance tax that could be saved if the well is a certified HB 591 well.\n\nESG & SEC Reporting Implications\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals and targets are commonly discussed in many boardrooms today. HB 591 creates additional opportunities for operators in Texas to improve ESG performance, while potentially saving on taxes and generating additional revenues.\n\nThe SEC has signaled it will be requiring new climate-related disclosures. However, the timing of when this rule will go into effect is still uncertain. Recent SEC commissioner comments continue to indicate that Scope 1 disclosures will be a key component of the finalized rule. Often, a firm\u2019s flared gas is captured under Scope 1 emissions; therefore, reducing flaring could lead to a reduction in a company\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions profile.\n\nSource: WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (PDF), page 5.\n\nConclusion\n\nHB 591 solidifies the severance tax exemption in Texas. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said, \u201cMany oil and gas operators have not seriously considered partnering with a bitcoin miner to help mitigate and monetize their flared gas. This bill will act as a signal to them that they should consider it more seriously.\u201d\n\nThe eligibility requirements and application process are complex and nuanced.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Wild Ride: Analyzing the Volatility of the Past Month - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Few assets garner as much attention and scrutiny as Bitcoin in the ever-changing cryptocurrency world. The previous month has demonstrated the intrinsic volatility of this digital money, leaving both investors and analysts befuddled by its volatile price movements. In this article, we look at Bitcoin's recent wild journey, evaluating the reasons that have contributed to its volatility and examining the consequences for the broader crypto market.\n\nPrice Swings on a Roller-Coaster\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is infamous for its wild price changes, and Bitcoin is frequently at the epicenter of these movements. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated dramatically over the last month, leaving investors both excited and concerned. This wild ride serves as a reminder of the unusual character of cryptocurrency markets, where emotion and external factors can have a large impact on pricing in a short period of time.\n\nIs Bitcoin's Low Volatility Pointing to a Potential Further Decline?\n\nBitcoin and various cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing low volatility, a pattern that has preceded further price declines in recent times. Bitcoin's price has remained relatively flat at around $25,750 over the past 24 hours, staying below the $26,000 level, which has served as a key support in the previous month. This comes after a brief surge above $28,000 following a pro-crypto court ruling, which proved to be short-lived.\n\nBitcoin's volatility has reached record lows in recent months, and it appears to be returning to that pattern, lacking the dynamism seen in traditional markets like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies continue to be influenced by the same macroeconomic factors affecting equities. Concerns over resurging inflation and its impact on interest rates, which, in turn, affect the demand for riskier assets, have put pressure on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Causes of the Volatility\n\nBitcoin's volatility is caused by a variety of causes, and recent events have highlighted some of the most important ones. Bitcoin's price trajectory can be influenced by regulatory developments, market sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and technological improvements.\n\nUncertainty in Regulation\n\nGovernment regulatory announcements or crackdowns can have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. Speculation about prospective regulatory changes might cause market volatility and sell-offs. For example, rumors of heightened regulatory scrutiny in a major market can cause investors to panic sell, resulting in dramatic price reductions.\n\nMarket Attitudes\n\nInvestor attitude fluctuations frequently impact cryptocurrency markets. Positive news, such as institutional adoption or endorsements from high-profile personalities, can cause price spikes to occur quickly. Negative news, such as security breaches or legal issues, might, on the other hand, cause sell-offs and significant price decreases.\n\nTrends in Macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin's value is also affected by broader economic factors. During periods of economic uncertainty, investors may regard Bitcoin as a safe haven against traditional financial markets, resulting in greater demand and price increases. In contrast, during periods of economic optimism, Bitcoin's price may fall as investors shift toward riskier assets.\n\nTechnological Progress\n\nBitcoin's price can be influenced by technological advancements inside the bitcoin ecosystem. Updates to the Bitcoin network, scalability enhancements, and breakthroughs in security protocols can all have an impact on investor confidence and price stability.\n\nConsequences for the Crypto Market\n\nThe dramatic price oscillations of Bitcoin might have repercussions throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, frequently follow Bitcoin's lead, with their prices corresponding to Bitcoin's changes. This connection arises from Bitcoin's prominence and status as the crypto space's benchmark.\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin fluctuates significantly, it might increase trading activity across all cryptocurrencies. Traders may attempt to profit from short-term price movements, increasing volatility throughout the market. Furthermore, significant price movements in Bitcoin can cause investors to rethink their positions in other cryptocurrencies, potentially causing cascading impacts on their pricing.\n\nGetting Through the Volatility\n\nWhile Bitcoin's volatility brings both opportunities and threats, investors must proceed with caution and knowledge.\n\nA variety of factors can influence short-term price fluctuations, many of which are difficult to forecast. As a result, navigating the unpredictable cryptocurrency market requires a long-term investing strategy underpinned by comprehensive research and risk management.\n\nA Look Into the Future\n\nBitcoin's volatility may progressively reduce as cryptocurrency marketplaces develop and regulatory clarity improves. Participation by institutions, regulatory acceptance, and widespread adoption could all contribute to a more stable price environment. However, due to the speculative character of cryptocurrencies, some volatility is expected to endure.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin's recent rapid rise highlights the cryptocurrency market's unique difficulties and prospects. While its volatility can be intimidating, it also exposes the possibility of large gains and losses in a short period of time. Traders and investors must remain cautious, remaining educated about the factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements and taking into account their risk tolerance and investment objectives. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, the lessons acquired from Bitcoin's wild ride will surely impact market participants' strategies."

        "content": "Bitcoin BSC, a BEP-20 version of Bitcoin that offers staking rewards for investors, launched its token presale yesterday and raised more than $20,000 within a matter of hours.\n\nThe project offers early investors a chance to buy BTCBSC at only $0.99, a price Bitcoin last touched back in 2011.\n\nBTCBSC is the latest in a string of so-called \u2018Bitcoin clones\u2019 that have often outperformed Bitcoin itself in the short term for traders. BTC20, an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin, recently achieved a 688% return on its presale. Another Bitcoin clone, BTC 2.0, delivered a 538x return for investors before seeing a price correction.\n\nBy comparison, the price of Bitcoin itself is down 11.3% over the past month. Excitement over a potential spot Bitcoin ETF caused the price of BTC to rise to $27,700. However, that price support has waned significantly as the SEC signaled it plans to slow-walk any ETF approval.\n\nBitcoin BSC issues staking rewards every 10 minutes\n\nThe project\u2019s website describes how Bitcoin BSC is fundamentally different to Bitcoin in two ways.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s built on Binance\u2019s BNB Smart Chain, which supports proof-of-stake mining. That leads to the second key difference: Bitcoin BSC offers staking rewards.\n\nInvestors in BTCBSC can stake the token to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn rewards without traditional Bitcoin mining. The token is structured so that new BTCBSC rewards are released every 10 minutes, on the same schedule as Bitcoin block rewards.\n\nStaked tokens are locked for 7 days. The reward investors receive is proportional to how many tokens they have staked out of the entire staking pool.\n\nThe ability to stake BTCBSC changes the incentives for investors in this token. They can profit not only from the price of BTCBSC increasing, but also from holding and staking BTCBSC and earning token rewards.\n\nSixty-nine percent of the total BTCBSC token supply has been set aside for staking rewards, ensuring that there are enough tokens to continue rewarding investors for 120 years. BTCBSC rewards will cease around the same time that Bitcoin is fully mined out.\n\nBNB smart chain offers fast, low-cost transactions in BTCBSC\n\nAnother important advantage for BTCBSC is that the BNB Smart Chain offers extremely fast and cheap transactions. It\u2019s faster than not only the Bitcoin blockchain, but also the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis makes BTCBSC a potential alternative to the ERC-20 Bitcoin clone BTC20. Whereas investors can transact BTCBSC for an estimated $0.10 on BNB Smart Chain, transactions in BTC20 on the Ethereum blockchain can cost up to $10.\n\nBEP-20 tokens like BTCBSC are also widely compatible with dApps, including decentralized wallet apps like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. That makes it easy for investors to buy and sell BTCBSC, including during the presale. Presale investors can purchase BTCBSC on the Bitcoin BSC homepage using ETH, BNB, or USDT.\n\nBitcoin BSC presale promises fair launch at $0.99 price\n\nThe Bitcoin BSC presale, going on now, offers investors a limited-time chance to lock in BTCBSC at a price of only $0.99. That\u2019s nearly the same price at which BTC20 launched before delivering a 7x return for investors.\n\nThe total supply of BTCBSC is 21 million tokens, the same as for Bitcoin. The presale will make 6,125,000 tokens available for purchase, while the remaining 14,455,000 tokens are reserved for staking rewards.\n\nAt launch, BTCBSC will have a market cap of $6,063,750. That\u2019s nearly 100,000 times lower than the market cap of Bitcoin, illustrating just how much room this new token has to run after it hits exchanges.\n\nInvestors can check out the Bitcoin BSC whitepaper or follow the project\u2019s Twitter and Telegram accounts for the latest presale updates and roadmap progress.\n\nThe presale has a soft cap of $3.96 million and, based on the performance so far, it could sell out quickly. Once the presale sells out, the team behind Bitcoin BSC plans to launch the token on a BNB Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange.\n\nTake part in the Bitcoin BSC presale, powered by Web3Payments, at bitcoinbsc.io."

        "title": "Hedging cryptocurrencies with futures: A look at common use cases - Coinbase",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have delivered strong returns relative to traditional assets on both an absolute and a risk-adjusted basis over the past decade, with bitcoin generating an annualized return of 47.88% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.08, compared to 10.26% and 0.84 for the S&P 500, according to data from Portfolios Lab as of August 9, 2023. But the common tradeoff has been exposure to high volatility. For many investors, managing that volatility can be challenging, and that\u2019s led to increasing interest in hedging that risk. While there is a cost to hedging any investment, crypto or otherwise, the costs of not hedging can be significantly higher. History is rife with examples of institutions \u2013 from Long Term Capital Management to Lehman Brothers or First Republic \u2013 that have collapsed, largely as a result of their failure to properly hedge their exposure to different financial risks. Holders of cryptocurrencies may want to hedge for various reasons. Venture capital firms (VCs) might want to hedge the risks of tokens they own that are currently locked; participants in proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols may wish to hedge potential downside price moves while staking; and miners may want to insulate themselves from future price volatility. It\u2019s possible to hedge crypto holdings using liquid and regulated futures, but doing so requires a keen understanding of which vehicles and strategies to use, how different cryptocurrencies are correlated, and how to manage costs and mitigate risks. Choosing the appropriate hedging strategy depends on the particular circumstances and assets. Below, we look at some of the most common use cases and provide investors with guidelines to help them construct effective hedges for each.\n\nScenario 1: Protecting staked positions As ethereum (ETH) and other PoS cryptocurrencies have garnered greater market share, many holders have opted to stake their holdings. When users want to withdraw or unlock their staked tokens, a process known as unbonding, they need to initiate a request to release the locked funds from the staking contract. However, most PoS networks impose a lockup period, and, in the case of ETH, the exit queue was several weeks long immediately after withdrawals were enabled in April 2023. While the wait time has since normalized, it is still variable. If holders want to insulate themselves from price declines while waiting to complete the unbonding process, or if they want to hedge against depreciation risks while actively staking their assets, they can sell futures against their holdings. For ETH holders this is relatively straightforward, as there are liquid ETH futures contracts available. But liquid and regulated derivatives may not be available for holders of other commonly staked tokens, such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA). In these cases, holders can construct cross hedges using (other) positively correlated assets. For example, a synthetic hedge can be created by selling an appropriate amount of either bitcoin (BTC) or ETH futures as a proxy. To determine which futures contract to use, holders could identify the cryptocurrency with the highest positive correlation to their staked asset. For example, as seen in the table below, DOT and ADA both exhibit slightly stronger correlations with ETH than with BTC, so ETH futures may provide a more precise hedge. Next, holders may calculate the hedge ratio, which is defined as: (Standard Deviation of Spot Asset / Standard Deviation of Futures Contract) * Correlation Coefficient. For example, as of August 7, 2023, DOT had a standard deviation of 2.74 and ETH had a standard deviation of 2.13, according to Macroaxis data, while the 30-day correlation coefficient between the two was 0.83, as seen in the table below. So the hedge ratio between the two was: (2.74/2.13) * 0.76 = .1.07. So, each dollar of DOT exposure in this hypothetical example could be hedged with $1.07 of ETH futures. Correlations among BTC, ETH, ADA, and DOT BTC ETH ADA DOT BTC - 0.89 0.86 0.76 ETH 0.89 - 0.84 0.83 ADA 0.86 0.84 - 0.73 DOT 0.76 0.83 0.73 - Source: Coinbase, August 2023. Of course, correlations can and do change over time, sometimes quite suddenly. So, when constructing hedges such as these, where the asset used to hedge is different from the one held, it\u2019s crucial to continuously monitor the performance of the assets and the correlation between them and to adjust the hedge ratio if necessary. It is also worth noting that hedges can not protect against certain risks that are unique to crypto assets, notably protocol risk, which is the risk associated with the underlying technology or protocol on which a cryptocurrency operates. For example, if a significant security vulnerability were discovered in a token\u2019s underlying protocol, the price of the token \u2013 and its correlation with BTC and ETH \u2013 could drop meaningfully.\n\nScenario 2: Hedging assets that are locked up Many token holders, notably VC firms, are subject to lockup periods that can last several years, during which tokens cannot be liquidated. Tokens with significant market caps and a high percentage of locked assets include Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI). As with many staked tokens, liquid and regulated derivatives are not available for these locked tokens, but it is possible to construct a hedge with BTC or ETH futures. The table below shows the 30-day correlation coefficients between ARB, AVA, SUI, BTC, and ETH. Again, we see relatively high correlations to ETH and slightly lower correlations to BTC. Correlations among BTC, ETH, ARB, AVAX, and SUI BTC ETH ARB AVAX SUI BTC - 0.89 0.63 0.44 0.55 ETH 0.89 - 0.68 0.59 0.54 ARB 0.63 0.68 - 0.67 0.54 AVAX 0.44 0.59 0.67 - 0.39 SUI 0.55 0.54 0.54 0.39 - Source: Coinbase, August 2023.\n\nScenario 3: Hedging for bitcoin miners Bitcoin miners depend on selling their BTC for more than it costs them to mine it, so significant price declines can seriously impair profitability. This dynamic would seem to make hedging a natural part of the mining business, as it is for miners of traditional commodities like gold. However, many miners didn\u2019t hedge their exposure throughout bitcoin\u2019s long bull market. But the bear market of 2022 drove home the potential benefits of hedging, and more miners are now hedging with derivatives. To do so, miners can sell futures contracts with a notional value equivalent to the value of their BTC holdings or sell \u201cforward production\u201d and lock in a price at which their mined BTC can be sold. Alternatively, miners could hedge the portion of their mined BTC that is needed to pay for fixed operational expenses (e.g., estimated energy costs) and leave the balance of their BTC production unhedged to retain market exposure. By selling futures, miners don\u2019t have to pay an upfront cost (beyond minor transaction costs outlined below), as they would if they were purchasing put options because futures are settled at expiry. If the miner sold BTC futures at $25,000 and the price was trading at $26,000 at expiry, then they would owe $1,000 per coin. They would sell their spot BTC and pay the cost, pocketing the $25,000 per coin. If the price went down to $20,000 per coin at expiry, the futures contract would essentially pay the $5,000 difference \u2013 again, allowing them to realize a price of $25,000 per coin. Miners need to maintain enough cash margin to support the futures position throughout the lifecycle. If the price of BTC were to increase significantly, for example, they might need to post additional (variation) margin. These margin requirements are designed to protect both parties involved in the futures contract and ensure that the gains are able to be paid by the losing party."

        "title": "Waiting For Confirmation: Bitcoin Optech's Series On Mempool And Policy - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Much of the discussion about Bitcoin technology lately revolves around various soft-fork consensus changes to the Bitcoin protocol including new opcodes or sighashes or around layer 2 technologies like Lightning. Discussion of mempool or policy (the non-consensus rules around Bitcoin nodes communicating with one another) often falls to the background. However, with recent high transaction volume and launch of various NFT and token projects/platforms and the accompanying feerate spike, mempool and policy came to the forefront.\n\nUser of Inscriptions and other protocols ran into issues with standardness policy rules, leading many to question their purpose and look for ways to remove or subvert them. Regular Bitcoin users ran into issues with fees or bumping fees. In an effort to educate and engage the community, Bitcoin developers Gloria Zhao and Murch authored a 10-week series about mempool and relay policy called \u2018Waiting for confirmation\u2019 on the Bitcoin Optech website.\n\nThe series starts with an overview of what this cache of unconfirmed transactions we call a mempool is and why we have one. Having a mempool of unconfirmed transactions allows better fee estimation for wallets, faster downloading of new blocks, and supports a decentralized transaction and block relay network.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin miners are under no obligation to include these unconfirmed transactions in a block. As block space is limited, miners select transactions with the highest feerate by transaction weight to maximize their profits. The post on incentives details some nuances around feerates including the fact that onchain fees are paid not in proportion to the transaction amount but by the size of the transaction and complications that arise with relationships between different transactions.\n\nBut what should a transaction\u2019s feerate be? That is the goal of feerate estimation: to translate a user\u2019s urgency into a minimal feerate a transaction should pay. Transactions in the mempool and transactions in recent blocks can help provide a good start for estimating transaction fees.\n\nIn \u2018Bidding for block space\u2019 Gloria and Murch discuss practical strategies to get the most for your transaction fees. When creating a transaction, consider coin selection, using newer output types like taproot\u2019s P2TR that allow for fee savings, or batching. After broadcasting a transaction, techniques like Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) and Replace By Fee (RBF) can be used to increase the feerate of a transaction that is taking too long to confirm.\n\nWith the goal of a robust and decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes in mind, we want it to be as cheap and accessible as possible for anyone to run a node. Not only that, but a node\u2019s resources must be protected from DoS attacks. Transaction policy rules that are more restrictive than Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules help protect node resources (including memory, computational resources, and bandwidth) by enforcing limits on its untrusted peers on the Bitcoin P2P network.\n\nLikewise, network-wide resources including the UTXO set, protocol upgrade hooks, the size of the block chain and the computational effort required to process it, also need to be protected. A series of other policy rules, including limits on arbitrary data publishing to the block chain, minimum feerates, and limits on low value outputs all help safeguard these network resources.\n\nWhile policy is optional, Bitcoin Core doesn't offer many ways to configure them. In \u2018Policy Consistency\u2019 Gloria and Murch outline potential ramifications of altering some of the default policies and why Bitcoin Core has historically been conservative with the configurability of policies.\n\nIt is not just individuals running nodes that should be aware of transaction policy rules. Wallets, services, and layer 2 protocols that broadcast transactions must be designed with policy rules in mind to avoid creating transactions that are rejected and to ensure they can get confirmed, even during times of fluctuating feerates. For example, different types of pinning attacks are possible on L2 settlement transactions like Lightning that take advantage of limitations in mempool policy to prevent incentive-compatible transactions from entering mempools or getting confirmed.\n\nJust as policy rules have been changed or added in the past, there are a series of proposals to improve policy as well. Package relay, cluster mempool, version 3 transaction relay, and ephemeral anchors are a few that are under development currently.\n\nHowever, since transaction relay policy changes to Bitcoin Core can impact many ecosystem participants, they require collaboration, socialization, feedback, and testing from the wider Bitcoin community prior to consideration. The authors note: \u201cDecentralized decision-making is a challenging process, but necessary to support the diverse ecosystem of protocols and applications that use Bitcoin\u2019s transaction relay network.\u201d\n\nReaders should consider getting involved in the different avenues of discussion and participation.\n\nBitcoin Optech\u2019s also has a podcast special that highlights all of the 10 weeks of our discussion with Murch and Gloria, including comments by guest speakers and questions from the audience.\n\nThank you to Gloria Zhao and Mark \u201cMurch\u201d Erhardt for authoring the series as well as explaining each weekly article on the Bitcoin Optech Podcast.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals (ORDI), a blockchain platform for transforming satoshis into NFTs, plans to introduce plain-text key-value pairs as metadata for inscriptions, enhancing their utility and readability. However, existing inscriptions cannot be retroactively added.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals (ORDI), a blockchain-based platform known for its unique inscriptions, is on the verge of a significant update. Introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, a programmer and artist, as reported by Blockchain.News, Bitcoin Ordinals serve as a system for numbering and tracking individual satoshis, transforming them into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform has now proposed an addition of metadata to these inscriptions.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are unique in the blockchain space, offering a way to inscribe digital content directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain. They are based on ordinal theory, which assigns a unique number to each satoshi based on when it was mined. This allows for the tracking, transferring, and imbuing of individual satoshis with meaning. Unlike traditional NFTs on platforms like Ethereum, Bitcoin Ordinals store content or art directly on-chain.\n\nImmutable Metadata\n\nCasey's recent proposal aims to introduce plain-text key-value pairs as metadata for inscriptions. Made public on September 5, 2023, the proposal is \"intentionally simple, supporting only plain-text key-value pairs,\" covering \"the vast majority of use-cases\" and designed to be \"human readable and easy to display without a schema.\"\n\nNo Retroactive Changes\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of retroactively adding metadata to existing inscriptions, Casey clarified,\n\nNope, unfortunately not. Inscriptions are immutable, so it is not possible to add metadata to old inscriptions.\n\nTrading and Wallets\n\nAs Bitcoin Ordinals grow in popularity, trading tools are emerging to facilitate the buying and selling of these digital artifacts. Ordinals Wallet and Hiro Wallet, launched in February 2023, are among the trusted platforms that allow users to store, send, and trade Ordinals.\n\nImplications for the Blockchain Industry\n\nThe move to add metadata to inscriptions could set a precedent for other blockchain platforms seeking to enhance the utility and readability of their data. However, the immutability factor remains a double-edged sword, offering both security and limitations.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are a burgeoning technology with growing use-cases, including porting Ethereum NFT collections to Bitcoin. As demand increases, the ecosystem is expected to mature, offering more user-friendly journeys.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Blockchain analytical firm Arkham Intelligence identified Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust as the second-largest Bitcoin (BTC) holder in a Sept. 6 post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe company said that the trust is the \u201csecond largest BTC entity globally\u201d and that the fund contains over $16 billion of the flagship digital asset. This is in tandem with Grayscale\u2019s website, which shows that the total assets under its BTC trust are $16.009 billion.\n\nArkham revealed that the funds are distributed among more than 1,750 addresses, each holding 1,000 BTC or less.

At the time, the crypto investment funds cited \u201csecurity concerns\u201d as why it decided not to publish on-chain addresses associated with it. Nonetheless, its custodial partner, Coinbase, later released a report detailing the assets it held on behalf of the investment firm.\n\nArkham\u2019s disclosure positions it as the pioneering firm in identifying the specific addresses associated with the GBTC fund.\n\nArkham previously identified Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust as the second-largest Ethereum (ETH) holder, with addresses associated with the fund holding around $5 billion worth of ETH. The firm had also identified Robinhood as the holder of the third-largest Bitcoin wallet and the fifth-largest Ethereum wallet.\n\nGBTC discount under 20%\n\nGBTC\u2019s discount has remained under 20% despite the bearish sentiments that have kept BTC under $26,000 for most of the current month, according to Ycharts data.\n\nThe discount had rapidly dropped to its lowest level within the last two years after Grayscale secured a victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August. The court had ruled that the financial regulator acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in rejecting its attempt to convert its trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "What is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index? - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is based on the concept that investor fear pushes Bitcoin price down while greed pushes the price higher.\n\nThis metric correlates with the metaphor of a bear (fearful) or bull (greedy) market.\n\nInvestors can get a feel for whether Bitcoin is underpriced or overpriced by using the Index to understand the real-time influence of market mood.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate by taking Decrypt U's free course, Bitcoin\u2019s price is ultimately influenced by human emotion, and the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is a measure of this investor sentiment. Here, we find out why the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index can be an important market tool.\n\nIn an ideal world, Bitcoin\u2019s price would always reflect its underlying or intrinsic value. In reality, and in the same way as other as other assets, Bitcoin\u2019s price is significantly driven by how investors feel about the market and, ultimately, how investors act in response to their emotions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSentiment trends like investor fear or investor greed (equal to bearish or bullish markets, respectively) can push Bitcoin price above or below expectations of value.\n\nYou can find the index here.\n\nCNN developed the first Fear and Greed Index in 2011 as a tool for stock market investors. The concept has since been adopted for cryptocurrency. It\u2019s now a useful metric for Bitcoin investors and traders looking for a snapshot of market feeling to aid their decision-making.\n\nHow does the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index work?\n\nThe Index itself is a scale from 0 to 100. A value of 1 shows investor sentiment is \u201cextreme fear.\u201d This would be a strong bearish market, indicating Bitcoin owners are selling their assets. In contrast, the scale at 100 dictates \u201cextreme greed,\u201d where investors and traders are enthusiastically buying.\n\nHow is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index measured?\n\nThe Index rating draws from a number of factors, such as Bitcoin volatility, Bitcoin whale activity, trading volume, Bitcoin market dominance, social media and wider media sentiment, and also search engine data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index curators often categorize the numeric values of the scale using the following structure, but some have a fifth, neutral level of sentiment sitting in between \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cgreed.\u201d\n\nIndex Level Market Sentiment 0-24 Extreme Fear 25-49 Fear 50-74 Greed 75-100 Extreme Greed\n\nIterations of the Index can be found at alternative.me, LookIntoBitcoin.com, BitDegree.org, and CoinStats.app with rating history data available as far back as 2018.\n\nWhy is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index important?\n\nThe Index can be used to make buying and selling decisions. Some investors might join the \u201ctrend du jour\u201d and follow the market, selling when there is fear and buying when there is greed.\n\nPrimarily, the Index is used to reveal the opportunity in the market. Traders can buy Bitcoin when fearful investors sell at a low price and later sell for a much higher price when the Index denotes greed, or high demand.\n\nThe volatility of Bitcoin and its alignment with the wider crypto market make the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index especially useful as a quick gauge.\n\nFear in the market occurs when Bitcoin owners are doubtful about their investments. For example, if new regulation threatens to stifle the market or an exchange hack results in investor losses.\n\nGreed in the market demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin, and this could be as an asset class or indicate broader confidence in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. When Elon Musk revealed Tesla\u2019s investment in Bitcoin in February 2021, the Index rocketed to a rating of 92. Conversely, the lowest Index rating to date occurred in March 2020 as COVID-19 fuelled panic spread through conventional and emerging financial markets.\n\nCan you rely on the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index?\n\nThe short answer is no, at least not alone. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is a useful indicator of the emotion driving market sentiment toward Bitcoin in the short term, and it has its limitations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, there are a number of Bitcoin fear and greed indexes published by different organizations. There is often little depth to the transparency of how the index ratings are calculated. What\u2019s more, the factors that contribute to the ratings are difficult to quantify, they are subjective in nature. This contrasts with CNN\u2019s stock market Fear and Greed Index, which is based on calculable deviations from the average for metrics of market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand.\n\nLastly, although some Bitcoin fear and greed indexes are updated up to twice per day, Bitcoin\u2019s price history tells us that substantial market volatility can occur in a few hours or less.\n\nA Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is an excellent tool for confirming Bitcoin market sentiment, but its best use is in conjunction with other tools, research, and due diligence."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold: Google Bard AI shared 4 reasons why BTC is better - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Since the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC), its proponents have often regarded the cryptocurrency as a potential rival to the traditional store of value, gold. It\u2019s worth noting that these two products belong to distinct asset classes, and as Bitcoin matures, proponents believe it may eventually surpass gold. This topic has sparked debates within financial circles.\n\nIn this scenario, Finbold sought insights from the generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform Google Bard, posing, \u2018Which asset is a better investment: Bitcoin or Gold?\u2019 The tool provided four compelling reasons why Bitcoin might have an advantage over gold as an investment.\n\nGoogle Bard\u2019s comparison between Bitcoin and gold. Source: Google Bard\n\nHighly liquid and can be traded 24/7\n\nThe tool identified liquidity as the main advantage of Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which necessitates physical possession, Bitcoin can easily be traded and transferred 24/7, allowing investors to access their funds quickly and conveniently. This ease of access and high liquidity make Bitcoin an attractive option for those who value agility in their investments.\n\nEasy to store and transfer\n\nUnlike gold, which necessitates physical possession or storage in a secure vault, Bitcoin is a purely digital currency, existing solely in the digital realm. This characteristic makes it extremely easy to store and transfer.\n\nAll that is required is a digital wallet, which can be a software, hardware, or paper wallet, to Bitcoins securely. Investors can store their wallet information digitally or even memorize a passphrase, making it highly portable and easy to access.\n\nNot subject to government regulation\n\nBard also identified another point in Bitcoin\u2019s favor: its independence from government regulation. Gold has historically been subject to government oversight and regulation, which can impact its value and trade.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin operates on decentralized blockchain technology, making it resistant to government interference. This attribute appeals to individuals seeking a financial asset that operates outside traditional systems.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are ongoing global efforts meant to regulate Bitcoin, but entirely outlawing the digital currency has become a challenge.\n\nPotential for high returns\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s staggering value ascent has magnetized investors looking for substantial returns. While gold boasts a track record of wealth preservation, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory suggests the potential for significant gains within a relatively short span. This allure of high returns, however, comes bundled with cryptocurrency volatility.\n\nOn the other hand, the AI tool also offered some of Bitcoin\u2019s cons, identifying volatility, new asset class, and risks of hacking and theft as the main undoing of the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin represents a relatively uncharted asset class in comparison to gold. Yet, its underlying technology holds the potential to transform various industries beyond finance. As blockchain advances, Bitcoin\u2019s utility and value may expand, making it a captivating investment.\n\nIn summary, Bard indicated that ultimately, when it comes to investment options, it narrows down to the individual and their preferences."

        "title": "Bitcoin would trade at this price if it hits its all-time high market cap - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high price of $69,045 on November 10, 2021, as well as an all-time high market cap of $1.302 trillion on the same day. Bitcoin is usually promoted as \u2018digital gold\u2019, due to having a programmed distribution and limited max supply of 21 million BTC \u2014 which can, theoretically, make it a great Store of Value (SoV) long term.\n\nHowever, even with such highlighted good economic fundamentals, BTC is still affected by its supply inflation, while the 21 million units have not been fully distributed to Bitcoin Miners.\n\nConsidering data retrieved by Finbold on September 5, with a current circulating supply of around 19.48 million BTC, one Bitcoin would be worth close to $66,838 \u2014 $2,207 (3.19%) less than its price all-time high in US dollars.\n\nBitcoin Market Cap All-Time High on November 10, 2021. Source: TradingView\n\nMoreover, market capitalization is usually used to measure the market\u2019s perception of value in a given asset, as well as its speculative demand in a given moment. Meaning that Bitcoin constantly needs an increased demand to meet historical prices with a previously lower supply, in a practical application of the supply and demand economic law.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, BTC is trading at $25,747 at the time of publication, which would potentially offer the possibility for Bitcoin investors to gain 160% for purchases made at this moment if the leading cryptocurrency ever meets previous demand.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nComparatively, the current price is -62.72% lower than the all-time high price.\n\nBitcoin supply inflation\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto decided to create \u201cBitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d, he had to decide how the coins would be distributed in this system. \u201cWho would receive it?\u201d, \u201cHow much would be received?\u201d and \u201cHow often would it be received?\u201d were questions that needed to be answered.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s creator solved the puzzle through mining which, at the same time, would be used to keep the network safe through the Proof-of-Work (PoW); mining would also reward these \u201cworkers\u201d with the programmed distribution of the coin, according to the \u201cwork\u201d that could be \u201cproved\u201d.\n\nIn this way, it was established that: with each block discovered and added to the blockchain, the miner would release an amount in BTC, not yet in circulation, through a special transaction called \u2018coinbase\u2019.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto programmed the Bitcoin protocol so that the amount of coins released into each block through the coinbase was halved whenever 210,000 blocks had been mined, until it reached zero, completing the distribution at close to 21 million BTC \u2014 something expected to happen in the year of 2140, if nothing is changed until then.\n\nInterestingly, in the current \u2018halving cycle\u2019 of 6.25 BTC being created in every block, released on average every 10 minutes (according to the mining difficulty adjustment), Bitcoin has a supply inflation of 900 BTC per day or 328,500 BTC per year. Resulting in a yearly inflation of around 1.7%, that will be halved in 2024.\n\nHow other cryptocurrencies would perform according to their all-time high market cap?\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nAnalyst Crypto Rover attributes the current lull market to BlackRock, accusing the asset manager of deliberately driving down Bitcoin price.\n\nIn his opinion, the firm is trying to achieve a better buying position so that the ETF earns them more upon approval.\n\nWhile this is mere speculation, it is a reminder for retail investors to be more analytical in a market swayed by big players.\n\nBlackRock asset manager is among the list of institutional players awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after filing applications for Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals.\n\nAlso Read: The BlackRock and crypto connection is much deeper than what people know of\n\nBlackRock driving Bitcoin price down deliberately, Crypto Rover\n\nWhile the market awaits a decision from the US SEC, crypto enthusiast and renowned analyst Daan de Rover (Crypto Rover) says BlackRock asset manager is deliberately driving Bitcoin price down. His thoughts are based on the argument that the company would \u201crequire actual Bitcoin to back their Spot ETF\u201d if approval comes.\n\nMany individuals don't realize that BlackRock would require actual Bitcoin to back their Spot ETF.\n\n\n\nThey might have already purchased their Bitcoin months ago when prices were lower.\n\n\n\nOr, they could be deliberately driving down prices currently to establish a better buying\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dKW2awmcuL \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 5, 2023\n\nIn this regard, Rover presents two perspectives:\n\nThey might have already purchased their Bitcoin months ago when prices were lower. Or, they could be driving down prices deliberately to establish a better buying position for themselves.\n\nHe wagers on the latter, noting that they would be fighting to keep prices up if they had bought earlier. Therefore, a surge in prices, possibly steered by a Spot BTC approval, would earn them more value against their purchase price.\n\nCrypto Rover has built a career helping investors understand cryptocurrency trading through free educational content on different topics. These range from basic investing basics to advanced technical analysis.\n\nInstitutional investors buying Bitcoin\n\nAccording to renowned Bitcoin writer Mark Helfman, institutional investors rarely buy BTC directly lest they expose themselves to legal and regulatory risks. Instead, they leverage custody solutions to conceal their activities. Helfman cites \u201clarge buyers and sellers\u201d who \u201cfind a broker for a private sale and settle the exchange in batches.\u201d\n\nThe transactions happen outside the exchange at an agreed price different from the spot price indicated on the exchange. In Helfman\u2019s words:\n\nSince bitcoin is pseudonymous and you can create new wallets ad nauseum, plus brokers are not obligated to report private deals, it\u2019s difficult to know who\u2019s moving money where without forensic technology or an insider who knows about the deal.\n\nAs a result of this, buying and selling often happens without affecting the price of Bitcoin, meaning it may go unnoticed on a chart because they tactfully buy just enough at any given time not to disturb the price. That said, large holders can still also dump Bitcoin to drive down the price.\n\nMore broadly, institutional investors are more experienced, knowledgeable, and have more connections. Given their mostly huge Assets Under Management (AUM), it only takes a small fraction of their holdings to influence Bitcoin price.\n\nInstitutional investors are usually highly secretive about their dealings. By the time retail traders know an institution has made a move it is usually too late, says Helfman. They would only announce \u201cWe are interested in buying,\u201d for example, after they had already bought.\n\nIf there is any truth to Rover\u2019s assertions, then it highlights the role and influence of big corporations in driving the market. It also reminds retail investors to be more analytical in a market swayed by big players."

        "title": "Jack Dorsey's Thirst For An Africa-Led Bitcoin Revolution Is Not Going Away - WeeTracker",
        "content": "In a significant development for the campaign to drive adoption of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin in Africa, \u20bftrust, a non-profit organisation seeded by X (fka Twitter) and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey and music tycoon Jay-Z (Shawn Carter), committed to decentralising Bitcoin software development, has recently acquired Qala, a fledgling organisation that set out to train African Bitcoin and Lightning engineers.\n\nThe deal, finalised this month, will result in Qala undergoing a rebranding as the \u20bftrust Builders Programme, marking a strategic move to further \u20bfTrust\u2019s mission of promoting the development and education of Bitcoin open-source engineers from the Global South.\n\n\u20bftrust, established in 2021 with initial funding of 500 Bitcoins from Jay-Z and Dorsey, a notable Bitcoin maximalist known to be keen on the potential for Bitcoin adoption in Africa, primarily focuses on nurturing developer talent and supporting the free and open-source Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\u201c[\u2026] Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!) [\u2026],\u201d Dorsey wrote in 2019 as he concluded a tour of key African tech hubs, adding that he would be living in Africa for 3-6 months the following year to push the mission, though those plans ultimately never materialised. However, in 2021, Dorsey co-created the Bitcoin endowment \u2018\u20bftrust \u2018 with an initial focus on funding Bitcoin development in India and Africa, appointing three Nigerians to its board months later.\n\nAfrica\u2019s crypto prospects have long been promising, with growing adoption, innovative applications, and increasing interest from both the public and private sectors. Although the downturn currently stifling the crypto market has caused a lull, interest in Bitcoin has soared over the years as the continent embraces digital currencies, blockchain technology, and fintech innovation to address financial access gaps.\n\nCurrently overseen by a board of directors including Abubakar Nur Khalil, Carla Kirk-Cohen, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai, \u20bftrust has initiated initiatives such as the Africa Open Source Cohort, supporting Bitcoin Development Kit contributor Vladimir Fomene, and proudly sponsoring the Africa Bitcoin Conference, an annual gathering of Bitcoin stakeholders from across Africa and beyond.\n\nOn the other hand, Qala, founded in 2021, specialises in identifying, training, and connecting African software developers with leading Bitcoin companies worldwide, equipping them with highly sought-after skills in the global Bitcoin talent market. With a vast online community spanning over 42 countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, Qala boasts an impressive fellowship placement rate, with its alumni securing positions at renowned companies like Galoy, SphinxChat, and Bitnob, along with receiving open-source grants from \u20bftrust and Superlunar.\n\nBernard Parah, Co-Founder/Director of Qala, expressed his enthusiasm about the acquisition, emphasising that it will significantly accelerate their mission to cultivate a critical mass of African engineers well-versed in Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, which can drive transformative change across the continent. Parah sees this transition not just as a boost for the Bitcoin ecosystem but also as a crucial step towards leveraging Bitcoin to achieve financial freedom in Africa and the Global South.\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Femi Longe, CEO of Qala, and Stephanie Titcombe, Programmes Manager at Qala, will assume roles as Programme Leads at \u20bftrust Builders. This move signals a shift in \u20bftrust Builders\u2019 focus towards open-source training, and they have already launched a call for their next cohort of senior African software developers interested in transitioning into Bitcoin and Lightning development.\n\nOjoma Ochai, a Board Member at \u20bftrust, expressed pride in welcoming Femi and his team, highlighting Qala\u2019s remarkable work in driving open-source development in the Global South through education, closely aligning with \u20bftrust\u2019s core mission. The organisation is now committed to building upon Qala\u2019s achievements and empowering more developers in the Global South to create innovative open-source solutions using Bitcoin.\n\nLooking ahead to September 2023, \u20bftrust Builders is gearing up for the \u2018Build for Africa\u2019 Hackathon, aimed at encouraging makers to develop solutions that address African challenges and boost Bitcoin adoption on the continent. This event will serve as a platform for open innovation and collaborative problem-solving, with a particular focus on tackling Africa-specific issues and accelerating Bitcoin projects through mentorship in design, development, and Lightning integration. The hackathon sets the stage for the Africa Bitcoin Conference in December, an event that \u20bftrust supports for the second consecutive year, solidifying its commitment to the region\u2019s Bitcoin community.\n\nFeatured Image Credits: Coin Culture"

        "content": "Rick Edelman, manager of the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals fund, has revealed some predictions for the price of bitcoin by the summer of 2025.\n\nHe believes the price will reach $150,000 in the next two years, driven by continued technological growth and the likely approval of a spot ETF by the SEC.\n\nAt the moment, however, the price of bitcoin is struggling and the likelihood of a return to $20,000 in the short term is looking increasingly real.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nRic Edelman and his predictions for the price of bitcoin by 2025\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals, said in a recent interview with Coindesk that his predictions for the future price of bitcoin are very bullish.\n\nSpecifically, according to the manager of the $300 billion fund, the leading cryptocurrency will reach a price of $150,000 by the summer of 2025.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Founder of $300 billion fund manager Ric Edelman predicts #Bitcoin to hit $150,000 by summer of 2025 \u2013 CoinDesk pic.twitter.com/B1Whoq3HNU \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 5, 2023\n\nThere are many reasons for his optimism.\n\nFirstly, Ric Edelman notes that following the SEC\u2019s stepped up legal action in June this year, we are going through a period of change, with the crypto market getting rid of the \u201cbad boys\u201d and becoming a cleaner industry.\n\nIn addition, the continued technological growth of the protocol is driving adoption to new horizons, with more institutional players interested in cryptocurrency and more asset management funds, venture funds and pension funds attracted by its potential.\n\nIn particular, the entry into the crypto sector of BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Wisdom Tree and Invesco with their various applications for a spot ETF and Invesco has reinforced the bullish forecasts of most digital asset analysts, who now see a rise in the price of bitcoin as increasingly likely.\n\nIndeed, the approval of a spot ETF would lead to a significant increase in volume in the regulated markets, as many fund managers would be forced to buy the underlying in the market in order to offer it to their clients, significantly reducing the supply in circulation.\n\nSpeaking of supply, Eric Edelman also mentioned the halving factor in his explanation of the bullish forecast for bitcoin, explaining that the expected halving of the miners\u2019 premium in April 2024 could trigger a bull run in the price of digital gold.\n\nAt least, this is what has happened in recent years, with bulls always coming out on top after the previous three halving of the cryptocurrency, which occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nFor example, if we take the price of bitcoin in October 2019 (7 months before the next halving) and that in July 2021 (the summer after the halving), we can see a 5x increase in its value.\n\nSimilarly, now that the next protocol update is 7 months away, we can expect a similar performance, which would take the price of the cryptocurrency directly to over $125,000 by 2025.\n\nIf we also take into account the much more positive outlook compared to the context of 2019, when cryptos were still a \u201cbet\u201d, we can easily agree with Erc Edelman\u2019s prediction, which could potentially reach an even higher value than the one mentioned for 2025.\n\nThe accumulation period before a BTC halving has historically been the best time to build a position.\n\n\n\nThe mark up phase post halving this time could see Bitcoin rally up to 5-600% above the current price if we assume a bull top at 150-180k.\n\n\n\nThis period won't last forever. pic.twitter.com/HK4KPL95jt \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 3, 2023\n\nMarket analysis of the value of bitcoin\n\nDespite Eric Edelman\u2019s extremely positive predictions for the price of bitcoin by the summer of 2025, the short-term price action looks set to mark further declines unless a catalytic event occurs in the coming weeks.\n\nSince mid-July, the market\u2019s most capitalised crypto has interrupted the positive phase it has been experiencing throughout 2023, with prices beginning to fall rapidly without the ability to respond to the bears.\n\nNot even Grayscale\u2019s victory against the SEC on 29 August, when the appeals court described the federal agency\u2019s reaction as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and forced it to reconsider its offer for a spot ETF, was enough to reverse the short-term trend.\n\nThis bodes ill for the price outlook, as the asset lost 1.5% and then 5% over the next two days, wiping out all of its earlier gains.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is now hovering around $25,700, with many short positions open just above $26,000 and downward pressure looking to break through the $25,000 support.\n\nIn particular, there have been two downward attacks that ended in liquidity grabs and the formation of two spikes, one on the 22nd of August and one on the 1st of September, which has technical analysts worried. A further downward push could permanently break the key level and take bitcoin to $23,000 and then $20,000.\n\nOnly a small bullish divergence on the daily RSI, which we are currently observing, could have a positive impact on the price in the coming days, which now seems to be compromised to the downside.\n\nDaily Bitcoin price chart (BTC/USD)\n\nGiven the market outlook, it is unlikely that we\u2019ll go below $20,000, as that figure represents the top of the 2017 bull run and there are plenty of traders ready to enter the market around that level.\n\nIn any case, in the short term, the odds are in favour of the short sellers, with prices likely to fall throughout September, which is statistically a terrible month for price action in the asset.\n\nIn fact, since the currency has been tradable on the markets, there have only been 2 occasions when its price has posted positive gains this month, compared with 8 occasions when it has posted losses.\n\nOctober, on the other hand, tends to be a month of strong gains, especially in the years leading up to the half and half years.\n\nThe decline could therefore continue for a few more weeks before the bulls take over again."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing mounting bearish pressure, just a week after the cryptocurrency attempted to rally toward the $30,000 level, supported by positive regulatory developments. These bearish sentiments arise as crucial technical indicators signal a potential downward trajectory in both the short and medium term.\n\nAs per an analysis posted on TradingView on September 5 by TradersWeekly, caution should be observed when assessing Bitcoin\u2019s price. The analysts noted that despite a brief period of stability over the long weekend, BTC price largely remained flat, hovering around the $26,000 mark, a notable area of concern.\n\nThe analysis pointed out that after a brief spike above $28,000 last week, Bitcoin\u2019s technicals have begun to turn bearish again. Furthermore, the weekly timeframe also indicates a growing bearish sentiment, with key indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Stochastic Oscillator pointing firmly to the downside.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOf particular concern is the MACD, which currently hovers just slightly above the midpoint. TradersWeekly warned that a further slide to zero could spell more trouble for the cryptocurrency, anticipating a further drop below $24,000.\n\n\u201cMACD is just slightly above the midpoint, and if it breaks below zero, it will strongly bolster a bearish case in the medium term. As a result, our stance has not changed since the previous update on Bitcoin. We expect it to continue lower in the short and medium term, sliding to the area around $24,000,\u201d the analyst warned.\n\nNo interest in BTC\u2019s current price\n\nFurthermore, the analyst stated that another worrisome sign is the behavior of large investors in the cryptocurrency space. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding 1,000 or more coins dropped below levels seen shortly before last week\u2019s price spike.\n\nIn this case, the analysts consider the move a lack of interest in the current price by major players. Such behavior by institutional investors can exert further downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin briefly rallied after a United States appeals court directed the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to reconsider its decision not to approve the Grayscale Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has since slid into familiar consolidation territory, which has been synonymous with most of the year. Notably, the ETF development is considered a catalyst for Bitcoin to regain new heights, as it is seen as the driver of institutional capital into the asset.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, the price of Bitcoin continues to hover below the $26,000 mark. By press time, BTC was valued at $25,744 with weekly losses of almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.
