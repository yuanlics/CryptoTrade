        "title": "3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Many crypto investors will likely assert that no cryptos are better buys than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto \u201csecure, private, untraceable,\u201d Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR\u2019s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it\u2019s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a remarkable recovery in 2023, positioning itself as a compelling contender in the realm of decentralized finance.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) empowers the development of decentralized applications (DApps) through its distinctive hybrid consensus model. By merging proof-of-history (PoH) with underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Solana achieves exceptionally fast transaction processing. Furthermore, this speed makes it appealing to individual traders as well as institutional investors seeking efficient blockchain solutions.\n\nSolana, launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, stands out as an unconventional cryptocurrency project. It prioritizes functionality and operates on an open-source framework, utilizing blockchain technology to drive decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Notably, Solana excels in both transaction speed and cost-efficiency, ensuring scalability and rapid processing. However, the network has faced intermittent outages, impacting its value and ambitions. Some critics also raise concerns about its tokenomics favoring venture capital investors. Nonetheless, Solana remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nIn summary, Solana has seen a remarkable 100% surge this year, solidifying its position as an innovation powerhouse. In addition to this, their latest breakthrough, the Saga crypto phone, has the potential to revolutionize the crypto landscape. The Saga is an Android-powered mobile device designed to simplify and enhance crypto activities. With its pioneering Seed Vault technology, it streamlines the process of using your phone as a crypto wallet, eliminating common challenges faced by conventional phones. Experience a new level of convenience and efficiency in managing your crypto assets with the Saga crypto phone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in ETH, SOL.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum appeared first on InvestorPlace."

        "content": "Bitcoin price predictions are always absolutely everywhere. Everyone who pays attention to crypto, whether for investing, building or entertainment, cannot avoid reading daily wild headlines about where the price of BTC is heading.\n\n\u201cThe Fed May Have Just Triggered a $100 Billion Bitcoin Price Boom as Ethereum Surges Back,\u201d \u201cBitcoin Price Drops Below $28,000 Post Labor Day \u2013 Rough Road Ahead,\u201d and \u201cBitcoin at $100,000? Insiders Say the Cryptocurrency Could Test New Highs This Year,\u201d are some of my recent favorites.\n\nFrom $1,000,000 price bets to the proverbial \u201cimminent crash,\u201d those who have been around long enough in this space have either learned to tune predictions out or play into their hyped narrative themselves.\n\nWith the next bitcoin halving event less than a year away, it\u2019s a given that prices will move, maybe even wildly. So it\u2019s time we stop predicting the price of bitcoin like it\u2019s something interesting, useful, or even, frankly, predictable at all.\n\nInstead, there\u2019s an argument to be made that a new challenger to the bitcoin price prediction has entered the room \u2014 a contender for new predictions that could actually bring some useful insight to the community.\n\nThe challenger? Bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nIf we were able to provide more insight about bitcoin transaction fees, our predictions could actually be useful instead of hollow headline grabbers \u2014 we could help users find the lowest fee moments to dive into new use cases on Bitcoin, or help builders develop and scale Bitcoin layers more efficiently.\n\nBitcoin was meant to scale\n\nInterest surrounding all aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain has hit record levels, as Ordinals, Stamps, BRC-20 tokens and other new protocols have sprouted up this year. Bitcoin\u2019s average daily transactions over seven days reached record highs, the first time it\u2019s done so since December 2017. We\u2019re entering this era where people actually want to do something more with Bitcoin than just point out its price.\n\nGlassnode reported that the average transactions reached 586,704.42 throughout May. The average transaction fee reached as high as seven dollars, as Ordinal inscriptions surpassed three million in May 2023.\n\nThe thing we have forgotten is Bitcoin was always meant to scale. Low fees were always going to be temporary. That\u2019s why Bitcoin layer-2 solutions exist. As is the case with every other major layer-1 blockchain, when the base layer began to bloat, layer-2s were designed to efficiently scale usage and reprioritize where demand went toward the base layer.\n\nRead More: Ron DeSantis Posturing On Bitcoin Is Just Performative Politics\n\nThe Bitcoin builders community has talked about the idea of DeFi and other use cases coming back to Bitcoin from other layer-1s for years, and now we are seeing that prediction become a reality. This revival of activity for Bitcoin means that the day-to-day price of transaction fees is going to matter more for many users than the daily moving average cost of one BTC.\n\nI\u2019ll go first with this new prediction model.\n\nI predict that we will see another 10x from here in transaction fees.\n\nAs the Bitcoin thesis continues playing out, and as layer-1 apps grow and scale into layer-2s, we will see multiple spikes in the daily transaction price that will worry some and excite others. Ultimately, the higher fees will benefit the entire Bitcoin community.\n\nNow, it\u2019s your turn.\n\nRena Shah is the Head of Operations and Strategy at Trust Machines, a company building the largest ecosystem of applications on Bitcoin.

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Really Worth? - Morningstar",
        "content": "Those declaring crypto is dead might want to check the charts. Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 75% so far this year, climbing from a level of $16,540 as of 1 January to $29,218 as of April 30. Over that period, it\u2019s beaten the Morningstar US Market Index by a whopping 69 percentage points.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons for this. Bitcoin underwent a software upgrade late last year that opens its blockchain up to other use cases besides payments, which might have stirred up some interest. As the financial ecosystem around crypto has crumbled, it\u2019s possible that the faithful have returned to their mother ship and stashed their assets where they know they won\u2019t be touched. Gold has also rallied over that same stretch, leading some analysts to conclude that investors more broadly are looking for alternative stores of value as trust in financial institutions has ebbed after the regional bank failures that peppered the first few months of 2023.\n\nAny of these reasons might be compelling, but only because other potential bitcoin investors find them meaningful. Right now, bitcoin is still a bit of a mirror: People will see what they want to see. Returns of 50% are possible because there are very few contrarians in crypto.\n\nUnfortunately, this is equally as true on the way down as it is on the way up. Bitcoin will continue to cycle through boom after bust so long as there\u2019s no good way to value it. Only with cold hard numbers in hand can investors start to probe at the narratives.\n\nThis article represents Morningstar\u2019s first attempt to do so. We will cover four common valuation exercises and evaluate the suitability of each as it relates to bitcoin.\n\n4 Methods for Modeling\n\nThere are four popular models for proxying the value of bitcoin that hail from traditional stock valuation.\n\nTwo measure demand:\n\nTotal Addressable Market\n\nNetwork Effects\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo measure supply:\n\nCost of Production\n\nStock-to-Flow\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will examine the other three models in future pieces; the balance of this article will focus on total addressable market.\n\nInvestors using the total addressable market method take an existing product or industry and estimate the size of that market. From there, they will estimate how much market share a new product could capture, giving them a rough idea of how much it could be worth to consumers.\n\nInvestors might recognise this approach from firms touting that bitcoin could someday displace gold as a store of value. Why all the focus on gold? Primarily it is because, like bitcoin, gold has a theoretical fixed supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and miners have already minted roughly 19 million as of May 2023; roughly 209,000 tons of gold have ever been mined, leaving approximately 52,000 tons in the ground as of February 2023.\n\nThere are practical reasons to discount this argument, which we have made before. But the narrative persists, with some analysts tempering their assumptions to reach more-reasonable valuations. Even if bitcoin captures just 10% of the market for gold, the thinking goes, it could reach prices as high as $154,000.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s put aside the theory and focus on the math. One problem with that back-of-the-napkin estimate is that gold has another major application that gives it value and scarcity: jewelry. The World Gold Council estimates that jewelers have claimed about half of the world\u2019s aboveground supply of gold.\n\nAs an intangible asset, bitcoin cannot compete with gold on that front. So what we\u2019ve done is scrape that stock from our estimate of the available supply to focus exclusively on financial use-cases. (We assume that no consumers are purchasing gold jewelry to use it as a store of value. We also assume that all nonjewelry storage can be classified as an investment. Both of these assumptions are likely not 100% true, but such are the risks of simple models.)\n\nAfter adjusting for jewelry, our math suggests that bitcoin has attained much greater penetration of the \u201cstore of value\u201d market than other studies claim. At year-end 2022, bitcoin had a market capitalisation of around $318 billion. The world\u2019s financial holdings of gold totaled about $6,528 billion, which means that bitcoin soaked up 4.9% of gold\u2019s market share as a store of value in 2022. Interestingly, bitcoin already passed the forecast 10% threshold back in 2021.\n\nFrom here, an analyst would typically pick a terminal market share and multiply that by the size of the industry to forecast how much a product can grow.\n\nSo, how much bigger could bitcoin get? The unvarnished truth is that no one knows. If we ask Cathie Wood, bitcoin could eclipse 100% of gold\u2019s market cap. If bitcoin recouped its losses and nabbed back 10% of gold\u2019s market share, that would imply a price of $33,910. But market share could also fall back down to less than 2%, where bitcoin has floundered for most of the 2010s, if retail interest continues to dwindle after the slew of crypto blowups of 2022.\n\nRather than relying on guesswork, we will try to apply some rigor to the forecast by using history as a guide. The S-Curve was created by a rural sociologist named Everett Rogers in the 1960s to explain how innovation spreads. It has since become a cornerstone for modeling the rate of adoption for new technologies in a wide range of disciplines, from cancer prevention techniques to social networks.\n\nThe S-Curve models adoption along several distinct phases. Each phase is denoted by the audience it represents: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Rogers starts with a normal distribution of the entire market, segmenting it across each one of these categories. To build an S-Curve, the populations accumulate, so that the market share of a particular product equals some percentage of the audience it is currently expanding to, plus all of the groups that came before it.\n\nBy this metric, with a 4.9% market share, bitcoin is still in the throes of the early adopter phase. If it crossed over into the early majority phase, it would reach a price of $50,870. If it was to reach the late majority phase, it could surpass $169,000.\n\nGiven how simple they are, there are inherent flaws to relying on S-Curves for financial securities.\n\nS-Curves assume that adoption is cumulative. Put another way, this would imply that users who adopted the technology in an earlier phase do not abandon it. We know from experience that that\u2019s not true: Bitcoin\u2019s market share declined to 4.9% from 13.7% in just a year.\n\nUsers are the unit of measurement for S-Curves, and the model assumes that the relationship between additional users and additional market share is 1:1. This relationship is intuitive for products. If you purchase a PC from Dell, for example, Dell\u2019s revenues will usually increase by the price of that computer. For financial assets, this assumption is a bit more of a reach. It implies that every additional bitcoin wallet opened pushes up bitcoin\u2019s price by a constant amount\u2014a highly improbable condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven once we plug in a forecast market share, using the total addressable market model to derive a price introduces additional wrinkles.\n\nWe assume that the suggested total addressable market, measured by gold\u2019s nonjewelry market capitalisation, stays fixed over time.\n\nWe also assume that bitcoin\u2019s current circulating supply would also be its future circulating supply.\n\nThese two assumptions are clearly oversimplifications. We know that this is not how these assets work in practice: Gold\u2019s market capitalisation grew by 3.7% annualised over the past 12 years, and bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply increases every day as miners approve new blocks.\n\nWhile these assumptions may not be true, they can still be useful. That\u2019s because they point to something important about the design of a total addressable market model: Although there are certainly tweaks that investors can make, it\u2019s not inherently a time-varied approach. There is no end date unless the analyst defines one. That\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s not particularly informative to try to ascribe a future value to an asset when that future remains undefined.\n\nMadeline Hume is a senior research analyst at Morningstar"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Really Soar 500% Before Its Next Halving? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is now less than one year away from a highly anticipated event known as halving, and crypto analysts are already starting to bump up their price targets. The latest model claims that Bitcoin will reach a price of $160,000 by April 2024. Based on today's price of $27,941, that would imply a rally of nearly 500%.\n\nBut not so fast. While past halvings have led to significant appreciation in the price of the crypto both before and after the event, there is less agreement on how long this rally might last, and even how significant it might be this time around. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe halving is the reduction in the reward for mining a block on the Bitcoin blockchain by one-half. Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins for every block they mine. Beginning in April 2024, they will receive 3.125 bitcoins. This halving event occurs every four years, and will continue to occur like clockwork until all the bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined by the year 2140.\n\nThis feature is designed to make Bitcoin more deflationary over time. It has a maximum lifetime supply of 21 million coins, and there are already 19.4 million in circulation, so it's easy to see how the halving introduces scarcity into the equation. Between now and 2140, only 1.6 million additional bitcoins can ever be mined, and the pace at which this happens is getting slower and slower over time.\n\nImpact of halving on price\n\nSince Bitcoin's launch in 2009, there have been three different halving events: in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Thus, there is (relatively speaking) a significant amount of data to examine to see what the impact on the price might be. After the last halving in 2020, for example, it exploded by 688% over the next 546 days, eventually reaching a high of $67,594. And before that, the crypto's price skyrocketed by an astounding 2,824% in the wake of its 2016 halving, reaching what was then an all-time high of $19,065.\n\nThere was also an impact on the price of Bitcoin before the halving. For example, before the 2020 halving, it was up nearly 20%. Before the 2016 halving, it rose 142%. And before the 2012 halving, it gained 384%.\n\nWill the same pattern happen in 2023-2024?\n\nThus, if you use a similar data set, most models will probably suggest that Bitcoin will rally yet again, both before and after the 2024 halving. As a result, there already have been some remarkable forecasts. The baseline forecast seems to be $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nBut in November 2022, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital put out a price target of $149,000. And in May, one crypto analyst -- using a number of technical trading factors -- came up with a forecast of $160,000 by the time of the next halving. This last forecast, in my opinion, seems to be particularly aggressive. As noted above, the biggest pre-halving rally until now has been 384%.\n\nAlso remember: History is no guarantee of future performance. Just because Bitcoin behaved one way in the past does not mean it will do so again. Moreover, there is always model risk. Different models can come up with different forecasts, depending on which numbers and dates you use. So before you start investing as a result of the latest new price forecast, be careful that you know how it's being calculated.\n\nOther factors to consider\n\nThe big question is whether the upcoming halving is even going to be the biggest catalyst for Bitcoin. The halving is a purely technical event, and does not take into account overall macroeconomic conditions. Thus, any price forecasts need to be balanced with a nuanced understanding of how factors like inflation or recession might spoil the party in 2024. We're already seeing evidence of this, with the digital currency struggling to get past the $30,000 price level due to overall economic weakness.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do think the halving will have a significant positive impact on the digital coin's price. But I'm rethinking how much of an impact. Just based on the simple mathematics involved, it seems like every halving from here on out is going to have less and less impact on the price of the crypto. I'm still bullish on Bitcoin, but I am pumping the brakes when it comes to price forecasts for 2024."

His family launched an appeal on his whereabouts on social media soon after.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Beast at the time, his younger brother, Richard Forsyth, said that John Forsyth wouldn\u2019t miss a shift, so it was \u201can immediate red flag.\u201d\n\nAuthorities found Forsyth\u2019s sedan parked less than a mile away from the hospital on May 28.\n\nBeaver Lake in northwest Arkansas, Dr. John Forsyth.

        "content": "Bitcoin \u201cconsolidation\u201d could end by July, new research predicts as optimism over a BTC price breakout returns.\n\nIn its latest market update on June 2, trading firm QCP Capital revealed a bullish bias on both Bitcoin (BTC) and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH).\n\nQCP Capital: Bitcoin consolidation \u201cplayed out perfectly\u201d\n\nBitcoin price has been ranging between $26,000 and $31,000 since mid-March, but analysts are increasingly calling time on the sideways action.\n\nQCP Capital is among them, predicting a change of course as soon as the end of the month.\n\nThis, it argues, is thanks to the United States debt ceiling \u201csideshow\u201d vanishing, leaving Bitcoin closely mimicking its consolidation and breakout phase from 2020.\n\n\u201cWith the passage of the Debt ceiling bill through the House and Senate that extends the ceiling until Jan 2025, we can now all move on and not have to worry about any political sideshow again until next year\u2019s US Presidential elections,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cThis means we now return to our regular programming of proper macro and crypto narratives.\u201d\n\nFor QCP, the price levels may be different, but the underlying behavior is the same in 2023 as at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBack then, the Federal Reserve unleashed a giant $4 trillion worth of liquidity, buoying risk assets and ultimately sending Bitcoin to new all-time highs.\n\n\u201cIn March 2020 we were on the verge of a massive price breakdown below 5k when the Fed unleashed the liquidity tap, resulting in an exponential price increase as we approached the halving cycle the following year,\u201d it wrote, quoting a previous edition of its \u201cJust Crypto\u201d newsletter series.\n\n\u201cSimilarly in March 2023, we were about to break below 20k on BTC as a result of the banking crisis risk-off, when the Fed again unleashed the liquidity tap to drive us back above 30k, as we head into the next halving cycle next year.\u201d\n\nShould the relationship continue to play out, the next phase is obvious: a dramatic exit of the trading range, with QCP positioning long options plays.\n\n\u201cThis consolidation has played out perfectly so far, but we expect that we are soon coming close to the end sometime this month. As a result, we recommend positioning for an upcoming big move through long 3m and 6m strangles here, with a bias to the long call side,\u201d it added.\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the month of June as a hotspot for both BTC and ETH volatility from 2019 onward.\n\n3-month \u201cat-the-money\u201d volatility chart for BTC, ETH (screenshot).

        "content": "While many beginners base their trades on the negativity brought about by devastating events happening in the crypto space, experienced traders base their decisions on different factors, helping them come out on top \u2014 even in a bear market.\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Dan Tapiero, founder of growth equity funds 10T Holdings and 1RoundTable Partners, shared some of his most important strategies to navigate the market. These include having a broader perspective, and avoiding the influence of feelings and people\u2019s fears. Tapiero explained:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the space has really grown. It\u2019s not just about the price of Bitcoin or the price of Ethereum. We have five or six companies that actually made more money last year than in the previous year. So, even during the time of a massive drop in the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we\u2019ve had companies do better.\u201d\n\nThe executive also gave examples of sectors within the broad digital asset ecosystem that, according to Tapiero, are not correlated. He explained that in 2022, $8 trillion in stablecoins were settled, the total number of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) minted crossed the one trillion mark, and blockchain gaming took off. Tapiero pointed out that three years ago, these were all zero.\n\n10T Holdings founder Dan Tapiero with Cointelegraph reporter Ezra Reguerra in Dubai, UAE. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nApart from these, the veteran trader also pointed to developments in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and highlighted that despite the space\u2019s locked value going from $200 billion to $50 billion, it was also at zero a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cI found like, you know, young guys in the space don\u2019t have the perspective. Five, six years ago, which is not that long ago, nothing exists. You barely even had Ethereum. It was just Bitcoin (BTC). So, as the space broadens out, the value also increases with it,\u201d he explained.\n\nRelated: Blackrock CEO issues dire warning over \u2018debt ceiling drama\u2019 \u2014 Bullish for Bitcoin?\n\nWhen asked what he thinks about community sentiments and their impact on his strategies, Tapiero said that they can \u201csee it and sense it,\u201d but he\u2019s not interested in these feelings. He believes crypto is a market similar to other currencies, bonds or stocks. He explained:\n\n\u201cMarkets display certain behaviors. I spent my entire life managing a portfolio of financial assets that move around, and honestly, the most important thing is to be able to set your emotion aside and make rational judgments that aren\u2019t impacted by what the news is or what people\u2019s fears are.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these insights, the executive shared his thoughts on the next bull phase. \u201cThe bear phase is finished,\u201d he said. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) went down last year, Tapiero said the market has \u201chad a very nice recovery,\u201d and will have an \u201cexplosive\u201d and broad bull market.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see new highs probably in the second half of 2024, 2025. And I think in that bull phase, we\u2019ll probably hit up to 6 to 8 trillion [crypto market capitalization],\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "content": "Yuan stablecoin team reportedly arrested\n\nOn May 31, local news outlet PANewsLab reported that the developers for the offshore Chinese yuan and Hong Kong dollar stablecoin issuer CNHC had lost contact or had been taken away by law enforcement officials. A photo shows what appears to be an empty office building at CNHC\u2019s Shanghai division with the following message posted:\n\n\u201cThe building\u2019s assets have been seized by law enforcement; vandalism is prohibited.\u201d\n\nIn March, CNHC raised $10 million in its Series A, led by KuCoin Ventures, Circle and IDG Capital. The team said back then that it planned to use the funds for \u201cexpansion in the Asia Pacific Region\u201d and was in the process of moving its headquarters from the Cayman Islands to Hong Kong.\n\nThe reported move appears to be part of a wider crackdown on cryptocurrencies by Chinese authorities. On May 24, Asia Express reported that tokens of Singaporean inter-blockchain communications protocol Multichain had plunged 30% on a delayed backend upgrade and rumors of Chinese police arrest of its core developers.\n\nThough Multichain says that it is still operational, it stated on June 1 that it is still \u201cunable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance,\u201d and as a result, the protocol would need to suspend a number of affected cross-chain services.\n\nIn the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for\u2026 \u2014 Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) May 31, 2023\n\nHong Kong opens up retail crypto licensing\n\nDespite censorship and bans in mainland China, the adoption of cryptocurrency exchange regulation in Hong Kong has proceeded as scheduled. On May 31, the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium was formed to approve the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap for listing and to conduct quarterly reviews of registered digital asset exchanges to ensure compliance with licensing regulations that took effect on June 1.\n\nOn another front, according to a research report published by multichain wallet provider BitKeep, notable crypto projects such as Avalanche, Conflux, EOS and Fantom have all joined Hong Kong\u2019s Web3Hub ecosystem fund unveiled in April. With a budget of $10 million, the fund will incentivize Web3 projects to set up subsidiaries or headquarters in the special administrative region of China. The fund is headed by Paul Chan Mo-Po, financial secretary of Hong Kong SAR.\n\nDespite the growing traction, BitKeep researchers reminded that HK regulations remain strict for the time being:\n\nThe new regulations clearly limit the types of tokens that can be traded and the types of services that exchanges can provide. Cryptocurrencies must meet the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) strict regulations, which emphasize that only non-security tokens can be traded, have a history of at least 12 months, and the token has been included in two cryptocurrency indices.\n\nIn addition, exchanges are prohibited from providing wealth management products, as well as the provision of lending and deposit services, along with derivative transactions such as perpetual crypto contracts. \u201cHowever, the regulator recognizes the importance of derivatives trading in the encrypted market and will conduct further research and consideration,\u201d researchers noted.\n\nWeChat allows BTC price quotes\n\nAs of June 1, WeChat, China\u2019s largest social media app with over 1 billion users, has indexed Bitcoin price quotes in its search queries. The move is significant, considering that China has pretty much banned all crypto-related activities such as exchanges, crypto mining, and fiat-crypto on-ramping since 2021.\n\n\n\nHowever, if history is any guide, the WeChat Bitcoin search query probably won\u2019t last for long. Formerly, billion-user platforms China Central Television and Chinese TikTok variant Douyin have allowed something similar, only to have authorities pull them down just days after launch.\n\nBitcoin price quotes are now publicly available (WeChat)\n\nAll Nippon Airways launches NFT marketplace\n\nOn May 30, All Nippon Airways (ANA), the largest airline in Japan with over $12.2 billion in revenue in the last fiscal year, launched an aeronautical-themed NFT marketplace dubbed \u201cANA GranWhale.\u201d Developers wrote:\n\n\u201cNFTs have been used mainly in fields such as art and music as a technology for expressing ownership of digital assets. This time, the ANA Group will apply NFT to the aviation industry.\u201d\n\nAs its inaugural step, ANA GranWhale will debut aerial photographer Luke Ozawa\u2019s first-ever digital photo in his career as an NFT with an asking price of 100,000 yen ($719). The second installment, starting on June 7, will feature a 3-D model NFT conversion of the first special paint Boeing 787 aircraft launched by ANA. The NFT marketplace\u2019s development began last August as part of ANA\u2019s vision of building a Web3 virtual travel platform.\n\n\u201cWith a view to commercializing NFTs as specialty products from various parts of Japan, we aim to improve the value of customer experience, including local and overseas, through the \u2018GranWhale NFT marketplace.'\u201d\n\nAn ANA GranWhale NFT (All Nippon Airways)\n\nFed inspires Astar Network to revamp tokenomics\n\nOn May 28, Sota Watanabe, the founder of Japanese blockchain Astar (ASTR) Network, expressed his desire to revamp the protocol\u2019s tokenomics, saying that even the United States government was targeting an inflation rate of 2%, compared to levels of around 8.4% currently. Drawing further inspiration from the Federal Reserve, Watanabe proposed mirroring the Fed\u2019s meeting decisions every quarter or every six months and updating the blockchain\u2019s token inflation rate on a variety of factors, writing:\n\n\u201cDecentralizing one of the roles of the FED can be a challenge but also an interesting trial.\u201d\n\nThe crypto executive said he wished to either fix ASTR\u2019s total supply and make the inflation rate smaller and smaller such as in Bitcoin, or automatically decide the inflation rate based on network usage, as in Ethereum, or use a mix of both models.\n\n\n\nA multichain decentralized application proposal, Astar recently launched the second iteration of its smart contracts, supporting both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM VM) on its mainnet for developing new cross-chain apps.\n\nBitFlyer and the Travel Rule\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer will comply with the country\u2019s Financial Services Agency\u2019s new Travel Rule starting June 1. The Travel Rule states that a crypto asset exchange operator sending crypto assets at the request of a user shall provide specific information about the sender and the recipient to the exchange operator receiving the transfer.\n\nIn addition, further restrictions are imposed on crypto transfers to any of the 21 countries, including Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Bahamas, Hong Kong, and the U.S., utilizing the Coinbase-led Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST).\n\nBitFlyer clients who wish to transfer crypto to any of the 21 TRUST countries can only send Bitcoin or Ethereum and select ERC-20 tokens. Such requirements do not apply to transfers to addresses identified with any of the remaining non-TRUST countries. As told by bitFlyer:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the travel rule is to prevent the ability for terrorists and other criminals from using digital fund transfer systems as well as track unauthorized use.\u201d"

Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature, offer the potential for financial sovereignty by allowing individuals to have control over their money without relying on traditional financial systems or government regulations.\n\nRight-wing politicians also may perceive cryptocurrencies as a way to challenge the existing financial establishment and its perceived biases or control. Bitcoin (BTC), in particular, emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, a crisis that led many to lose trust in traditional financial institutions and governmental monetary policies.\n\nIn addition, many became concerned about central banks and their influence on monetary policy, and Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature appealed to those who advocate alternative monetary systems outside of central bank control.\n\nBitcoin as an \u201calternative for Germany\u201d\n\nFor example, a German exit from the euro and a return to the Deutschmark (the country\u2019s former currency) is a well-known demand of the right-wing populist political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Although there is no official or clear strategy within the anti-euro party regarding cryptocurrencies, some members have clearly expressed their positive attitude toward Bitcoin.\n\nFor instance, AfD leader Alice Weidel has attended several Bitcoin conferences, called herself a \u201cBitcoin entrepreneur\u201d and wanted to launch a Bitcoin startup. Even Aaron Koenig, a German entrepreneur and the founder of the brick-and-mortar crypto exchange Bitcoin Exchange Berlin, was on the stage with Weidel, and both presented their view of \u201cmoney without a state.\u201d\n\nThe AfD\u2019s prioritization of crypto is also evident in its behavior in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament. On several occasions, the AfD has submitted \u201cKleine Anfragen\u201d (literally, \u201csmall requests\u201d) to the government. This instrument of parliamentary procedure requires an official response from the Bundestag and is often a way for opposition parties to demand accountability for specific actions or inquire as to why other measures were not taken.\n\nFor instance, the party asked a \u201csmall question\u201d about crypto donations for Ukraine, how a cryptocurrency could replace the previous currency, what effects this would have on the banking system, and how much Bitcoin German federal authorities own. AfD also opposed a proposed Bitcoin ban during discussions among European lawmakers last year.\n\nThe concept of cryptocurrency is, in some places, being linked to the right-wing \u2014 and, in part, radical \u2014 positions of the AfD.\n\nFor years, some experts, such as David Golumbia \u2014 a digital studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who researches the politics of cryptocurrency \u2014 have warned that blockchain could be hijacked by right-wing and libertarian groups.\n\nRecent: Does the US have a crypto \u2018tax loophole\u2019 problem?\n\nIn Golumbia\u2019s view, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies could be the realization of their vision of a world without government control. As a former member of the Hayek Society, Weidel belongs to the radical economic liberal wing of her party. The Hayek Society is named after Austrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek, who was an advocate of an unfettered market with as little government intervention as possible.\n\nSupport for crypto among Europe\u2019s right-wing parties\n\nIt\u2019s not only German right-wing politicians who have voiced interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology as potential disruptors of traditional financial systems, with the leaders of the Dutch right-wing parties Party for Freedom (PVV) and Forum for Democracy (FvD) \u2014 Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet, respectively \u2014 also speaking positively on the subject.\n\nBaudet even wants to make the Netherlands a Bitcoin hub and released two NFT series on the theme of his fight against World Economic Forum founder and CEO Klaus Schwab. Baudet is a fierce critic of the WEF, which he believes is leading the world in the wrong direction and causing serious threats to individual freedom.\n\nPolish politician Jaroslaw Gowin and his center-right party, Agreement \u2014 formerly known as Poland Together \u2014 were part of the ruling United Right coalition from 2015 to 2021. For most of that period, Gowin served as deputy prime minister, as well as being a member of parliament.\n\nWhen Gowin was the leader of the Agreement party, he expressed a positive attitude toward cryptocurrencies, acknowledging their potential to promote financial innovation. The politician also consulted with many people from the industry about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. For example, the party held a meeting where Prime Minister Gowin listened to the recommendations of industry experts, including economist Krzysztof Piech and Filip Pawczynski, president of the Polish Bitcoin Association.\n\nNigel Farage, a prominent figure in British politics and former leader of the right-wing pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, has also shown interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Cointelegraph, Farage \u2014 also a former member of the European Parliament \u2014 said he first became aware of Bitcoin 10 years ago and shared his perspective on the potential future of Bitcoin adoption in Europe: \u201cWhat happens in America first happens here [in Europe], too. There\u2019s going to be a very, very big change here over the next two or three years, and it [Bitcoin] will become a trusted means of exchange.\u201d\n\nFarage also believes that Bitcoin has gained appeal as an alternative to the existing financial infrastructure, noting the latter\u2019s inefficiency, high costs and slow speeds.\n\nOther right-wing politicians haven\u2019t made specific statements about cryptocurrencies but are still taking steps to embrace digital currencies. Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister of Hungary and leader of the right-wing Fidesz party, and his government are currently considering the potential benefits of launching a central bank digital currency. Hungary also appears to be warming up to crypto across the board, with the government revealing plans in 2021 to cut taxes on crypto trading from 30.5% to 15% as part of an economic recovery program.\n\nRight-wing extremists rely on crypto payments\n\nNot only have right-wing politicians discovered cryptocurrencies, but right-wing extremist movements have also been utilizing crypto. In 2022, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) published a report on the massive increase in the use of crypto payments by right-wing extremist groups in recent years.\n\nCrypto payments are not a new tool for ultranationalists and European extremist groups proclaiming the superiority of the \u201cwhite race\u201d and advocating for a \u201cwhite\u201d Europe and North America. In fact, they are among the early adopters of the technology, accepting BTC donations as early as 2012, according to the MEMRI.\n\nThe United States-based Southern Poverty Law Center has further compiled a list of extremist groups accepting crypto donations.\n\nUltranationalist and extremist groups are actively using cryptocurrencies not only for reasons of convenience and ideology \u2014 and because they are being shut out of traditional and mainstream online banking systems \u2014 but also because funds held in crypto cannot be accessed or seized by anyone.\n\nSo, is crypto a right-wing movement, then?\n\nDoes this all mean that crypto in Europe is a right-wing thing? Not really.\n\nWhile crypto itself is not inherently Right or Left, it is not without ideology, nor is it completely free of political positions \u2014 even if its political relations are indirect. Politicians can like it or hate it, regardless of their political persuasion, and support for cryptocurrencies among politicians is not limited to those leaning toward the Right. For example, the German liberal, pro-free market Free Democratic Party also advocates for a friendly policy toward cryptocurrencies.\n\nRecent: Increasing number of divorce proceedings involve crypto\n\nWhile the European crypto scene is not inherently right-wing, there are notable instances of right-wing influence within the community, according to the MEMRI report, which also states that it is crucial to address these concerns by fostering education, implementing regulations and ensuring that the crypto space remains inclusive, transparent and aligned with democratic principles.\n\nMEMRI further stated that social media platforms and online communities need to take proactive steps to curb hate speech, misinformation and extremist content, while also promoting healthy, constructive dialogue."

        "title": "Someone Bought a Loaf of Bread With a Bitcoin Wallet Baked Inside - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Yacht parties, tank tops, McLarens: For the last three years, the eponymous annual Bitcoin conference has taken root in Miami, celebrating the excess of crypto\u2019s nouveau riche while showcasing a unique and particularly masculine strain of financialized tribalism.\n\nThough the conference\u2019s latest iteration last month featured notably smaller crowds and less exuberance than in past years, it also appears to have broken new barriers for a new and very different kind of eye-popping excess. On May 18, pseudonymous conceptual artist OONA sold a loaf of bread to a collector for 0.5 BTC, or just over $13,400 worth.\n\nThe sale was not a trick or a gag. The loaf was real, perishable country bread. It was really sold to a man, Vladimir Kravets, who did in fact pay thousands of dollars for it.\n\nIn fairness, the loaf\u2014made in partnership with Bitcoin NFT marketplace DIBA\u2014was unlike other grocery store varieties, as it contained a hardware wallet that stored an undisclosed amount of BTC. But neither the artist nor Kravets plan to disclose the amount.\n\nThat may be because the actual value of \"Bit.Bread,\" as the piece is titled, has nothing to do with money itself. As with OONA\u2019s previous works, it instead investigates the perception of value, particularly as that perception pertains to gender\u2014an often fraught subject in the male-dominated crypto industry.\n\n\u201cIt fundamentally investigates the ways in which this technology is more progressive than the people that use it,\u201d OONA told Decrypt of \"Bit.Bread.\"\n\nSince 2021, OONA has created works of performance art at crypto conferences, always sporting glasses and a draped mask that conceals her identity. Her work has focused on the treatment and perception of women in crypto, and the ways in which crypto\u2014a technology the artist believes can financially and politically liberate and empower people of all backgrounds\u2014has emerged within a culture that she believes does not adequately respect or include women.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Art Basel Miami last December, OONA, with the help of performance artist Lori Baldwin, auctioned off a cup of her own breast milk\u2014milked live in front of a large audience\u2014before being escorted away by conference security. The piece, \"Milking the Artist,\" received a high bid of $200,000.\n\nThey're both part of a progression of performance art activations, as detailed in a recent blog post by OONA, including tokenizing and auctioning off butter that she had churned. It's a juxtaposition between the \"permanent\" and \"perishable,\" as she describes it.\n\nThat piece and \"Bit.Bread\" both riff on edible symbols of the kitchen, in an effort to interrogate the value placed on women in crypto-related environments. That value is typically minimal, and often reduced to sexualization and objectification, according to the artist.\n\nOONA (left) alongside an unidentified actor hired for the performance. Image: Alejandra Bernal\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the degree of crypto-specific sexism that OONA has repeatedly, personally encountered has generally risen with the tide of crypto prices and speculative frenzy.\n\n\u201cAt the 2022 Avalanche Summit, I was asked what my hourly rate was at least five times, because people assumed that I was a prostitute,\u201d OONA recounted. \u201cGoing back this year, most conversations were about my performance art.\u201d\n\nSame thing at Bitcoin Miami: Last year, during the waning days of the bull market, OONA said that she had to repeatedly fight off men intent on trying to rip off her mask to reveal her face. This year, in the doldrums of the bear market, such an invasion of her artistic and physical privacy never once occurred.\n\nMinted by Dance: Inside Art Blocks' Latest Immersive Digital Art Collection\n\nIn that sense, \"Bit.Bread\" can be interpreted as a reflection on the relationship between speculation and gender. So far, crypto\u2019s speculative excesses have typically encouraged a hyper-masculine subculture, one personified by the \u201ccrypto bro\u201d stereotype.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean speculation is itself harmful, according to OONA. On the contrary, speculation is at the heart of Bitcoin\u2019s promise as a tool and value system that she believes will hopefully, eventually, lift up people of all backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI wanted to connect speculation around the value of women with speculation around Bitcoin,\u201d she said, adding that both \"involve a new set of knowledge, a new way of interacting, and a new way of perceiving self-sovereignty.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct the date that the bread was sold."

        "content": "Blackrock CEO Laurence Fink believes the recent \u201cdrama\u201d around the United States debt ceiling has deteriorated global trust in the U.S. dollar, something that other analysts predict could provide some tailwinds for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nFink\u2019s comments came as U.S. House of Representatives on May 31 passed a highly-anticipated bill to lift the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling. The bill now goes to the Senate, which is expected to spend a few days debating it. The U.S. Treasury has indicated that the deadline for raising the debt ceiling was June 5. Any later, the country could begin defaulting on its debts.\n\n314-117: The House passes the Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling agreement, raising the debt limit until 2025 and instituting discretionary spending caps for two years.\n\n\n\n71 Republicans and 46 Democrats voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill. pic.twitter.com/RdU42whDd5 \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) June 1, 2023\n\nAccording to a May 31 report by Reuters, Fink told the attendees of a Deutsche Bank financial services conference that he expects at least two more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the coming months, claiming that he\u2019d seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of overall inflation being reduced.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019ll have a resolution, ... but let\u2019s be clear, the United States is jeopardizing its reserve currency status.\u201d\n\nMany Bitcoin advocates and cryptocurrency investors see BTC as a hedge against inflation and debt fears brought on by central banks increasing overall monetary supply.\n\nJosh Gilbert, a markets analyst with eToro, told Cointelegraph that the debt ceiling drama brings Bitcoin into the spotlight once again, as investors may seek finite-supply safe haven assets outside the constraints of the current financial system.\n\n\u201cThe debt ceiling deal once again highlights Bitcoin\u2019s utility because it\u2019s essentially a break away from the traditional financial system. Given its finite supply, it\u2019s free from the issues that the U.S. government is facing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Gilbert notes that while the U.S. banking crisis and the debt-ceiling debacle highlights the inherent utility of an asset like Bitcoin, any investors hoping for current events to provide a massive surge in the value of Bitcoin should tone down their expectations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more fear than optimism in the short term due to the uncertainty of these issues and the liquidity problems they will cause,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWhen the banking crisis happened, it dialed down inflation and rate hike expectations, which is why we saw Bitcoin rally.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Matteo Greco, a research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International, who told CNBC that the current downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price is due primarily to investor fears of the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin hodlers exited \u2018capitulation\u2019 above $20K, new metric hints\n\nTypically when central banks raise interest rates, investors choose to take their money out of risky assets like cryptocurrencies and growth stocks.\n\n\u201cGiven Bitcoin was so depressed in 2022, the expectations of this high-interest rate environment changing saw investors take an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at heavy drawdowns. Rate hike expectations have changed significantly so far this year and in the last few weeks,\u201d Gilbert added.\n\nOn Gilbert's assessment, if Fink\u2019s fears of further rate hikes come true, this could see the price of Bitcoin fall further from its current price. If the inverse happens, and the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hiking cycle in June, Gilbert says that investors can expect to see some positive price action for Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin over the last year.

        "title": "What is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. Since the price of Bitcoin tends to rise and fall dramatically, investors are always looking for a tool to streamline making efficient investment choices.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one of the many tools invented to create an easy visual guide to investing in this cryptocurrency. As the price of Bitcoin rises and falls, the rainbow chart is designed to help investors determine the appropriate times to buy and sell their tokens. It also allows you to compare Bitcoin\u2019s current price to historical trends.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart and how you can efficiently build your investment portfolio.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart reflects a logarithmic growth curve.\n\nThe chart uses various colors to highlight good times to buy or sell Bitcoin.\n\nAlthough a helpful visual, investors should look beyond the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart when making investment decisions.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a tool that investors use to assess the current value of the cryptocurrency in relation to the big picture. Within the chart, you\u2019ll see a rainbow of colors that reflects a logarithmic growth curve, which investors use as a mathematical tool to forecast the possible future price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen looking at the rainbow chart, you\u2019ll also see the price of Bitcoin over time. Notably, the chart\u2019s designers didn\u2019t want daily fluctuations in price to throw off its data. Instead, the chart ignores the noise of market movements throughout the day to focus on the overarching Bitcoin price trends.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin so Volatile?\n\nBitcoins are produced through a process called mining. Miners are nodes in Bitcoin\u2019s network that solve complex computational math problems to earn the next \u201cblock\u201d of Bitcoins. Mining has a dual purpose: minting new Bitcoins that enter circulation and auditing the blockchain the make sure all transactions are valid and no double-spending is occurring.\n\nBecause Bitcoin mining requires robust hardware and significant energy, it\u2019s costly, slow, and only sometimes financially rewarding. Still, it has attracted considerable interest in recent years because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and its status as a kind of modern precious metal.\n\nUnlike the gold standard or fiat currency, Bitcoin is a new and mostly untested currency. It\u2019s not used in most people\u2019s everyday lives and has yet to be accepted by most retailers and vendors as a legitimate form of payment.\n\nBitcoin is volatile because its price is dependent on supply and demand. The price will swing depending on how many Bitcoins are in circulation, how much people are willing to pay for the tokens, and how close the currency is to its 21 million Bitcoin limit.\n\nThis limit was purposefully put in place by Bitcoin\u2019s inventor so miners couldn\u2019t keep minting coins to the point of causing wild price fluctuations. Hype for Bitcoin in the media or negative press can also lead to volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, some experts argued the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to increased interest in cryptocurrency products, pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat happened to Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2022?\n\n2022 was a particularly volatile year for economies worldwide. Inflation in the United States led to the Federal Reserve instituting a series of aggressive rate hikes, which made borrowing more expensive to reduce discretionary spending. As rates increased, they damaged corporate profits, and many tech companies laid off thousands of employees.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine also led to widespread economic uncertainty last year. Energy prices skyrocketed, particularly in Europe, as access to Russian energy sources became limited.\n\nBitcoin saw its price fall from over $60,000 at the end of 2021 to under $20,000 at the end of 2022. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 marked a particularly low point for Bitcoin, as investor confidence in the speculative asset seemed low.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is seeing positive growth in 2023. As inflation and rate hikes ease up, consumers are starting to spend more and feel more comfortable putting money toward something as risky as Bitcoin.\n\nWho Created the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart hit the scene when a Reddit user, Azop, introduced the chart to track the price of Bitcoin. The chart is meant to predict future market trends without the distractions of daily market volatility.\n\nHow Does the Chart Work?\n\nThe chart superimposes the price of Bitcoin onto a rainbow. Since the logarithmic growth curve intends to forecast the future price of Bitcoin, different colors are intended to highlight the prime opportunities for buying or selling it.\n\nIn general, investors use this chart as a long-term valuation tool. But the predictions made within the rainbow chart aren\u2019t necessarily accurate. It\u2019s simply one way to assess Bitcoin\u2019s current price levels quickly.\n\nAt the end of each 24 hours, the chart is updated with the daily close price. With that, you\u2019ll filter through the fluctuations within a single day to better assess the bigger picture.\n\nA Guide To The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart\n\nThe appeal of the rainbow chart is that it seems to provide clear advice on what actions you should take in your portfolio, at least according to the chart\u2019s measurements. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what the colors mean:\n\nRed: When the price of Bitcoin is in the red, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates a \u201cmaximum bubble territory.\u201d With that, it\u2019s a good time to sell Bitcoin but not to buy it.\n\nOrange: When the price of Bitcoin is in the orange, it\u2019s in the \u201cFOMO intensifies\u201d stage, which means that the price is relatively high. With that, it\u2019s a wise time to sell Bitcoin but not to buy it.\n\nYellow: When the price of Bitcoin is in the yellow, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is neither too high nor too low. With that, there\u2019s little advantage to either buying or selling the coin.\n\nLight green: When the price of Bitcoin is in the light green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. With that, there is potential for growth, making it a reasonably good time to buy but not sell.\n\nGreen: When the price of Bitcoin is in the green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. Since it is potentially undervalued, there is some potential room for growth, making it a reasonably good time to buy but not sell.\n\nBlue-green: When the price of Bitcoin is in the blue-green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. With that, there is a lot of growth potential, making it a good time to stock up.\n\nIndigo: A price at the indigo level is about as good as it gets, otherwise known as a fire sale, making it a perfect time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nBy following the rainbow chart, it\u2019s easy to see where the price of Bitcoin stands based on the color.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart\n\nAs with all investment tools, using the rainbow chart has pros and cons.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pros:\n\nReasonably good track record: Since the chart launched in 2014, it has remained relatively accurate.\n\nEasy to use: It\u2019s easy to check in with the rainbow chart before buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nNow for the cons:\n\nNot a foolproof result: Although the chart has been right so far, that doesn\u2019t mean it will always be a good judge of Bitcoin\u2019s price direction.\n\nDoesn\u2019t look at the daily fluctuations: If you want to buy and sell Bitcoin throughout the day, this chart won\u2019t be much help to you.\n\nShould You Rely on the Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a helpful visual to assess where the price of Bitcoin stands quickly. But long-term research has yet to back-up the chart. When dealing with highly volatile cryptocurrencies, things can change rapidly.\n\nSince past performance doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate future results, relying on the rainbow chart won\u2019t always translate into blockbuster investment returns. Solely relying on this chart could mislead your investment decisions if the price of Bitcoin behaves unexpectedly.\n\nThe rainbow chart might be a good place to start investment decision-making. But it\u2019s important to follow up on your initial discovery with other information about the state of the Bitcoin market before moving forward with an investment decision.\n\nHow to Invest in Cryptocurrency\n\nMost successful cryptocurrency investors regularly follow changes in the market to guide their decisions. Since the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, constant monitoring seems to be one path to success.\n\nHowever, only some investors interested in the cryptocurrency have the time or inclination to monitor the markets consistently. The good news is that with the spread of artificial intelligence, it\u2019s possible to find investing software that protects your money from volatility and price swings.\n\nAt the same time, nothing in the crypto space is guaranteed, and you shouldn\u2019t invest any money you need to survive. Multiple established crypto exchanges collapsed in 2022. Investors should be wary of any cryptocurrency that makes investors promises that seem too good to be true.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one tool available to cryptocurrency investors. If you are trying to determine the right time to buy or sell Bitcoin, this tool can give you a quick take on the situation. However, it shouldn\u2019t be the only tool you use to determine the appropriate time to buy or sell Bitcoin.\n\nThe post What is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart? appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin price slips under $27K, but data shows BTC whales counter trading DXY strength - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the summer season arrives, an unexpected heatwave is gripping financial markets.\n\nThis heat is coming in the form of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has been on a remarkable uptrend since late April, reaching levels unseen since early March\u2019s banking crisis when the dollar wrecking ball wreaked havoc on asset prices.\n\nThis surge in the dollar has raised concerns among market participants due to its high inverse relationship with Bitcoin (BTC), a topic many macro and crypto analysts have discussed repeatedly in 2023.\n\nThe implication of this inverse correlation means that when the dollar rises, BTC falls and vice versa. The chart below showing the year-to-date performances of DXY (blue line) and BTC (orange line) underscores this relationship a step further.\n\nNotice how Bitcoin\u2019s 2023\u2019s performance has been propelled by a downward dollar. Not coincidentally, the DXY reached its year-to-date low near 100.80 on April 13, nearly the exact date BTC reached its year-to-date high of just over $31,000. Since then, however, both have been trending in opposite directions.\n\nBTC and DXY year-to-date returns. Source: TradingView\n\nFeelings of unease over what sort of summer could be in store for markets should the dollar\u2019s uptrend continue are certainly justified at present. After all, the last time the DXY broke above these levels, BTC was trading below the $20,000 mark.\n\nOn the surface, this would imply that BTC still has quite a deep correction ahead before any hopes of new year-to-date highs emerge.\n\nTaking a look deeper, however, it\u2019s clear that some divergent signals are beginning to emerge that suggest this dollar rally could be nearing an end.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at them to see what\u2019s been driving DXY\u2019s recent strength and zoom in on a notable segment of the market that has remained unphased by Uncle Sam\u2019s recent resurgence.\n\nThe relationship between BTC and DXY is terminal\n\nBack in March, similar to now, plummeting federal funds futures were the primary driver of the DXY\u2019s strength.\n\nFor readers who might not be macroeconomic nerds, the federal funds futures represent the terminal rate, or the market\u2019s expectation of when the Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking cycle will come to an end.\n\nWhen Federal funds futures fall, the terminal rate rises, and consequently, the dollar rises as well. The opposite is also true, which is another inverse correlation.\n\nTo track this leading indicator, traders follow the federal funds futures ticker (ZQN2023 on TradingView). The chart can be a bit intricate, with 100 representing zero interest rate expectations and each 0.10 increment below indicating a 10 basis point (0.10%) rate hike.\n\nCurrently, the chart reads 94.83, implying a terminal rate of 5.27%. This suggests that the market still anticipates the Fed to hike rates by at least 27 basis points beyond its current rate of 5%.\n\nJuly 2023 federal funds futures contracts. Source: TradingView\n\nThis is the lowest level federal funds futures have reached since early March, just before the banking crisis unfolded.\n\nLooking at the chart again below with BTC (orange line) laid overtop shows that the mid-March reversal in terminal rate expectations was a huge driver of DXY\u2019s drop and, consequently, Bitcoin\u2019s rally above $30,000.\n\nBTC and July 2023 federal funds futures contracts. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the federal funds futures were again to fall back below the 94.50 level, as they did in March, it would become very likely that the market would fall back under heavy sell pressure due to this correlation.\n\nNotably, these federal funds futures made a strong surge on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 31, when they rose over 10 basis points from the lows.\n\nShould this trend continue and the ZQN2023 contract rise back above 95, it would signal the market\u2019s belief that the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle has concluded, potentially paving the way for rate cuts. Such easing of monetary policy would more than likely be quite bullish for BTC and bearish for the DXY.\n\nThis is especially true if the DXY falls back down to new 2023 lows from here and breaks below its long-held support level near 100. Such price action would open up the gates for BTC to make a refreshed run above $30,000.\n\nAnd with that thought in mind, there is one notable cohort of crypto market participants who appear to be front-running such a reversal: Bitcoin whales.\n\nRelated: Last BTC price dip before a $30K breakout? Bitcoin wipes weekend gains\n\nBitcoin whale songs\n\nBitcoin whales are classified by wallet addresses that hold more than 10,000 BTC.\n\nA species of smart money that the on-chain data scientists study intensely.\n\nAs shown on the chart below, Bitcoin whales (represented by the red dots) have been steadily increasing their holdings on net every day since April 17, a trend which coincided with Bitcoin reaching its year-to-date high above $31,000.\n\nBitcoin divergence chart. Source: Tara NFT\n\nThis behavior diverges from previous trends, where whale wallets accumulated Bitcoin at market bottoms, or on the way to higher highs, rather than tops. This anomaly prompts a thought-provoking question: Have these whale wallets bought the top for the first time, or was April 17 not the peak?\n\nBitcoin divergence chart. Source: Tara NFT\n\nThis behavior from the Bitcoin market\u2019s largest players calls into question the legitimacy of May\u2019s DXY pump and adds uncertainty to bearish outlooks, especially when combined with the notable rise in federal funds futures.\n\nAs always, the market is doing its best to keep participants a step behind the next trend.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how much the rise of terminal rates and the DXY in May can be attributed to escalating fears over the United States debt ceiling standoff. With that issue now in the rearview (pending final votes), one wonders whether or not this will lead to the dollar reverting back to its downtrend and Bitcoin heading back above the $30,000 mark.\n\nFor the remainder of the second quarter, it will be crucial to closely monitor the movements of terminal rate expectations, the DXY and Bitcoin whale activity, as these data points are likely to provide actionable clues prior to the next big move happening.\n\nThe coming weeks will undoubtedly shed light on these intriguing dynamics, shaping the path for both the U.S. dollar and the cryptocurrency market at large into the summer months and beyond.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Hong Kong is bringing back retail crypto trading. Will China be next? - Fortune",
        "content": "Hong Kong on Thursday reinstated retail crypto trading at select exchanges in what could serve as a test case for China reversing its 2021 ban on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile crypto trading and mining are still banned on the mainland, Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region of China, has cautiously reopened to the nascent asset class.\n\nLast week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission announced it was going forward with a plan to allow individual investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with high market caps, like Bitcoin and Ether, as it begins a new licensing system June 1. As of Thursday, it will be against the law for any unlicensed exchanges to market to Hong Kong investors, Bloomberg reported, citing Keith Choy, the interim head of intermediaries at the SFC.\n\nJust two exchanges, OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited, have been licensed so far, according to the SFC\u2019s website, but several others, including Huobi and OKX, have said they plan to apply for licenses.\n\nOver the weekend, Beijing added to the speculation of a crypto renaissance in the country after the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park Management Committee released a white paper on Web3 technologies, according to local media. The report seemed to affirm at least some commitment to supporting blockchain-related companies ahead of the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s new policy. Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, CEO of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, posted a copy of the white paper on Twitter, noting the \u201cinteresting timing.\u201d\n\nInteresting timing on this Web 3.0 white paper from the Beijing government tech committee with the June 1st anticipation in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/0Ts1UB0jnL \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) May 27, 2023\n\nAnd on Monday, two new Hong Kong\u2013based industry associations, Hong Kong Licensed Virtual Assets Association and Web3 Harbour, also launched with \u201ca shared commitment to the long-term growth and development of the virtual asset economy and decentralized internet,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nThe shift in Hong Kong\u2019s attitude toward digital currencies follows similar actions by governments in Dubai and Singapore. But Hong Kong\u2019s new approach could have a bigger impact, experts say, because of the potential for China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, to embrace crypto as the U.S. grows increasingly hostile toward the sector.\n\n\u201cI have literally been laughed at when I tell people that our business is in the U.S.\u201d Leo Mizuhara, CEO, Hashnote\n\nMark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, said China is likely being pulled toward crypto rather than pushing on its own, because it needs new revenue streams to help service its debts. Reopening to crypto trading would give it that opportunity, but it would also increase the overall variability and volatility because more retail traders mean more liquidity, he said.\n\nHe added that China, which is known for tight controls over its economy, might introduce its own crypto exchange, which, although unusual, could still be a net positive.\n\n\u201cEven if it was state-controlled,\u201d Connors added, \u201cyou would have a liquidity provider for the world\u2019s largest populated state.\u201d\n\nHow China\u2019s government will coexist with decentralized blockchains remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThis is almost an exercise in democracy,\u201d Connors continued, \u201cwhere you have a non-state commodity being shared, and you can\u2019t really control its flow like you can with pipelines and shipping lanes.\u201d\n\nThe change in tone from Hong Kong is welcome news to entrepreneurs and business leaders who are interested in getting a foothold in China. Leo Mizuhara, CEO of Hashnote, an institutional management platform for digital assets, said he has looked to expand his company\u2019s reach in Asia partly because of the large market opportunity but also because of U.S. regulators\u2019 increasing hostility.\n\nEven though Mizuhara said he worries about the risks of doing business in China, such as submitting to strict capital controls or ceding some of the company\u2019s intellectual property to the government, he\u2019ll still strongly consider it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to run a business with the level of uncertainty that is currently in the U.S.,\u201d Mizuhara said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost irresponsible of us not to have a little bit of that diversification.\u201d\n\nIncreased enforcement actions by regulators, mainly the Securities and Exchange Commission, have left crypto companies unsure of where they stand, even those offering an olive branch to regulators. Coinbase, the biggest U.S.-based exchange and arguably one of the most compliant companies in the industry, sued the SEC in April after it was hit with a Wells Notice, which signals the agency is planning legal action against an individual or company.\n\nIn a MarketWatch opinion piece published on Wednesday by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he said regulators and policymakers writing off crypto as just another unstable asset benefits China and it \u201crisks America\u2019s time-honored role as the global financial leader and an innovation hub.\u201d\n\nAlthough most of Hashnote\u2019s employees are split between Chicago and New York City, Mizuhara said he\u2019s considering moving the company\u2019s headquarters to another country.\n\n\u201cI have literally been laughed at when I tell people that our business is in the U.S.,\u201d he said."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI is making waves as it infiltrates more of everyday life, but a tech specialist at Alliance Bernstein noticed that people aren't searching for it as much as they did Bitcoin in 2017.\n\nIn Mark Schilsky's note to investors on Wednesday, he said interest in the term \"AI\" was at an \"all-time high\" based on data from Google Trends, which tracks how much people are searching for particular terms.\n\nBut, he noted, \"it's still far below the absolute hype of 'Bitcoin.'\"\n\nSchilsky's report shows a line chart comparing three search terms: \"AI,\" \"metaverse,\" and \"Bitcoin.\" He pegged those as the buzziest segments of the tech industry over the past five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA screen grab from Google Trends shows what Alliance Bernstein analyst Mark Schilsky pointed out to clients: The peak of search volume for \"Bitcoin\" is higher than the peak of search volume for \"AI\" so far. And also: \"Metaverse\" has never really taken off. Alliance Bernstein\n\nAs for the latest data, it's possible that people haven't been googling \"AI\" with the same frequency they googled \"Bitcoin\" at the height of its mania in 2017 because the terms \"artificial intelligence\" and \"AI\" have been around for decades \u2014 at least since the 1950s. (Bitcoin, on the other hand, was a relatively new invention at the time.)\n\nAnd the metaverse hasn't spiked significantly higher perhaps because many still view it as a place for video games and not something the average person can use in their ordinary life \u2014 much to Mark Zuckerberg's chagrin.\n\nWith the trendline for \"AI\" searches \u2014 and its apparent inevitable march to be an ever-more important part of our lives \u2014 it's likely only a matter of time before it surpasses \"Bitcoin\" for search volume. But we're not there quite yet."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price ended its four-month positive return streak as May noted a negative return of 6.92%.\n\nHistorical monthly return suggests that BTC is likely to remain in the red for the next quarter as well.\n\nBased on this data, investors can expect the bull run to restart in October 2023.\n\nWith worsening macroeconomic conditions, this bearish outlook might just manifest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price produced a monthly close at $27,210, noting a -6.92% return for May. The last-minute slide in BTC put an end to the four-month bullish streak that kickstarted the 2023 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nBitcoin price and historical returns\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price faced intense selling pressure in May, which caused it to drop 8.75% from its local top of $29,820. As a result, the month returned a negative 6.92%, ending the four-month positive streak for BTC.\n\nAs hopes of a bull run diminish, more investors could join the selling spree, triggering a sell-off. Or, Bitcoin price could consolidate, making it boring for day traders and investors. Historical data is key when measured over a large enough timeframe and reflects investors\u2019 sentiments, which often tend to be cyclical.\n\nOver the last 14 years, the highest average return for Bitcoin price is roughly 38% in November. Following this is 36% in April and 26% in October. Likewise, quarters one and four display the best returns for Bitcoin price. A simple conclusion from this would be that the first and third quarters are typically the best time to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC average monthly and quarterly returns\n\nThe monthly return table for Bitcoin price not only shows the big-picture outlook but also adds structure to the chaos of everyday volatility. As seen in the image below, the average return for BTC slumps after April all the way up to September. But in the last quarter, the average monthly return picks up steam.\n\nA simple conclusion one can draw from this is that the next three months are likely going to be in the red or barely breaking even. The former seems more plausible when factoring in the worsening macroeconomic conditions.\n\nBTC monthly returns\n\nRead more: China coin narrative in play as Coinbase CEO warns of restrictive US crypto policies\n\nMacroeconomic economic conditions worsen\n\nIn hindsight, Covid-19 seems to be the starting point of what is happening in the world. Due to the sudden halt in the economic machine, central banks across the world started worrying about an impending recession. To prevent a catastrophic breakdown of world economies, central banks decided to grease the economy by printing and distributing money to failing banks, businesses and people.\n\nWhile money printing did the trick, it took a heavy toll on inflation. The year-over-year Consumer Price Index (CPI), or inflation in the United States, peaked at 9.1% in 2022. Similar ripple effects were seen in economies across the world that resorted to printing money out of thin air.\n\nCentral banks have been trying to curb the inflation. The US Federal Reserve has been curbing inflation by raising interest rates, which is reminiscent of the Great Recession of 2008 - 2009. Similar hikes in interest rates in 2008 caused the banks to fail, which had a domino effect causing the housing market bubble to pop. The panic was soon followed by a recession in not just the US but across the globe.\n\nLikewise, the recent hikes by the Fed caused many popular US banks to close up shops, which caused panic among retail investors. Now, the latest in a long line of crisis is the US Debt Ceiling; the US House of Representatives has voted to remove the $31.4 trillion ceiling, which received bipartisan support.\n\nRead more: S&P500 Futures grind higher, yields stabilize as US House of Representatives pass debt ceiling deal\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nBased on the historical data and macroeconomic conditions, the outlook for Bitcoin price does not look good. So, investors can expect the next three months to be so-so. But from a long-term investment perspective, Q3 is likely to provide plenty of opportunities to accumulate BTC and other altcoins before the 2023 bull rally kickstarts in Q4."

It also draws from other sources, including Saifedean Ammous\u2019 book The Bitcoin Standard, Jeff Booth\u2019s book The Price of Tomorrow and Corbin\u2019s film The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin, with more sources on the way.\n\nIn testing, the chatbot generates responses that are typically uncertain of the future of fiat currencies and hopeful about Bitcoin, although it can provide conflicting answers depending on how it's prompted.\n\nCheck out an example:\n\nHere's the answer to \"Is our debt sustainable in an inflationary world?\":\n\n\n\nWhere else can you get this kind of answer? pic.twitter.com/euSj6oXqot \u2014 Pierre Corbin (@CierrePorbin) May 31, 2023\n\nFor example, when asked a variation of the question \u201cWhat is the future of Bitcoin?\u201d it generated separate responses saying it was both \u201cpromising\u201d and \u201cuncertain.\u201d\n\nThe model isn\u2019t trained on the more recent Bitcoin developments, such as the Ordinals protocol or BRC-20 tokens and often generates a response saying it can\u2019t provide an opinion on such topics. Depending on the question, however, it can generate contradicting responses on Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe chatbot seems to be critical of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and other Bitcoin forks in general, saying it has been \u201cdifficult for alternative chains to gain momentum.\" Source: Talk2Satoshi\n\nWhen asked questions regarding Ordinals, it said in one reply that Bitcoin \u201cis not meant to be a platform for storing or transmitting images or other types of data,\u201d while another response called Ordinals \u201ca fascinating and creative application of cryptography.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nAccording to Corbin, the goal of the bot is to show that AI tools could potentially be used in education.\n\nThe model can generate competent responses when asked questions about Bitcoin such as how it works and how its mined, and can explain aspects of the network such as satoshis.\n\nSimilar to the real person, the Nakamoto-emulating bot is still shy about revealing its real identity and typically responds:\n\n\u201cMy real name is not important.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, June 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending May 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe achieved a significant milestone during the month of May,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cNot only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date. Importantly, we achieved this milestone with the bulk of our expansion expected to come later this year.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the amount of bitcoin we mined this month exceeded expectations, largely due to increases in operational efficiency and a brief, albeit significant, increase in transaction fees. For about five days in May, fees were elevated because of increased interest in ordinals on the blockchain. At its peak, our bitcoin production jumped to nearly 30 bitcoins in a single day, almost double our normal daily production of about 18 bitcoins. Since then, transaction fees have normalized.\u201d\n\nMay Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in May: 609\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 3,004\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of May 31: 451\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in May: 471\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,196 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 471 bitcoins in May 2023 at an average of approximately $27,400 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. May daily BTC mined averaged 19.6 and reached a high of 29.6, due to a brief period of unusually high transaction fees.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nWashington. The 50MW expansion continues to track according to projected timelines, despite a series of rain delays that temporarily slowed down progress. Miners are arriving daily with all units expected to be at the facility by the end of the month. Racking has begun and energization is expected to begin in the second half of June.\n\nSandersville. Crews are making headway in prepping the land for the Company\u2019s expansion at its Sandersville site. The planned expansion will add over 6 EH/s to CleanSpark\u2019s mining operations. Additional updates about the expansion are posted from time-to-time on the Company\u2019s Twitter feed, @CleanSpark_Inc.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "title": "Blockchain: the balancing act between efficiency and security - Santander",
        "content": "There are currently all types of combinations, depending on block size and the rate at which new blocks are added. In Bitcoin's blockchain, for example, the block is usually two megabytes (2 MB) in size, but can very between 1 MB and 4 MB, and the blockchain is designed to take 10 minutes to add a block to the chain. As a result of these restrictions, the Bitcoin network has been criticised for having low scalability), but the speed of payments under this system is beginning to be addressed through Lightning Networks. Other blockchain networks that emerged after Bitcoin have a larger block size (Bitcoin Cash, BCH; has blocks 8 MB) or can add a new block to the network in less time (this is the case of Litecoin (LTC), where a new block is added every two and a half minutes, four times faster than Bitcoin).\n\nAlthough adjusting these parameters (size and time) can improve network efficiency (more transactions could be conducted per unit of time). However, doing so could compromise network security, as this is based on the computational effort required from the nodes (proof-of-work consensus algorithm).\n\nIncreasing the block size and slashing the time it takes for a block to join the network would inevitably result in higher demand on the computational capacity of the nodes involved in blockchain mining. It is now quite common to find clusters of computers working together as a team, in what are known as \u201cmining farms\u201d, attempting to complete the proof of work (process for determining the entity that will add the next block to the blockchain).\n\nAs the number of Bitcoin network users increases \u2013 the more people attempting to solve the proof-of-work puzzle, the easier it is to solve, meaning that in order to maintain the 10-minute cadence, the difficulty must be increased.\n\nIn extreme circumstances, a small group of mining farms could even come to dominate the network. One of blockchain's security fundamentals stems from the existence of a high number of nodes that individually ensure that the network functions properly: accurate information, non-corruption and immutable information. If a smaller cluster of nodes is in control, this could prevent the blockchain network from working properly. A 51% attack refers to a type of attack on a blockchain network that allows a malicious miner, who holds more than 50% of the computational power (hash rate), to take control of the mining. This way, mining farms agree on which information (or transactions) are written (or executed) on the Blockchain.\n\nThe more nodes there are, the more decentralised the blockchain becomes. Increasing the number of blocks per unit of time or increasing the size of the block in the pursuit of efficiency ends up increasing the cost of maintaining the node, meaning that nodes fall in number and the network therefore becomes less decentralised.\n\nUltimately, the violation of the principle of decentralisation and the potential for the emergence of oligopolies in the pursuit of greater efficiency may diminish the security of the blockchain compared to that which was initially established. As is often the case, the fact that a technology is born based on the improvement of existing systems does not imply that it can be used other than initially intended. The need to regulate or create legislation and case law on blockchain is also currently under debate, though this will have to be done based on the different uses derived from this technology."

        "title": "'There needs to be a health warning': How crypto trading can lead to addiction - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIn the circle of a therapy session in an 18th century Scottish country house are half-a-dozen recovering addicts. Many recall, at their lowest points, battling chronic depression and contemplating suicide.\n\nThe patients, all male, share harrowing stories of dealing with a newfangled addiction: compulsive crypto trading. Some say their crypto addiction combined with an alcohol or drug habit, while others say they began by treating trading digital tokens much like gambling.\n\n\u201cI spent eight hours a day on Reddit reading [crypto] white papers, thinking I\u2019m making an intellectual decision . . . it was just ridiculous,\u201d said one patient.\n\nTheir plight goes to the heart of a dilemma for politicians around the world as they try to grapple with the impact of cryptocurrencies on their populations. Many lawmakers and companies are calling for it to be designated as a financial service, which would demand tough regulatory standards but offer consumers legal protections.\n\nIn an effort to establish London as a \u201chub\u201d for financial markets innovation, the British government has set out a sweeping framework for crypto that would bring it into line with established regulations for financial services.\n\nBut in the UK last month a report from a powerful cross-party group of MPs said crypto should be regulated like gambling; people were trading assets that had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and \u201cno discernible social good\u201d, it said.\n\nFor those treating the 70-odd patients at the private Castle Craig rehab centre outside Edinburgh, the change in emphasis cannot come soon enough.\n\nCrypto addicts describe their experience \u201cas any gambler would describe their gambling addiction\u201d, said Anthony Marini, Castle Craig\u2019s senior specialist therapist. \u201cSo, for me, should it be regulated as gambling? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 patients suffering from a form of crypto addiction have come through Castle Craig\u2019s doors since it opened up to crypto traders in 2018, calling itself the world\u2019s first specialist crypto addiction centre.\n\nAll hands went up during the group session when Marini asked if any patients had experienced symptoms such as suicidal ideation, chronic depression or hopelessness.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a health warning [on crypto exchanges] just like any gambling site,\u201d Marini said. \u201cPeople have lost families, people have lost their jobs, people have embezzled . . . there needs to be warnings and education that this can actually kill people.\u201d\n\nCentral to the report from the Treasury select committee were concerns that handing oversight of crypto to the UK\u2019s main markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, would give the impression that crypto is \u201csafer than it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was seeing crypto more as an investment, so in my head I wasn\u2019t gambling at first . . . but I don\u2019t think it really works like that,\u201d another gambling addict told the Financial Times.\n\nDuring the therapy session at Castle Craig, patients described using crypto trading apps that were built to encourage them to invest compulsively and chase a quick profit, echoing the rougher tactics of the early online betting industry, which has been tamed to some extent by more fines being meted out by the Gambling Commission.\n\nGaming companies are now compelled to offer customers access to self-exclusion technology, while crypto trading apps are not. UK online betting platforms will soon have to impose stake limits and conduct basic affordability checks on users, although how this will work is still subject to consultation.\n\nThe prospect of regulations that borrow from the gambling playbook would likely \u201ccut against\u201d the UK government\u2019s ambitions to become a hub for the sector, argued Paige Berges, anti-corruption and international risk counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray.\n\nCrypto companies have also hit out at its findings, saying it underplays crypto\u2019s potential benefits for the economy and consumers. British lobbying group CryptoUK calls the select committee report \u201cnot helpful\u201d.\n\nTrading venue GFO-X said: \u201cAll investors \u2014 whether retail or institutional \u2014 deserve access to orderly markets which establish price discovery, in the same way as other financial instruments or commodities. The rhetoric around crypto assets being classed as gambling is extremely unhelpful and provides worse customer outcomes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the UK Treasury, responsible for developing the rules, has privately indicated it will not be swayed by the report.\n\n\u201cRisks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it is financial services regulation \u2014 rather than gambling regulation \u2014 that has the record in mitigating them,\u201d said a recent email from the Treasury to the crypto industry and seen by the FT.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that the lines between crypto trading and gambling are blurred, and the worst consequences of overuse look strikingly similar.\n\nA 2019 study from researchers at Rutgers University that looked at 876 gamblers who bet at least once a month found that increased problem gambling severity among the cohort was \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with trading crypto.\n\n\u201cYour emotions are so attached to what the graph is doing, especially with crypto because it\u2019s 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I\u2019d be checking my phone at 3am, you lose sleep over it,\u201d said one patient at Castle Craig.\n\nDuring the week when the Terra stablecoin collapsed last May, the US National Council on Problem Gambling registered a record 19,000 users, the same number as a typical month. A 2023 study by the Blockchain Research Lab found that crypto users who also gamble tend to be \u201cyoung, male, well-educated and well-off\u201d.\n\nThe NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic, which launched in 2008, will hold its first clinic solely focused on addicted retail traders this month, and half of the dozen patients complain of compulsively trading crypto.\n\n\u201cThe three impacts we see from gambling are on mental health, finances and on relationships. In crypto trading, what we\u2019re seeing is exactly the same,\u201d said Anna Hemmings, chief executive officer of gambling support organisation GamCare.\n\nBut putting crypto in one legal basket and not another also brings problems. Berges at Ropes & Gray points out that treating it as gaming could have the result of \u201cputting crypto outside the scope of traditional financial services regulations\u201d.\n\nKahlil Philander, assistant professor at Washington State University who researches the crossover of crypto and gambling, said not maintaining some oversight by the FCA would be a mistake as crypto is \u201cpretty clearly a commodity or a security\u201d.\n\nAnother is that the Gambling Commission, the body that would be charged with overseeing crypto, is less well-resourced than the FCA, which has more than 4,000 staff.\n\nFor years, safer gambling campaigners have complained that the Gambling Commission\u2019s \u00a374mn budget and 300 staff are toothless in the face of the \u00a314bn UK gambling industry.\n\n\u201cThe gambling sector is large and growing in this country . . . so I think in the short term it would be very challenging for the Gambling Commission to take on crypto,\u201d said Hemmings.\n\nBut the two regulators are conscious that technology is blurring the lines between them and have pledged to work together. That was prompted two years ago by the failure of Football Index, an online betting company that styled itself as a stock market for football. It fell into administration, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their funds.\n\nThe Football Index collapse \u201ccould have been avoided not by the FCA replacing the Gambling Commission as the regulator, but by them working together\u201d, said Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling. \u201cThe same applies to crypto.\u201d\n\nBut for many addicts the regulatory turf war is a moot point and too late. As one patient at Castle Craig said: \u201cPut gambling and crypto side by side, look at the repercussions of both of them, look at the severity of both of them, and tell me they\u2019re not the same.\u201d"

        "content": "DALLAS, TX / ACCESSWIRE / June 2, 2023 / Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc., (\"EGSE\"), a Dallas/Fort Worth based sustainable asset company (OTCQB:EGSE) is updating today its investor base on activities associated with the Company's Costa Rican Bitcoin mining operations (\"Toro\").\n\nEvergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc., Friday, June 2, 2023, Press release picture\n\nAs previously announced on January 12 and January 18, 2023, the Company acquired and closed on a hydroelectric dam located in Costa Rica that generates just under one MW of electricity. Within a week of closing the acquisition, an order was subsequently placed to acquire 240 new bitcoin mining machines (Bitmain S19J Pro+) where were contracted to be delivered by the end of February. Due to manufacturer delays, those new machines were delivered just two weeks ago. After clearing customs and remitting required taxes and import duty fees, the new machines are in the process of being installed in two recently acquired containers that are currently being retrofitted for installation of these 240 new bitcoin mining machines.\n\nAt the same time, annual planned maintenance is being performed on the turbines and the six generators located at the Toro hydroelectric dam. The current timeline for full operations is scheduled to begin within two weeks on or about June 15, 2023.\n\nMr. Gary C. Evans, Chairman and CEO of Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. stated, \"We are very anxious to get our first bitcoin mining operation up and running within the next two weeks. We have coordinated with our 20% equity partner to complete all planned annual maintenance of machinery at the hydroelectric dam during this down time period. This also coordinates with the end of the \"dry season\" in Costa Rica. We believe our new mining operations will be some of the lowest cost with the highest margins in the business due to controlling our power costs at approximately $0.02 per kWh. Based upon current financial modeling, our breakdown Bitcoin price is $10,145 whereas the bitcoin price is trading in the $27,000 range. When we made this investment back in January, Bitcoin prices were in the $16,000 range.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOur management team is continuing to negotiate additional site locations both in the U.S. and Costa Rica at sites where power prices are significantly below historical norms.\n\nAbout Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. (f/k/a Generation Hemp, Inc)\n\nEvergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. is a Dallas/Fort Worth based sustainable [green energy] asset company with operations in both the Bitcoin mining industry and the hemp industry. Bitcoin operations are located in Costa Rica, with future development plans in Arkansas and Kentucky and other Costa Rica locations. Hemp operations are located in western Kentucky and Denver, Colorado. In the hemp industry, the company uses its proprietary technology to dry, clean, process and store hemp. In addition, Generation Hemp also owns and leases real estate to companies needing seed storage facilities located within the greater Denver area.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe U.S. overwhelmingly passed the recent debt ceiling deal, giving markets a breather. But Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] bearish sentiment persists after failing to flip bullish on the higher timeframe chart. It closed May in red, sustaining about 4% loss in monthly performance.\n\nDespite the price pump seen last weekend, BTC recorded $11 million outflows in short-Bitcoin in the same period. The trend marks the sixth consecutive outflow totaling over $270 million, according to Coinshares\u2019 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report.\n\nWhile this underscores the prevailing negative sentiment, declining volumes were also worrying.\n\nBTC\u2019s trendline resistance roadblock\n\nBTC price action has been making lower highs after price rejection at $31k in mid-April. A trendline resistance (white) has become a key roadblock on the daily chart, preventing BTC from flipping to bullish.\n\n\n\nA recent bullish breakout on 28 May faced rejection at the trendline resistance, setting BTC to retrace to the previous mid-range of $26.8k. Below the mid-range lies the 111-day MA (Moving Average) of $26.5k.\n\n\n\nThe 111-MA has checked three major drops so far. One in mid-March and two in May, making it a key dynamic support level. A breach below the MA and range low of $26.0k could offer sellers more upper hand, denting the bullish sentiment further.\n\nThe two support levels to watch out for in such an extended plunge are $25k and $24k.\n\nConversely, BTC could rebound at the mid-range, which aligns with $26.6k, a key support level in late March/April after the U.S. debt ceiling news.\n\nHowever, bulls must clear the trendline resistance roadblock to gain leverage. Northwards, resistance levels lay at $28.5k, $29.8k and $31k.\n\nCVD spot declines\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nTowards the end of May, CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) spot took a nosedive, declining steadily from 29 May to 1 June (as of press time). It reinforces the sellers\u2019 leverage seen in the past few days.\n\nWith the US debt ceiling out of the way, the focus now turns to the FOMC meeting in mid-June. In addition, the $28k level has been marked level by long-term BTC holders in profit and could remain a key obstacle for a while."

Friedrich, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered Patel be detained pending trial, the Department of Justice said in a press release.\n\nPreviously, Firoz, his brother, Ferhan, 42, and their company, MH Pillars, doing business as Payza, were prosecuted in the US District Court of Columbia for operating an Internet-based unlicensed money service business that processed more than $250 million in transactions, it said.\n\nThrough Payza.com, the defendants ran a money-transmitting business that operated without the necessary state licenses and knowingly transmitted funds that were derived from illegal activity.\n\nThe brothers who founded and operated Payza.com, AlertPay.com and Egopay.com, each pled guilty to conspiracy to commit crimes against the US by operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and by laundering monetary instruments.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Firoz Patel was required to disclose all known assets to the US government.\n\nThe court had also entered a forfeiture judgment for \u201cany property, real or personal, involved in\u201d the offence to which Firoz had pled guilty. On November 10, 2020, Firoz was sentenced to 36 months in prison and was given a reporting date.\n\nAccording to the court documents, between his sentencing and reporting dates, Patel transferred 450 BTC valued at $24,020,699.83, traceable to Payza.com, to an account at a virtual currency exchange in the UK.\n\nThe 450 Bitcoin would have been subject to forfeiture in Patel's previous criminal case. The virtual currency exchange account was opened using the name and date of birth of Patel's father but with an email address and phone number controlled by Firoz Patel.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the additional information required by the virtual currency exchange about the account and the large deposit received a response in the name of an employee of a company in India affiliated with Payza.\n\nAfter which, the account containing the 450 Bitcoin was frozen.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

Litecoin topped among the gainers with a more than 5 per cent rise, while Polygon, Avalanche and XRP gained 2 per cent. Cardano and Dogecoin were other top gainers.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, rising to $1.14 trillion-mark as it increased more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped over 15 per cent to $29.64 billion.\n\n\n\nWith the price dipping below the $27,000 mark.

The law is set to go into effect in 2024, heralding the beginning of regulation for crypto firms operating in the EU,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is in a bearish trend though a rebound is likely with the asset holding support in longer timeframes. It is trading near $0.9 currently. The MATIC price trend is in a falling wedge pattern and is looking for a breakout, ideally back above $1.00 and its 200-day MA.\n\n\n\nIts RSI also has made a comeback in the past week and is moving upwards indicating an upcoming rally. However, like all altcoins, MATIC\u2019s price action depends on performance of BTC and financial markets. If MATIC fails to withhold the $0.82 support level, it could encounter renewed selling pressure.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.75, $0.82\n\nResistance: $0.95, $1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) is still trying to move closer to the psychologically important level of $28,000, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is starting to show slightly positive signs, suggesting further move up could be in store by the end of June.\n\nIn this context, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithm over at the cryptocurrency analytics and forecast platform PricePredictions, which has set the price of Bitcoin for June 30, 2023, at $27,540.35, according to the information seen on June 2.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nIf these projections, based on indicators like moving average convergence divergence (MACD), average true range (ATR), Bollinger Bands (BB), and others, are to materialize, the predicted price would represent a 1.59% increase to the current price of Bitcoin, which at the time of publication was changing hands at $27,110.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIndeed, the price of the maiden crypto asset at press time suggests a daily gain of 0.96%, as well as climbing 2.28% over the previous seven days, as it records a loss of 5.42% across the past month, according to the latest charts retrieved on June 2.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, the technical analysis (TA) gauges on the finance and crypto market analytics platform TradingView are somewhat mixed, with an optimistic 1-week sentiment that suggests a \u2018buy\u2019 at 11, as moving averages (MA) point at a \u2018buy\u2019 at 9 and oscillators are in the \u2018neutral\u2019 area. On the other hand, 1-day gauges indicate a \u2018sell.\u2019\n\nBitcoin technical analysis 1-week gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nAll things considered, Bitcoin\u2019s capability to reach the projected price will depend on multiple factors and indicators. For instance, the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA), support and resistance levels, 200-day EMA, and the 0.382 ratio Fibonacci level suggest that the price of Bitcoin could drop to as low as $23,000, as Finbold reported on June 1.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
