        "title": "How IRS-CI Seized Billions From Silk Road Hacker James Zhong - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "In November 2021, IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) seized 50,676 Bitcoin from James Zhong, an American who pled guilty to wire fraud for stealing that Bitcoin from the darknet market Silk Road in September 2012. With a value of $3.36 billion, this marks one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in history.\n\nWe commend the IRS-CI agents who led this investigation, as well as the DOJ lawyers who were able to achieve a guilty plea from Zhong. We\u2019re also proud to say that Chainalysis\u2019 own Aaron Bice assisted agents with the case, using Chainalysis Reactor and other proprietary tools to trace Zhong\u2019s attempts to launder the funds, and performing forensic database analysis to help agents identify Zhong and build their case against him. Below, we\u2019ll share more about Zhong\u2019s theft, money laundering strategy, and the investigation itself.\n\nThe hack of Silk Road, from theft to seizure\n\nActive between 2011 and 2013, Silk Road was the first major crypto-powered darknet market, and at its peak accounted for over 20% of Bitcoin\u2019s daily economic activity. While Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht was arrested in 2013, it wasn\u2019t until November 2021 that authorities would catch James Zhong, the person who stole 50,000 Bitcoin from the infamous darknet market in 2012.\n\nZhong pulled off the theft by exploiting a flaw in Silk Road\u2019s Bitcoin withdrawal mechanism for vendors. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), Zhong set up fake Silk Road vendor accounts solely for this purpose, never actually listing anything for sale. Zhong funded the address associated with each vendor account with between 200 and 2,000 Bitcoin, and soon after would initiate multiple transactions to withdraw that amount in a matter of milliseconds. By doing this several times over several days, he was able to trick Silk Road\u2019s system into letting him withdraw more than he deposited, ultimately stealing 50,000 Bitcoin. We can see the results of this activity on the Chainalysis Reactor graph below.\n\nSoon after the theft, Zhong consolidated his 50,000 Bitcoin in two wallets, with 40,000 Bitcoin in one and 10,000 in the other. The funds sat untouched for over a year, until he gradually moved them to new wallets over several years from October 2013 to May 2019. Between December 2020 and January 2021, Zhong also moved a portion of the funds to a mixing service in an effort to obfuscate the flow of funds.\n\nWe should also note that Zhong gained an additional 50,000 in Bitcoin Cash \u2014 the equivalent of his stolen Bitcoin holdings \u2014 when the Bitcoin Cash hard fork occurred in 2017. Soon after, Zhong exchanged that 50,000 Bitcoin Cash for 3,500 Bitcoin, bringing his total illicit holdings to 53,500 Bitcoin, a portion of which was also seized later.\n\nEventually, Zhong attempted to liquidate a portion of the stolen funds at a centralized cryptocurrency exchange in 2020. During that process, an address that had received funds directly from the Silk Road hack was included on the input side of a transaction along with an address easily traced to Zhong, allowing investigators to ascertain that Zhong controlled both. Additionally, the compliance team at that exchange provided law enforcement with the KYC information and IP address linked to the account associated with these transactions, which also led back to Zhong. Agents raided Zhong\u2019s Gainesville, Georgia home in November 2021, finding 50,491 Bitcoin on devices hidden in a floor safe and, on the lower end of Zhong\u2019s security measures, inside of a popcorn tin stuffed under blankets. Agents also turned up over $660,000 in cash, precious metals, and 25 Casascius coins, which are physical representations of Bitcoin containing private keys to access actual Bitcoin. Zhong voluntarily turned over another 861 Bitcoin in March 2022 and May 2022. In November 2022, he pled guilty to charges of wire fraud stemming from this theft, and was sentenced to just over a year in prison in April 2023.\n\nSeizures are key in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime\n\nIt should go without saying that no one has the right to steal money just because it was obtained through criminal activity. More importantly, this case shows how far law enforcement has progressed in its ability to follow and seize cryptocurrency associated with crime, even when criminals go to great lengths to hide it, and even when the activity in question occurred years in the past. The blockchain is forever, so investigators can always return to old, suspicious transactions and investigate them using the latest methods.\n\nAmerican law enforcement agencies \u2014 primarily IRS-CI but others as well \u2014 have now seized billions in digital assets, which should show would-be cybercriminals that cryptocurrency isn\u2019t the anonymous, untraceable asset they may hope it is. In fact, the immutable and public nature of blockchains means that cryptocurrency is usually easier to trace than fiat. We look forward to continuing our support of IRS-CI, the DOJ, and other law enforcement and prosecuting agencies around the world as they continue to progress in their ability to solve cryptocurrency-based crime."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Cash Reach $1,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Bitcoin Cash (BCH 2.27%) cryptocurrency bills itself as a system of \"peer-to-peer electronic cash.\"\n\nThat vision carries subtle but important differences from Bitcoin, where the battle cry is \"a new kind of money.\" Bitcoin offers payment services but mainly wants to store and protect your wealth in the long run. Bitcoin Cash started from the same code base but tweaked a few parameters to speed up its transaction processing. So Bitcoin wants to be a solid tool for generic money management. Bitcoin Cash serves as a nimbler payment processor, with less long-term stability and a potentially weaker data security model.\n\nWith this transaction-friendly focus, it should come as no surprise that Bitcoin Cash is more volatile than Bitcoin. For instance, the smaller and swifter cryptocurrency has doubled its price in 2023 while Bitcoin gained 55%. At the same time, the current price of $199 per Bitcoin Cash token is far from the three-year high of $1,547.\n\nIs the recent price surge a sign of better times ahead, or is the slumping long-term trend a more accurate predictor? Will Bitcoin Cash ever be worth $1,000 per token again?\n\nWhat's new?\n\nBitcoin Cash creates value when people use it in the real world, or take steps toward widespread use of its payment services. The cryptocurrency has indeed seen some good news recently.\n\nA consortium of financial service giants, led by Charles Schwab and Fidelity , fired up a brand new cryptocurrency exchange in June. The EDX Markets exchange launched with support for four hand-picked cryptocurrencies, and this elite list includes Bitcoin Cash. As a result, Bitcoin Cash's token price nearly tripled in a week as investors digested this strong vote of confidence.\n\nand , fired up a brand new cryptocurrency exchange in June. The EDX Markets exchange launched with support for four hand-picked cryptocurrencies, and this elite list includes Bitcoin Cash. As a result, Bitcoin Cash's token price nearly tripled in a week as investors digested this strong vote of confidence. Recent rulings in a couple of important lawsuits imply that Bitcoin Cash should be seen as a cash-like commodity rather than a regulation-laden security. Nothing is set in stone yet, and the legal wheels of appeals and jury trials will probably keep turning for years before the regulatory framework is finalized. But baby steps in the right direction still count as moving forward.\n\nThe crawl toward a more stable crypto-trading future has inspired several investment management titans to consider making Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available on the open market. The list of potential ETF issuers is a who's who of investment services. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has a filing in play. BlackRock is the world's largest financial manager with $9 trillion of assets on the books, and another current Bitcoin ETF application. If the SEC ever approves one of these filings, the floodgates will open for all sorts of cryptocurrency ETFs -- including Bitcoin Cash. That potential sea change is important because the funds would pour massive amounts of cold, hard cash into the crypto sector.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nA couple of thorny questions must work out in Bitcoin Cash's favor before the cryptocurrency can soar to $1,000 per token again.\n\nFirst, the progress toward a serious legal and regulatory crypto system must continue. Stalling out for years could bring Bitcoin Cash back to square one in many ways. Second, crypto-based payments need to become more common. Third, it would be great if Bitcoin Cash could become the most popular blockchain platform for high-speed payment transactions, though simply landing among a handful of standard options could be good enough.\n\nCan these crucial chips fall the right way? Yes, of course. But there is no guarantee that they will -- and even if they do, Bitcoin Cash may not survive a long and slow process. This cryptocurrency has market momentum on its side right now. It would be a shame to waste it.\n\nBitcoin Cash is making progress, but this digital coin is still far from the go-to solution for digital payments. Bitcoin remains the most widely accepted crypto payment option in the real world, followed by Ethereum and Litecoin. If you're dealing with international payments, XRP also enters the conversation before Bitcoin Cash. Maybe that's good enough to jam a foot in the market door for the long haul, and maybe it isn't. Time will tell.\n\nSo Bitcoin Cash might be able to regain the lofty $1,000 price point again, but that target looks distant today. You should buckle down for a bumpy ride, keep the investment size modest due to the substantial risks along the way, and be prepared to lose it all if something goes wrong. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation. Make sure you can live with that before putting real money into Bitcoin Cash."

        "content": "\u201cBitcoin fans have a new presidential candidate to throw their weight behind,\u201d read the first line in a recent newsletter by Decrypt, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency site. The rest was no less gushing in its praise of Javier Milei, the upset front-runner in Argentina\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMilei is a far-right libertarian, a fan of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 and, crucially, the candidate that wants to take Argentina in the most radically new economic direction. He is known for being amenable to crypto, saying that \u201cBitcoin represents money\u2019s return to its original maker: the private sector.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the core of his policies lies not cryptocurrency, but dollarization. Decrypt\u2019s enthusiasm for Milei might therefore be misplaced: If he did replace the peso with the U.S. dollar, it may potentially mean a much less crypto-friendly Argentina.\n\nFor a while now, Argentina has weathered inflation that is well over 100% and rising. The government has put strict controls on U.S. dollars entering the country, resulting in a thriving black market. Virtually every story Rest of World publishes about Argentina contains an explanatory paragraph on its bizarre and dire monetary situation. This is not only because currency issues are one of the main problems facing every single person in the country on a day-to-day basis, but also because they determine how and why Argentines adopt tech in weird and wonderful ways.\n\nCrypto is no exception.\n\nArgentina is a major adopter of crypto on the world stage, with around a third of the population actively using it on a daily basis. But it is the economic crisis that has determined how and why the country adopted crypto. Unlike the U.S. and Europe \u2014 places with stable currencies where crypto has, in recent years, been seen as an investment tool \u2014 Argentines use it as a store of value. Getting their hands on foreign currency is very difficult, and keeping their pesos in a bank is a surefire way of seeing all their worth evaporate. In terms of crypto adoption, Argentina has even overtaken El Salvador, the country where President Nayib Bukele rushed to introduce bitcoin as a national currency in 2021.\n\nLike Milei, Bukele was met with rapturous applause by the crypto community. But the two actually couldn\u2019t be more different while still sitting within the \u201cpro-crypto\u201d camp.\n\nBukele supports one specific crypto project: bitcoin. Milei seems more interested in defending people\u2019s right to use any crypto (even if he has been bullish on bitcoin).\n\nBukele seems to have used bitcoin as a tool to distance himself from the constraints dollarization placed on El Salvador; Milei wants to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy.\n\nBukele has encouraged Salvadorans to store their crypto in a government-linked wallet; Milei says he hates this sort of government interventionism, which is why he is happy to relinquish sovereignty by giving up the peso.\n\nUltimately, because dollarization \u2014 not crypto \u2014 is what truly appeals to Milei, his crypto-fans might end up disappointed. Dollarization will inevitably have many unexpected side effects, including for crypto\u2019s use case. In a dollarized Argentina, how many would stick to crypto if the main reason they used it was so their money wouldn\u2019t lose its value? The dollar could well take on that role."

        "content": "Crypto Nodes: What Are They And How Do They Work?\n\nRead 5 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Public blockchains use a decentralized infrastructure that relies on a network of computers called nodes, rather than centralized servers like the internet.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Crypto nodes maintain the latest record of blockchain networks and consistently verify and approve new transactions. They also ensure that everyone follows the rules set forth by the network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are many types of nodes with differing use-cases, such as miner and validator nodes which create and propose new blocks.\n\n\n\n\u2014 In this article, we dive into what a crypto node is, how they work, and what they mean for blockchain transactions.\n\nCrypto nodes: They are the unsung heroes of the blockchain, the whole reason decentralized networks are even possible. Their job is simple; they offer ways to propose, approve and process transactions without a centralized entity.\n\nWithout nodes, you couldn\u2019t use the blockchain for all sorts of decentralized purposes such as DAOs or even just the peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets. Essentially, nodes make sure transactions are correct every time, and processed effectively. Since the blockchain is immutable\u2013or at least it\u2019s extremely difficult to alter or tamper with a blockchain transaction\u2013getting it right the first time is important. In fact, the security of the network depends on it!\n\nHowever, no one said getting thousands of computers to agree on something was an easy feat. Ensuring every transaction is correct and relying on a network of strangers is a difficult task, and as a result, the way each blockchain approaches crypto nodes can differ slightly. Each network offers different incentives (and punishments) for their actions on a network or even ways of approving transactions. This all affects how the nodes work, how many there are in a network, and even the types of different nodes there are.\n\nSo in this article, we\u2019ll dive into crypto nodes, explaining what they do, their different types and the difference between miners and nodes.\n\nBut before we get there, let\u2019s start with the basics. In fact, what are crypto nodes exactly?\n\nWhat Is a Crypto Node?\n\nA crypto node is a single computer that can interact with and is part of, a blockchain network. On most blockchains, each node is a single and separate computer which stores all of the information on the blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger. Since every node has a copy of the same information, they can verify each other.\n\nThis allows the nodes to verify and record new transactions and broadcast them to the network without the help of a central entity.\n\nThe more crypto nodes you have, the more difficult it becomes to cheat the entire system. That\u2019s because tampering with a blockchain will\u2014more often than not\u2014require a bad actor to control over 51% of the nodes. This becomes practically impossible on popular networks, simply due to the sheer number of nodes you would have to control.\n\nWhat Is a Crypto Node For?\n\nFirstly, crypto nodes store the data necessary for a blockchain to operate. This can include the entire distributed ledger and all of its transactions. The other important job crypto nodes have is communicating with each other. This is integral to keep the nodes in consensus, i.e. making sure every node has the same copy of the chain. It\u2019s basically the method the nodes use to synchronize, making sure the blockchain is the same for everyone.\n\nBeyond that, some crypto nodes also have other jobs, such as verifying blockchain transactions and rejecting those that don\u2019t fit the mold. Plus they can also offer a copy of the blockchain to any new node that wishes to join the network.\n\nEssentially, these capabilities work together to allow crypto nodes to verify and record transactions without a central entity. Instead of working like traditional finance, public blockchains rely on the power of the collective: People all around the world operating nodes.\n\nCrypto Nodes Vs Miners Vs Validators: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nVery often, the words \u2018nodes\u2019 and \u2018miners\u2019 are used interchangeably in crypto, but they\u2019re not the same thing. So, let\u2019s clarify that confusing point now:\n\nA miner is a dedicated computer system that can add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. To mine new coins or validate transactions, this miner must solve the puzzle\u2013a complex mathematical computation\u2013which requires a considerable amount of energy. This crypto mining mechanic is what keeps a proof-of-work blockchain secure. Simply, bitcoin mining is too costly to consider trying to cheat the system.\n\nThis is where it may be confusing to some, as each miner is a node. However, not every node is a miner. For example, anyone can run a crypto node to help the Bitcoin consensus run without mining a single coin. Plus, beyond those distinctions, there are also differences across different types of networks too.\n\nFor example, on proof-of-stake networks, nodes are operated by validators instead of miners. But even on proof-of-stake networks you can also set up your own node without validating transactions. Thus nodes and validators are not synonymous either.\n\nTypes of Crypto Nodes\n\nThere are 2 main types of nodes: Full Nodes and Light Nodes. Each of these exists for separate reasons and has different capabilities.\n\nFull Node\n\nPut simply, a full node stores a full copy of the network\u2019s digital ledger. These types of crypto nodes build the foundations for most blockchains; storing the history of the chain and communicating with other full nodes. These are also the nodes responsible for providing a copy of the chain to new nodes: They really are the backbone of a network, which is why most blockchains will have these types of nodes.\n\nMiner Nodes\n\nMiner nodes are the participants responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain on a proof-of-work blockchain. Mining requires a lot of computational power to solve complex puzzles. However, they also receive cryptocurrency rewards in return for their work.\n\nValidator Nodes\n\nValidator nodes are similar to miner nodes, but on a proof-of-stake network instead: They also validate transactions and create blocks. However, they don\u2019t have to solve complex computational problems, they are chosen in relation to the amount of funds they lock in the system. Like miners though, they also receive rewards for creating blocks.\n\nLight Nodes\n\nSPV clients, also called light nodes, are a little different. Firstly, these types of nodes do not store the entire blockchain like their heavyweight counterparts. Instead, they just download \u2018block headers\u2019. Without getting too technical, it means they don\u2019t require as much storage capacity. Instead, these crypto nodes\u2019 only task is to verify transactions in the blockchain using simplified payment verification (SPV). It\u2019s important to note that not all blockchains use these types of nodes. Mainly, they are popular in blockchains that have limited storage space per block, such as Bitcoin.\n\nHow Do Crypto Nodes Work?\n\nCrypto nodes on different blockchains can vary slightly, but let\u2019s look at a generic flow of how crypto nodes work and what they do.\n\nCrypto Nodes Distribute the Signed Transaction\n\nWhen you sign a transaction, the details are sent to a set of nodes. The first set of nodes passes it onto the other nodes, who then pass it on to the next level of nodes. They do this until the transaction is included in a block or discarded.\n\nNodes Then Verify Transactions in the Mempool\n\nAs the transaction is distributed, it enters a mempool in each node. Initially, it has a queued status. But from there, the nodes must validate the transaction. Once the majority of nodes validate that the transaction is valid, it moves to a pending status. This means that the transaction is ready to be added to the chain. Conversely, if the majority of nodes decide a transaction is not valid, it will be discarded.\n\nNodes Add Transactions To Blocks and Broadcast Them To The Network\n\nOnce the transaction moves to a pending status, miner or validator nodes are able to add the block to the network. At the point a miner or validator wins the block and adds it to the chain, the transaction becomes immutable. To explain, making any alteration to the transaction would require the majority of nodes\u2019 approval, which could be thousands of nodes in more popular blockchains. This simple mechanism keeps the chain secure.\n\nNodes Have Incentives (and Deterrents) To Ensure Good Behavior\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to note that some nodes are responsible for adding blocks to the network, which will usually earn them cryptocurrency rewards.\n\nOn a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, this requires a large amount of computational power in order to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. This means that miners have an incentive to add valid blocks to the chain, but they also have a deterrent from behaving dishonorably\u2014simply the energy cost of mining wouldn\u2019t be profitable without the block rewards.\n\nOn a proof-of-stake blockchain, participating nodes also receive block rewards, but as a deterrent for bad behavior, these chains have a different method. To explain, validators must lock up a significant amount of their funds as collateral. Then if they behave honorably, they receive more rewards. If they behave maliciously, their collateral\u2014also called a stake\u2014is slashed. This mechanism ensures that nodes behave as they should, even without an ongoing energy cost and expensive equipment.\n\nCrypto Nodes: Why Are They So Important?\n\nCrypto nodes are integral to the security of blockchain systems. When trying to execute tasks in a decentralized manner, the only option is a peer-to-peer system, and the only way to manage one effectively is via a blockchain network. Nodes allow blockchains to validate transactions in a fair way\u2014and without a centralized entity taking a cut.\n\nPlus, the more participants there are operating nodes, the harder it is for bad actors to collude or take control of the network. They ensure that the users and miners are playing by the rules, with both features making the network more decentralized and secure.\n\nIn short, no matter what you\u2019re doing on a network, you\u2019re going to encounter nodes. In fact, you may even want to start operating a crypto node yourself! Whether you fancy running a full node, or even becoming a miner or validator node, there\u2019s an option for you. You can even fund a validator node directly through Ledger Live.\n\nNodes are the basis of blockchain systems; without them, there would be no blockchain storage in the first place. Together, nodes provide the whole infrastructure for a blockchain network\u2014which is why understanding them is so important.\n\nKnowledge is Power\n\nTrust yourself and keep on learning.

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin is offering new insight into how Bitcoin stored on its exchange will be held in custody in the future, following a tumultuous month in which many of the company's users were left looking for clarity.\n\nAnnounced Thursday, Swan Bitcoin says it intends to partner with BitGo to launch a \"Bitcoin-only trust company,\" one that would require regulatory approval before ultimately being made live for customers.\n\n\"This strategic partnership aims to cater to the growing demand for Bitcoin-specific solutions while addressing the critical security and custody requirements within the Bitcoin ecosystem,\" a press release sent exclusively to Bitcoin Magazine read.\n\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said in a statement that the plan is to either acquire an existing trust company, or build one. If they choose to acquire, he said they aim to be live with customers by Q1 2024. If, instead, they build a new trust, the goal is to go live by Q3.\n\nKlippsten further detailed how the move builds on an existing collaboration between the companies, explaining that BitGo has held all of Swan users\u2019 custodied coins in cold storage since June, which will continue. He claims Fortress does not custody Swan clients\u2019 coins except for small amounts temporarily when satisfying withdrawal requests.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe echoed Klippsten's claims, saying the companies have been collaborating on a solution for some time. Prior to Fortress and BitGo, Swan Bitcoin used Prime Trust as its preferred custody partner.\n\nPrime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August, claiming a shortfall of customer funds.\n\n\"Our teams have worked closely together for nearly a year on stronger qualified custody models,\" Belshe said. \"Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the capabilities of each company.\"\n\nThe trust's announcement follows the acquisition of Fortress by Ripple, a cryptocurrency company formed in 2012 that is devoted to evangelizing the XRP digital asset. The acquisition of Fortress by Ripple caused a stir on social media, especially given that Klippsten has previously accused Ripple of fraud.\n\nOf note is that Swan Bitcoin actively discourages customers from holding Bitcoin on its exchange, an industry best practice that has limited client exposure to Fortress.\n\nElsewhere, the press release was forward-looking and aspirational, with Klippsten seeking to highlight his desire to create a Bitcoin-only custodian that would satisfy his customer's concerns, limiting their exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem of which he has been so publicly critical.\n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo is a leading cryptocurrency custody company regarded for its security, though it's notable that, after launching as a Bitcoin-only company, it would go on to add support for hundreds of crypto assets.\n\nStill, the prospect of the creation of a Bitcoin-only custodian will likely find an appeal with Swan Bitcoin's users, while Klippsten said they expect to serve company treasuries, asset managers, governments and on-ramps like Swan itself. Though in practice it remains to be seen whether there would be demand for the offering.\n\n\u201cWith the Bitcoin-specific trust company, we'll finally be able to deliver the product that marries the best of self-custody service with the components that require qualified custody. This has never been achievable before, because existing offerings focus on breadth of token support rather than the absolute best custody for Bitcoin,\" said Swan Bitcoin cofounder and CTO Yan Pritzker. \"The new trust company will offer Bitcoin-specific features such as institution-grade advanced wallet management capabilities and more ways for clients to hold their own keys, inheritance planning, and adoption of new Bitcoin standards as they emerge.\"\n\nFor instance, some of Swan's competitors in the Bitcoin-only brokerage space, such as River, already employ their own in-house custody solutions without third parties.\n\n\"For years we\u2019ve heard from major clients, partners, and other Bitcoin companies that they would prefer a Bitcoin-only software and services stack, focused on strictly the best custody leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s unique features,\" said Klippsten. \"Time has proven that altcoins come with risks on many levels. Demand will continue to grow for Bitcoin-only services that avoid many of those risks.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

FTX\u2019s bankruptcy overseers released an illuminating report this week listing about $7 billion of assets, including cash, cryptocurrencies and real estate. That includes $1.16 billion of SOL, the token behind the Solana project that Sam Bankman-Fried supported. There have been worries in the aftermath that FTX is about to dump a bunch of crypto \u2013 to cash out \u2013 spooking some investors. There is not, however, actually evidence that\u2019s about the occur, raising the question of whether any swoon in prices will be short-lived."

We do have some strong fundamentals in the space, but ultimately, what drives risk assets is liquidity. The longer that we have this tightening cycle, and if we start to see an uptick in unemployment and more stress in the banking sector, then there could be a bit more pain for risk assets like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nRelated: The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving\n\nDespite the dim macroeconomic outlook, Coutts did suggest:\n\n\u201cWe could be near the end. There is still a lot of underlying stress in the U.S. banking system and other areas of the economy. I think this is somewhat different to any other Bitcoin cycle that we\u2019ve seen, but ultimately, people will need to keep in mind that we are living in a fiat and credit-money-based money system, and inevitably, there will need to be a return to some form of easing because essentially the system cannot handle long periods of deflation. So, it is still Bitcoin, and to some degree, crypto assets that have control of their inflation schedules that will do well when things start to resume.\u201d\n\nTo hear more about Coutt\u2019s views on the macro, Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins and stablecoins, tune in to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Bitcoin's price this week is near a familiar and key support level, but its latest stop there is a little more worrying than previous ones this year, according to Wolfe Research. Earlier this week, bitcoin fell below $25,000 for the first time since March . The flagship cryptocurrency tested this threshold at various points this year, but it always rebounded. While bitcoin has been floating in the narrow range of $25,000 to $30,000 all year, investors have cheered its resilience knowing potential catalysts such as developments around bitcoin exchange-traded funds were on the horizon. That long-term momentum is starting to break, however. That means crypto investors who have been patiently waiting for better days may want to consider their positions. \"With support in this area on dual fronts, it makes sense that price would hold and consolidate in this region. However, as we look around, the crypto landscape is growing ever more concerning,\" Wolfe analyst Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"Coins are taking out crucial levels of support across the board and there's not many bright spots to be found at the moment.\" \"Longer term momentum is starting to break in bitcoin,\" he added. \"This is often one of our more reliable warning signs and part of the reason we are currently bearish on the broader market. Short term price action is never our worry, it's when longer term trends start to break, that we want to take notice and pivot accordingly.\" BTC.CM= 6M mountain Bitcoin recently fell below key support at $25,000 for the first time since March. Bitcoin's 50-day moving average began turning lower in August and recently crossed below its 200-day moving average. Although it may be losing momentum, the 200-day moving average is still ascending. The next level of support below $25,000 is at $20,000, Ginsberg said. Further, ether is testing the $1,600 threshold, which has Wolfe \"highly concerned.\" Failure to bounce from that level puts $1,500 at the next level to test on the downside, the firm said. \"As the retail investor comes under pressure and liquidity is drained, our concerns will only grow for crypto prices,\" Ginsberg added. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Nick Wells contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $26K as U.S. Inflation Is 'Not Going Anywhere Fast': Trader - CoinDesk",
        "content": "New inflation data is out. The consumer price index was up 3.7% in August on a year over year basis. That's 0.1% higher than expected. So, what does that mean? Interest rates are going to stay higher for longer? Well, let's, and what does it mean for crypto? More importantly, that's, that's why you're here. Right? Well, joining us now with some answers to that and the entire meaning of life, all of life answers. Nonetheless, it's the crypto trader. He's the author of that book, Glenn Goodman. Welcome back. Welcome back, Glenn. It's great to be here and I've brought the meaning of life with me. It's, it's just here in my pocket. So uh I'll get to that shortly, but I had, I had the meaning of uh of life in my, in my jacket pocket as well. And then uh went to dry cleaners and it's gone. So, yeah, that happens all the time to me. Uh So, all right, we have the, the CP I data uh a little bit higher than expected, it was a little bit higher than expected. Um But, but the interesting thing when I look at the markets right now is that they've been going basically initially when the data came out because naught 0.6% month on month uh for inflation was, I mean, that was actually expected, but the year on year figure ended up being slightly higher than expected. And so uh the market, the stock market fell quite, you know, quite quickly initially. But then everybody looked, you know, after the initial snap, everyone looked at the actual data where, oh, actually it's not that bad. Is it? Is it? So then prices rushed back up again. Those, that, those probably the robots doing all that, right? So it's probably no human intervention at this point. It's like that's what happens when you set your algorithms too. Precisely. Yes, and not using any kind of thought involved. So, I, I mean, this question of hire for longer, uh or at least, you know, where we are and that it will last well into 2024. Uh It, it seemed like a lot of people were hoping and praying that there would be some sort of rate cut at the end of the year. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen. I don't think, uh, we're already in September, you know, December, I last, I checked that's four months away. I, I, you know, I'm using a calendar. Um, it doesn't seem like the, the fed will, will get around to cutting. Um So does that mean that the, the risk appetite and the willingness to get into crypto will remain sort of the things stand right now. Yeah. I mean, you know, every new piece of data that comes in, particularly from, for the American economy, obviously, you know, there's always the potential for things to change as things stand. I, I think it's highly unlikely that we'll get a rate cut before the end of the year. Um, I think in the next meeting, the fed will not do anything. And November is a question mark and you know, as we can see inflation, all right, it's, it's come down a fair amount, but it's, it's not going anywhere fast at the moment. And actually, if you look at core inflation, so, you know, the the the headline inflation figure obviously was pushed up uh quite heavily by the price of gas or petrol as we call it here in the UK. So, so, you know, that went up pretty heavily and that was the main thing that was bearing down on the figure. But the core inflation figure, which obviously professionals look at um pretty closely which excludes food and it excludes energy because they're considered volatile components. Uh what you actually end up with is a figure that was a little bit worrying. And I mean, basically what, what you had was core inflation 0.3% month on month, slightly faster than expected. Uh worked out at 3.4% annualized drug prices were quite a significant factor here, actually higher drug prices. Uh Also what else? Uh, rent is still running very hot. But, um, the, the auto market continues to do quite badly and that, that helped to sort of pull prices down again. So a bit of a mixed picture, but all in all, still slightly worrying, I'd be, I'd be very surprised if we saw, um, a rate cut before the end of this year. But as I say, every new piece of data can change my outlook as well as everybody else's. Would you be surprised? No. Ok. So you're leading more, more likely a rate hike than a rate cut uh Before the end of the year, I think that the Federal Reserve are still very determined to make sure that inflation gets dead and buried. They don't want to see it come back in a big way because uh for Jerome Powell, that would be very embarrassing. And there's nothing worse for somebody, for anybody for going to dinner parties to see their friends and their friends going. You really messed up your life, didn't you? You, you, you're embarrassed to say, you know, I know from experience. That is correct. So, yeah, I mean, I think from a psychological perspective, he's, he's gonna be inclined to stay higher for longer. Glenn. Let's, let's turn to Bitcoin now and take a look at this chart that you created, that illustrated your analysis of Bitcoin's price price. We have um, April there and now September, of course, we are in September, talk to us about what we're seeing. Right. Well, what I did there, I mean, this is basically just taken from my own Twitter feed in April. I tweeted out for the first time that those particular support and resistance lines after that top line, as you can see, there have been hit by the price and then started bouncing back down. So I was like, OK, that matches up with that earlier um resistance that we saw back in the uh when was it, it was back in the previous year. So um I sort of define those resistance and support lines right there. And then as as you can see here, we are in September and the same resistance and support lines still hold, the price has just been pogo between the two of them ever since for, you know, getting on for six months now. And II I included this not to go. Oh, look at how clever I am that I, that I saw this coming in April. It wasn't that I saw it coming. Exactly. It was just that it's that I wanted to emphasize the power of technical analysis or simple technical analysis. Forget all your complicated indicators when push comes to shove what's important is to look at where the main resistance and support are. And then you can really define um where a bull market would take off for me. That would be if the price pushed up hard above that resistance line and a bear market arguably would begin if we pushed way down below that support line in between those two lines. It's short term trader territory. As you can see, they push the price up whenever it hits support, they push the price down whenever it hits resistance. It's their little game in between those two lines, longer term investors. Um really only need to take things seriously when they go outside those two lines whenever that may be. Well, does your, does your arm hurt from patting yourself on the back? I was gonna say, I thought for sure there's a little bit of a humble brag in there. No, no, no, I didn't invent technical analysis, did I, I didn't invent support lines. I'm just, I'm just following the way that, you know, the, the the greats of 100 years ago laid it down and uh I say great, I mean, you know, they were just looking at what everybody else was looking at too. They just put a name on it. Support resistance. But from time immemorial, certainly sent, people have been looking at exactly these kinds of levels. I'm just a, a humble trader in a long line of traders. All right, Glenn, I think that's the perfect note to wrap the segment up on. Thanks. Thank you for joining us and taking a look at the markets this morning. See you soon. That was the crypto trader author Glenn Goodman."

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the US$26,000 support level on Wednesday afternoon and touched a daily high of over US$26,370 on early Thursday morning.\n\nDespite reclaiming the key US$26,000 line, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has seemingly weakened on Tuesday, but is \u201cstill strong enough to hold on to most of what was reclaimed after the bounce,\u201d Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin still faces multiple technical resistances, including a \u201cdeath cross\u201d between the token\u2019s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages \u2013 which currently sit at US$27,444 and US$27,670, as well as a 100-day moving average at US$28,292 that outlines the ceiling of the range, according to Alan on Tuesday.\n\nEther also gained 0.95% to US$1,609.32 but still traded 1.64% lower in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday night.\n\nBitcoin and Ether prices briefly dipped on early Thursday morning in Asia after the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. The selling is capped at US$100 million per week, which can be extended to US$200 million.\n\nFTX\u2019s current crypto holdings include US$1.16 billion in Solana\u2019s SOL and US$560 million in Bitcoin, according to a Monday court filing.\n\nDespite the incoming FTX liquidation, crypto prices remain largely stable. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. SOL led the winners, which rose 2.70% to US$18.43 but lost 6.70% for the week.\n\nVisa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain \u201chas attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa\u2019s stablecoin settlement pilot.\u201d The global payment giant announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana\u2019s blockchain\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume dropped 21.30% to US$27.63 billion.\n\n\u201cThe recent stability could be attributed to steady CPI data, as is common amongst high-risk asset classes,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure DAO, Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it seems the crypto market may have already priced in the potential ramifications of FTX\u2019s approved sale of its substantial $3.4 billion crypto asset portfolio,\u201d added Stefanidis.\n\nU.S. annual inflation rate accelerates\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging lower.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia rose on Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all logged gains, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%.\n\nThe U.S. CPI release on Wednesday sent mixed information to the market. The inflation gauge rose 3.7% by year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022.\n\nThe accelerated CPI growth aligns with analysts\u2019 expectation, according to Reuters on Thursday. Gasoline price, which jumped 10.6% in August, accounted for over 50% of the CPI growth in the month.\n\nMeanwhile, the core CPI \u2014 which excludes the volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing here to seriously put a Fed rate hike on the table next week, but there is enough to keep the debate about the need for one more hike in 2023 alive,\u201d Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at U.S.-based investment bank Brean Capital, told Reuters.\n\nGiven the mixed CPI data, J.P.Morgan Asset Management wrote on Wednesday it expects the Federal Reserve to make no further interest rate hike in this monetary tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cDespite still rising oil prices in early September, we expect the impact of oil price spikes on CPI to be limited,\u201d J.P.Morgan\u2019s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly said in a note viewed by Reuters, who expects the annual inflation rate will fall below the Fed\u2019s long-term goal of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July. The data will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\n(Updates with equity section, comment from Stefanidis.)"

        "content": "Elon Musk said in 2021 that Tesla would accept Bitcoin payments once miners were using roughly 50% clean energy sources \u201cwith positive future trend\u201d \u2014 a benchmark that may have recently been met.\n\nIn a Sept. 14 thread on X (formerly Twitter), Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts reported the percentage of Bitcoin (BTC) mining energy coming from renewable sources had exceeded 50% with \u201cfalling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate.\u201d According to Coutts, the push toward renewable energy sources was the result of miners dispersing from China in the wake of the country\u2019s mining ban starting in 2021, as well as certain nations turning to mining to \u201cmonetize stranded and excess energy.\u201d\n\nSustainable Energy Sources Rise >50%\n\nFalling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate can only mean one thing; Bitcoin mining is consuming more sustainable energy in its mix. pic.twitter.com/AGXrKWDWuI \u2014 Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 14, 2023\n\nCountries investing in BTC mining include El Salvador \u2014 which has also recognized the cryptocurrency as legal tender since 2021 \u2014 Bhutan, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

Since establishing a sustainable energy source threshold of 50% for when the firm would resume payments, Musk acknowledged that there was a positive trend toward green energy sources but hasn\u2019t changed Tesla\u2019s policy.\n\nThe Tesla CEO did not appear to have publicly announced any move to resume BTC payments.

        "title": "These Are the 5 Wallets With the Most Bitcoin in the World - - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s popularity is hard for anyone to ignore. Although we can\u2019t predict whether Bitcoin will replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, Bitcoin is unquestionably the biggest decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) payment network. We are certain that Bitcoin will power a new financial system.\n\nSo, It would surprise you to know that the top wallets with the most Bitcoin belong to top financial institutions and organizations. While that\u2019s not exactly a problem, it births a certain curiosity as to why these guys are into BTC and whether it is significant for the crypto market. Now let\u2019s list the wallets with the most Bitcoin. This list will feature both individual and corporate owners.\n\n1) Satoshi Nakamoto (1.1 million BTCs)\n\nDespite the mystery surrounding Nakamoto\u2019s identity, it is certain that they mined around one million bitcoins between 2009 and 2010, stored in about 22,000 wallet addresses. Many people think Nakamoto purposefully pulled these bitcoins from circulation, but it\u2019s unclear who has access to this sizable BTC reserve.\n\nAll of it was never used, except for a few test transactions. Since quitting the project in 2010, Satoshi has avoided the spotlight and remained mysterious.\n\n20th richest person in the world may now be anonymous. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, could be worth $60 billion if estimates of their holdings are correct. The world is changing. pic.twitter.com/5UmJgPONcu \u2014 Documenting \u20bfitcoin \ud83d\udcc4 (@DocumentingBTC) April 2, 2021\n\nHowever, more than 100 BTCs were transferred from two abandoned Satoshi wallets a year ago. The Bitcoin wallet was dormant for over a decade, which has sparked debate in the Bitcoin community. In June 2010, both addresses received 50 BTC for mining blocks. There was basically no activity for a number of years.\n\n2) Grayscale: (643,572 BTCs)\n\nGrayscale is the biggest asset manager to continue selling shares of its crypto assets on the US stock market. The company owns about 643,572 BTC or nearly 3% of the total supply.\n\nBreaking: Arkham has identified the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s holdings on chain. It is the 2nd largest BTC entity globally, holding >$16B of BTC. Though Grayscale publicly reports balances, they have refused to identify the on-chain addresses of the trust. https://t.co/uEN4kNldpm pic.twitter.com/p9GfrthoKR \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 6, 2023\n\nGrayscale is one of the many companies that have filed for a Bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC rejected this request in 2022 due to a purported lack of surveillance competence. Grayscale sued the SEC, claiming that the latter permitted the Bitcoin Futures ETF. Grayscale secured a mini-victory against the SEC in August after a court ordered the regulator to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\n3) Binance: (498,147 BTCs)\n\nIt is only natural that Binance\u2019s cold storage wallets contain significant quantities of BTC, given that the company is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance currently has 498,197 BTC, the most in a single wallet.\n\nBinance POR: Ethereum holdings declined while Bitcoin and USDT steadied \u2014 Bradicoin (@Bradicoin10) September 11, 2023\n\nThe nature of Binance\u2019s services is a reason why it owns lots of BTC. Platforms like Binance make it easier to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Exchanges like Binance also affect the liquidity of Bitcoin.\n\n4) Bitfinex: (192, 508 BTCs )\n\nBitfinex holds about 168,010 BTC and is one of the biggest players in the Bitcoin market. Interestingly, the exchange suffered a hack in 2016 that wiped off 119,756 BTC, which at the time was valued at $66 million. The US Department of Justice recently unveiled the faces behind the attack.\n\nThere\u2019s no way those two people hacked Bitfinex. There\u2019s more to the story. \u2014 Brady Swenson (@CitizenBitcoin) February 10, 2022\n\n5) U.S. Government: (175,000 BTCs)\n\nThe United States is the country with the most bitcoins. Of course, the US did not purchase these bitcoins from an exchange. Instead, this mass wealth of BTC was seized from the Silk Road, Bitfinex, and the seizure of James Zhong\u2019s BTC. Over the years, many government agencies have confiscated Bitcoin. There\u2019s little accountability over what the government does with its stash of bitcoin.\n\nAfter seizing the Bitfinex hacked funds, the US government is now one of the largest hodlers of Bitcoin. \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) February 9, 2022\n\nThese are the top five holders: But there are others with respectable ownership of BTC:\n\nMicrostrategy: 152,800.\n\nBlock dot one: 140,000.\n\nOKX: 118,334.\n\nRobinhood: 118,300.\n\nWinklevoss: 70,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe identity and impact of Bitcoin\u2019s largest holders will continue to be hot-button issues as BTC develops and becomes widely accepted. Anyone active in the Bitcoin market, either as an investor, trader, or spectator, needs to understand these factors.\n\n\u2013 For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2013 Unlock the key to managing your crypto portfolio like a PRO!

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 September 13, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR, BlackRock BLK, Marathon Digital MARA and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO.\n\nBitcoin's Untapped Potential: Institutional Adoption\n\nThe revolutionary invention of Bitcoin came from a humble 2008 white paper by a pseudonymous person or people named Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was simple yet powerful \u2013 create a digital, decentralized, secure network resistant to a single point of failure. Through the years, Bitcoin has seen some major tests, including (but not limited to):\n\nThe 2008 Financial Crisis\n\nBitcoin went live slightly after the largest recession in more than 100 years.\n\nMt. Gox Collapse\n\nEarly in Bitcoin\u2019s existence, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world and handled around 70% of Bitcoin transactions. However, in early 2014, Mt. Gox was hacked, and the exchange lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers, equating to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFTX Bankruptcy\n\nFTX was one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, but in 2022, regulators discovered that its founder Sam Bankman Fried, allegedly mishandled customer funds. Soon after, Fried was arrested, and FTX was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBitcoin Resilience\n\nBitcoin is known for having ardent haters and religious followers. Nonetheless, despite the shockwaves these and other events sent through the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin itself has survived. Through thick and thin, Bitcoin has continued to function as a decentralized digital currency, and its price eventually recovered. Since its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s average annual return has been stunning \u2013 230% annually (well above the S&P 500 and pretty much every asset). Bitcoin is now worth $510 billion \u2013 well above most Fortune 500 companies.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: A Major Catalyst that Hasn\u2019t Come to Fruition (Yet)\n\nIf you missed the meteoric Bitcoin returns, is the juice still worth the squeeze? The answer is yes. Bitcoin has achieved stunning returns without major institutional investors being involved. Below are 3 catalysts that will send Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies even higher:\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal Clarity\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is locked in major lawsuits against crypto players. Recently, XRP altcoin parent Ripple scored a historic court win over the SEC. The court ruled that XRP is not an offer of unregistered securities. That\u2019s potentially good news for Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange that is currently entangled in a similar lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\nRecently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed corporate accounting rules \u2013 a move that will help crypto-centric companies like MicroStrategy. MSTR, one of the largest Bitcoin holders, can now alleviate undesired perceptions associated with holding Bitcoin. Furthermore, the new standards will allow banks to take custody and lend against Bitcoin \u2013 a significant win for the industry.\n\nSpot ETF Approval\n\nCurrently, no spot Bitcoin ETF exists in the United States. As the name implies, a spot ETF is a mechanism to invest in Bitcoin \u201con the spot.\u201d The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF,a non-spot Bitcoin ETF, is underperforming Bitcoin itself dramatically year-to-date.\n\nHowever, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, has applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF, along with others. With that in mind, the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF seems inevitable (out of more than 500 applications, BLK has only had one rejected in its history).\n\nSlowly, Then All at Once\n\nAfter years of failures, the Bitcoin and crypto industry is inching closer to regulatory clarity due to recent court victories, new accounting standards, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Regulatory clarity will clear the way for institutional adoption. If institutional adoption is to take place, clear winners would be Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin proxies such as Marathon Digital and Coinbase, which will benefit from increased trading from institutions and custody of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining difficulty at an all-time high, is it too late for beginners to start mining the largest cryptocurrency by market cap? The short answer is No \u2014 there are specialized services that make the whole mining process look easy.\n\nBitcoin mining is a tricky business. It requires expensive hardware equipment, cheap and stable electricity and a lot of maintenance to keep the facility in shape, like cooling systems and hardware updates.\n\nThese days, starting Bitcoin mining operations from scratch as an individual is not a good business plan. Many factors need to align perfectly, including geography, energy costs, regulation, weather and the Bitcoin (BTC) price itself. Still, the upfront costs are too high for regular people.\n\nBeginners can start mining by joining specialized mining pools. However, due diligence is needed because mining pools charge fees and split the rewards between participants. The problem with these pools is that they are centralized entities that may not always be transparent or expose participants to risks. For example, during the Crypto Winter of 2022, a mining pool operator halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to liquidity issues.\n\nBitcoin mining for beginners\n\nSome Bitcoin mining services eliminate the entry barriers for beginners. One example is GoMining, which offers various features that give Bitcoin miners more control and opportunities.\n\nBy joining GoMining, users don\u2019t have to buy and set up hardware or maintain the equipment. All processes are conducted online, while GoMining does all the behind-the-scenes work. The mining service has been around for over six years and currently has a power capacity of 350 megawatts across its nine data centers dispersed worldwide. This translates into a total hash rate of 2.1 million terahashes per second.\n\nFor more than two years, GoMining has been allowing individuals to access its mining data centers and paying out rewards, even during the crypto winter of 2022 and other bearish markets. Moreover, GoMining is a member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and has MMA legend Khabib Nurmagomedov as its ambassador.\n\nWith GoMining, users can access Bitcoin mining through a system of proprietary tokens, including:\n\nGOMINING token. This is the main utility token of the GoMining ecosystem. It enables holders to buy GoMining nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and lock them to get rewards paid in VeGoMining to participate in governance.\n\nThis is the main utility token of the GoMining ecosystem. It enables holders to buy GoMining nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and lock them to get rewards paid in to participate in governance. GoMining NFTs. The NFTs by GoMining represent ownership of the Bitcoin hash rate in its data centers, entitling holders to daily mining rewards.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nNew tokenomics ensure transparency\n\nRecently, GoMining rebranded and introduced new tokenomics to simplify access to Bitcoin mining, while its native token changed its ticker from GMT to GOMINING to avoid confusion with other projects. The latest upgrade introduced the so-called liquid Bitcoin hash rate (LBH) protocol, which borrows from liquid staking platforms in decentralized finance (DeFi), such as Lido.\n\nGoMining LBH tokens, which come in the form of NFTs, enable users to transparently and securely own hash rate. Holders of these tokens have to pay for electricity while receiving mining revenues, so they end up in a better financial position than traditional miners. On top of that, these LBH tokens can be used in DeFi for borrowing and lending purposes or trading on secondary markets.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nWith the new tokenomics model, LBH token holders can pay for electricity with GOMINING and benefit from a 10% discount. Also, the model uses a burn and mint mechanism, in which all tokens used to pay for the electricity expenses are burned algorithmically, while the system redistributes minted tokens for community rewards and to service providers, VeTokenomics stakers and the GoMining team.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nThe new tokenomics brings more transparency while ensuring the NFTs are directly linked to the data centers.\n\nNew products, data centers and exchange listings on the horizon\n\nGoMining is expanding its network and plans to introduce new features and products to make the Bitcoin mining process more exciting. By the end of this year, it plans to add 50-megawatt data centers in the MENA region and increase the total hash rate to 3,000,000 terahashes per second. To top it all off, GoMining is also working on a Web3 game and planning to list on top exchanges.\n\nGoMining CEO Mark Zalan said:\n\n\u201cOur objectives encompass broadening the company\u2019s global network through the construction of additional data centers across the world. Simultaneously, we are delving into technologies such as DeFi and other advancements in the blockchain sphere.\u201d\n\nNot all mining software is designed with beginners in mind, but projects like GoMining with easy-to-use and quick-start mining features are changing that, allowing almost anyone to participate in Bitcoin mining without installing complex hardware.\n\nLearn more about GoMining"

        "title": "11 Bitcoin blockchain metrics TradFi organizations should watch - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Many who aren\u2019t crypto industry insiders may view \u201cBitcoin\u201d and \u201ccrypto\u201d as basically synonymous. While members of the traditional finance industry know that there\u2019s much more to crypto than Bitcoin, they also know that Bitcoin\u2019s performance and health serve as a bellwether for the acceptance and growth of the overall crypto industry.\n\nMonitoring select blockchain metrics can help financial institutions and investors gauge market sentiment, predict changes in values and identify investment risks and opportunities not only in terms of Bitcoin, but also the larger crypto industry. Below, 11 members of Cointelegraph Innovation Circle detail Bitcoin blockchain metrics TradFi organizations would be wise to watch.\n\nRealized cap\n\nRealized cap is an on-chain metric that shows the total sum of profits and losses from all on-chain sales and purchases. An increasing realized cap would mean new investors are buying and selling Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) for higher prices. This also means that the net sum of trades is in profits, and therefore, people are now bullish on Bitcoin. \u2013 Abhishek Singh, Acknoledger\n\nHalving\n\nBitcoin halving should be considered by financial institutions because it can influence Bitcoin\u2019s price through altered supply dynamics, potentially impacting miner profitability and network security. Halving can indicate broader mainstream adoption trends, present speculative opportunities and serve as a focal point for educational and marketing initiatives within the finance sector. \u2013 Irina Litchfield, Lumeria\n\nHash rate\n\nAs financial institutions explore cryptocurrencies, they should focus on a key Bitcoin blockchain measure: the hash rate. The hash rate measures the network\u2019s strength and security by gauging its computational power. Keeping an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate helps financial institutions assess the stability of the network and any investment risks linked to cryptocurrencies. \u2013 Vinita Rathi, Systango\n\nGrowth in the number of wallets with large holdings\n\nIn addition to the often-discussed \u201chalving\u201d of Bitcoin, financial institutions should also pay heed to the growth in the number of wallets holding large amounts of BTC. A wallet with a small amount of BTC could probably be assumed to be a retail investor, while wallets holding large amounts could potentially be \u201cwhales\u201d or institutional holders. \u2013 Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\n\nNumber of solutions leveraging Bitcoin security\n\nI think it\u2019s useful to look at how many solutions are leveraging Bitcoin security through timestamping \u2014 or even better, merged mining \u2014 because all of that value will be leveraged and, thus, fed back into Bitcoin. For example Syscoin, Namecoin and Dogecoin merge mine and add value to ancillary chains. Many overlook the external value being built by leveraging Bitcoin security. \u2013 Jagdeep Sidhu, Syscoin Foundation\n\nDeFi velocity\n\nDeFi velocity (DFY) is a valuable metric for Web3 investors. In addition to total value locked, DFY also factors in volume to shed light on the user engagement and capital efficiency of a specific crypto market. Overall, this metric can help institutions differentiate between stagnant capital and healthy economic activity. \u2013 Wolfgang R\u00fcckerl, ENT Technologies AG\n\nTransaction volume\n\nBitcoin transaction volume is a key blockchain metric for financial institutions monitoring crypto adoption and market activity. It refers to the specific number of transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain within a specific timeframe. Financial institutions may find this metric essential as they explore crypto, as it shows trends, user engagement, risk and more. \u2013 Anthony Georgiades, Pastel Network\n\nBitcoin distribution\n\nMonitoring the distribution of Bitcoin helps show macro trends in market sentiment. For example, analyzing the circulating supply of Bitcoin held by BTC \u201cwhales\u201d (those who own more than 1,000 BTC) versus that held by BTC \u201cshrimp\u201d (those who own fewer than 1 BTC) helps financial institutions gauge risk exposure and the behavior of different investor groups to predict price stability and potential volatility. \u2013 Sheraz Ahmed, STORM Partners\n\nMiner revenue from transaction fees\n\nEver-increasing energy costs and future halving events are presenting compounding challenges for Bitcoin miners. However, the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens is positioning miner revenue from transaction fees to become a new key vector to consider when calculating network health. As Bitcoin diversifies to accommodate a service economy, there\u2019s no telling what novel applications could arise. \u2013 Oleksandr Lutskevych, CEX.IO\n\nNumber of unique wallet addresses\n\nThere is a direct correlation between market sentiment and the number of unique wallet addresses, and financial institutions can use this metric to infer Bitcoin\u2019s strength. As Bitcoin becomes stronger as a store of value and the Lightning Network slowly and steadily begins handling micro payments, the growth of unique wallet addresses will become a strong predictor of market sentiment. \u2013 Tiago Ser\u00f4dio, Partisia Blockchain\n\nBitcoin days destroyed\n\nFinancial institutions should measure Bitcoin days destroyed (BDD), which is the number of days since BTC was last moved multiplied by the amount exchanged. It reveals high-volume, low-value economic activities. BDD increases when long-term BTC holders sell \u2014 often before major market changes. \u2013 Arvin Khamseh, SOLDOUT NFTs\n\nThis article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

        "title": "Bitcoin at $25K: Discount or disaster? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman delves into Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) latest bounce at $25,000, which some analysts and influencers argue represents a short-term buying opportunity. Pechman explains that Bitcoin\u2019s inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index has only held for 40% of the previous 20 months, meaning it is likely not a good metric to anticipate price movements.\n\nThe show then shifts focus to a recent Glassnode report revealing that the amount of BTC changing hands is at its lowest since October 2020, citing investors\u2019 \u201capathy\u201d and \u201cexhaustion.\u201d Pechman argues that bulls got tired after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s relentless action to pursue Coinbase and Binance. Ultimately, Pechman disagrees that Bitcoin\u2019s recent movement to $25,000 presents an opportunity for buyers, given that the short-term risk-reward ratio near the current price level is around 50:50.\n\nFor the show\u2019s next segment, Pechman analyzes the prediction made by Davis Hui, vice president of Bitcoin miner Canaan, that BTC will hit $100,000 in 2024 based on the halving and a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. First, Pechman explains that BlackRock\u2019s $10 trillion in assets is merely a mirage, as 55% is stuck in fixed-income investments and $2.8 trillion is already invested in other ETFs such as commodities, the S&P 500 index, global emerging markets and alternative investments.\n\nFurthermore, Pechman raises the risk of current holders deciding to flip their positions previously bought at $60,000, $50,000 or even $40,000 if Bitcoin\u2019s price were to shoot up, meaning the offer side is never predictable regardless of miners\u2019 incentives. Lastly, Pechman explains that a spot Bitcoin ETF has been a dream for the past eight years, and nothing has changed to refute the SEC\u2019s reasons for dismissal, namely stablecoin trading volumes and unregulated offshore exchanges.\n\nCheck out the latest episode of The Market Report, available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Does Your Portfolio Need a Boost? How One Asset Could Be Exactly What Investors are Looking For. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that Bitcoin (BTC -1.40%) is one of the most volatile assets. For this reason and possibly others, most investors shy away from giving the world's most valuable cryptocurrency a spot in their portfolios.\n\nHowever, as time marches on and Bitcoin continues to prove its worth in an increasingly digital world, there's mounting evidence that owning even just a little Bitcoin might be one of the best ways for investors to boost their portfolios over the long term.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nIn an August study, crypto asset manager Bitwise Investments analyzed how varying degrees of Bitcoin allocation would affect a traditional 60/40 portfolio -- and the results were astounding. The composition of the research was fairly straightforward. In the hypothetical portfolio, 60% was invested in equities in the form of the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT -0.35%) and the remaining 40% was designated for bonds using the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND -0.49%).\n\nBitwise also chose to focus on Bitcoin's performance from January 2013 to June 2023 since Bitcoin's price ascension from 2010 to 2013 was more than 1,500,000%. This is unlikely to happen again and would likely skew results. Lastly, to capture how varying degrees of allocation affected portfolio performance, Bitwise analyzed Bitcoin based on it making up 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of a portfolio.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Over the 10-year time frame that the study analyzed, the traditional 60/40 portfolio without any Bitcoin allocation returned a healthy 64%. But when adding just 1% of Bitcoin, performance jumped to 78%. At 2.5% of Bitcoin, the portfolio more than doubled to 101%, and bumping exposure to 5% resulted in an astounding 144% increase.\n\nStriking a balance\n\nThese results alone are intriguing and highlight the value Bitcoin presents for investors looking to adequately diversify while also increasing performance. But Bitwise took the analysis a step further. Adding to its evaluation of performance based on varying allocations, Bitwise also considered the impact rebalancing the portfolio over particular time frames would have.\n\nAfter applying rebalancing strategies on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis to each of the designated allocations, Bitwise found that the quarterly rebalancing produced the best returns while minimizing volatility.\n\nTo combine the results of allocation levels and rebalancing strategies, Bitwise discovered that the ideal amount of Bitcoin exposure would be at 5%, with a quarterly rebalancing. This strategy struck the perfect balance of maximizing performance while limiting volatility as overall risk significantly increased over the 5% level.\n\nThe Bitcoin effect\n\nIn an effort to capture the overall potential Bitcoin exposure provides to portfolios, regardless of the level of allocation, Bitwise compiled additional data from its analyses to highlight the misconceptions around Bitcoin's volatility and performance.\n\nAcross all scenarios of allocation and rebalancing, results proved that \"positive contribution from a bitcoin allocation does not come at the price of greater volatility.\" In fact, the study found that Bitcoin provided a boost to all portfolios' Sharpe ratios, which measures risk-adjusted return and performance.\n\nPerhaps the most important discovery from the analyses was Bitcoin's usefulness over longer time spans. Bitcoin would have contributed positively to a diversified portfolio's returns in 70% of one-year periods, 94% of two-year periods, and 100% of three-year periods since 2014, assuming quarterly rebalancing.\n\nThe multiple benefits Bitcoin produced, even at a 1% allocation, highlights its ability to favorably impact portfolios over the long term. Admittedly, higher levels of allocation for those with shorter time horizons and lower risk tolerances might not be recommended. For investors with a goal of holding for three years or longer, however, few other assets can provide positive benefits without introducing additional risk."

        "title": "Paxos confirms it's responsible for paying a $500K Bitcoin transaction fee - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The account that overpaid $500,000 in fees on Sept. 10 for a Bitcoin transfer belonged to Paxos, according to a Sept. 13 statement from the company. Paxos claimed that end users have not been affected and all user funds are safe. Paxos is most well-known as the issuer of stablecoins, including PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Pax Dollar (USDP), but also runs a crypto brokerage firm that carries Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe statement comes after users on X (formerly Twitter) were speculating that PayPal may have been responsible for the transaction due to a related wallet account that had been identified by analytics platform OXT as belonging to PayPal. A Paxos representative told Cointelegraph that PayPal was not responsible, as the error was its own, stating:\n\n\u201cPaxos overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, 2023. This only impacted Paxos corporate operations. Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe. This was due to a bug on a single transfer and it has been fixed. Paxos is in contact with the miner to recoup the funds.\u201d\n\nThe mistaken transaction was first discovered on Sept. 10, shortly after it had occurred. According to blockchain data, the sender paid fees of approximately 20 BTC (over $515,000 worth at the time) to send just 0.07 BTC (worth less than $2,000 at the time). At the time, Casa wallet co-founder Jameson Lopp declared that the sending account \u201clooks like an exchange or payment processor with buggy software,\u201d as it had made over 60,000 transactions from the same address.\n\nThe block that contained the transaction was confirmed by Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool. On Sept. 10, the pool\u2019s management offered to return the funds to whoever sent the transaction if a claim was made within three days. Otherwise, the exorbitant fee would be paid out to the pool\u2019s hashing power contributors.\n\nBefore Paxos made its statement, Bitcoin enthusiast Mononaut declared on X that PayPal was responsible for the transaction.\n\nBREAKING\n\nThe fat fingers belong to PayPal https://t.co/pKN0w5SfKB \u2014 mononaut (@mononautical) September 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Mononaut, the sending account, bc1qr35hws365juz5rtlsjtvmulu97957kqvr3zpw3, had exhibited behavior that \u201cclosely matches the behavior of a now inactive wallet [bc1qhs3gptkxem5y7yaq2yg0un2m8hae6wt87gkx4n].\u201d This inactive address was labeled \u201cPaypal\u201d by blockchain analytics platform OXT.\n\nTo add further evidence for their hypothesis, Mononaut pointed out that this old wallet address transferred its funds to the new address through an intermediate account. Bitcoin blockchain data shows that the old address labeled \u201cPaypal\u201d by OXT transferred approximately 18.5 BTC to address bc1qlm0xlahpysq2v9yh5rhcc430xjz3xknqqnyvaf on June 19. That account then sent \u200earound 5.37 BTC to the new address that later made the mistaken transaction. Lopp shared the thread, wondering aloud if PayPal would request the funds back.\n\nRelated: Coinbase to integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network: CEO Brian Armstrong\n\nPaxos later issued its statement confirming that the mistake had been its own, not PayPal\u2019s.\n\nPaxos isn\u2019t the first crypto user or company to potentially pay thousands of dollars in fees because of a mistake. In 2019, one Ethereum user lost over $300,000 when they mistakenly pasted values into the wrong fields. Luckily for them, the mining pool agreed to return 50% of the funds lost. In 2020, another Ethereum user mistakenly paid $9,500 for a $120 trade. The user claimed that the mistake had \u201cdestroyed [their] life.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, Paxos claimed that it had contacted the mining company that confirmed the transaction and is attempting to recover the lost funds."

        "content": "The European Central Bank announced its 10th straight rate hike just minutes ago, lifting interest rates by a quarter. I believe that this is a record. What does this mean? Are we gonna see some, uh are we gonna see the stop now that we hit the 10th rate hike? So, ok, look, I I if you follow crypto markets, the European interest rates alone might not mean anything because most crypto is priced in, let's be honest, tether us DT which is a US dollar derivative if we can call it that. Um But what it does indicate is the potential or at least an excuse for the, for the federal reserve to potentially raise rates again. I mean, will they do it in September? The, the, the upcoming meeting, the odds are or at least the way the markets are predicting now, it's not gonna happen this meeting, but at the very least we've seen a couple of data points over the past day. Yes, it, today, in fact, we saw the PP I uh the wholesale index, it's up a lot higher than expected. Uh Y yesterday we saw the CP I number come in hotter than expected a little bit hotter than expected. But nonetheless, it tells us that inflation isn't under control the way perhaps the fed wants it to be and what that means is. Ok. Well, this idea that the fed will cut rates and make it easier for people to borrow money and leverage and do all those things to trade crypto and take on that risk. That might not happen right away. That's gonna be further out into the future if at all. So we might have a little bit more time where the FED is trying to keep the, the, the market led the liquidity if you will or, or the the amount of money in the in the sloshing around the market, uh trying to keep it down to lower inflation. Uh lots of other ways they can do it, by the way, besides raising rates, of course, is to sell off some of its portfolio. We haven't, you know, we've seen some movements in that obviously uh over, you know, planned movements uh for, for the past several months, be curious to see actually going forward if that then becomes a tool of the FED. I don't know yet. It doesn't seem like that anybody's been talking about that. But when it has trillions of dollars on the balance sheet, it also offers an opportunity for the Fed to take, take some other measures besides just raising rates to uh to dampen inflation."

That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean trading is free. The company says it takes a spread of up to 1% on crypto trades.\n\nStill, that\u2019s relatively good compared with other crypto services reviewed by NerdWallet. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange focused solely on crypto, often charges a fee of $2.99 on simple transactions, which would exceed 1% on small purchases.\n\nOther crypto services can have significantly higher fees, with some upward of 10% depending on how you pay.\n\nFunding and minimums\n\nFunding a Fidelity Crypto account could be easy if you already have a brokerage or cash management account with the company. You\u2019ll be able to move money from Fidelity accounts into Fidelity Crypto.\n\nThere\u2019s no minimum deposit to open a crypto trading account. And the minimum crypto purchase is $1, Fidelity says. These factors put the company on even footing with most other leading exchanges.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Fidelity account, making purchases will require you to create and fund an account such as a brokerage or cash management account.\n\nWhy you might want to use another exchange\n\nAvailability\n\nFidelity Crypto is initially available 35 states. If you can\u2019t access the service in your state, you\u2019ll have to go with another option.\n\nCrypto selection\n\nFidelity Crypto\u2019s offerings are on the low end among cryptocurrency platforms reviewed by NerdWallet. Granted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, which means they are widely used and relatively well-established in this emerging sector.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency traders often look at more options when they are buying and selling. Crypto.com, another major cryptocurrency exchange, has more than 300 cryptocurrencies for sale. Other brokerages also have more crypto options. SoFi, for example, has about 20.\n\nIt may turn out that Fidelity follows the path of other brokerages, such as Robinhood, which started with limited crypto offerings, then expanded over time.\n\nFunctionality\n\nFidelity Crypto does not offer some of the advanced features available on competing exchanges. It doesn't allow staking, a process that allows owners of some cryptocurrencies to earn rewards similar to interest.\n\nAnd unlike some other crypto exchanges, Fidelity Crypto does not offer round-the-clock crypto transactions, with trading limited to 4 a.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nFinally, the company says it does not allow customers to transfer cryptocurrency out of their accounts or to external crypto wallets.\n\nTransfers are crucial if you want to do anything with cryptocurrency other than hold it in hopes that it will increase in value. You won\u2019t be able to use crypto purchased through Fidelity on decentralized finance products, for instance.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet.

        "title": "Why Are These 3 Bitcoin Mining Stocks Surging Today? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nInvestors in a range of cryptocurrency mining stocks are winning big today. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, CleanSpark (CLSK -8.77%), Bit Digital (BTBT -4.00%), Bitfarms (BITF -3.40%), and TeraWulf (WULF -6.03%) investors have seen gains of 7.8%, 7.2%, 4.5%, and 1.8%, respectively, from yesterday's close. Interestingly, each of these companies has given up some of their gains from their intraday highs.\n\nThese moves appear to be driven by a resurgence in Bitcoin prices today. The price of Bitcoin, the most important factor in terms of revenue generation and profitability for these crypto miners, is up 1.8% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing. Additionally, it appears many crypto miners remain bullish on the outlook for Bitcoin prices over time, with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 being the key catalyst some in the sector are looking to for growth.\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin prices have traded within a relatively narrow range in recent months, and today's rather significant swing to the upside has been somewhat of an outlier. That said, any sort of significant surge in Bitcoin prices often leads to even greater moves higher in Bitcoin miners, due to the leverage these companies provide to the underlying price of Bitcoin. A 2% surge in Bitcoin often leads to 4% to 8% moves in Bitcoin miners, as these companies benefit disproportionately from higher Bitcoin prices (revenue is denominated in Bitcoin, while debt is mostly denominated in dollars).\n\nFurthermore, budding interest in the upcoming Bitcoin halving event has certainly generated outsize attention for crypto miners. We're now months away from this halving event, in which Bitcoin mining rewards will be halved per block produced. While that shouldn't be a good thing for crypto miners (and probably won't be for the sector as a whole), it does mean that a race is on for market share right now. Investors appear to believe that CleanSpark, Bit Digital, and Bitfarms may be the way to play this sector long-term, judging by these stocks' price movements of late.\n\nNow what\n\nMany investors may continue to view Bitcoin miners as tools or vehicles to gain even greater exposure to the price of Bitcoin. As such, it appears the market is taking an increasingly bullish view on where the price of Bitcoin could be headed (which makes sense, given its upcoming halving).\n\nThat said, it's also true that when Bitcoin declines, these crypto miners often see outsize losses.\n\nI think it's going to be increasingly difficult for investors to pick the winners and losers in the race for Bitcoin mining market share. Thus, this is a sector that may be too volatile for most, and it may simply make more sense to own Bitcoin (for those who are bullish). That said, given the moves many of these Bitcoin-related stocks make on a daily basis, this is certainly a sector to watch, particularly for those looking to trade or invest based on momentum."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFranklin Templeton, a global investment firm, has entered the competitive ring for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company has detailed its plan for a Bitcoin ETF, where Coinbase will serve as the custodian. The ETF will be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Pricing will rely on the CME's CF Bitcoin Reference Rate\u2013New York Variant.This development comes after the SEC's postponement of decisions on spot ETF applications from several other prominent firms, including WisdomTree, Valkyrie, Fidelity, VanEck, Bitwise, and Invesco. Additionally, an important court ruling on August 29 mandated that the SEC consider Grayscale's request to transform its Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETF into a spot ETF.Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF application acknowledges the regulatory uncertainties surrounding digital assets in the US. It points out that adverse legislative or regulatory changes could significantly impact the value of Bitcoin and related products. Such developments could include measures such as banning or restricting Bitcoins, mining activities, digital wallets, and services related to Bitcoin trading and custody. The company has also shown increasing interest in digital assets, exploring funds blending blockchain technologies with tokenised treasury bonds. With approximately $1.5 trillion in assets under its management, Franklin Templeton's entry into the crypto market adds to the growing institutional interest in digital assets. However, other financial heavyweights, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity, have already advanced in the regulatory process with their ETF proposals. The SEC is scheduled to review these applications in mid-October. However, historical delays in the regulatory process suggest a final decision may come around March 2024.Franklin Templeton's entry into the Bitcoin ETF race adds to the growing momentum toward greater crypto adoption in traditional finance. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US remains desirable, with investors eagerly awaiting regulatory decisions in the coming months."

        "title": "Build Asset Management Debuts Bitcoin-Backed Private Credit Fund in Partnership with Unchained - Business Wire",
        "content": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Build Asset Management (\u201cBuild\u201d), an investment manager focused on income and risk mitigation in public and private credit markets, announces the launch of the Build Secured Income Fund I in partnership with Unchained. The Fund is one of the first direct lending private credit funds that invests in over-collateralized consumer and business loans that are backed by bitcoin. The Fund, which began raising capital in June, seeks to offer a compelling yield profile designed to support the income needs of accredited investors and institutions while simultaneously giving borrowers in the emerging bitcoin economy access to dollar capital.\n\n\u201cSince its invention in 2008, the Bitcoin protocol has seen steady growth and adoption across the world, and we see real potential in bitcoin serving as a widely-adopted store of value and as quality collateral,\u201d says John Ruth, co-founder and CEO of Build. \u201cWe envision this fund\u2019s debut as laying pivotal groundwork for seamlessly weaving bitcoin into the economic fabric of our society while using our expertise to provide investors with a unique and differentiated income solution. Such solutions are critical in today\u2019s complex interest rate and inflation environment.\u201d\n\nBuild believes bitcoin\u2019s properties make it an exceptional form of collateral entirely unique in the credit space, specifically:\n\n\u25cf Potential for improved liquidity over traditional collateral: Because bitcoin is traded 24/7 in a highly liquid market, the collateral can be liquidated in a matter of minutes in the event of a loan default, unlike real estate or other commonly collateralized assets.\n\n\u25cf Multi-signature collaborative custody and no rehypothecation: Bitcoin's protocol ensures distinctive custody solutions that prevent rehypothecation (the use of pledged collateral assets by banks or brokers for their own purposes) by storing the bitcoin that backs each loan in visible and transparent multi-signature addresses. With keys distributed among the borrower, loan originator and a third-party agent, this setup not only prevents single points of failure but also permits transparency for the borrower and immediate access to the collateral for the lender.\n\n\u25cf Fixed supply of a scarce, fungible asset: Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, enforced by a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin to be issued ever, along with a halving of new supply every four years, may increase the attractiveness of using the asset as collateral over time.\n\n\u201cWe founded Build to deliver solutions that improve investor outcomes in an era of disruption that probably won\u2019t mirror the investment landscape of the last 40 years,\u201d says Matt Dines, CFA, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Build. \u201cWe believe the unique properties of bitcoin are only just starting to be broadly understood, and we are motivated to lead the way by providing our clients new tools like this to help achieve the investment outcomes they desire.\u201d\n\nUnchained, a leader in financial services for bitcoin holders, is the originating agent and servicer of the loans purchased by the Fund. With collaborative three-party custody, 24/7 liquidity, and the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, Unchained\u2019s lending operation has experienced no dollar losses since its inception in 2017. These properties make the Fund a unique and potentially appealing option for accredited investors seeking yield with a reduced risk profile when compared to private credit funds backed by other assets as collateral.\n\nFor bitcoin holders, Unchained provides a way for borrowers to access US dollar capital without the need to sell their bitcoin, which often creates a significant tax event. The typical profile of loans held in the fund are interest-only, largely between $25,000 and $100,000, with an average loan-to-value ratio of 40%. The over-collateralization coupled with a strict margin call process may help manage the risk of Bitcoin price volatility and may protect against loss of principal for investors in the fund.\n\nThe private fund is accepting new investors now as a continuous offering. Investors must qualify as accredited investors or qualified purchasers before they can enter the fund.

Protecting Your Personal Information\n\nBitcoin mining has gained significant attention in recent years as a way to earn cryptocurrencies and potentially make real money.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand the process and the potential risks involved.\n\nIn this article, we will explore what bitcoin mining is, how it works, and the importance of protecting your personal information throughout the process.\n\nBy the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin mining and the steps you can take to safeguard your data.\n\nAlso read: Crypto: 6 of 25 ETFs are non-Bitcoin, Ethereum-centric.\n\nBitcoin cryptocurrencies and graph statistic background\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and added to the blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAdditionally, it involves solving complex math problems through a process called \u201cproof of work.\u201d\n\nMiners compete to solve these math problems, and the first miner to find the correct solution is rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nAlso read: Franklin Templeton Files for the Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Process of Bitcoin Mining\n\nTo better grasp how Bitcoin mining works, let\u2019s break down the process into a few key steps:\n\nTransaction Verification: When someone initiates a Bitcoin transaction, it needs to be verified by miners. Miners ensure that the transaction is valid and complies with the blockchain rules. Competing to Solve Math Problems: Miners use powerful computers to compete and solve math problems. These math problems require significant computing power and electricity. Adding Transactions to the Blockchain: Once a miner successfully solves a math problem, they add the verified transactions to the blockchain. This process ensures the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. Rewards for Miners: Miners are rewarded with newly created bitcoins for their efforts in solving math problems and adding transactions to the blockchain. This serves as an incentive for miners to continue the mining process.\n\nThe risks of mining\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nWhile bitcoin mining can be a legitimate way to earn cryptocurrencies, there are risks associated with the process.\n\nOne of the most significant risks involves the protection of personal information.\n\nFurthermore, hackers and scammers often target Bitcoin miners and mining enthusiasts to gain access to their personal data.\n\nIs Bitcoin mining legit with the threat of malware?\n\nOne common method used by hackers is the distribution of malware. Malware is malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to computers and steal sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, hackers can install Bitcoin mining malware on unsuspecting users\u2019 computers, allowing them to use the resources of those computers for their mining operations.\n\nProtecting your personal information\n\nTo protect your personal information while engaging in Bitcoin mining, it is crucial to follow these essential steps:\n\nStay vigilant: Be cautious of suspicious emails, websites, or applications related to Bitcoin mining. Hackers often use phishing techniques to trick users into revealing their personal information. Keep an eye out for any signs of scams or malicious activities. Use Reliable Security Software: Install a reliable security solution with built-in protection against malware, phishing attempts, and online fraud. This will help detect and block any potential threats to your personal information. Be Mindful of Passwords: Create strong and unique passwords for your mining accounts and ensure that you never share them with anyone. Consider using a password manager to securely store your passwords. Secure Your Network: Ensure that your home network is secure by using strong encryption, such as WPA2, and regularly updating your Wi-Fi router\u2019s firmware. This will help prevent unauthorized access to your mining activities and personal information. Regularly Update Software: Keep your mining software and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches. Updates often include important security fixes that can protect against known vulnerabilities. Encrypt Your Data: Consider encrypting your mining data and personal files using encryption software. Encryption adds an extra layer of protection, making it more challenging for hackers to access your sensitive information. Use Two-Factor Authentication: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a unique code sent to your mobile device, in addition to your password. Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices for protecting your personal information. Educating yourself will help you make informed decisions and avoid falling victim to scams or malware attacks.\n\nSource: Wazirx\n\nConclusion: Is Bitcoin Mining Legit?\n\nIn conclusion, are you still wondering, \u201cIs Bitcoin Mining Legit?\u201d\n\nTo some, yes. Bitcoin mining can be a legitimate way to earn cryptocurrencies, but it is essential to understand the risks involved. Protecting your personal information should be a top priority throughout the mining process.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this article and staying vigilant, you can help safeguard your data and enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin mining without falling victim to scams or hackers.\n\nRemember, knowledge and proactive measures are your best defense in the world of Bitcoin mining.

        "title": "Greenidge Generation continues to mine Bitcoin, profit while it violates NY climate law - Gothamist",
        "content": "More than a year has passed since the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation rejected the air permit application of Greenidge Generation, a Finger Lakes power plant that fuels a Bitcoin-mining operation by burning natural gas.\n\nAccording to publicly available documents, the cryptomining company is on pace for its most lucrative year to date as its appeal undergoes an administrative review with the state. The company is also operating with a water permit that expired last year.\n\nLocal community members and advocacy groups have pushed for Greenidge\u2019s closure ever since 2018 when its air permit was up for a customary five-year renewal. In June 2022, the DEC rejected the renewal application on the grounds that the company had violated the Community Leadership and Climate Protection Act, or CLCPA \u2014 the state\u2019s signature climate law that requires all industries and sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by the end of this decade. Cryptocurrency mining consumes large amounts of energy due to the large computer farms needed to solve the complex algorithms that release new coins.\n\nThe DEC\u2019s assessment at the time was that Greenidge had no evidence of any plans to significantly reduce its actual emissions.\n\nA month later, the company\u2019s water permit came under jeopardy. The DEC cited the facility for operating without fish screens on its 7-foot-diameter intake pipes, which suck in nearly 140 million gallons of water from Seneca Lake each day at a maximum rate of 68,000 gallons per minute. Doing so can be deadly for fish and other aquatic life that gets sucked in, and fish screens are an inexpensive and standard practice at power plants, according to Edwin Cowen, a civil engineering professor at Cornell University. In January, the screens were installed after more than five years of operation without them.\n\nGreenidge is appealing the air permit decision with an administrative law judge at the DEC\u2019s Office of Hearings and Mediation Services, as part of the agency\u2019s standard process for enforcement. This judge is an \u201can impartial person designated by the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation who independently evaluates the evidence,\u201d according to the DEC.\n\nIn the meantime, the company has amassed a total of 1,368 Bitcoins for the first half of this year \u2013 a 16% increase over the same period last year. That amount of Bitcoin would be valued around $35 million as of Tuesday. Adding in its other Securities and Exchange Commission filings during its first three years of operation, the company has produced 7,111 Bitcoins currently valued at $186 million since the mining operation started in 2020.\n\nGreenidge did not respond to a request for comment from Gothamist.\n\nWithout a strict timeline for proceedings, environmental groups fear that upstate cryptominers could continue to operate and pollute for years as a result of multiple appeals even if the administrative law judge upholds the DEC\u2019s permit denial.\n\nThis loophole could be attractive for other cryptomining operations looking to acquire defunct fossil fuel plants upstate."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin dominance tends to influence altcoins, with its pump or slump impacting altcoins differently.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows BTC\u2019s correlation with Litecoin is stronger than with Ethereum, while Dollar-pegged USDT tails the list.\n\nA lower correlation is excellent for diversification, offering trading opportunities despite broader market lull where BTC remains range-bound.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is nurturing an uptrend, and with it, several altcoins are moving north. This effect, where the price action of BTC is mirrored or reflected in the price action of another asset, is called correlation. It is often influenced by several factors, including market conditions, investor sentiment, and regulatory developments.\n\nOutside crypto, BTC has a correlation with different assets in the financial playing field, including the US Dollar (USD) and Gold. This explains the narrative, \u201cBitcoin is trading like a tech stock\u201d alongside its often acute inverse relationship with the United States dollar. Read more on this here.\n\nThe correlation with TradFi assets, however, tends to show less consistency compared to crypto. Specifically, while Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the USD or Gold may change from time to time, it remains rather fixed for most of crypto.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Is BTC ready for a pullback or is it a fake out?\n\nBitcoin correlation with cryptocurrencies\n\nOn-chain analytics and market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has a Bitcoin Correlation Matrix, which shows the lead crypto\u2019s correlation with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s Matrix, BTC has a correlation score of 0.95 with Litecoin (LTC). This is relatively high since the highest possible is 1.00. A correlation of 1.00 means the two cryptos 100% reflect each other\u2019s price changes.\n\nThe lowest correlation possible is -1.00, which means the two variables, or in this case, cryptocurrencies, actually exhibit a 100% negative correlation or move in the exact opposite direction to each other.\n\nA result of 0 means there is no relationship whatsoever between the two variables. BTC also has a high 0.94 correlation to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBitcoin correlation matrix\n\nSmart investors tend to spread their risk by investing in different cryptocurrencies, as opposed to putting all their money in one basket. This is called \u2018portfolio diversification\u2019. It prevents investors from losing all their money in one go.\n\nIn order to achieve portfolio diversification, it is advised not to invest in highly correlated assets, because a slump affecting one will affect them all, leading to greater losses.\n\nFor investors with large holdings of Bitcoin, therefore, it would be unwise to accumulate too much ETH or LTC. The high correlation with Litecoin is not surprising, in fact, given the altcoin is itself the product of a BTC fork.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart, LTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHow correlation affects portfolio diversification\n\nAccording to portfolio diversification theory investors should steer away from owning too many assets that share a correlation close to 1.0, Assets with a correlation that is as low as -1.0 (perfectly negatively correlated), however, yield maximum risk reduction and should be sought.\n\nCorrelation vs. Risk scale\n\nIt is not possible to find a crypto that is perfectly negatively correlated to Bitcoin. Even stablecoins, which are the least correlated, are nevertheless not negatively correlated to BTC either. The leading one, Tether (USDT), shows a 0.01 correlation. This low correlation explains why USDT tends to get attention when BTC volatility peaks.\n\nBTC correlation with USDT\n\nTraders use USDT to respond to the volatility of Bitcoin. When BTC price goes bearish, they sell, and because they do not want to leave the crypto market entirely, they convert their assets to USDT, before awaiting a market improvement. During such instances, it is possible to note high volumes of USDT move from exchange wallets to private wallets.\n\nWhen markets start improving, the reverse happens, with experienced traders starting to move USDT to exchange wallets in readiness to buy BTC at discounted rates."

        "content": "A total of 11 BTC spot ETF filings were awaiting SEC approval at press time.\n\nBTC and BCH trended as the news of the most recent ETF filing hit.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] spot ETFs have garnered significant attention due to a growing number of institutions applying for this service. Although the SEC\u2019s approval process has been moving slowly, the recent favorable ruling obtained by Grayscale could inspire more ETF applications, as evidenced by the emergence of a new participant in the market.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin sees a flurry of ETF filings\n\nRecently, there has been a surge in filings for Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s filing on 15 June triggered a wave of new submissions.\n\nBlackRock sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as the crypto custodian and spot market data provider and BNY Mellon as the cash custodian. On 15 July, the SEC formally accepted BlackRock\u2019s application for review.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, WisdomTree, a New York-based asset manager, filed on 19 July. It\u2019s worth noting that WisdomTree had previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. on 8 December 2021, but it was rejected by the SEC in 2022.\n\nSimilarly, asset management firm Valkyrie initially filed a spot Bitcoin ETF application in January 2021, which was rejected. However, they refiled their application on 21 June.\n\nJuly witnessed a flurry of filings, with VanEck, Fidelity/Wise Origin, and Invesco Galaxy submitting their applications to the SEC. Ark Invest was among the earliest institutions to file for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAdditionally, Frank Templeton recently joined the BTC ETF race. This latest filing has generated considerable excitement in the market.\n\nOn 11 September, Franklin Templeton entered the competitive arena by filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. This move made them the most recent traditional asset management company to enter this crowded space.\n\nIn their submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Franklin Templeton outlined their proposal for an ETF custodied by Coinbase, designed to be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. However, they have yet to put forth a specific ticker symbol for this product.\n\nBitcoin trends as news of another filing hits\n\nThe Templeton application generated a considerable buzz, as noted in a post by Santiment. This post, which tracked the social trends in cryptocurrencies, revealed that the excitement extended beyond just Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash [BCH], a fork of Bitcoin, also garnered significant attention, surpassing BTC in its trending status. The historical trend data also indicated that BCH consistently trended alongside BTC whenever news related to ETF filings emerged.\n\n? #FranklinTempleton has filed for a spot #Bitcoin #ETF, and there is an uptick in crowd optimism. $BTC and its best known fork, $BCH, are the top two trending assets in #crypto. #BitcoinCash, in particular, has benefited from previous ETF announcements. https://t.co/UeSwx9dO3k pic.twitter.com/6DMuPvPG5b \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nHow BTC and BCH reacted to the news\n\nThe daily timeframe chart of Bitcoin Cash revealed a notable development on 12 September. The chart indicated that BCH experienced a substantial price surge, surging by more than 7% to reach a closing price of $198.5.\n\nAs of this writing, BCH continued to trade with a modest increase of over 1%, hovering around the $201 mark.\n\nFurthermore, this price increase had a noticeable effect on its Relative Strength Index (RSI). As of this writing, the RSI had risen above the neutral line, indicating an uptrend in BCH\u2019s price momentum.\n\nOn 12 September, Bitcoin also experienced an uptrend according to its daily timeframe chart, although the price increase was relatively modest compared to BCH. The chart indicated that BTC\u2019s price gained over 2%, closing trading at slightly above $25,800.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nAt press time, it was trading at approximately $26,000, reflecting a further increase of over 1%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that unlike Bitcoin Cash, this uptrend did not pull Bitcoin out of its bearish trend. The RSI indicated it was still trending below the neutral line at press time, suggesting ongoing bearish sentiment in the market."

The dollar index was trading at 104.67 with a slightly negative bias.In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by 0.57% while ETH is down by 2.28% during this period, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX on the Crypto Market said. \"The Exponential Moving Average for 10-day EMA indicates 'Buy' in BTC at $25,858 and 200-day EMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,005. Meanwhile, 10-day SMA indicates 'Buy' at $25,817 and 200-day SMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,655,\" Menon said.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder of Mudrex attributes the price surge in Bitcoin above $25,900 to renewed interest in the Bitcoin Spot ETF race. He said that Franklin Templeton, a major player in the asset management industry, has submitted an application to the US SEC, which could have caused this positive market sentiment. \"Notably, the number of wallets holding 0.1 BTC reached an all-time high of 12 million recently, which suggests growing trust among investors in Bitcoin. Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to trade around the $1600 mark,\" Patel said.Among the top gainers, MKR rose 125%, followed by OMG with a 35% increase, ZIL with 26%, REEF with 10% and BTG with an 8% gain, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin informed while highlighting biggest losers as ENS which is down 69%, WAVES down 64%, COTI down 38%, GNS down 28% and REP down 26%.On the strategy front, Vishwanath said, \"Bitcoin technical analysis reveals strong bullish trend. Primary technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average of Convergence (MACD) indicate a favorable buying zone. Additionally, the 50-day exponential moving average supports a continued bullish trajectory as long as Bitcoin remains above $25,600. A decline below this level could test the support at $25,400 and the critical $24,950 level. Conversely, a break above the $26,500 resistance may target the $27,000 and $27,500 levels\".(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Use TensorFlow to predict Bitcoin prices - InfoWorld",
        "content": "TensorFlow is the most popular machine learning platform and the Node version, TensorFlow.js, makes it easy to use in a JavaScript application. In this article, we\u2019ll combine two of the most interesting technologies of the day: cryptocurrency and AI. We\u2019ll train a neural network to make a price prediction based on a set of historical Bitcoin prices, then check it against the actual price of Bitcoins during a given date range.\n\nStart the project\n\nYou\u2019ll need Node/NPM installed to start. Then you can create a new directory and run npm init , and accept the defaults. Next, install TensorFlow by entering npm i tensorflow/tfjs . That's the only dependency you need for this demo.\n\nThe application consists of three files:\n\npredict.js to handle the command-line interaction.\n\nto handle the command-line interaction. fetchPriceData.js to get the price data.\n\nto get the price data. > trainAndPredict.js to make predictions.\n\npredict.js is typical Node.js for handling command-line arguments. There are some niceties added for cleaning up the arguments, which we won't bother with here. The basic idea is that the user runs predict.js and passes in three arguments:\n\nThe token symbol (like Bitcoin, Solana, and so on)\n\nThe end date\n\nThe number of days to go back\n\nIf you don\u2019t provide anything, the program defaults to Bitcoin, ending today, going back 90 days.\n\nSet up the prediction\n\nWe\u2019re using the CoinGecko API, which is particular about how it returns historical data. If the time range covers more than 90 days, it\u2019ll automatically use a daily interval instead of hourly. Our code will handle either, but by default, we\u2019ll use three months of hourly data, ending today. (CoinGecko wants the timestamps in seconds, not milliseconds, so that explains the odd juggling of 1000s in calculating start and end dates.)\n\nThe predict.js file is shown in Listing 1.\n\nListing 1. predict.js\n\nconst fetchPriceData = require('./fetchPriceData'); const trainAndPredict = require('./trainAndPredict.js'); const [tokenSymbol] = process.argv.slice(2); // Set default if argument not provided const defaultTokenSymbol = 'bitcoin'; // CoinGecko likes timestamps in seconds, not ms const endDate = new Date(Date.now()) / 1000; const startDate = new Date((endDate * 1000) - 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Use default values if arguments are not present const finalTokenSymbol = tokenSymbol || defaultTokenSymbol; async function main(){ try { const { timePrices, predictTime, actualPrice } = await fetchPriceData(finalTokenSymbol, startDate, endDate); const results = await trainAndPredict(timePrices, predictTime); console.log(`Prediction for ${new Date(predictTime)}: ${results} `); console.log(`Actual: ${actualPrice}`); } catch (error) { console.error('Error:', error); } } main();\n\nThis code won\u2019t run until we create the two modules for it to import. predict.js uses those modules, fetchPriceData and trainAndPredict , to get the price data and run the AI. The fetchPriceData module returns three things:\n\nAn array of timestamps and prices\n\nA timestamp used to predict the price of Bitcoins\n\nThe actual price at that time\n\nWe\u2019ll use the actual price to compare the AI's prediction to what really happened.\n\nGet the price data\n\nTo get our price data, we use the CoinGecko API to define the fetchPriceData module, as shown in Listing 2.\n\nListing 2. fetchPriceData.js\n\nasync function fetchPriceData(tokenSymbol, fromTimestamp, toTimestamp) { try { const url = `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/${tokenSymbol}/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=${fromTimestamp}&to=${toTimestamp}`; console.info(\"Getting price data from: \" + url); const response = await fetch(url); const data = await response.json(); console.info(`Got ${data.prices.length} data points`); if (data && data.prices) { const lastElement = data.prices.pop(); const pricesButLast = data.prices.slice(0, data.prices.length - 1); return { timePrices: pricesButLast, predictTime: lastElement[0], actualPrice: lastElement[1] }; } else { console.log('No price data available.'); return { timePrices: [], predictTime: null, actualPrice: null }; } } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message); return { timePrices: [], predictTime: null, actualPrice: null }; } } module.exports = fetchPriceData;\n\nThe CoinGecko API is found at api.coingecko.com/api/ . We'll use the market_chart/range endpoint, which lets you define a date range and token ID. The vs_currency parameter specifies what flat currency to use as the scale (in our case, it\u2019s hardcoded to usd ). You can find more information about the CoinGecko API by reading its documentation and introduction. It\u2019s a full-featured API and you can use most of it without an API key.\n\nWe interpolate the arguments sent over from predict.js into the endpoint URL, like so:\n\nhttps://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/${tokenSymbol}/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=${fromTimestamp}&to=${toTimestamp}\n\nIf you actually plug in some data here, you can open the URL in a browser and get a look at the format; for example, try plugging in:\n\nhttps://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=1684013673.171&to=1691789673.171\n\nNote that the times are in Unix timestamp format.\n\nWe use this URL with the Fetch API, which was integrated into Node in version 14. Then, we navigate the JSON structure to get the actual price list at data.prices . This holds two-dimensional arrays with [timestamp, price] as the structure.\n\nTrain and predict\n\nNext, we do a bit of manipulation that might seem strange, but the idea is to take the last time/price couplet and remove it from the end of the data set. We do this so the AI model can train on the rest of it, and then we can give the model the last timestamp, get a prediction, and compare it to the real price.\n\nOnce we have that, we return an object with three fields holding our data:\n\n{ timePrices: pricesButLast, predictTime: lastElement[0], actualPrice: lastElement[1] }\n\nBack in predict.js , we receive this data and we're ready to call trainAndPredict . It takes the time/price data and a timestamp and returns a value, which is the prediction. Listing 3 has the code for the trainAndPredict module.\n\nListing 3. trainAndPredict\n\nasync function trainAndPredict(timeAndPriceData, newTimestamp) { // Extract timestamps and prices from the data const timestamps = timeAndPriceData.map(([timestamp, price]) => timestamp); const prices = timeAndPriceData.map(([timestamp, price]) => price); // Normalize and scale the data const minTimestamp = Math.min(...timestamps); const maxTimestamp = Math.max(...timestamps); const minPrice = Math.min(...prices); const maxPrice = Math.max(...prices); const normalizedTimestamps = timestamps.map(ts => (ts - minTimestamp) / (maxTimestamp - minTimestamp)); const normalizedPrices = prices.map(price => (price - minPrice) / (maxPrice - minPrice)); // Convert data to TensorFlow tensors const X = tf.tensor1d(normalizedTimestamps); const y = tf.tensor1d(normalizedPrices); // Create a simple linear regression model const model = tf.sequential(); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); // Compile the model model.compile({ optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError' }); // Train the model await model.fit(X, y, { epochs: 100 }); // Normalize the new timestamp for prediction const normalizedNewTimestamp = (newTimestamp - minTimestamp) / (maxTimestamp - minTimestamp); // Predict the normalized price for the new timestamp const normalizedPredictedPrice = model.predict(tf.tensor1d([normalizedNewTimestamp])); // Scale the predicted price back to the original range const predictedPrice = normalizedPredictedPrice.mul(maxPrice - minPrice).add(minPrice); return predictedPrice.dataSync()[0]; } module.exports = trainAndPredict;\n\nListing 3 is where we start to get into the machine learning code. From here forward, it\u2019s helpful to understand basic machine learning concepts.\n\nTraining the model\n\nWe begin by extracting the two data elements, time and price, into separate variables. We then normalize them. Preprocessing data with normalization is common in neural networks. Essentially, we are making sure that both data sets are close to each other in spread. Specifically, we compress the values of both to the range of 0 to 1. This ensures the gradient descent algorithm, which finds the smallest error, works more efficiently and helps it avoid being trapped in local minima.\n\nThe normalization operation for both values consists of finding the maximum and minimum values, subtracting the minimum from the actual value, then dividing by the maximum minus the minimum.\n\nNext, we use the data to create tensors, the basic building block in TensorFlow. Tensors are like vectors on steroids, with n-dimensions. They support complex operations for interactions between the dimensions. TensorFlow lets you model the data as tensors, and then use that data to train your model against. You can learn more about the practical use of tensors in TensorFlow by reading the TensorFlow guide.\n\nIn our case, we only need tame tensors: a couple of one-dimensional vectors for the times and prices. We get these by calling tensor1d() .\n\nWe then create and add layers to the neural network. We use a simple \u201csequential\u201d network, with each layer in a column, and add them with model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })) . Each of these is a layer of neurons in the network. The \u201c dense \u201d designation means that each neuron connects to all the other neurons in the next layer. These are very basic layers, and there is a huge amount of configuration that you can use in TensorFlow, like how many layers, how many neurons, the type of layer (dense, convolution, Long Short-Term Memory, etc.), the activation function, and so on. You can also define custom networks and neuron properties.\n\nNext, we compile the model with the optimizer set to \u201c sgd \u201d (stochastic gradient descent) and the mean square error loss function. Again, this is all open for configuration to help improve the model performance.\n\nRunning the predictor\n\nNow, we are ready to actually run the training with await model.fit(X, y, { epochs: 100 }) , where epochs is the number of cycles to run the data through the network. (Too many epochs can lead to overfitting on the training data.)\n\nFinally, we can make a prediction using the timestamp (which we also normalize), with this call: model.predict(tf.tensor1d([normalizedNewTimestamp])) . To get back to a price, we denormalize the prediction. This is normal JavaScript math, except for the .mul() method, which is part of TensorFlow's support for tensor operations; in this case, element-wise multiplication. In our case, we only have a single predicted value, not an array, so it just performs normal multiplication.\n\nIf we run this code, we'll see something like what's shown in Listing 4.\n\nListing 4. Running the predictor\n\n$ node predict Prediction for Fri Aug 11 2023 21:00:01 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time): 30595.5546875 Actual: 29380.31012784574 $ node predict solana Prediction for Fri Aug 11 2023 22:00:54 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time): 24.18000602722168 Actual: 24.5108586331892\n\nHow did we do?\n\nIn the first case, we get a Bitcoin prediction and in the second, a Solana prediction. Both use the last 90 days of hourly data.\n\nIn both cases, the prediction is in the ballpark, but not terribly accurate. Why is that? The answer is, because there is no real relationship between the timestamps and the prices. That was a very naive and silly approach to predicting Bitcoin prices.\n\nNevertheless, it gave us a good look at all the fundamental components of using TensorFlow with a cryptocurrency API feed. From here, a whole world of possibilities open up.\n\nYou can find the full project code for this demo in my GitHub repo."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBucking the conventional wisdom about Bitcoin\u2019s relationship with interest rates, popular macro-analyst Arthur Hayes published a blog post arguing that such traditional economic logic will crumble under the U.S. government\u2019s exorbitant amount of debt.\n\n\u201cCentral banks and governments are flailing about trying to use the economic theories of yesteryear to combat the novel situations of the present,\u201d Hayes wrote on Monday.\n\nSince last year, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark rate from 0.25% to 5.25% in an attempt to bring inflation back down to 2%. Though its efforts have proven successful so far, Hayes thinks inflation may prove \u201csticky\u201d going forward, as nominal GDP growth exceeds government bond yields.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Hayes\u2019 estimates\u2014based on data from the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast\u2014nominal Q3 GDP growth remains at a \u201cmind-bogglingly massive\u201d 9.4%, whereas the 2-year US Treasury yield is only 5%.\n\n\u201cConventional economics says, as the Fed raised rates, growth in a very credit-sensitive economy would falter,\u201d Hayes wrote. This proved true for financial asset markets like stocks and Bitcoin, which cratered in 2022 and washed away capital gains tax receipts for the government, he said.\n\nYet lower tax revenue also meant higher government deficits, which must be funded by selling more bonds to repay old debt. For the U.S. government, that means more interest payments to the nation\u2019s wealthy bondholders\u2014which are exacerbated by the higher yield on such bonds in a high-rate environment.\n\n\u201cTo sum up: when rates rise, the government increases interest payments to the rich, the rich spend more on services, and GDP pumps even more,\u201d Hayes explained.\n\nSo long as the economy continues to expand at a faster rate than the government will pay out through its debt, Hayes believes bondholders may seek yield in more rewarding \u201crisk assets\u201d like Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a similar essay last month, Hayes argued that Bitcoin would win in the face of a tightening Fed, whose methods may inadvertently increase the money supply.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed believes that to kill inflation it must both raise interest rates and reduce the size of its balance sheet, then it is cutting its nose to spite its face,\u201d he wrote at the time.\n\nAnalysts generally view lower rates as good for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as cheap money leaves room for investors to speculate for potentially higher returns. In June, Coinbase analysts published a report arguing that Bitcoin\u2019s 4-year cycles may be attributable to low-rate central bank policy.\n\nHayes still doesn\u2019t discount the positive impact of low rates on Bitcoin\u2019s price, describing the asset\u2019s connection to central bank policy as a \u201cpositive convex relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings become non-linear\u2014and sometimes binary\u2014at the extremes,\u201d Hayes concluded. \u201cThe U.S. and the global economy is at such an extreme.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Blackrock Wants High Bitcoin (BTC) Price, SEC\u2013Ripple Lawsuit Cost Ripple (XRP) 3 years of Adoption, an - The Economic Times",
        "content": "In this article, we will explore the reasons why Blackrock is aiming for a higher Bitcoin (BTC) price, how the SEC-Ripple lawsuit has cost Ripple (XRP) three years of adoption, and finally how Tradecurve Markets has experienced a boom in growth over the past few months. Let's look at each of these topics in more detail.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nTradecurve Markets (TCRV)\u2019s Stellar Surge: 150% and Rising\n\nAs Tradecurve Markets transitions into its fifth phase, the token price climbed to $0.025, with more than 35 million being acquired in just one week.\n\nSo, what's fueling this excitement? At its core, Tradecurve Markets is an avant-garde trading platform envisioned to meld the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. By seamlessly integrating the prime features from both trading environments, Tradecurve Markets resonates with a diverse spectrum of traders.\n\nA standout aspect of Tradecurve Markets is its versatile trading palette, enabling transactions across a diverse set of assets. Be it cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or corporate stocks, traders can consolidate and oversee their investments on a singular platform.\n\nYet, the real USP of Tradecurve Markets is the removal of cumbersome KYC/AML formalities, empowering traders to embark on their journey with minimal hassle. All it takes is an email registration and an initial cryptocurrency deposit for traders to get started.\n\nGiven these innovative features, it's clear why market analysts are earmarking Tradecurve Markets as a formidable contender against the likes of established giants such as Binance and Kraken. With the road ahead looking bright, there's a palpable sentiment that TCRV's value might soar well beyond the $1.00 mark in due course.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) ETFs and the Market's Jitters\n\nBitcoin has recently slumped from $31,800 to under $26,000 after delays to Bitcoin ETF approvals. Market participants are now commenting that Blackrock wants a lower Bitcoin price before they enter the market.\n\nThe perception that a depressed Bitcoin price would allow BlackRock to rake in higher profits upon the ETF launch may seem logical at first glance. However, diving deeper into the mechanics and implications makes the idea less straightforward.\n\nBlackRock, an esteemed global financial institution, has always prioritized market stability and the trust of its investors. Deliberately benefiting from a significant dip in Bitcoin's value could risk the broader reputation and acceptance of the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps a watchful eye on any signs of market manipulation while ensuring robust investor protection. Any suggestion that BlackRock might be involved in manipulating Bitcoin's price would not only tarnish its reputation but could also derail its attempts to secure regulatory green lights for its ETFs.\n\nRecent price action suggests that Bitcoin buyers were overly bullish on the initial ETF news by leveraging margin positions. The subsequent lack of bullish updates caused the price to dip under support, where a long squeeze began.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nRipple (XRP)'s Legal Quagmire: Setbacks and Surges\n\nIn a recent statement on X (previously known as Twitter), renowned attorney John Deaton lamented the significant opportunity cost the SEC\u2013Ripple lawsuit had on Ripple (XRP).\n\nThe legal battle has cost Ripple three years of adoption, technology development, and establishing relationships with global partners. Other crypto projects have taken this time to make significant progress in their respective areas, leaving XRP far behind them.\n\nHighlighting the peculiar nature of the lawsuit, Deaton also referenced MoneyGram's association with Ripple. MoneyGram, a global leader in payment processing, had no backlash from the SEC regarding a decision to leverage Ripple.\n\nYet, despite adherence to due diligence and transparency by Ripple's partners, the SEC opted to initiate a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, ushering in an era of uncertainty and setbacks for XRP in the U.S. market.\n\nPrice-wise, the news that Ripple won the SEC case sent the token soaring by over 100% in a single day. However, that full move has fully retraced and Ripple is back trading under the $0.55 support/resistance.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV):\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nhttps://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "\"Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the unique capabilities of each company and supporting the innovators that will be at the forefront of pushing Bitcoin adoption.\" Post this\n\nBitGo and Swan Bitcoin today announced plans to create the first Bitcoin-only trust company, pending regulatory approval. The new joint venture will combine BitGo's best-in-class Bitcoin cold storage technology and regulatory compliance expertise with Swan's industry-leading capabilities in onboarding, fraud prevention, AML/KYC, and dedicated Bitcoin experts.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe said, \"We believe the best model for the Bitcoin industry is the same battle-tested model that has been part of the US financial industry for over a century: the separation of exchange and custody.

Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the unique capabilities of each company and supporting the innovators that will be at the forefront of pushing Bitcoin adoption.\"\n\n\"We immediately saw the vision,\" said Cory Klippsten, Swan's CEO. \"For years, we've heard from major clients, partners, and other Bitcoin companies that they would prefer a Bitcoin-only software and services stack that is focused strictly on the best custody that leverages Bitcoin's unique features. It's important to us to build a custodian without the risks of securing many altcoins within the same trust company as Bitcoin. We want to do our part to build a dedicated ecosystem for Bitcoin, separate from industry speculators, to allow for innovation in custodial offerings.\"\n\nBoth BitGo and Swan are thriving in the longest-ever Bitcoin bear market. BitGo recently closed a $100 million fundraising round at a $1.75 billion valuation. Swan has already seen significant revenue growth in 2023 and projects another 50% increase by year-end to more than $75 million annualized.\n\nSwan is committed to addressing the complex issue of custody, which it considers the most challenging issue for Bitcoin holders. In addition to the new partnership with BitGo, Swan acquired Specter Solutions in 2022 and will unveil Swan Vault, a retail-facing multisig custody solution, in October.\n\nTo learn more follow @Swan and @BitGo.\n\nAbout BitGo:\n\nBitGo provides the most secure and scalable wallet solutions for the digital asset economy, offering regulated custody, staking and trading, and core infrastructure to investors and builders alike.\n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo pioneered the multi-signature wallet and is the first digital asset company to focus exclusively on serving institutional clients.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid widespread international expansion from crypto companies, Canadian Bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin announced a commercial foray into Costa Rica this week. The company became the first Bitcoin enterprise to tap into SINPE Movil, the country\u2019s primary payment provider, offering a Bitcoin on-and-off-ramp.\n\nAided by a Bitcoin circular economy project dubbed the Bitcoin Jungle, users will be able to buy and sell BTC with the country\u2019s national currency (col\u00f3n) through the project\u2019s digital wallet. To swap col\u00f3nes into BTC or vice versa, Costa Ricans and tourists can download the Bitcoin Jungle wallet, create a username, and select the SINPE Movil option.\n\nSINPE Movil, the Spanish acronym for National System for Electronic Payments, is run and operated by the Costa Rican Central Bank and uses a similar model to the Kenyan M-Pesa. Users are allowed to send and receive money via mobile phone numbers, instantaneously.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to local media outlets, more than 60% of the country uses the service, with the system transacting the equivalent of 17% of the country\u2019s GDP at one point. The service is not a dedicated app, but instead operates as an interbank settlement service, much like Zelle in the United States or Interac in Canada.\n\n\u201cSINPE Movil integration is a game changer,\u201d said Francis Pouliot, founder and CEO of Bull Bitcoin, \u201cbecause everyone in Costa Rica uses it.\u201d\n\nHe told Decrypt that \u201cit's simple and transactions are instant,\u201d and described it as an \u201calmost magical experience\u201d due to the ability to send money \u201cfrom anywhere in the world to a Costa Rican's phone number within seconds, at very low cost.\u201d\n\nBull Bitcoin is the first and only exchange in Costa Rica to allow Bitcoin <-> Colones conversion using the national fiat mobile payment system, allowing instant low-cost access for millions of Costa Ricans and an off-ramp for tourists and businesses \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\udc02https://t.co/pcdW3YdVyz \u2014 FRANCIS \u2623\ufe0f BULLBITCOIN.COM (@francispouliot_) September 12, 2023\n\nAccording to Pouliot, a Canadian national who has lived in Costa Rica for three years, the country is \u201cfairly banked\u201d thanks to SINPE Movil.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Lee Salminen, the founder of Bitcoin Jungle\u2014Bull Bitcoin\u2019s local partner\u2014the partnership allows the company key insight into Latin America.\n\n\u201cBeing on the ground in Costa Rica provides a unique opportunity to experiment in real-time,\u201d he told Decrypt, \u201cwith ground-level insight into its impact and adoption.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Jungle has been paving the way for a Bitcoin circular economy in what\u2019s known as Costa Rica\u2019s Golden Triangle. Comprising five communities\u2014Dominical, Uvita, Ojochal, Platanillo, and Tinamaste\u2014it aims to replicate what Bitcoin Beach has done in El Salvador.\n\nPouliot concluded that the integration into SINPE Movil \u201csolves the biggest obstacle for Bitcoin adoption in Costa Rica\u2014the absence of infrastructure that lets businesses and individuals move money from the Bitcoin network into the traditional financial system.\u201d"

        "content": "A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Karnataka Police Tuesday carried out searches at the homes of three persons linked to an alleged hacking and Bitcoin bribery scam that occurred during the tenure of the erstwhile BJP government in the state.\n\nThe SIT raids were conducted at the home of hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 28, and his associates Sunish Hegde, 33, and Prasidh Shetty, 27, in connection with the reinvestigation by the CID of multiple cases of hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges, poker sites, online purchase of drugs with cryptocurrency, and the hacking of a government portal to steal Rs 11.5 crore.\n\nA senior CID official said searches were carried out Tuesday by the SIT at locations linked to three main accused in the Bitcoin scam cases from 2019 to 2021, which were ordered to be further investigated by a CID SIT constituted by the Congress government after it came to power in the state in May this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe alleged Bitcoin scam cases involving hacker Sriki and his associates have been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress alleging that top leaders of the state BJP and police officials received kickbacks in cryptocurrency after the arrest of the hacker and his associates in 2020 by the Bengaluru police.\n\n\u201cEarlier when the BJP was in power a Bitcoin scam running into lakhs of rupees is reported to have occurred through virtual transfers with several people involved in the transactions and that the issue was hushed up without proper investigations,\u201d Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said while announcing further investigations in the hacking cases.\n\nIn November 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bengaluru police stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoin by Srikrishna following his arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the darknet using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe investigations in the drug case led to the CCB filing cases against the hacker and his associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe arrest of the hacker in November 2020 in the drug case by the CCB also revealed his \u2018role\u2019 in a July 2019 hacking of the state e-procurement cell in which Rs 11.5 crore was stolen. Sriki told the police after his arrest that he was involved in stealing cryptocurrency from international sites including virtual crypto exchanges like the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nWhile Rs 1.43 crore of the Rs 11.5 crore stolen from the e-procurement cell has been recovered by the Enforcement Directorate, there has been no other major recovery of funds or cryptocurrency that was allegedly stolen by the gang from crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SIT searches Tuesday were carried out even as a police officer involved in the original investigation against the hacker gang approached the Karnataka High Court to quash a recent FIR filed by the SIT against unnamed officers of the Bengaluru CCB.\n\nThe police officer, Sridhar Poojar, who was the investigating officer in one of the original hacking cases filed in 2020 against Srikrishna and his associates, has sought the quashing of an FIR filed last month by the CID against CCB officials for allegedly tampering with electronic evidence collected when Srikrishna alias Sriki and his associates were arrested in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildren of several politicians cutting across party lines in Karnataka are known to have been associated with Srikrishna. According to court records, Srikrishna was often housed in five-star hotels by his affluent associates to carry out his hacking activities.\n\n\u201cThere is information about the involvement of influential politicians of Karnataka in the drugs & Bitcoin scam. It is concerning that the investigating officers are trying to close the case to help those politicians,\u201d the then opposition leader Siddaramaiah, who is now the chief minister, said on social media in October 2021 in an apparent reference to hacker Sriki and his associates."

        "content": "The Karnataka High Court has asked a special investigation team (SIT) probing a Bitcoin scam during the previous BJP government\u2019s tenure not to take precipitative action against a police officer in a case registered over alleged tampering of electronic evidence seized at the start of the case in 2020.\n\nThe police officer, Sridhar Poojar, was the investigating officer in the 2020 case against hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 28, and his associates. Poojar has sought the quashing of an FIR filed last month by the CID against unnamed Bengaluru police officials for allegedly tampering with electronic evidence seized from Sriki and his associates.\n\nThe high court on September 12 asked SIT officials not to take any \u201caction in the absence of any incriminating material against the petitioner\u201d till October 9 when the case is listed for hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CID had filed an FIR on August 8, 2023, for alleged tampering of evidence against officials of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) unit of the Bengaluru police that had investigated Sriki between 2020 and 2022. An officer of the rank of a deputy superintendent of police, K Ravishankar, who is a part of the Bitcoin scam probe SIT, filed a case of destruction of documents and cheating against unnamed officers of its sister unit, the CCB, in connection with the alleged manipulation of electronic devices seized from Sriki and his associates.\n\nThe CID has quoted a digital forensics report dated February 20, 2023, to state that two pen drives seized from the accused on November 9, 2020, at the time of the first batch of arrests had been manipulated in police custody, and that a MacBook and a hard disk seized on November 17, 2020, were found to have been tampered between November 18 and 20. A second MacBook seized on November 19, 2020, was allegedly tampered with between November 20 and 21.\n\nThe electronic and computer devices were tampered with at the premises of the CCB office in Bengaluru between November 9 and December 12, 2020, the CID has alleged in its complaint against the CCB to the Bengaluru police.\n\nPoojar has denied the allegations in his petition.\n\nThe alleged Bitcoin scam case involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress alleging that top leaders of the state BJP and police officials received kickbacks in cryptocurrency after the arrest of the accused in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 30 this year, the Karnataka police functioning under the new Congress government ordered the creation of the SIT to probe the Bitcoin scam.\n\nIn statements given to the police, Sriki has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations, I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki, which is a part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against the hacker in 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, the Central Crime Branch of the Bengaluru police had stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoin by the hacker Srikrishna following his arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the darknet using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe investigations in the drug case led to the CCB filing cases against Sriki and his associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSriki\u2019s arrest also revealed his role in a July 2019 hacking of the state e-procurement cell where Rs 11.5 crore was stolen. Sriki told the police that he was involved in stealing cryptocurrency from international sites, including virtual crypto exchanges like the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nWhile Rs 1.43 crore of the Rs 11.5 crore stolen from the e-procurement cell has been recovered by the Enforcement Directorate, there has been no other major recovery of stolen funds or cryptocurrency that was allegedly stolen by the gang from crypto exchanges."

        "content": "SINGAPORE - With stools spilling out of its shopfront and a queue of patients flowing out the door, Zenith Medical Clinic in Punggol looks like any other clinic in the heartland.\n\nBut there is one key difference \u2013 patients at this clinic can choose to pay their doctor using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe doctors who run the clinic, brothers Paul Ang and David Ang, made the unconventional decision to accept cryptocurrencies four years ago, after they developed an interest in these digital tokens.\n\nOne perk of accepting payments in this form is that the clinic does not have to pay fees to use these services, said Dr Paul Ang, 36, pointing out that credit card companies can charge more than 2 per cent in fees on each transaction.\n\n\u201cThese are all predatory taxes imposed on businesses, which are extra costs that will be passed on to consumers ultimately,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clinic accepts digital currencies Bitcoin and Ether, and payment is made by scanning a QR code.\n\nInstead of cash, patients who use cryptocurrency pay an equivalent value in cryptocurrency, depending on the digital token\u2019s current market value, said Dr Paul Ang.\n\nHe said \u201cvery, very few people\u201d have paid in cryptocurrency so far. He estimates that the number is less than 0.1 per cent of the patients they see. Those who do so are mostly foreigners between 30 and 40 years old.\n\nHe puts that down to the belief among crypto investors that the value of digital currencies will appreciate.\n\n\u201cIf people think that the price will keep increasing, why would they spend it? But when cryptocurrency prices are high, people might be more willing to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are no official statistics on the number of medical practices in Singapore that accept cryptocurrency, but Dr Paul Ang estimates there are fewer than 10 clinics here that do so.\n\nHe first became interested in cryptocurrency about six years ago, after reading books that reinforced his belief in the value of digital tokens as a form of currency that is more independent of the control of banks and governments than cash.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that cryptocurrencies can be volatile and it can be risky holding on to large amounts of these digital tokens, he points out that there are risks in investing in property and stocks too.\n\n\u201cI believe that what goes up will come down, and what goes down will come up. It\u2019s just the law of nature,\u201d said Dr Paul Ang.\n\n\u201cEvery (investment) has a risk; if you cannot accept that kind of mindset, leave the money in a bank. If you cannot take the risk, you won\u2019t be able to make money.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a small rollercoaster ride in recent days, trading above and below the $26,000 threshold several times. This uninspiring performance highlighted the challenges BTC is facing to make a significant breakthrough after dropping more than 10% in the past month.\n\nHowever, one prognosis forecasts a rebound in BTC\u2019s price in the coming weeks, indicating potential signs of much-needed optimism.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin is projected to reach $28,435 by October 13, 2023, signaling that the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency could witness a surge of nearly 9% from its current price, according to September 13 data displayed by the price prediction algorithm at the crypto analytics platform CoinCodex.\n\nCoinCodex\u2019s 1-month BTC price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nBTC price projections\n\nApart from a 30-day projection, the platform offered interesting price estimates for several other timeframes. For instance, CoinCodex anticipates Bitcoin to reach a new high of $31,139 by September 30, implying a potential short-term upside of around 20%. On the other hand, as of October 31, 2023, the cryptocurrency could slip back to $27,205, which is still 4% higher than its current price.\n\nCoinCodex\u2019s 3-month prediction chart. Source: CoinCodex\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was changing hands at $26,151, up 0.32% on the day.\n\nThe maiden crypto asset rose around 0.8% over the past 5 days while losing more than 10.8% on the monthly chart, erasing over $65 billion off its market cap.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart.

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency industry matures, more people are jumping on the bandwagon, including multi-billionaires such as Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who has recently shared that he only had investments in Bitcoin (BTC), business intelligence platform MicroStrategy, several Bitcoin mining companies, oil enterprises, and gold miners.\n\nSpecifically, the Mexican billionaire and founder of the Grupo Salinas corporate conglomerate of several Mexican companies opened up about his investment portfolio and interest in Bitcoin, giving the most credit to Saifedean Ammous and his book \u2018The Bitcoin Standard,\u2019 in a podcast interview with Natalie Brunell streamed on September 7.\n\nOn \u2018The Bitcoin Standard\u2019\n\nAccording to Salinas\u2019s detailed account, Ammous\u2019s book gave him a good introduction and clear breakdown of money, as well as the advantages of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset over traditional finance, including the lack of room for manipulation or any kind of abuse by the authorities or financial institutions. As he explained:\n\n\u201cI have to give credit to my friend Saifedean Ammous because of his book, \u2018The Bitcoin Standard.\u2019 He really spelled it out. What he did was put together in one small book all the things about Bitcoin, the history of money, how it evolved, and how it\u2019s been abused by the government, and now how this thing cannot be abused, it\u2019s a Bible.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder, Ammous\u2019s book provides an in-depth analysis of the historical context that has facilitated the birth and rise of Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional money, as well as its economic, social, and political effects, and Salinas has been a fan for a while, even recommending it on his social media channels, next to Sun Tzu\u2019s \u2018The Art of War\u2019 and Ayn Rand\u2019s \u2018La rebeli\u00f3n de Atlas\u2019 (eng. \u2018Atlas Shrugged\u2019):\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous \u2014 Don Ricardo Salinas Pliego (@RicardoBSalinas) August 15, 2021\n\nMeanwhile, Salinas\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency was at press time changing hands at the price of $25,936, recording a 0.57% increase in the last 24 hours and gaining 0.74% across the previous seven days while still recording losses of 11.79% on its monthly chart, as per the data retrieved on September 13.\n\nWatch the entire video below:\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
