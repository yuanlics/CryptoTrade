        "title": "What Backs Bitcoin? - Yahoo Sports",
        "content": "20The argument that Bitcoin (BTC) has no value because it isn't backed by anything physical remains one of its major misconceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s a view that\u2019s been perpetuated by the likes of billionaire tycoon Warren Buffett and former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2014both of whom have been quoted saying Bitcoin has no value.\n\nBut now that Bitcoin ranks alongside the largest world currencies by market cap, it does beg the question ... what exactly does back it?\n\nBitcoin vs. fiat\n\nUp until relatively recently (the last century or so), most ordinary paper currency and coinage was directly redeemable for gold. This is because many of the wealthiest countries followed the gold standard, a monetary system where governments tied a fixed exchange rate for national currency to gold. As part of this system, countries kept sufficient reserves of gold in their vaults to 100% back their circulating currency supply, ensuring currency-for-gold exchanges were always possible.\n\nHowever, this also constrained the economy in the middle of the Great Depression, since governments were unable to simply source more gold to expand their money supply and stimulate spending.\n\nThe system was abandoned by Australia and New Zealand in 1929-1930; Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1931; and the United States partially left the standard in 1933.\n\nIt wasn't until 1971 that the United States fully left the gold standard, after then-President Richard Nixon ended the interconvertability of the U.S. dollar into gold, thereby nullifying the Bretton Woods system and essentially ending the age of the gold standard.\n\nInstead, countries switched to a fiat model, where the national currency isn't backed by a commodity like gold, allowing central banks to print new money whenever needed. Although it doesn't have intrinsic value, the value of fiat money is set by changes in supply and demand, as well as the strength of the government behind it. Since governments only accept payment of taxes in fiat currency, and tax evasion is illegal, their value is also partially maintained required tax payments.\n\nSo while fiat currencies are not formally backed by anything, we tend to buy into our fiat currencies with the confidence that they will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for goods and services. Essentially, our confidence in fiat currencies generates purchasing power, and therefore value, for fiat currencies.\n\nBut our confidence in fiat currencies suffers from a problem of induction. In other words, we presuppose that a sequence of events will occur as it always has, based on our previous experience. We can't really say for certain what lies ahead for the value of our traditional fiat currencies. Without a currency being formally tied to a commodity like gold, value becomes a contingency rather than a guarantee.\n\nIs Bitcoin backed by mathematics?\n\nLike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by a physical commodity, and instead derives its value in other ways.\n\nSince Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized entity that enforces its value, and it isn't backed by any commodity, many people mistakenly believe this means Bitcoin doesn't have any value.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin currently has an individual unit value of around $30,000, and a total market capitalization\u2014defined as the unit value multiplied by the number of Bitcoin in circulation\u2014of over $625 billion, clearly demonstrating that it is considered valuable by a large number of people.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn't actually backed by anything physical\u2014only the complicated mathematics underlying its blockchain technology and controlled supply. This ensures Bitcoin remains limited in supply and is resistant to censorship\u2014which imbues it with some of its value. As Anthony Pompliano said in a panel discussion on CNBC, \"If you don't believe in Bitcoin, you're essentially saying you don't believe in cryptography.\" For Pompliano, blockchain technology endows Bitcoin with inherent value, almost like a gold standard for crypto.\n\nThe rest of Bitcoin's value can be attributed to the fact that it was the first successful monetary system to operate without a centralized entity pulling the strings\u2014meaning its supply can't be forcefully inflated, it can't be easily confiscated like gold was during the 1930s, and it offers a level of financial freedom that few (if any) fiat currencies can match.\n\nBitcoin has also been shown to have utility value; thousands of merchants now accept it as payment for goods and services. In two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender, meaning that merchants have to accept it (though in the former, at least, adoption has reportedly been patchy).\n\nEl Salvador's Controversial Bitcoin Year: A Timeline\n\nThe level of confidence seen in a currency can be indicated, or even preserved, by its level of usage around the world. Whether it is performing well relative to other fiat currencies, the U.S. dollar is\u2014and will be for the foreseeable future\u2014a currency that can be spent almost anywhere. As a result, consumers are confident in the dollar. Purchasing power and practicality are valuable commodities themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is still some way from the mainstream. The crypto community has come a long way since the first Bitcoin transaction was spent on a pizza, but until mass adoption takes place, confidence in Bitcoin will ultimately not be as high, or as widespread, as confidence in established fiat currencies.\n\nDespite their obvious differences, Bitcoin turns out to be similar to a fiat currency insofar as it is backed largely by consumer confidence. As belief in the crypto space grows, so too will confidence in Bitcoin."

        "title": "Stolen crypto - UK Court of Appeal opens door to software developers' legal duties to users | Insights - Mayer Brown",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe roller coaster ride that is Tulip Trading v Wladimir van der Laan & Ors \u2013 as we have previously discussed \u2013 has taken another turn.\n\nOn 3 February 2023, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales unanimously decided to allow the appeal of Tulip Trading Limited (\"Tulip\"), reversing the prior order of the High Court, dated 25 March 2022. In particular, the Court determined that establishing whether or not certain Bitcoin developers owe a legal duty to Tulip \u2013 such that they may be compelled to assist Tulip in recovering Bitcoin lost as a result of a computer hack \u2013 is a \"serious issue to be tried\". This determination resulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the English courts do have jurisdiction over the case, as it ensured that the three part test for jurisdiction was found to be satisfied (see, e.g. VTB paragraphs 99-101).\n\nAs a result, the case is now expected to go to full trial in 2024.\n\nWhilst this decision is largely procedural, and the final position on the existence of any duties will depend on the facts as established at the full trial (e.g. the extent to which the relevant Bitcoin networks are decentralised, and whether it is technologically possible to achieve the remedy sought by Tulip), the decision is a milestone with potentially far-reaching implications for the wider crypto and blockchain world:\n\nit (re)opens the door to the imposition of fiduciary duties on software developers who \"look after\" cryptocurrencies on behalf of users / owners; it may thereby offer victims of crypto theft or fraud a route to recovery; and it indicates that the English courts remain open to adapting complex areas of law to account for fast\u2011developing technology.\n\nThe Court of Appeal Judgment\n\nIn its decision, the Court of Appeal focused on evaluating whether there is \"a real as opposed to fanciful prospect\" of fiduciary duties being imposed on the respondent developers, given the facts of the case. Whilst recognising that, in the words of Lord Justice Birss, \"for Tulip's case to succeed would involve a significant development of the common law on fiduciary duties\", the Court nevertheless found it to be clearly arguable that fiduciary duties do exist, as the software developers who look after the relevant Bitcoin networks have undertaken roles which bear at least some relationship to the interests of Bitcoin owners.\n\nThe Court of Appeal considered there to be a realistic argument that:\n\n\"[t]he developers of a given network are a sufficiently well-defined group to be capable of being subject to fiduciary duties. Viewed objectively the developers have undertaken a role which involves making discretionary decisions and exercising power for and on behalf of other people, in relation to property owned by those other people. That property has been entrusted into the care of the developers\u2026 The essence of that duty is single minded loyalty to the users of bitcoin software. The content of the duties includes a duty not to act in their own self-interest and also involves a duty to act in positive ways in certain circumstances. It may also, realistically, include a duty to act to introduce code so that an owner's bitcoin can be transferred to safety in the circumstances alleged by Tulip.\"\n\nIn concluding that there was a realistic prospect that fiduciary duties could be found to exist, the Court noted that Tulip had amended its case \u2013 moving from its position that a breach of fiduciary duties occurred when the developers did not act following a user raising a theft claim with them, to an amended position which, at its highest, asserted that the alleged duties arose where it was established (e.g. by a court with competent jurisdiction) that a user's cryptocurrency had been stolen. The Court noted that in doing so, Tulip had removed one of \"the difficulties with its case\". In assessing whether the amended case nevertheless did not stand a realistic prospect of success, on the basis that utilisation of such a court-based standard raised the risk that contradictory judgments could be attained from different courts leading to conflict of laws issues, the Court determined such a risk could not justify a finding that there is no serious issue to be tried \u2013 as the Court stated: \"[t]he internet is not a place the law does not apply.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal also made clear that it remains open-minded to the development of this area of law in response to fast technological evolution - as Lord Justice Birss stated, \"\u2026the common law often works incrementally and by analogy with existing cases, and rightly so; but if the facts change in a way which is more than incremental I do not believe the right response of the common law is simply to stop and say that incremental development cannot reach that far.\" It will thus be interesting to see how far the common law of fiduciary duties will advance from existing principles in the final judgment, if at all.\n\nKey observations\n\nThis Court of Appeal ruling is perhaps not surprising, given the importance and complexity of the issue as to whether Bitcoin is truly decentralised and the scale of the claim \u2013 the Bitcoin in dispute having been valued at some \u00a34bn in 2021. As the Court of Appeal put it, \"[i]f the decentralised governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property\".\n\nLeaving aside the controversy surrounding Dr. Craig Wright, the owner of Tulip, the reaction to this Court of Appeal decision within the crypto / blockchain community has been divided. On the one hand, the spectre of liability now hangs over crypto software developers in relation to certain types of losses suffered by their users; this may deter some developers/engineers from taking on roles which could conceivably entail fiduciary duties. Notably, as many blockchain networks are more centralised than the networks at the centre of this case \u2013 and greater centralisation appears to increase the possibility that fiduciary duties might exist \u2013 it is a broad selection of chain administrators that may need to consider the potential implications of this judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, this decision may be welcomed by crypto-asset investors, on the basis that it potentially provides an alternative (and more straightforward) route to redress for fraud victims. Currently, crypto owners / investors have little hope of recovering stolen crypto assets and/or private keys, which are at the mercy of the software developers/engineers.\n\nFinally, against the backdrop of the current project on digital assets undertaken by the Law Commission, the Court of Appeal recognised the possible need for statutory intervention if the law on digital assets and blockchain requires developments beyond those possible through common law. Nevertheless, the discussion in this case demonstrates that the English courts are willing to engage with these difficult subjects in order to provide greater legal clarity, as part of the UK's broader strategy to support innovation within the UK's digital ecosystem."

        "content": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York led a study that examined the relationship between bitcoin and macroeconomic data, finding that the two barely have a link.\n\n\u201cThe key result is that, unlike other US asset classes, Bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news,\u201d economists Gianluca Benigno and Carlo Rosa wrote.\n\nThey did flag that bitcoin seems to be slightly sensitive to consumer price index (CPI) data \u2014 a measure of inflation \u2014 however its coefficient was only 5%.\n\n\u201cIf we restrict the sample to the period 2017-2021, the CPI coefficient is no longer significant for Bitcoin, but it remains significantly different from zero for other assets,\u201d Benigno and Rosa said in the study.\n\n\u201cThis disconnect is puzzling as unexpected changes in discount rates should, in principle, affect the price of bitcoin even when interpreting bitcoin as a purely speculative asset.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the chosen asset for the study because of its popularity and because it is more \u201caccessible and liquid\u201d than other cryptocurrencies, they said.\n\nThe economists analyzed its response to broadly defined macroeconomic data points such as initial jobless claims, industrial production, retail sales, unemployment and news on inflation. Bloomberg consensus forecasts were used to compare market expectations.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s low responsiveness to macro news is in \u201cstark contrast\u201d with other assets the economists used for comparison \u2014 gold, silver, the S&P 500 and a number of bilateral exchange rates.\n\n\u201cAll other traditional assets respond to macroeconomic news with an economically large and significant coefficient,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe economists originally expected bitcoin to respond to monetary policy news as they figured bitcoin is an asset with no intrinsic value, whose current value \u201cdepends on the discounted value of its future price.\u201d\n\nSo, changes in current and future real interest rates, powered by macroeconomic events, should impact its desirability as an investment\n\n\u201cOur analysis instead shows that, while other US asset prices respond to both the target and the path of monetary policy news, Bitcoin is unresponsive to unexpected changes in the short-term rate while its reaction to news about the future path of policy is not robust,\u201d they said.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) last traded around $24,560 as of 11:00 am ET and is down 35% in the last 12 months, but up 50% in the year-to-date period.\n\nThe S&P 500, on the other hand, is down 6.5% over the past year and up 5.2% in 2023 so far.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The foundation is focused on promoting and protecting human rights globally \u2014 particularly in countries where its people live \u201cunder authoritarian rule.\"\n\nGladstein also delivers lectures on Bitcoin and the future of money at Singularity University events, according to his bio.\n\nGladstein said during the interview that Bitcoin represents free speech, property rights and open capital markets, all of which are stifling to a tyrannical government, which often needs censorship, confiscation and closed capital markets. He stated:\n\n\u201cThis is what China and Russia need to survive they need censorship, they need close capital markets and they need confiscation; Bitcoin makes it really hard for governments to impose those things on their people.\"\n\nBoth Russia and China have been hostile toward crypto in the past.

Bitcoin infrastructure provider OpenNode voiced similar opinions in a 2021 post about the benefit that BTC donations had in evading authoritative crackdowns.\n\n\u201cOne of the benefits of Bitcoin is its censorship resistance,\u201d OpenNode wrote at the time.\n\n\u201cWithout any central authority to dictate who can and can\u2019t use Bitcoin, it has proven to be the currency of choice for many individuals and organizations who have been left out of traditional payment methods.\"\n\nAccording to a February 2022 investigation by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, one of the biggest reasons for embracing blockchain-based fundraising was to avoid traditional accounts being closed by financial institutions.\n\nRelated: Blockchain is the only viable path to privacy and censorship resistance in the 21st century\n\nGladstein predicts there will be many more \u201ctrigger moments\u201d in the coming years of people having \u201ctechnical and liquidity trouble with traditional financial services,\u201d which will result in more people shifting to BTC as an alternative.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a conflict or a breakdown in trade or communications, you\u2019re just gonna see a whole hell of a lot of problems, and every single one of those is like a moment that\u2019s gonna mint a new Bitcoiner out of necessity,\u201d he said."

        "content": "In brief Like the U.S. dollar and most other fiat currencies, Bitcoin isn't backed by physical assets in a vault, but instead by its value as a mode of payment.\n\nThe math underpinning Bitcoin's blockchain contributes to its desirability in a number of ways.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUp until relatively recently (the last century or so), most ordinary paper currency and coinage was directly redeemable for gold. This is because many of the wealthiest countries followed the gold standard, a monetary system where governments tied a fixed exchange rate for national currency to gold. As part of this system, countries kept sufficient reserves of gold in their vaults to 100% back their circulating currency supply, ensuring currency-for-gold exchanges were always possible.\n\nHowever, this also constrained the economy in the middle of the Great Depression, since governments were unable to simply source more gold to expand their money supply and stimulate spending.\n\nThe system was abandoned by Australia and New Zealand in 1929-1930; Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1931; and the United States partially left the standard in 1933.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn't until 1971 that the United States fully left the gold standard, after then-President Richard Nixon ended the interconvertability of the U.S. dollar into gold, thereby nullifying the Bretton Woods system and essentially ending the age of the gold standard.\n\nInstead, countries switched to a fiat model, where the national currency isn't backed by a commodity like gold, allowing central banks to print new money whenever needed. Although it doesn't have intrinsic value, the value of fiat money is set by changes in supply and demand, as well as the strength of the government behind it. Since governments only accept payment of taxes in fiat currency, and tax evasion is illegal, their value is also partially maintained required tax payments.\n\nSo while fiat currencies are not formally backed by anything, we tend to buy into our fiat currencies with the confidence that they will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for goods and services. Essentially, our confidence in fiat currencies generates purchasing power, and therefore value, for fiat currencies.\n\nBut our confidence in fiat currencies suffers from a problem of induction. In other words, we presuppose that a sequence of events will occur as it always has, based on our previous experience. We can't really say for certain what lies ahead for the value of our traditional fiat currencies. Without a currency being formally tied to a commodity like gold, value becomes a contingency rather than a guarantee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs Bitcoin backed by mathematics?\n\nLike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by a physical commodity, and instead derives its value in other ways.\n\nSince Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized entity that enforces its value, and it isn't backed by any commodity, many people mistakenly believe this means Bitcoin doesn't have any value.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin currently has an individual unit value of around $30,000, and a total market capitalization\u2014defined as the unit value multiplied by the number of Bitcoin in circulation\u2014of over $625 billion, clearly demonstrating that it is considered valuable by a large number of people.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn't actually backed by anything physical\u2014only the complicated mathematics underlying its blockchain technology and controlled supply. This ensures Bitcoin remains limited in supply and is resistant to censorship\u2014which imbues it with some of its value. As Anthony Pompliano said in a panel discussion on CNBC, \"If you don't believe in Bitcoin, you're essentially saying you don't believe in cryptography.\" For Pompliano, blockchain technology endows Bitcoin with inherent value, almost like a gold standard for crypto.\n\nThe rest of Bitcoin's value can be attributed to the fact that it was the first successful monetary system to operate without a centralized entity pulling the strings\u2014meaning its supply can't be forcefully inflated, it can't be easily confiscated like gold was during the 1930s, and it offers a level of financial freedom that few (if any) fiat currencies can match.\n\nBitcoin has also been shown to have utility value; thousands of merchants now accept it as payment for goods and services. In two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender, meaning that merchants have to accept it (though in the former, at least, adoption has reportedly been patchy).\n\nThe level of confidence seen in a currency can be indicated, or even preserved, by its level of usage around the world. Whether it is performing well relative to other fiat currencies, the U.S. dollar is\u2014and will be for the foreseeable future\u2014a currency that can be spent almost anywhere. As a result, consumers are confident in the dollar. Purchasing power and practicality are valuable commodities themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is still some way from the mainstream. The crypto community has come a long way since the first Bitcoin transaction was spent on a pizza, but until mass adoption takes place, confidence in Bitcoin will ultimately not be as high, or as widespread, as confidence in established fiat currencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite their obvious differences, Bitcoin turns out to be similar to a fiat currency insofar as it is backed largely by consumer confidence. As belief in the crypto space grows, so too will confidence in Bitcoin."

        "content": "'Truly a sham market': Jim Cramer says you need to ignore the 'crypto cheerleaders' now that bitcoin is bouncing \u2014 this is why and what he likes instead\n\nAfter a terrible 2022, cryptocurrencies seem to have finally found some upward momentum again. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.\n\nBut CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer isn\u2019t a fan.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\n'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' \u2014 here are 3 better recession-proof buys\n\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes \u2014 how do you stack up?\n\n\u201cThe charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin\u2019s bouncing,\u201d he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading\u2019s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.\n\nSome say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.\n\nCramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cIf you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,\u201d the Mad Money host says.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019ve been following Cramer, you\u2019d already know that he hasn\u2019t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.\n\n\u201cThe manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,\u201d he tweeted earlier in January.\n\nIf you share Cramer\u2019s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.\n\nBullion\n\nInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.\n\nIt can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.\n\nAnd because of the precious metal\u2019s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.\n\nMost bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don\u2019t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable \u2014 this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth instead\n\nGold mining companies\n\nWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.\n\nBarrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.\n\nHigher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.\n\nETFs\n\nExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.\n\nInvestors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.\n\nThe most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.\n\nThe iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion \u2014 just like GLD \u2014 but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.\n\nThere are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.\n\nFor instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.\n\nGDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.\n\nA better way to buy gold?\n\nOf course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.\n\nA Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.\n\nIt\u2019s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold\u2019s purchasing power remains more stable over time.\n\nOpting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.\n\nIf you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that\u2019ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account \u2014 and quickly.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "Over the course of Bitcoin's (BTC 1.46%) impressive run in the last 14 years, it has proved naysayers wrong time after time as it smashed through previous all-time highs. Since hitting its most recent historic high of around $68,000 in November 2021, the next hope for investors is that its price will one day reach six figures.\n\nPredictions for a $100,000 Bitcoin are common these days. But often they lack substance, evidence, or any legitimate reasoning. Let's try to change that.\n\nTo paint a clearer picture of what might be in store for Bitcoin, our analysis needs to use data. Knowing where Bitcoin has been can help formulate more-realistic estimates on where it could be headed, rather than using wishful thinking.\n\nAs we look at the data, a few things become clear. First, Bitcoin's price behavior is influenced significantly by an event known as a halving. And due to the halving's heavy influence, we can even project when the cryptocurrency will hit a particular price. Before getting into this, though, an understanding of halvings is needed.\n\nA true Bitcoin feature\n\nHalving is what helps make Bitcoin unique due to its role in mining and the creation of new bitcoins. When miners successfully mine a block, they are rewarded with freshly minted bitcoins. This is the primary way that new bitcoins enter circulation.\n\nWhen a halving occurs, it cuts the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners in half, thereby slowing the rate at which new coins enter circulation.\n\nThese halvings take place every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. The first halving occurred in November 2012 and dropped the block reward from 50 bitcoins to 25. The second was in the summer of 2016. And the most recent was in May 2020, resulting in the reward being cut from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nWhat Bitcoin could look like by the next halving\n\nAs we analyze the data, it becomes evident that Bitcoin's price at the time of each halving is roughly 50% less than its previous all-time high. This is crucial to understand so that we can more accurately estimate where it could be headed.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin at the time of the halving is about 50% of the previous all-time high, we can surmise that in May 2024, Bitcoin could be worth around $34,000 based on its current record high of roughly $68,000.\n\nFrom here, we need to look at what happens after the halving. With the halving reducing the rate of new coins entering circulation, Bitcoin's price tends to make its most significant gains after this as the market adjusts to a more limited supply.\n\nWhen we look at Bitcoin's performance after past halvings, two things become clear. On average, Bitcoin returns about 25% less with each new cycle, and a new record high is typically made a year and a half after the halving.\n\nSince we know that the last cycle produced a 670% return, we arrive at around a 500% increase for the coming halving. An increase of this size from our speculative $34,000 price in May 2024 would result in a new all-time high of more than $200,000 sometime in the second half of 2025.\n\nThese estimates and timelines are speculative. But unlike other predictions, this scenario takes data into account and relies on verifiable trends revolving around halvings. Until the data proves otherwise, it is all we can base estimates on.\n\nAs such, with the data's integrity still intact, buying the crypto today could prove to be extremely lucrative since its price hovers at about $25,000.\n\nShould Bitcoin behave like it has in the past and reach our projected $200,000; that would represent an increase of 700% from today's price. Even better, time is on our side: 2025 remains off in the distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "More Than Half Of Bitcoin Mining Is Fueled By Sustainable Power - Markets Insider",
        "content": "This article provides a look at my latest research, revealing how it came to be that a 2022 Cambridge Centre For Alternative Finance\u2019s (CCAF) study on Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact underestimates the amount of sustainable Bitcoin mining going on. I also address why we can be very confident that the actual sustainable energy usage is at least 52.6% of Bitcoin\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nWhatever your position on ESG investment, the reality is that it\u2019s soaring, on track to reach $10.5 trillion in the U.S. alone. What\u2019s also true is that Bitcoin adoption cannot occur unless this $10.5 trillion of ESG funds feels comfortable that Bitcoin is a net positive to the environment.\n\nRight now, ESG investors largely don\u2019t feel comfortable that this is the case. In speaking with them, my impression is that one reason for ESG investor discomfort with Bitcoin is that the CCAF study, \u201cA Deep Dive Into Bitcoin\u2019s Environmental Impact,\u201d reported that Bitcoin uses only 37.6% sustainable energy.\n\nWhile ESG investors are generally quick to dismiss the work of Bitcoin critic Alex de Vries \u2014 debunked in an earlier Bitcoin Magazine article \u2014 I have found they are also more likely to trust the CCAF study over a Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) study that found Bitcoin uses 58.9% sustainable energy. You can understand why: The Cambridge brand says \u201creputable, independent research,\u201d while BMC\u2019s says, \u201cindustry body.\u201d\n\nIronically, being an industry body, the very thing that gives BMC access to real-time Bitcoin mining data, also made its findings easier for at least some ESG investors to disqualify. Environmental groups such as Earth Justice and journals such as \u201cThe Ecologist\u201d have been similarly quick to assume the CCAF numbers must be the correct ones.\n\nTo date, Bitcoiners have had a muted response. The result: The conversation about ESG funds getting behind Bitcoin cannot progress. Bitcoin user adoption stalls.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups gain more fuel to lobby governments to regulate Bitcoin mining in a punitive manner.\n\nWHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR ESG FUNDS TO SUPPORT BITCOIN?\n\nESG funds require three things before they will invest in Bitcoin projects. These are the same three things that the White House would need in order to not punitively regulate Bitcoin mining: independent, empirical data demonstrating unambiguously:\n\nHow the CCAF study came to be understated and by how much That the Bitcoin macro trend is quantifiably moving toward sustainable energy That Bitcoin is quantifiably a net positive to the environment and society\n\nThe research presented here is the answer to the first requirement for ESG investors. It won\u2019t by itself open the floodgates for institutional ESG investment, but it does knock over the first major barriers.\n\nFINDINGS\n\nThroughout 2022, I was perplexed about the consistent, 20%-plus difference between the BMC and CCAF estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s sustainable energy use. I saw both the Bitcoin community and environmental groups quote the figure that fit their narratives.\n\nBeing in the unusual position of straddling both communities, my simple question was, \u201cWho\u2019s right?\u201d\n\nI decided to research the question.\n\nWhat I realized was that the CCAF model was excluding several factors. No great detective work on my part: It says so on its website under the \u201cLimitations Of The Model\u201d section.\n\nSo, I quantified the impact of these exclusions. It turned out that the three exclusions mentioned on its website cause its model to understate Bitcoin\u2019s sustainable energy percentage by 13.6%. This explains two-thirds of the entire variance between the CCAF and the BMC model.\n\nWhen all exclusions from the CCAF model are factored in, the Bitcoin sustainable energy percentage figure is a full 15.5% higher.\n\nHere\u2019s a full breakdown of all of the CCAF model exclusions. There are nine exclusions in total: seven (in green) that increase the sustainable energy-use figure; two (in red) that decrease it. A full evaluation of each factor and the methodology used to quantify exclusions can be found on my research site.\n\nSo, in summary, the CCAF model does not factor in:\n\nOff-grid mining (impact: plus 10.8%)\n\nFlare-gas mining (impact: plus 1.0%)\n\nUpdated geographical hash rate (Kazakhstan miner exodus, impact: plus 1.8%)\n\nWith all exclusions factored in, the sustainable energy mix calculation is 52.6%. This figure represents a lower-bound estimate, so it is not incompatible with the BMC study showing 58.9% sustainable energy.\n\nHOW CONFIDENT CAN WE BE THAT BITCOIN\u2019S ENERGY USE IS OVER 50%?\n\nWe can simulate this using the revised model. For Bitcoin\u2019s true sustainable energy use to be below 50%, at least one of the following scenarios would have to be true:\n\nFour large Bitcoin mining operations secretly run off 100% coal-based energy\n\nERCOT (The operator of Texas\u2019s electricity grid) has over-reported its true renewable energy numbers by a factor of four\n\nDespite the widely-reported exodus of miners from Kazakhstan, its claim on Bitcoin mining actually increased its share of global hash rate from 13.2% to 20%\n\nI would rate the chance of any of these being true as far fetched. As for the likelihood that the true sustainable percentage of the Bitcoin network is 37.6%, there is a higher likelihood of you winning first prize in a single-ticket entry lottery where every man, woman and child in the U.S. has a ticket.\n\nWHAT DOES THIS NEW RESEARCH MEAN FOR BITCOIN\u2019S ESG NARRATIVE\n\nThree things:\n\n1. It won\u2019t stop mainstream media from quoting the Cambridge study or environmental groups from using it. But it will make a difference to how ESG investors look at Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin advocates have a legitimate, data-based way to remove the roadblock that the CCAF study has for some time created in the minds of ESG investors.\n\nPast the first hurdle, proponents of Bitcoin can ask the next two big questions that ESG investors and the White House have: Is Bitcoin\u2019s macro-trend quantifiably moving toward sustainable energy? And is Bitcoin quantifiably a net positive to the environment and society?\n\n2. It also means that previous CCAF findings that appear to have used the same partial data set will need to be revisited. Specifically, we will need to revisit its findings that:\n\nBitcoin emissions are currently 58.58 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) (likely overstated)\n\nBitcoin uses less sustainable energy since the China ban (likely to show a different trend once off-grid mining is factored in)\n\nEmissions intensity may be increasing (for the same reason as the above)\n\nThe major energy used by the Bitcoin network is coal (in light of off-grid data, it is unclear if there is sufficient evidence for this conclusion)\n\nInitial calculations suggest that all four findings may be incorrect. This will need further analysis before we can say this with confidence. I\u2019ll do that in separate pieces of work.\n\n3. To the best of my knowledge, all other major industries are significantly behind Bitcoin in their use of sustainable energy. Bitcoin can legitimately claim to be leading all other industries in its adoption of sustainable energy sources. This is a very strong ESG case, because it shows an industry taking leadership in the renewable transition, which has the potential to inspire other industries by example.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Bitcoin has achieved this feat in the remarkably quick time of just 14 years.\n\nIn summary: One of the three hurdles to institutional adoption of Bitcoin on ESG grounds effectively no longer exists. Both Bitcoin advocates and ESG investors can now feel confident that Bitcoin is predominantly sustainable.\n\nFINAL WORDS\n\nThroughout the process, I was in contact with both Alexander Neumueller, the digital assets project lead at CCAF, and Michael Saylor, the founder of BMC. Each was both encouraging and supportive of the approach I was taking.\n\nTo my knowledge, CCAF was the first to create energy and emission data for the Bitcoin network using a valid methodology and high-integrity data. I use both its energy consumption index (CBECI) and its mining map extensively in my own research and have found both the methodology and the data of these two tools to be sound. It is only the sustainable energy percentages where I found that an underestimation was occurring.\n\nWhen CCAF first started calculating the sustainable energy use of the Bitcoin network in late 2019, it was highly accurate. It is the subsequent proliferation of largely renewable-based, off-grid mining, flare-gas mining and rapid miner movement from Kazakhstan and to Texas that saw its model start to lose tune. As any quant trader can tell you, \u201ceven a great algorithm will lose tune over time.\u201d\n\nBy Daniel Batten via Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nDemographic Challenges Weigh On Russia\u2019s Military Ambitions\n\nSemiconductors Have An Emissions Problem\n\nNorway\u2019s Oil Production Dropped In January\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nThis story originally appeared on Oilprice.com"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe only investors making money from buying Bitcoin are the whales and pro traders\u2014and if you bought the cryptocurrency after 2015, you\u2019ve probably lost money.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements, which claims that more \u201csophisticated investors\u201d in the crypto market have done well for themselves over the last seven years, but retail investors have generally lost out.\n\nMonday\u2019s \u201cCrypto shocks and retail losses\u201d report looks at how retail investors flooded the space when the price of coins and tokens started plummeting\u2014and most buying volume took place when Bitcoin was above $30,000. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading for around $25,000, down 64% from its all-time high above $69,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cData on major crypto trading platforms over August 2015-December 2022 show that, as a result, a majority of crypto app users in nearly all economies made losses on their Bitcoin holdings,\u201d the report says, referring to state of the market following the collapse of the Terra crypto project.\n\nTerra, at its peak, was one of the biggest blockchain ecosystems in the space. Its native coin, LUNA, had a market cap of over $30 billion, until it collapsed last May\u2014sending \u201cshockwaves through the system,\u201d in the words of BIS researchers, and bringing the price of every digital asset down with it.\n\nThe BIS report also looks at the collapse of digital asset exchange FTX in November and how it hit the ecosystem. The exchange, once one of the biggest and most-respected, went bankrupt after a rush of customers tried to cash out at the same time. The bank run resulted in the exchange being forced to admit it did not hold one-to-one reserves of customer assets.\n\nFTX was allegedly criminally mismanaged and its ex-boss, Sam Bankman-Fried, is now facing eight criminal charges in the U.S.\n\nThe BIS notes that despite Terra\u2019s crash and FTX\u2019s fall, activity on crypto trading apps jumped after news broke of their failures\u2014but larger holders typically were able to \u201cat the expense of smaller investors\u201d as they know when to sell Bitcoin and other crypto to retail investors before a sharp decline.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese losses could be exacerbated by the fact that larger, more sophisticated investors tended to sell their coins right before steep price declines, while smaller investors were still buying,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u201cThese patterns highlight the need for better investor protection in the crypto space,\u201d the BIS concludes, echoing the sentiment coming from U.S. regulators in recent months.\n\nRegulators and lawmakers alike have become increasingly concerned with reining in the crypto industry following the collapse of FTX. The SEC, which first began cracking down on crypto in 2018, has stepped up its \"regulation by enforcement\" methods lately, dishing out fines to celebrities and exchanges\u2014all in the name of \u201cinvestor protection,\u201d in the words of the body\u2019s chair Gary Gensler."

        "title": "Advanced Bitcoin Chain Opens Crypto Mining - 24-7 Press Release",
        "content": "BETTER Algorithm... GREATER Earnings!\n\nSEATTLE, WA, February 21, 2023 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Advanced Bitcoin Center is pleased to announce the official launch of its Advanced Bitcoin Chain for cryptocurrency mining. This chain utilizes a distinct algorithm that differs from those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nBy integrating Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, the Advanced Bitcoin Chain has created a more effective algorithm, allowing miners to extract up to 14,400 Advanced Bitcoin (aBTC) each day.\n\n\n\nBased on the public transaction history of aBTC since 2022, the average value of each aBTC typically ranges from $200.00 to $350,000.\n\n\n\nConsequently, mining aBTC on the Advanced Bitcoin Chain is exceptionally profitable. The aBTC miners have the potential to mine around $4.32 million to $5.04 billion worth of Advanced Bitcoin per day.\n\n\n\nCompared to traditional Bitcoin, the main features of Advanced Bitcoin can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n1) It can run normally and efficiently on a regular personal computer, unlike traditional Bitcoin, which requires a professional mining computer with unprecedented computing power to function.\n\n\n\n2) Compared to the daily power consumption of a personal computer, there is virtually no additional power consumption when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n3) Compared to the normal noise of a personal computer, there is virtually no additional computer noise when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n4) Compared to the normal heat generated by a personal computer, there is virtually no additional heat when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n5) The block generation speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 10 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n6) The cryptocurrency generation speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 16 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n7) The blockchain transaction verification speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 45 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n8) Compared to the 3-7 transactions per second (TPS) that can be processed by traditional Bitcoin blockchain, the TPS of the Advanced Bitcoin blockchain is around 100,000-1,000,000 transactions per second, which is more than 10,000-140,000 times faster than traditional Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n9) The Advanced Bitcoin Wallet is designed to produce up to 1 billion units of Advanced Bitcoin (aBTC) over a period of approximately 190 years. This quantity represents a 47.62-fold increase over the maximum amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that can be generated through conventional Bitcoin mining equipment, which is capped at 21 million BTC.\n\n\n\nHow to mine Advanced Bitcoin?\n\n\n\nMining is the process by which new Advanced Bitcoins are generated. While it differs significantly from physical mining for precious metals like gold, the comparison does hold in that digital currency miners use computers to solve cryptographic problems and receive a reward in the form of cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nTo begin mining Advanced Bitcoin on the Advanced Bitcoin Chain, miners will require a dedicated Advanced Bitcoin wallet and a computer.\n\n\n\nDue to the advantages offered by the Advanced Bitcoin Chain, the Advanced Bitcoin Center is now offering mining opportunities to interested parties. This includes mining companies and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have sufficient funds to engage in crypto mining.\n\n\n\nMining parties that are approved by the Advanced Bitcoin Center will be authorized to utilize its Advanced Bitcoin wallet to mine aBTC on a 24/7/365 basis.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Chain, as the latest innovative blockchain in the world, commenced mining operations on February 14, 2023. It effectively combines the algorithmic advantages of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, resulting in an impressive maximum transaction processing speed of up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. This makes it a more advanced blockchain technology compared to traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Wallet is a professional application developed by the Advanced Bitcoin Center in the United States to replace the high-pollution, high-energy consumption traditional Bitcoin and its blockchain with the newly lunched Advanced Bitcoin Chain. It is primarily used to mine Advanced Bitcoin, store Advanced Bitcoin, make payments with Advanced Bitcoin, and verify transactions of Advanced Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Center is the developer of Advanced Bitcoin related blockchain products.

        "title": "What is Blockchain Wallet and How Does It Work? [Updated] - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular due to their many improvements over traditional fiat currencies. If you want to use any of these blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ll need to understand how blockchain wallets work.\n\nThe article explains what is blockchain wallet, gives reasons as to why you might use a blockchain wallet and describes the different types of blockchain wallets. It also includes a demo on the use of blockchain wallets.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Use a Blockchain Wallet?\n\nTraditional banking systems pose several problems for doing any transaction. For one thing, transactions are often slow. For another, any transaction has to pass through an intermediary, like a bank, meaning there is a central point of failure. And there are issues in keeping track of all accounts and balances; data can get jeopardized, manipulated, or even corrupted across multiple systems where the accounts and balances are maintained. Blockchain wallets reduce or eliminate these problems.\n\nWhat is a Blockchain Wallet?\n\nA blockchain wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to manage different kinds of cryptocurrencies\u2014for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum. A blockchain wallet helps someone exchange funds easily. Transactions are secure, as they are cryptographically signed. The wallet is accessible from web devices, including mobile ones, and the privacy and identity of the user are maintained. So a blockchain wallet provides all the features that are necessary for safe and secure transfers and exchanges of funds between different parties.\n\nIt is very similar to the process of sending or receiving money through PayPal or any other gateway used today, but you use cryptocurrency instead. Examples of blockchain wallets include Electrum, Blockchain.info, Jaxx, Mycelium, Samurai, and Bitcoin paper wallet. There are many more based on the needs you have and the security you require.\n\nHow Do Blockchain Wallets Work?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss what private and public keys are and how these keys are related to a blockchain wallet. Whenever you create a blockchain wallet, you are provided a private key and a public key that is associated with your wallet. Let\u2019s use email as an example. If you want to receive an email from someone, you give him or her your email address.\n\nBut giving out your email address doesn\u2019t mean someone will be able to send out emails via your account. Someone would have to know your email account\u2019s password to do that. Blockchain wallets follow a similar process using a public key and a private key together. A public key is similar to your email address; you can give it to anyone. When your wallet is generated, a public key is generated, and you can share the public key with anyone in order to receive funds.\n\nThe private key is top secret. It\u2019s similar to your password; it should not get hacked and you should not disclose it to anyone. You use this private key to spend your funds. If someone gets access to your private key, there is a high possibility that your account is compromised, and you might end up losing all the cryptocurrency deposits in your account.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nBlockchain Wallet Features\n\nNow that you know how Blockchain wallets work, it is imperative that you should know about their features. Here are some of the important features of Blockchain wallets:\n\nEasy to use. It\u2019s just like any other software or a wallet that you use for your day-to-day transactions.\n\nHighly secure. It is just a matter of securing your private key.\n\nAllows instant transactions across geographies. And these are barrier-free, without intermediaries.\n\nLow transaction fees. The cost of transferring funds is much lower than with traditional banks.\n\nAllows transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies. This helps you do easy currency conversions.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Types\n\nThere are two types of blockchain wallets based on private keys: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are like normal wallets that we carry for day-to-day transactions, and these wallets are user-friendly. Cold wallets are similar to a vault; they store cryptocurrencies with a high level of security.\n\nHot Wallets and Cold Wallets\n\nHot wallets are online wallets through which cryptocurrencies can be transferred quickly. They are available online. Examples are Coinbase and Blockchain.info. Cold wallets are digital offline wallets where the transactions are signed offline and then disclosed online. They are not maintained in the cloud on the internet; they are maintained offline to have high security. Examples of cold wallets are Trezor and Ledger.\n\nWith hot wallets, private keys are stored in the cloud for faster transfer. With cold wallets, private keys are stored in separate hardware that is not connected to the internet or the cloud, or they are stored on a paper document. Hot wallets are easy to access online 24/7 and can be accessed via a desktop or mobile device, but there is the risk of unrecoverable theft if hacked. With cold wallets, the method of the transaction helps in protecting the wallet from unauthorized access (hacking and other online vulnerabilities).\n\nWe can further break down wallets into three types:\n\nSoftware wallets; Hardware wallets, which you plug into your USB drive; and Typical paper-based wallets, for which you print your public key and private key on a piece of paper and keep it in a secure place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nSoftware Wallets\n\nA software wallet is an application that is downloaded on a device; it could be a desktop or a mobile device, or it could be a web-based wallet that can be accessed online. Breadwallet, Jaxx, and Copay are popular software wallets. We can further categorize software wallets as desktop wallets, online wallets (web wallets), and mobile wallets.\n\nDesktop Wallets Desktop wallets are cold wallets in which the private keys are stored in cold servers (in your desktop). You can unplug the wallet from the Internet, do some offline transactions, and then bring it back online. In case the main server is lost, then a cold server, basically your desktop, is used as a backup server.\n\n\n\nThese wallets can be downloaded on any computer but can be accessed only from the system they are installed on, so you make sure the desktop or the machine on which you are downloading the desktop wallet is safe (has a backup and is in a secure location), and that you\u2019re maintaining the hardware and not letting the machine go anywhere.\n\nThese wallets are definitely cost-efficient. Electrum is one of the most popular desktop wallets.\n\nDesktop wallets are cold wallets in which the private keys are stored in cold servers (in your desktop).

These wallets are definitely cost-efficient. Electrum is one of the most popular desktop wallets. Online Wallets\n\nThese are other kinds of hot wallets that run on the Internet. Users have the benefit of accessing these wallets across any device. It could be a tablet or a desktop, or you can access it from your mobile browser. The private keys are stored online and are managed by a third party. For example, GreenAddress is a Bitcoin wallet that is available on the web, has an Android app, is available on a desktop, and also is available on iOS.\n\nThese are other kinds of hot wallets that run on the Internet.

These wallets have a user-friendly interface that helps you do transactions easily. Mycelium is the best available mobile wallet.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nA hardware wallet is a type of cold storage device, typically like a USB, that stores the user\u2019s private key in a protected hardware device. These wallets are similar to portable devices that can be connected to the computer (plugged in). As noted earlier, they are less prone to malicious attacks and are hack-proof. Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey are the top hardware wallets on the market.\n\nTo make a transaction from your hardware wallet, you have to ensure that the hardware wallet is plugged into your computer system.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nA paper wallet is an offline process for storing cryptocurrencies. This wallet is a printed paper that has both your private key and public key, which are accessed using a QR code. Since these wallets are safe, they are widely used for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Paper Wallet and MyEtherWallet are two widely used paper wallets.\n\nA paper wallet works with your software wallet to transfer funds from your software wallet to the public address shown on your paper wallet. First, you park your funds in a software wallet, then you transfer the funds from your software wallet to the public address printed on the paper wallet.\n\nBlockchain Wallets Comparison\n\nBlockchain.info is a cryptocurrency wallet that supports both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is easy to use and has a low transaction fee. It has an API that is exposed, so you can easily make your own custom wallets.\n\nLedger Nano S is a hardware wallet that offers high security for your account.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinal Inscriptions and the ability to mint content other than transactions on the Bitcoin network have taken the blockchain by storm, with over 154,000 inscriptions created to date, according to Dune analytics. Now, a developer has adapted the Ordinals project for rival proof-of-work blockchain Litecoin.\n\nLaunched in 2011, Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency designed to be quicker at processing transactions than Bitcoin. Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who sold all of his Litecoin in 2017 to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe quest to bring Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain began on February 10, when a pseudonymous Twitter user, Indigo Nakamoto, offered 5 LTC (around $500) to anyone who could port Ordinals to Litecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, software engineer Anthony Guerrera launched the Litecoin Ordinals project on GitHub after forking the GitHub repository for Bitcoin Ordinals posted by Casey Rodarmor in January.\n\nLitecoin was chosen because it is the only other blockchain on which Ordinals could work, Guerrera said, due to its soft forks of the SegWit and Taproot technology found in Bitcoin\u2014both of which are essential to making Ordinals work.\n\n\u201cBasically, I was motivated by the bounty that Indigo and a few others put out for someone to port Ordinals to Litecoin,\u201d Guerrera told Decrypt via Twitter DM. \u201cI approached Indigo about a week ago to step up to the challenge.\u201d\n\nGuerrera says the bounty to port Ordinals to Litecoin grew from 5 LTC to 22 LTC, or around $2100.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGuerrera says that when he began working on the project, he found issues with its dependency on rust-bitcoin, which did not support the MimbleWimble upgrade on Litecoin.\n\nRust is a programming language designed for safety and performance. In September 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken launched the internal Tam\u00e1s Blummer Memorial Fund to support the development of rust, named in memory of a Bitcoin Rust contributor who passed away.\n\n\u201cI forked rust-bitcoin to make one that is able to work with Litecoin MWEB,\u201d Guerrera said. \u201c[This allows] Ordinals to decode the block data and safely ignore the extension block MWEB.\u201d\n\nLaunched in May 2022, MimbleWimble\u2014named after a spell from Harry Potter\u2014is an upgrade to the Litecoin blockchain that aims to enhance the network\u2019s privacy and transaction size.\n\nWith MimbleWimble as its secret sauce, Guerrera says the Litecoin blockchain is the perfect place for Ordinals because it can handle more data in an individual transaction at a lower cost than on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cHaving MWEB built into the chain allows for users to be able to transfer funds privately before inscribing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, a statement piece while maintaining privacy; is a huge advantage, unlike Bitcoin, which is a fully public ledger.\u201d\n\nLitecoin is currently the 16th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at $6.89 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Account abstraction on Bitcoin since day 1 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nAccount abstraction has for a long time been a dream of Ethereum and has become a hot topic recently.\n\nWe demonstrate Bitcoin has shipped with account abstraction/unification since its genesis. Thus, all the salient features promised by AA can be and have been developed on Bitcoin, without any protocol changes and with little added complexity. Ethereum\u2019s flawed initial design requires constant and complex retrofits to realize AA, which is still yet to be delivered, over 14 years later than Bitcoin.\n\nAccount Abstraction (AA)\n\nTo understand AA, we need to understand how accounts work on Ethereum first. An Ethereum account is similar to a bank account, but holds ethers or ETH rather than fiat. There are two types of accounts on Ethereum, both identified by a unique address.\n\n1. Externally Owned Account (EOA)\n\nEOAs are accounts owned by something external to the blockchain: users. They are the traditional accounts that users create with a wallet like MetaMask. An EOA has a public address controlled by the user\u2019s private key, which can sign and initiate transactions. The validation of signature is hardcoded into the base layer and runs outside of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\n2. Contract Account (CA)\n\nThese accounts are commonly known as smart contracts and are controlled by their smart contract code, not a private key. The smart contract is run in the EVM. Also a CA has storage and code, neither of which an EOA has.\n\nMotivations for AA\n\nEOA suffers from an one-size-fits-all issue. Whether an EOA has a balance of 1 ether or ethers worth billions of dollars, it is secured by a single private key. If a user loses the private key (or seed phrase) due to a small mistake, she can lose everything. This makes self-custody non-viable for mainstream audience.\n\nAA seeks to improve user experience and eliminate the existence of two types of accounts by unifying EOA and CA. It makes EOA programmable by moving the validation logic of signed transactions into the EVM, as in CA. An EOA can be tailored to each user\u2019s needs.\n\nThe History and Current State of AA\n\nThere have been many proposals over the years on how to achieve AA on Ethereum.\n\nSome requires significant protocol changes such as EIP-2938. Others does not require protocol changes but fundamentally changes the workflow of a user wallet, such as the latest EIP-4337. It introduces a new mempool, a new actor called bundlers, and multiple new layers, among other changes. Given the enormous complexities introduced, it is not surprising EIP-4337 has not seen any meaningful adoption.\n\nAccount Abstraction on Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin equivalent of an account is a so-called Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). The bitcoins in a UTXO are controlled/locked by the smart contract code in it. To spend them, a user has to provide the matching \u201ckey\u201d, which typically requires some kinds of secret information.\n\nCrucially, there is no distinction between a UTXO controlled by a private key and a UTXO not controlled by one. The spending condition of a UTXO is always validated in the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM). The most popular types of UTXO has an address used by all Bitcoin wallets and is controlled by the corresponding private key\u00b9. However, its validation of signature is still done at BVM and NOT baked into the base layer and thus requires no special handling, in contrast to Ethereum.\n\nUse cases\n\nBitcoin has AA from the beginning since it unifies all account/UTXO processing. To corroborate this, we list some of the most prominent AA features that have been implemented on Bitcoin. Other AA features can be achieved similarly.\n\nSponsored transactions\n\nIt allows third parties (such as a paymaster and an application) to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users. This is needed to onboard users without any bitcoins. One way to enable it is using the ANYONECANPAY sighash flags. It allows anyone to add inputs to a partially signed transaction, which can be used to pay miner fees.\n\nDifferent signature schemes\n\nBitcoin uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called secp256k1 by default, the same as Ethereum. Since a UTXO is controlled by a programmable smart contract, we can use any alternative signature schemes. For example, we have implemented Schnorr and BLS signatures.\n\nWe have also implemented ECDSA on alternative curves like secp256r1, which enables hardware signing using the secure enclave of iOS and Android devices.\n\nVault\n\nA non-custodial Bitcoin vault has been built, where bitcoins locked inside can only be transferred after a user defined time delay. A user can also set a spending limit per day and whitelists/blacklists, among other things.\n\nRecurring payments\n\nA Patreon-like service on Bitcoin has been implement to allow recurring payments.\n\nMultisig\n\nBitcoin has built-in support for multisig out of the box.\n\nNOTE:\n\n[1] The smart contract is called Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH).\n\nWatch: Blockchain: Data Power-Ups and NFTs for eSports & Online Games\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

In terms of the projected artificial intelligence (AI) price for the end of this year, it currently stands at $33,047, which would present a climb of 34% from its price at press time.\n\nBitcoin 2023 price target.

Source: Finbold\n\nWhether the above projections for the year\u2019s end are realized, will depend on the developments in the wider macro landscape and those related to Bitcoin itself, such as its transaction count momentum reaching the highest level in more than two years and historical patterns suggesting a bullish rally for the next three years, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Crypto in Hawai\u2018i Is Still a \u201cLab\u201d Experiment\n\nEleven companies participate in the Digital Currency Innovation Lab while the state explores regulations and advocates push for open markets.\n\nIllustration: Getty Images; Mallory Adams-Nakamura\n\nCryptocurrency remains a \u201clab\u201d experiment in Hawai\u2018i, with 11 companies providing digital currency services in the state as part of the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. The lab, scheduled to end last summer, was instead extended until Dec. 30, 2024.\n\nHouse Bill 2108, designed to help create a new regulatory framework in Hawai\u2018i, made it all the way to conference committee in the last days of the 2022 Legislature but never passed. State Sen. Glenn Wakai, who has introduced cryptocurrency legislation in the past, says he doesn\u2019t plan to introduce new legislation during the 2023 Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe state should be very deliberate in how it grows the crypto market in Hawai\u2018i. So many people got hurt and swindled. It\u2019s the government\u2019s obligation to protect the public from bad actors,\u201d says Wakai.\n\nRyan Ozawa frequently reports on cryptocurrencies as the news editor for Decrypt, an online news platform that aims \u201cto demystify the decentralized web.\u201d He also once provided community engagement services for the digital currency lab, though no longer serves in that role.\n\nHe strongly supports greater access to digital investments.\n\n\u201cIn the absolute freedom model, you do whatever you want but you could also lose your house. In the consumer protection model, you have to jump through hoops, but you\u2019re less likely to lose your house. I see both sides of it. I believe in the \u2018buyer beware but have freedom model,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nNathaniel Harmon, CEO and co-founder of OceanBit Energy, a local Bitcoin mining startup, however, says well-built rules would benefit local communities.\n\n\u201cWe need good regulation here in the state. These exchanges, if they\u2019re selling Bitcoin, it\u2019s just a commodity. It\u2019s like buying or selling steel or buying and selling gold. Everything else is a security. Its value is dependent on the work that the company does, and the utility the company provides, so we should have strict regulation around these unregistered securities,\u201d Harmon says.\n\nRecommended: Bypassing the Bitcoin Blockade\n\nCentralized vs. Decentralized\n\nSome advocates of cryptocurrency emphasize the distinction between centralized exchanges and decentralized cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are companies that let customers trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional money or other digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies or cryptocurrencies.\n\nFTX is one example of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange; it was run by Sam Bankman-Fried and is now in bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried has been charged with fraud, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nHowever, there are decentralized cryptocurrencies in which transactions are user-based and user-controlled. Some of the best-known cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are decentralized. Such cryptocurrencies can also be traded on most exchanges, centralized or decentralized.\n\nCryptocurrencies can also be bought and sold by individuals in Hawai\u2018i through companies participating in the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. They can use online exchanges and brokerages, and other platforms such as some ATMs in Hawai\u2018i.\n\nLab director Iris Ikeda, who is also the state\u2019s commissioner of financial institutions, says the lab was formed to study the use and effectiveness of cryptocurrency companies \u2013 and whether or not they should be regulated.\n\nLiam Grist is the founder of Cloud Nalu, a Hawai\u2018i-based company that is participating in the lab and provides \u201ca brokerage application for buying and selling Bitcoin while prioritizing holding your own keys (self-custody).\u201d He says HB 2108 could have been a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d by providing easier access to cryptocurrency and trading practices, while also allowing unfairly leveraged and shady exchanges like FTX to operate in the Islands.\n\nIkeda, however, says added protection provided by HB 2108 would have been helpful to consumers.\n\nAwaiting Federal Regulation\n\nGrist says, \u201cRegulation coming from our national government, or the (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), will have a bigger impact on the crypto industry \u2013 more than any legislation Hawai\u2019i can come up with.\u201d\n\nOzawa agrees that Hawai\u2018i should hold off on legislation until the federal government creates a national framework. \u201cThere is no doubt there will be government action,\u201d he says.\n\nThe regulatory climate for cryptocurrencies currently varies from state to state.\n\nGrist would like to see a greater acceptance of digital currency by Hawai\u2018i\u2019s banks. That acceptance, he says, would help residents and the local economy, and each bank would become a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d by safely storing individuals\u2019 cryptocurrency investments.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can really change the future is by engaging and integrating with and building a new system founded on better incentives, founded in real, hard money. It\u2019ll take awhile, but it\u2019s an important thing to do,\u201d Grist says.\n\nIkeda says the lab will continue to allow digital currency transactions and will continue to conduct research that could show the benefits of crypto, including economic development.\n\nRecommended: Bypassing the Bitcoin Blockade\n\nWhile Harmon and Grist both support the lab and a regulatory framework, they also believe a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin should be viewed differently.\n\n\u201cThe difference with Bitcoin is that you can actually hold your own keys to that Bitcoin,\u201d Grist says. \u201cYou can hold your own property, and nobody can control it. I hope it (the lab) will help legislators decide in the future, (that) when we come up with bills in support of digital currency, we separate Bitcoin from crypto because they are two very different things.\u201d\n\nHarmon adds: \u201cBitcoin has no leader, no company behind it. It\u2019s fully decentralized and sets the bar. The vast majority (of cryptocurrencies) are scams. \u2026 If you\u2019re a Bitcoin-only exchange, there should be a different set of laws than being an unregistered securities exchange.\u201d"

The first time this happened was in December 2020, when Bitcoin reached $25,000 for the first time during a period of significant price growth, from $10,200 in September 2020 to $63,170 in April 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa's market capitalisation exceeded Bitcoin's between June and October 2022, but on October 1st, Bitcoin briefly surpassed Visa again before Visa regained its lead. The lead between Bitcoin's market capitalisation and Visa's widened after the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, which caused Bitcoin to lose over $100 billion in value over four days in November 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since then, Bitcoin has fully recovered and added $65 billion on top of its market capitalisation of $408 billion on November 6, which allowed it to overtake Visa once again. It's important to note that the market capitalisation difference between Bitcoin and Visa is small, so they are currently frequently overtaking each other by the hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has had a remarkable start to 2023 and has surpassed Visa's market capitalisation for the third time. This was due to a 14-day period of continuous price increases between January 4th and 17th.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently ahead of Mastercard, the second-largest payment processing network, which has a market capitalization of $345.24 billion, according to Google Finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's value is still 63 percent lower than its all-time high of $69,044, which it reached on November 10th, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash\n\nBitcoin's value has increased by 48 percent since the beginning of the year, leading to a rise in its market capitalisation to overtake that of Visa, a major payment processing company."

It provides the security and payment opportunities that most banks lack and, simultaneously, allows people who don\ufffdt have the convenience of using the services of such financial institutions. China, for example, is the country with the most people without a bank account.\n\nBitcoin is the first and most important cryptocurrency created. It provides the security and payment opportunities that most banks lack and, simultaneously, allows people who don\ufffdt have the convenience of using the services of such financial institutions. China, for example, is the country with the most people without a bank account. And although China is among the countries that use Bitcoin the most, since it has no clear regulations, it has banned related transactions. Other areas, like Venezuela, struggle with their fiat currency, which is why they\ufffdve accepted bitcoin more recently.\n\nThere are still challenges for this cryptocurrency. But the BTC price remains steady, and the network is one of the best choices for businesses that want to expand their transactional resources. Some companies have already started accepting bitcoin as a payment method. From that point, many other significant organizations followed the trend, which is why we\ufffdll discuss some of them in the following paragraphs.\n\nPixabay\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft, the biggest software manufacturing company, started accepting bitcoin payments as far back as 2014, only five years after the cryptocurrency\ufffds market release. The organization partnered with BitPay, a known bitcoin payment service. The collaboration allowed customers to buy apps and games for Windows Phone, Xbox and even their Windows operating system. Microsoft\ufffds purpose was to give users more options for doing more on their devices and the cloud.\n\nBut that\ufffds not the only thing Microsoft adopted. The company also started experimenting with blockchain technology as it launched its first blockchain product in 2015 called Azure Blockchain Service, which would allow building applications in the network without managing infrastructure. Although the project was closed due to low offer interest, Windows is still testing new blockchain solutions.\n\nBurger King\n\nThe internationally successful Burger King restaurant had the first cryptocurrency test back in 2017 when the Russian subdivision of the company issued the WhooperCoin tokens in the Waves blockchain that would be offered to customers at every purchase. Although the project failed, other Burger King branches started to accept Bitcoin payments, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, Venezuela, Brazil and more.\n\nNowadays, you can buy Whoppers with Bitcoin through virtual debit cards. Lately, Burger King started to partner up with Cryptobuyer, another cryptocurrency payment processor through which the company now accepts six different cryptocurrencies in Venezuela, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash.\n\nKFC\n\nAnother important business in the fast-food industry, KFC, started accepting bitcoin as payment back in 2018. It all started in KFC Canada, where customers could pay, for a limited time, for the Bitcoin fried chicken bucket that would cost a little over $27. The buckets were delivered directly to people\ufffds home addresses, while the transactions were processed through BitPay.\n\nHowever, it\ufffds not clear at the moment if the giant company still accepts bitcoin as an optional payment form, but other Yum! Brands, Inc. businesses, such as Pizza Hut, allow bitcoin payments, but only in some regions, Like Venezuela, where the Venezuelan bolivar lost almost all value.\n\nTwitch\n\nTwitch has become one of the best and most used streaming platforms, especially around the pandemic. As owners saw the potential in this organization, they allowed cryptocurrency transactions via BitPay, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nThis method is beneficial for streamers since they can accept crypto donations and support their channel. By including crypto donations, streamers address a larger audience, provide multiple options for people with different types of coins, and have the opportunity to invest or liquidate these coins. Accepting crypto transfers is done through NOWPayments, and users can generate a crypto donation link to share it with their audience.\n\nNorwegian AIR\n\nNorwegian AIR is a major low-cost airline from Norway that plans to offer Bitcoin payments. They have already set up a crypto exchange plan so that customers can purchase tickets through their payment infrastructure. However, since the company faced issues after extensive cost cuts, the bitcoin payment option might take some time to develop fully.\n\nThe business has created a Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) that would roll out exchanges in other countries. The platform was planned to integrate the company\ufffds existing rewards program so that customers could earn points by trading on the exchange. With these points, clients can swap for a discount on tickets.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpress VPN is known as the best online security and data protection services on the market at the moment. It\ufffds also one of the few companies clearly stating their bitcoin payment option. Customers only need to provide their email addresses to sign up for these transactions without other essential information. The company allows for bitcoin transactions through BitPay, but other electronic wallets are also accepted.\n\nExpress VPN also proves an array of cryptocurrencies people can pay with, such as Ethereum, XRP, USDC, PAX AND GUSD stablecoins. The company has already been accepting bitcoin payments since 2014, but it is constantly expanding its payment area and developing its user privacy statements.\n\nStarbucks\n\nFinally, Starbucks is among the companies that allow customers to use bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies to pay for their coffee. In 2018, the business announced its partnering with the crypto platform Bakkt. Through this process, people could convert their cryptocurrencies into US dollars. The partnership had the purpose of helping the company convert consumer Bitcoins and select other digital assets to US dollars.\n\nThe Starbucks app integrates with Bitcoin wallets, and clients state that transactions are fast. Given that the company utilizes a PoS blockchain technology powered by Polygon, this less-energy solution is also one of the most efficient. Starbucks has also explored other facilities on the blockchain to offer customers another way to engage with the web3 experience.\n\nWrapping up\n\nBitcoin has yet to become a worldwide accepted cryptocurrency but is already one of the most used by investors and regular people. Therefore, many major companies have already added a bitcoin payment option to their systems so that an extended target audience can pay with their bitcoins fast and easily. At the same time, these businesses are also using blockchain technologies to dig into web3 experiences.\n\nStay updated with all the insights.\n\nNavigate news, 1 email day.\n\nSubscribe to Qrius"

        "title": "Electrum Bitcoin Wallet Review - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Electrum Bitcoin Wallet is a non-custodial digital wallet that uses hot storage, and can combine with the services of a cold storage hardware wallet for extra security. Electrum is one of the oldest Bitcoin wallets, having originated in 2011. This wallet uses two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure no one else can access your BTC.\n\nTop perks\n\nStraightforward installation\n\nElectrum makes everything easy to download and install, walking you through every step of the process in their installation wizard. This takes all of the complex technological mumbo jumbo and figures it out for you. With Electrum, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting anything wrong during setup. After installation, you can be sure that everything is correct, and get to storing your Bitcoin fast.\n\nHardware wallet compatibility\n\nBy default, Electrum offers hot storage, which is open to invasion from hackers. Electrum also gives users the option to transfer their Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, keeping their coins safe offline. Users can also download the wallet on an offline device to achieve a similar result. Electrum supports many of the most powerful and popular hardware wallets around. It recommends the Ledger Nano series of hardware wallets for storing Bitcoin.\n\nPersonalized security\n\nElectrum offers different options for securing the Bitcoins you entrust to them. With Electrum, you can choose whether you want your wallet to be set up with multiple-signature security, 2FA, or standard security for watch-only wallets. These options give you more flexibility in how your Bitcoin is stored.\n\nIf you are looking for the highest in security, you might want a multi-signature wallet, which is the most secure of Electrum\u2019s options. Standard wallets have the least security measures. These might be best for users who wish to hold their Bitcoin on an offline device or transfer it to a hardware wallet. For a good middle ground between these two extremes, 2FA is a good choice. This option provides an added layer of security, while still allowing quick access to your funds.\n\nOpen-source application\n\nElectrum\u2019s software is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view and comment on the layout of the application\u2019s code. This means anyone can look over the code to find potential software errors or vulnerabilities. With more eyes on the makeup of the system, potential cracks in the system\u2019s defenses can be spotted before hackers can exploit them. Because of this, Electrum\u2019s design will be consistently updated to ensure evolving security.\n\nWhat could be improved\n\nBitcoin only\n\nAspiring investors may choose another wallet over Electrum due to its sole focus on Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin is the only coin supported on Electrum. If you are looking for a place to store all your digital currency, Electrum cannot help with this. Bitcoin is not the only well-known cryptocurrency anymore. An increase in the number of supported currencies would give Electrum the ability to serve a wider variety of crypto traders.\n\nPast security issues\n\nElectrum\u2019s service has experienced some security breaches. Years ago, many users lost the Bitcoin stored on their hot wallets, and Electrum took much heat for it. Today, Electrum offers more robust security measures for their users. Electrum is once again considered a safe place to store Bitcoin. Yet, if a security breach can happen once, it may happen again. Malicious users are always finding new ways to get around successful security measures. Electrum\u2019s past safety failures raise concerns about the future, even with improved security measures in place. This encourages more users to invest in cold storage hardware to hold their coins should they choose to use Electrum."

        "content": "Top perks\n\nPeer-to-peer Bitcoin purchases\n\nIf you're looking for a place for peer-to-peer Bitcoin purchases, LocalBitcoins is one of the most popular options. Users can post and respond to classified ads with offers to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nCOMPARE TOP PICKS: Best Places to Buy Bitcoin\n\nOn every transaction, LocalBitcoins keeps the Bitcoin in an escrow account. After the seller confirms they've received the funds, the Bitcoin is released from escrow and sent to the buyer. This provides protection for both the buyer and the seller. However, it's worth mentioning there are scammers who attempt to steal people's crypto or cash.\n\nNo buying or selling fees\n\nThere are no fees for buying or selling Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins, making it an affordable way to invest in crypto. If you post an ad, LocalBitcoins charges a 1% escrow fee on every completed trade. You can avoid that fee by responding to ads instead of posting your own. It's an active exchange, so there are usually plenty of offers available.\n\nWide variety of payment options\n\nLocalBitcoins allows users to choose nearly any payment method they want. Users list the payment methods they'll accept in their ads. When you search for offers, you can add filters for specific payment methods.\n\nHere are some of the payment methods available on LocalBitcoins:\n\nBank transfers\n\nMoney wires\n\nPayment apps, such as Zelle and PayPal\n\nOther cryptocurrencies\n\nThe most notable payment method you can't use on LocalBitcoins is cash. This actually used to be an option, but the exchange removed it in 2019.\n\nReputation system\n\nEvery profile on LocalBitcoins includes information on that user's trading history, including their number of confirmed trades, feedback score, and comments from other users. This is a good way to find reputable buyers and sellers, although it can also make getting started on LocalBitcoins difficult. Some users won't trade with anyone who hasn't already completed a certain number of transactions."

        "title": "How to build a crypto portfolio without spending any money or time trading - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Starting to invest in cryptocurrency does not necessarily require connecting with a bank account or spending fiat to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Another way to earn cryptocurrency and build a portfolio is to complete a variety of tasks on various Web3 platforms.\n\nUsing decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, users can earn cryptocurrency and then swap, sell or hold it in centralized or decentralized wallets without even having to spend money.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few ways to build a crypto portfolio without connecting a bank account.\n\nInteract with Web3 browsers\n\nA person without cryptocurrency knowledge might be intimidated by the process of downloading wallets and performing on-chain transactions. An alternative is simply interacting with technology, and currently, there are multiple ways to experiment with different crypto platforms. One is replacing Web2 technology with a Web3 counterpart browser.\n\nGoogle dominates the web browser and search engine space, making money off users by selling data to advertisers. The Brave browser is an alternative platform where users earn Basic Attention Token (BAT) and fully own their data while searching. Users earn from their activity on advertisers\u2019 websites, and Brave does not sponsor search engine posts, which provides users with a more decentralized search experience.\n\nCurrently, Brave shares 70% of its advertising revenue, and some users choose to sell their earned BAT on centralized exchanges or through Web3 wallets like MetaMask.\n\nSocial media content creation and free NFT mints\n\nNFTs continue to grow in popularity, and potential crypto investors can use a variety of free software to analyze the wallet addresses of successful NFT investors that minted high-value NFTs and also try to find free NFT minting and whitelist opportunities.\n\nAI Birds minting overview with notable groups. Source: DegenMint\n\nColin Helm, CEO of a free-to-play metaverse platform Caesarverse, noted the importance of free NFTs in the space:\n\n\u201cIf users follow social media and community channels closely, they can always find very generous raffles, gain some assets that improve their gameplay experience and build their crypto portfolio just from playing games they may enjoy.\u201d\n\nSome users that have worked the free minting system have generated NFTs that eventually reached a 10 ETH floor.\n\nRelated: How to do mobile cryptocurrency mining?\n\nSimilar to how NFTs require a social media base for advertising, new blockchains and protocols also require immense amounts of testing and a user base in order to ensure sustainable growth at launch.\n\nSome blockchains like Arbitrum do not have a token, but the hint of an eventual airdrop tends to attract users to the protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2022, 1inch users on Optimism received an airdrop of 300,000 OP for their prelaunch usage of the blockchain.\n\nFor users without the technical knowledge to use new blockchains, social activity-based airdrops could be an easier way to earn cryptocurrency. With social airdrops, users may have to follow, like and share certain accounts on social media. Users will most likely need to use a decentralized wallet like MetaMask in order to receive social airdrops.\n\nBug bounties and beta tests\n\nMany crypto and DeFi projects have set tokens aside for marketing, bug finding, beta testing and content creation tasks. Many crypto investors earn tokens by auditing, testing, and creating brand designs, marketing materials, music and other content. Lending one\u2019s skills to crypto projects is a perfect way to get started.\n\nJenny \u201cDJen\u201d Schorsch, founder of GlamJam, shared her experience regarding how she built a brand and started in crypto without upfront costs:\n\n\u201cStart by creating value for the community for free first. After you have your community, you start generating profit and assets with them. I started using NFTs for ticketing and allowed Web3 companies sponsorships for my favorite projects. Before I knew it, people were offering me crypto for participation in events.\u201d\n\nWhile most users think that a bank account and fiat currency are necessary for interacting with blockchains and cryptocurrency, this is not the case.\n\nWith a little effort, aspiring crypto investors can earn cryptocurrency and NFTs without any upfront cost, other than time.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "With close to 3,000 different cryptocurrencies in the market right now, it\u2019s clear that despite their volatile nature, they are here to stay. But did you know almost all cryptocurrencies were born from the same concept?\n\nNearly all cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology. Also referred to as the shared ledger, given its distributed nature, blockchain is considered one of the most secure digital technologies.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is a list of records called blocks that store data publicly and in chronological order. The information is encrypted using cryptography to ensure that the privacy of the user is not compromised and data cannot be altered.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nInformation on a Blockchain network is not controlled by a centralized authority, unlike modern financial institutions. The participants of the network maintain the data, and they hold the democratic authority to approve any transaction which can happen on a Blockchain network. Therefore, a typical Blockchain network is a public Blockchain.\n\nAs long as you have access to the network, you have access to the data within the Blockchain. If you are a participant in the Blockchain network, you will have the same copy of the ledger, which all other participants have. Even if one node or data on one particular participant computer gets corrupted, the other participants will be alerted immediately, and they can rectify it as soon as possible.\n\nTo understand the promise of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies and their advantages over traditional (fiat) currencies, let\u2019s look at the issues inherent in fiat currency first.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Work?\n\nBlockchain is a combination of three important technologies - cryptographic keys, a peer-to-peer network, and a digital ledger. The cryptographic keys are of two types - private key and public key. Each individual or node has both of these keys and they are used to create a digital signature.\n\nThis digital signature is a unique and secure digital identity reference and the most important aspect of blockchain technology. Every transaction is authorized by the digital signature of the owner.\n\nA deal or transaction is authorized by a mathematical verification in a peer-to-peer network. This peer-to-peer network is a large group of individuals who act as authorities to reach a consensus on transactions, among other things.\n\nAll of these transactions are stored in a structure known as the digital ledger. In layman\u2019s terms, the digital ledger works like a spreadsheet containing all the numerous nodes in a network and has the history of all purchases made by each node. The information contained in the digital ledger is highly secure and the digital signature safeguards it from being tampered with. The most interesting part about this ledger is that anyone can see the data, but no one is able to corrupt it.\n\nHistory of Blockchain\n\nIn 1982, David Chaum proposed the first-ever blockchain-like protocol in his dissertation, Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups. This concept was further worked on by Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta in 1991, where they described the process of a cryptographically secured chain of blocks with timestamps that could not be tampered with.\n\nHowever, blockchain was first popularized by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. He improved the design using hashcash-like methods to timestamp each block without the need for a central authority or \u201ctrusted parties\u201d. These improvements were so innovative and have become the backbone of cryptocurrencies today.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Do Transactions Fail?\n\nImagine two people are making a money transaction. Now, assuming the sender has properly sent the money from his bank, there\u2019s no chance the transaction will fail, right?\n\nActually, there are several things that can go wrong, including:\n\nSomething could have gone wrong at the bank (such as a technical issue) The sender\u2019s account could have been hacked The transfer limits of the day could have been exceeded Debited from one account, never credited on the other side Issues with data\n\nHowever, none of these problems are applicable to cryptocurrencies. First, let\u2019s have a look at what cryptocurrencies are.\n\nWhat is a Cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that can be used to verify the transfer of assets, control the addition of new units, and secure financial transactions using cryptography.\n\nOne of the cryptocurrencies\u2019 most important advantages over normal (fiat) currencies is that they are not controlled by any central authority. Without a central point of failure or a \u201cvault,\u201d the funds cannot be hacked or stolen.\n\nAs an analogy, think of the popular Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. You can make changes to the data on your own that may differ from earlier versions of the spreadsheet that are shared with others. But if you make changes to a Google Sheets document, on the other hand, those changes also show up in every other shared copy. Similarly, the shared and distributed nature of cryptocurrencies keeps everyone on the same page.\n\nTherefore, the transparency and distributed nature of blockchain technology are what make cryptocurrencies (at least those that use the blockchain) secure.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Cryptocurrencies?\n\nThere are several cryptocurrencies available in the market right now. Some of the more popular ones are:\n\nBitcoin\n\nLitecoin\n\nEthereum\n\nZ Cash\n\nDash\n\nRipple\n\nMonero\n\nNEM\n\nStellar\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are close to 3,000 cryptocurrencies in the market\u2014a market that has become nearly saturated with options. Most experts say the vast majority of these options will eventually fail as users begin to coalesce around just a few.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nThe Bitcoin Story\n\nBitcoin was introduced in 2009 by someone or a group of people known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It aimed to solve the problem faced by fiat currencies with the help of Blockchain technology. As of 2018, there were more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies that followed the concepts of Bitcoin and Blockchain, including, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple.\n\nWhenever a sender has made a transaction, he sends Bitcoins to a receiver by submitting the transaction on a public Blockchain network of Bitcoin. The miners around the world do verifications to authenticate users. There are specific participants in the Bitcoin network who are identified as miners, and they verify the authenticity of the sender and the receiver. They also validate whether the sender has enough Bitcoins to send to the receiver and also ensure that the sanity of the underlying Blockchain network to the Bitcoin is not corrupt.\n\nOnce the miner has authenticated the transaction and verified all the parameters, the transaction is added to a block, and then that block is made part of the main Blockchain. After this is done, transactions that were associated with the block are executed. Once the transaction is complete, the block is added, and the ledgers across all the nodes are updated, thereby allowing all the participants to have the same copy of the information.\n\nFeatures of Blockchain\n\nThese are the four features of Blockchain which we are going to talk about in detail:\n\nWe have a public distributed ledger, which works using a hashing encryption.\n\nEvery block has a hash value, which is the digital signature of the block.\n\nAll the transactions are approved and verified on the Blockchain network using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nThe Blockchain network utilizes the resources of the miners, who are there to validate the transactions for rewards.\n\nAre you interested to learn about Blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies? Check out the Blockchain Certification Training and learn them today.\n\nPublic Distributed Ledger\n\nA public distributed ledger is a collection of digital data that is shared, synchronized, and replicated around the world, across multiple sites, countries, and institutions. Now let's consider a blockchain that can be accessed by anyone in the network around the world. If someone tries to alter data in one of the blocks, everyone in the network can see the alteration, because everyone in the network has a copy of the ledger. In this way, data tampering is prevented.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nHash Encryption\n\nBlockchain uses cryptography (see definition of \"cryptography\" above) to ensure that all the data in the blocks is kept secure from unauthorized access and is not altered. Blockchain uses SHA-256 for encryption. SHA-256 is one of the strongest hash functions available. This cryptographic hash algorithm generates an almost unique 256-bit signature for a text. Blockchain also uses digital signatures to validate users.\n\nEach user has a public and private key. The public key is used to identify the user uniquely, and the private key gives the user access to everything in the account. In the process from the sender's side, the sender's message is passed through a hash function; then, the output is passed through a signature algorithm with the user's private key, then the user's digital signature is obtained. In the transmission, the user's message, digital signature, and public key are transmitted.\n\nIn the process on the receiver's side, the message is passed through a cryptographic function to get a hash value. That hash value is compared with the hash output obtained bypassing the digital signature and public key through a verification function.\n\nAs mentioned, each block in a blockchain uses SHA-256 to encrypt and therefore secure the data. Every block has four fields:\n\nPrevious hash\u2014this field stores the hash of the previous block in the Blockchain\n\nTransaction details\u2014this field contains information regarding several transactions\n\nNonce\u2014this field contains a random value (the nonce value) whose sole purpose is to act as a variate for the hash value\n\nHash address\u2014this field contains the unique identification of the block; it is a hex value of 64 characters, both letters, and numbers, obtained by using the SHA-256 algorithm\n\nThe first three values (previous hash, transaction details, and nonce) are passed through a hashing function to produce the fourth value, the hash address of that particular block.\n\nProof of Work\n\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. What is proof of work? It is a piece of data that's very hard to produce (meaning it takes a lot of time or costs a lot of money) but can be easily verified by others, and it satisfies specific requirements. With bitcoin, proof of work is a competition among miners who want to add a block to the Blockchain\u2014meaning they have to find the nonce value for the block by solving a mathematical puzzle.\n\nOnce a miner discovers a nonce value, he or she spreads the word throughout the network, and if other miners validate the claim, the miner is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins or another form of compensation. Finding a nonce value also adds that block to the Blockchain.\n\nChoosing a nonce value is the primary objective of miners. They have to find a value that is less than the target value. If they find a value greater than the target, then their mining effort is rejected. But if they can successfully generate a hash value using the nonce that is less than the target value, then their effort is accepted. This is where the entire computational power of the miner is used\u2014to generate the hash value.\n\nFinding a nonce value requires a lot of time, money, and resources. When the nonce value is found, the miner spreads the word about finding this value, other miners attempt to validate the claim, and if it's verified, the miner gets the reward. So a miner is rewarded for being the first one to find the nonce, and that adds a block to the Blockchain.\n\nAs mentioned, as of today, the reward is 12.5 bitcoins. Every four years, the amount of bitcoin a miner can earn is reduced by half. Mining is the only way new bitcoins can be generated, and it ensures that there's a limit to how many bitcoins can exist in the market.\n\nMiners\n\nMining is the process of a miner being rewarded for finding the appropriate nonce first. Miners get paid in Bitcoins, and a successful verification is the only way the Bitcoins get added to the network. That is the concept of mining, and when a miner has completed the proof of work consensus, he is rewarded.\n\nA miner's fee is 12.5 Bitcoins for adding a block onto the Blockchain; however, the reward reduces by half every four years. When the fourth year approaches, the Bitcoin reward will go down to 6.25 Bitcoins, and miners also get the sum of all the transaction fees for a particular block.\n\nThe Walmart Problem\n\nWalmart was facing an issue where people were returning goods citing quality issues. Now, in an organization of Walmart\u2019s size and scope, it was quite a task to determine where bad products originated from within their supply chain. Their supply chain involved the following steps:\n\nTo ensure their reputation wasn\u2019t tarnished, they incorporated blockchain into their supply chain. Each event and detail within each step of the supply chain was logged. Now, in the scenario where a product was deemed bad and returned, Walmart would be able to determine where the issue with the product originated from in the supply chain.\n\nUses of Blockchain\n\nThe use of blockchain goes far beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Here are some of the most common uses of blockchain in different industries:\n\nAnti-money laundering tracking system\n\nNFT marketplaces\n\nOriginal content creation\n\nReal-time IoT operating systems\n\nAdvertising insights\n\nMusic royalties tracking\n\nCross-border payments\n\nVoting mechanism\n\nSupply chain and logistics monitoring\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nOther Fields That Use Blockchain\n\nThe financial services industry is an open field that uses blockchain technology extensively, but it's not the only one. Forbes mentions healthcare, crowdfunding, and ride-sharing in its article \"Eight Ways Blockchain Will Impact the World Beyond Cryptocurrency.\" Let's look at a few other fields.\n\nTravel\n\nBlockchain technology can be used for things like:\n\nTracking luggage, especially with multiple flights in one itinerary and international flights\n\nIdentifying passengers, saving time, and reducing lines and wait times\n\nMaking and accepting payments for services\n\nMusic\n\nThe rise of digital music has posed problems regarding issues like piracy and artist compensation. Blockchain can:\n\nHelp prevent piracy (illegal sharing) of music files\n\nBe used to compensate artists for purchased songs and albums\n\nCyber Security\n\nEven a giant company like Lockheed Martin is using Blockchain in its cybersecurity efforts. Blockchain can:\n\nHelp secure sensitive data, thanks to its cryptography feature\n\nEliminate the need for passwords, because users and devices can be authenticated using the public and private keys\n\nHuman Resources\n\nBlockchain technology is a natural fit for improving time-consuming and costly HR procedures. For example, it can:\n\nEliminate the need to run individual verification checks on potential employees\u2014blockchain transactions can store data regarding identity and employment history\n\nTrack payments and expenses, making things like paying taxes much easier for both employers and employees\n\nBlockchain as a Use Case in Banking\n\nBlockchain finds excellent use in banking. As of now, a user validates his identity to each bank he goes to, over and over. Is there a way we can ease the process with Blockchain? The answer is yes. We can use truffle, ethereum, ganache, and smart contracts, which are part of the Blockchain technology ecosystem, to make it work.\n\nDevelop a Bright Future in Blockchain Technology\n\nAs you can see, blockchain technology is enabling a whole new class of cryptocurrencies with unparalleled security and ease of use. While not all of the 3,000+ cryptocurrencies being developed are going to last, blockchain technology has a bright future. That\u2019s why getting trained and certified in blockchain technology is a smart choice for your future as well.

        "title": "Bitcoin token recovery is not a fork - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The Bitcoin token recovery process doesn\u2019t require a \u2018fork\u2019 of the blockchain, be it soft, hard, or sterling silver.\n\nMost of us will recall with some unease our first formal dinner, at which we were presented with what appeared to be a serious overabundance of forks. Confusion reigned until someone helpfully whispered to us that we start from the outside and move inward with each course. Relieved by this knowledge, we recovered our sense of decorum and went back to regaling our dinner companions with witty anecdotes. (Sure we did.)\n\nSimilar confusion appears to reign regarding the role\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of \u2018forks\u2019 in the process of token recovery on the Bitcoin blockchain. The recovery issue has been in the spotlight largely due to the efforts of Tulip Trading Limited (TTL) to convince a U.K. court that blockchain developers owe fiduciary and tortious duties to blockchain users who have been the victim of digital asset theft.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.K. Court of Appeal unanimously overturned a High Court decision to dismiss TTL\u2019s case against the blockchain developers, paving the way for a full trial on the issue. The judges\u2019 ruling stated that digital assets are \u201centrusted into the care of the developers,\u201d who may \u201crealistically\u201d have \u201ca duty to act to introduce code so that an owner\u2019s Bitcoin can be transferred to safety in the circumstances alleged by Tulip.\u201d\n\nTTL is owned by Dr. Craig Wright, the real-world figure behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous author of the 2008 Bitcoin white paper. TTL is endeavoring to recover over \u00a31 billion worth of digital assets, the private keys to which were stolen in a 2021 hack of Wright\u2019s computer.\n\nWright\u2019s original Bitcoin protocol contained an Alert Key function intended to notify Bitcoin miners to freeze tokens stolen from their rightful owner(s). But this function was permanently disabled by the developer group known as Bitcoin Core, many of whom are among those being called to task in the TTL case before the U.K. courts.\n\nWright has championed efforts to reintroduce some legal sanity to ownership of blockchain assets through the Digital Asset Recovery process. Predictably, this has earned him the usual brickbats from supporters of the BTC token that emerged from the developers\u2019 vivisection of the original Bitcoin protocol (now safely preserved in the form of Bitcoin BSV, aka BSV).\n\nLast October, the Bitcoin Association for BSV launched the Blacklist Manager software tool to permit miners to freeze digital assets on the BSV blockchain\u2014provided that a court order or equivalent documentation has been secured. Blacklist Manager is a key plank of Digital Asset Recovery, which maintains that a blockchain isn\u2019t some anarchic free-for-all space where property law doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the current system\u2014in which victims of theft have to plead with exchanges or coin mixers not to allow thieves to convert stolen tokens and obfuscate the trail of digital breadcrumbs\u2014is untenable. When your hopes of recovering your property rely on dodgy exchanges like Binance\u2014a key conduit for criminal darknet marketplaces\u2014then abandon all hope, ye who transact here.\n\nFreeze, remove, reissue\n\nThe YouTuber known as Crypto Kid T.V.! recently discussed Wright\u2019s efforts with Ruadhan O, founder of Seasonal Tokens, an Ethereum/Polygon-based \u201ccyclical cryptocurrency ecosystem containing four tokens: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.\u201d The episode in question was titled \u2018Bitcoin Expert Ruadhan O On Craig Wright Going to Court With $2.5 Billion Demand.\u2019\n\nRuadhan believes the judges in the TTL case have made it plain that it is \u201cunacceptable for cryptocurrency to be beyond the law,\u201d and therefore, Wright is \u201cvery likely to succeed at getting the judges to understand how to freeze Bitcoins.\u201d But, with no disrespect intended toward Ruadhan, his \u2018Bitcoin expert\u2019 status takes a hit when he describes the process by which TTL might be reunited with its purloined assets.\n\nRuadhan references Blacklist Manager, noting that the U.K. court could order the Bitcoin Core developers to add this tool to the BTC blockchain\u2019s code. Ruadhan claims the result of this wouldn\u2019t be the movement of stolen tokens from one address to another, merely the freezing of the stolen tokens at their current address.\n\nBut Ruadhan claims that this freezing would require a \u2018soft fork\u2019 of the blockchain, which involves wrapping a rule change into a software envelope that essentially tells blockchain nodes to ignore the rule change. That would be arguably less disruptive than a \u2018hard fork,\u2019 in which disagreement over implementing software rules causes one faction to branch off into a completely separate chain with its own ruleset.\n\nBut this is a misrepresentation of (a) what TTL is proposing and (b) what is required to accomplish that proposal. No fork\u2014hard or soft\u2014is necessary. Token recovery merely freezes the stolen assets, and then they are removed and reissued at the tip of the chain, with a full audit trail, so everyone recognizes their provenance.\n\nThere have been preliminary discussions of ways to further enhance this process, including incorporating country codes into Bitcoin transactions, effectively marking them with jurisdictional tags. That could permit individual jurisdictions to determine what type of transactions can be conducted within their borders, but it would also allow more focused recovery processes based on the circumstances of the individual whose assets have been stolen.\n\nIf you (legally) build it, they will come\n\nAs Wright is forever reminding us, code isn\u2019t law; law is law. Absent that principle, digital assets will forever lurk in the financial shadows, of primary benefit to scammers, ransomware hackers, and other malefactors.\n\nWright says it\u2019s disingenuous to claim that Bitcoin was designed to be outside the law and that transactions are unrecoverable. The use case presented within the white paper focuses exclusively on small casual payments, i.e., under US$500. Just like cash, reversing transactions requires a level of proof that makes applying this to small and micro-level payments impractical. For this reason, Bitcoin is designed to be unable to be reversed at very small levels.\n\nHigher level transactions\u2014in the case of cash, those exceeding US$10,000\u2014require identity solutions and other provisioning that wasn\u2019t included in the original Bitcoin release, such as know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards. While the white paper stated how identity is firewalled in Bitcoin, that doesn\u2019t mean identity doesn\u2019t exist. Rather, identity is firewalled off the blockchain, in wallets and other applications outside the primary Bitcoin protocol.\n\nJohnny Jaswal is managing director and general counsel at the Toronto-based Jaswal Institute, which provides regulatory, legal, government relations, strategic, and related investment banking advisory services. Jaswal is also assisting with Token Recovery, whose mission Jaswal describes as \u201cbringing the law to digital assets to increase the retail, institutional, and enterprise adoption of blockchain structures and digital assets by fostering confidence in these powerful systems.\u201d\n\nJaswal told CoinGeek that \u201cthe suggestion that a lack of technological understanding or lost keys can lead to someone losing ownership of assets is not workable in a functioning and thriving financial system.\u201d Referencing Ruadhan\u2019s comments regarding the TTL case, Jaswal said that despite the work his group has been doing to raise awareness of the realities of digital asset recovery, \u201cmany still don\u2019t have it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most misunderstood component in the market is that, similar to the legal principles being espoused in the TTL matter, the recovery process centers on taking existing legal frameworks and applying them to blockchain technology; for example, by establishing legal ownership over an asset and implementing that ownership by mandating the enforcement of rules via the network, as stated in the Bitcoin white paper. \u2018Not your keys, not your coins\u2019 is contrary to the law and impedes the efficient operation of the market, and the work we are doing at Token Recovery is making that clear.\u201d\n\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery on Bitcoin Explained\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "To say that 2022 is a catastrophic year for cryptocurrencies would be an understatement.\n\nFollowing a series of high-profile collapses from stablecoins to crypto exchanges, investors entered 2023 with a mix of trepidation and resignation.\n\nHowever, it seems as though cryptocurrencies might be tumbling out of a rough patch as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several other cryptocurrencies have started to rise.\n\nToday, the price of Bitcoin has rallied by at least a third more since the start of the year.\n\nIs this a fluke, or has the dreaded \u2018crypto winter\u2019 begun to thaw to give way to summer?\n\nHas Bitcoin turned bullish?\n\nBitcoin is showing bullish tendencies these days/ Image Credit: Bitcoin.com News\n\nEven though the crypto market is still a far cry from its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021, there are signs that things are looking up.\n\nBitcoin, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation is experiencing an unexpectedly strong start to the year.\n\nThe question is why.\n\nFor a start, it might be due to the US Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its interest rate hikes, which helped Bitcoin to maintain its rising trajectory and outperform other asset classes.\n\nIn addition, analysts feel that favourable market conditions (i.e. US inflation easing for the seventh consecutive month) could see Bitcoin recapture some of its losses in 2023.\n\nAccording to Nigel Green, CEO of the financial advisory firm deVere Group, we might technically still be in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control.\n\nHalving \u2013 a pivotal event for Bitcoin\n\nBut a more likely reason behind the bullish behaviour is the once every four years Bitcoin halving event, which is due to take place in 2024.\n\nCurrently, miners are paid 6.25 BTC for each Bitcoin block mined. This number will reduce to 3.125 BTC next year at the halving.\n\nAs a result of the halving cycle, the supply of available Bitcoin in the market decreases, which raises the value of Bitcoins.\n\nFor that reason, halving is a monumental event that would help lift the prices of Bitcoin out of the doldrums.\n\nBitcoin halving could trigger prices to rise/ Image Credit: Cointelegraph\n\nAnd judging from historical data, investors can expect a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s pricing in the months after halving.\n\nIn fact, commodity guru Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin could reach six figures in a couple of years.\n\nI fully expect Bitcoin in the next couple of years, by probably around the halving, maybe 2025, to get to US$100,000. Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone\n\nLastly, survival of the fittest is an evolutionary theory that extends to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe shockwaves of 2022, while devastating to investors, should be seen as an industry-wide detox to get rid of the black sheep and the weak players.\n\nRaoul Ullens, the co-founder of Brussels Blockchain Week, seems to think so too.\n\n\u201cAn unhealthy ecosystem will not attract the masses. A drop in the crypto asset markets is not only necessary but also healthy, contributing as it does to rebalancing the valuation of cryptocurrencies,\u201d he said.\n\nCryptocurrencies are not going away\n\nThere might be no urgent case for CBDC now but the study by MAS does envision it/ Image Credit: Cointelegraph\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have suffered their worst year, but their biggest fans are more than aware of the risks involved with this volatile investment and choose to take the plunge anyway.\n\nAnd considering the growing interest in the metaverse, cryptocurrencies will continue to be used as a digital currency for transactions in the digital space.\n\nIn addition, it is likely that we will see the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the future, a move that will give digital assets more credence.\n\nTherefore, while the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) might have assessed that the case for CBDCs in Singapore is not compelling enough after a pilot study, they have not ruled out its possibility in the future.\n\nFor those who do not mind taking a punt, dipping your fingers into crypto right now might not be such a bad idea.\n\nRemember, just don\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Nasdaq"

At its peak in November 2021, so-called alt-coins had a total market capitalisation of an incredible $3trillion (\u00a32.5trillion).\n\nThat\u2019s the same as the UK\u2019s annual total economic output.\n\nAll that for a digital currency that isn\u2019t backed by any central bank, has zero security and can vanish in a second with no redress.\n\nCrypto is the misbegotten offspring of the US technology boom, but at least that brought real world progress.\n\nApple gave us iPhones, Amazon let us shop without leaving the house, Netflix amused us during the pandemic, Tesla sells electric status symbols and Twitter frees us to issue death threats to total strangers.\n\nWe may not like them, but at least we understand them.\n\nCrypto developers should tear themselves away from their TikTok feeds and use their undoubted skills to build real companies in the real world, making goods and services that real people want to buy.\n\nMake the world a better place, rather than stupider, dirtier (Bitcoin has more carbon emissions than Ireland) and more corrupt."

Nigeria, is the only African country to make it to the top five of the ranking according to the study.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency betting experts cryptobetting.org combined Google Trends searches across the globe for countries searching for Bitcoin, alongside the number of Bitcoin ATMs in each country per 100,000 people and data on Crypto ownership per country. These metrics were then combined into an index to allocate each country a rating out of 100 to reveal which countries are most interested in Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. United States \u2013 54.95/100.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe United States ranks as the most Bitcoin-obsessed country in the world, with a total score of 54.95. The country boasts a high number of Bitcoin ATMs, clearly indicating the growing interest in the cryptocurrency. In the United States, around 13.22% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin being the most popular choice among these individuals. The large number of Bitcoin ATMs, along with the high rate of ownership, places the United States among the top countries in terms of Bitcoin popularity globally. The interest and adoption of Bitcoin in the United States is a testament to the growing acceptance of digital currencies as a legitimate form of investment and financial instrument.\n\n2. El Salvador \u2013 46.19/100\n\nadvertisement\n\nEl Salvador is a unique and prominent player in the world of Bitcoin, with a total score of 46.19. The country ranks second globally on the scale of countries with the highest interest in Bitcoin, making it a standout destination for digital currency enthusiasts. What sets El Salvador apart is that it is one of only two countries in the world where Bitcoin is considered legal tender. This distinction could explain the high level of interest in the country, as evidenced by the highest global Google searches for Bitcoin originating from El Salvador. The country is also the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Latin America, with 212 Bitcoin ATMs available for use. The combination of being a legal tender and the large number of ATMs makes El Salvador a hub for Bitcoin activity and a prime example of the growing acceptance of digital currencies.\n\n3. Vietnam \u2013 35.69/100\n\nVietnam has positioned itself as a leader in terms of interest and adoption of Bitcoin, with a score of 35.69. Vietnam has the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership globally at 26%, while it also has 8 Bitcoin ATMs, making it easier for individuals to access and use the cryptocurrency. Vietnam\u2019s strong interest in Bitcoin has made it the most popular country for digital currency in Asia. This high level of ownership and accessibility highlights Bitcoin as a legitimate form of investment in Vietnam and the wider Asia region.\n\n4. Canada \u2013 35.49/100\n\nCanada has a strong and growing interest in Bitcoin, with a score of 35.49 therefore placing fourth on the list. Canada has a large number of Bitcoin ATMs, with 2,645 ATMs available for use, and has the second highest number of Bitcoin ATMs per 100,000 people. In Canada, 4.1% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with the majority being Bitcoin. This high number of ATMs and the growing ownership of Bitcoin contribute towards a total score of 35.49 out of 100.\n\n5. Nigeria \u2013 25.31/100\n\nNigeria is a leading player in the world of Bitcoin, with a score of 25.31, helping it rank as the fifth country most interested in Bitcoin. The country is the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Africa, and also ranks second globally for Google Trends searches for Bitcoin, further emphasizing the high level of interest and recognition of the digital currency in the country.\n\nWhere do the other countries place on the list?\n\nSwitzerland places sixth on the list and is the European country with the highest interest in Bitcoin with a score of 19.14 out of a 100, rounding out the top ten is the Philippines with 18.71, India with 17.08, Venezuela with 16.88 and lastly Austria with 16.31. The United Kingdom places 20th on the list with a score of 12.19.\n\nCommenting on the findings, a spokesperson for cryptobetting.org said: \u201cBitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency across the world and this study highlights its immense popularity, with countries from different continents placing on the list, emphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s global interest.\n\n\u201cWhile it was expected that the United States would place first in the study, it is interesting to see that El Salvador places second. This can be explained by the fact that El Salvador became the first country in the world to use Bitcoin as a legal tender.\u201d"

Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nHistorical patterns\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s bear market of 2014 lasted for 426 days or 14 months, followed by 1,065 days or 35 months of bullishness that started in early 2015 and hadn\u2019t ended until 2018. Then a bearish period ensued that lasted for 427 days or 14 months, upon the end of which a bull market of 1,004 days or 33 months began.\n\nIn mid-2021, another bear market started, which ended at the beginning of 2023, thanks to the renewed optimism in the industry. Should the crypto expert\u2019s analysis prove correct, and history repeats itself this time around as well, it means that the crypto sector is in for another 33-35 months of the bullish rally, potentially aiming for $220,000 by mid-2026.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was at press time changing hands at the price of $24,872, recording increases on all of its charts, including gains of 0.77% on the day, 14.2% across the previous week and 9.54% over the past month.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn terms of its nearer future, Bitcoin seems set upon a bullish rally this week as well, as it targets the $25,000 goal upon capitulating and then forming a foundation for the next leg up, the pattern which has often repeated itself before.\n\nAt the same time, PricePredictions\u2019 machine learning algorithms indicate only a slight increase in the price of the maiden digital asset by March 1, as the sentiment on the 1-week gauges remains positive, Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Source: Glassnode\n\nImplications of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction momentum\n\nNotably, this is a significant development for Bitcoin, which has struggled to maintain a consistent level of on-chain activity in recent months as the general market downturn impacted the asset. In this line, the metric highlights the overall health of the Bitcoin network while offering a glimpse of what to expect, especially on the price movement front.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time the transaction count surged, Bitcoin was building the foundation for a bull run that culminated in an all-time high of almost $69,000 in late 2021.\n\nIndeed, the renewed onchain activity corresponds with a period Bitcoin has recorded increased attention on various features. As reported by Finbold, the Taproot feature hit the highest adoption level at 13% on February 16.\n\nThe transaction craze can also be attributed to the Ordinal inscription on the network. In this case, Ordinals are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be permanently stored inside the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $24,709 with daily gains of slightly above 1%. Overall, BTC is attempting to reclaim the $25,000 position that has been touted to trigger a sustained rally toward $30,000.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.
