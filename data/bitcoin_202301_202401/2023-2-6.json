        "title": "Here's Why Mark Cuban Thinks Bitcoin Is a Better Investment Than Gold - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Mark Cuban is a billionaire and was featured on Shark Tank. As a result, many people trust the financial advice he gives. He's also a fan of cryptocurrencies and has indicated he's a big investor in Bitcoin.\n\nHe recently explained why he thinks Bitcoin is a better investment alternative than gold. Here's why Cuban thinks you should buy Bitcoin as a safe haven investment.\n\nThe simple reason Cuban prefers Bitcoin to gold\n\nRecently, Cuban appeared on the Club Random podcast run by comedian Bill Maher. After Maher commented that he puts money in gold as a safe haven investment, Cuban indicated he believes this is not a wise choice and that Bitcoin would be a better alternative.\n\n\"Gold is a store of value, and so is Bitcoin,\" Cuban said. But Cuban believes that gold, unlike Bitcoin, isn't a very safe investment to make as a hedge against economic uncertainty because someone could \"kill you and take your gold bar,\" in the event of a major economic catastrophe.\n\nBecause of the risk of having your physical gold stolen, Cuban has described investing in the metal as \"useless.\" Bitcoin is also a store of value, but unlike the precious metal, Bitcoin is \"protected by a digital ledger.\" Since Bitcoin is a digital asset, no one could just take it from you if things went wrong. For that reason, Cuban thinks it's a safer bet.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nShould you invest in Bitcoin (or gold)?\n\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts hope Bitcoin will one day become a digital version of gold, as there are commonalities between them, including the scarcity of both the physical metal and the number of Bitcoins that will be available over time. Cuban appears to suggest that Bitcoin could serve a similar purpose to gold as a store of value, but be an even better bet.\n\nBut there are important differences between them as well. Gold is tracked on a worldwide tracking system and has long been considered a safe-haven investment. It has a more-established track record. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a newer alternative investment that has been embraced by many institutional investors and is the most well-established and respected of the cryptocurrencies.\n\nREAD MORE: Best Cryptocurrency Apps\n\nIt's essential to understand the attributes of both investment options if you are deciding between them. And it is very possible that neither investment would be the right choice for you for a few key reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, you should always make sure you invest only in things you fully understand. And both precious metals investing and cryptocurrency investing can be pretty complicated as well as fairly risky. So if you don't know the details of investing in them, you should steer clear of both investments in favor of simpler alternatives available in your brokerage account, such as index funds that track the performance of the market as a whole.\n\nWhile index funds tracking the market may experience a temporary decline during economic trouble, you shouldn't be investing for the short-term anyway. And, the reality is, these assets present far less risk of losses over time than either Bitcoin or gold, so they may be a better bet for the majority of people than either of these two alternatives."

        "content": "Hut 8 (HUT) and U.S. Bitcoin are the latest crypto miners rushing to take advantage of the January Bitcoin rally.\n\nTwo firms announced their merger Wednesday, the latest deal in a wave of consolidation and balance sheet shuffling from battered miners still struggling with losses from last year. The new company would combine the two firms' resources and create a new crypto-mining giant named Hut 8 Corp.\n\nKey Takeaways Canada's Hut 8 and U.S. Bitcoin will merge their BTC mining businesses.\n\nThe new company will look to strengthen its balance sheet and compete in the mining space.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry has been rushing to sell BTC and restructure debt.\n\nAlso referred to as \"New Hut,\" the transaction will create a company that is listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The companies said that the combined firm will have a market capitalization of $990 million and will be owned by shareholders of both firms.\n\n\"New Hut will have access to approximately 825 MW of gross energy across all six sites with self-mining, hosting, and managed infrastructure operations,\" the companies said in a press release.\n\n\n\nThe deal is expected to establish New Hut as a large-scale, publicly traded Bitcoin miner that can strengthen its balance sheet and gain access to capital-raising opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis transaction has given us the opportunity to leverage the significant, unencumbered Bitcoin stack we have HODLed to date,\u201d said Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8. \u201cDuring the interim period, we plan to cover our operating costs through a combination of selling the Bitcoin we mine, selling from our stack, and/or exploring various debt options.\"\n\nHut 8 stock fell 8.6% in Tuesday trading after the merger announcement.\n\nCrypto Miners Rush to Restructure Debt\n\nWhile some miners have been able to buy new mining rigs and sites at firesale prices during bitcoin's downturn, others have been forced to file for bankruptcy or restructure.\n\nAustin's Core Scientific (CORZ) filed for bankruptcy in late December. Greenridge Generation Holdings (GREE) announced debt restructuring with its creditors in late January and on Wednesday Pennsylvania's Stronghold Digital (SDIG) did the same.\n\nHut 8 is just the latest in a wave of recent miners that have rushed to take advantage of the January Bitcoin rally. Las Vegas, Nevada-based, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) announced last week it would sell 1,500 BTC in a move the company said would help to fund operating costs.\n\n\u201cMarathon may continue to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, or for general corporate purposes,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry has been on the ropes since the decline in crypto assets started last year. The recent rally has allowed some much-needed balance sheet restructuring.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that the rush to sell holdings of the world's largest cryptocurrency could impact its price. Texas-based miners have already faced another headwind in late January with a recent winter storm in the state forcing miners in the area to scale back their production."

        "title": "Biden administration acknowledges it can force Bitcoin mines to disclose pollution - The Verge",
        "content": "Federal agencies have the authority to force crypto mining companies to divulge how much energy they use and greenhouse gas emissions they create, according to letters between the agencies and Democratic lawmakers shared exclusively with The Verge.\n\nBitcoin miners have flocked to the US over the past couple years, triggering concerns about electricity usage and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the proliferation of crypto mines across the US, there hasn\u2019t been solid data on what impact they each have on the power grid and national climate goals.\n\nThat could soon change as Democratic lawmakers pressure federal agencies to speed up plans to require crypto mining companies to report their emissions and energy consumption. That kind of transparency is an early, crucial step toward reining in pollution from crypto mines.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to use those authorities to implement a mandatory disclosure regime as rapidly as possible\u201d\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have described \u201cclear authority to require emissions and energy-use disclosures by cryptominers\u201d according to a letter several Democratic Congress members sent to the agencies yesterday. It asks each agency to provide timelines for when they plan to start executing those powers and collecting information.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to use those authorities to implement a mandatory disclosure regime as rapidly as possible,\u201d says the letter, which was signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Representatives Jared Huffman (D-CA), Katie Porter (D-CA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\nThis is the latest move in a saga that started last year, when Democratic lawmakers asked the biggest crypto mining companies in the US to share numbers on their energy consumption and pollution. Seven companies together have the capacity to use over 1 gigawatt of electricity, almost enough energy as every residence in Houston might use combined, according to the Congress members.\n\nWhile several companies provided some data, none of them gave full responses to Democrats\u2019 questions. That spurred the Congress members to ask the DOE and EPA in July to require that crypto companies publicly share information to get a more comprehensive picture of the impact they have on the grid and the environment.\n\nSeven companies together have the capacity to use over 1 gigawatt of electricity, almost enough energy as every residence in Houston might use combined, according to the Congress members\n\nWarren\u2019s office shared the DOE and EPA\u2019s responses to that July inquiry with The Verge. In November, the Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote a letter to Warren saying that the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has the authority to require crypto operations to report their energy use as \u201coperating facilities... engaged in... major energy consumption.\u201d Such a mandate would \u201crequire development of a new survey to collect this information,\u201d the letter says. The EIA could also require utilities to share information about how much electricity they sell to crypto companies.\n\nThe EPA, meanwhile, told lawmakers that the Clean Air Act gives it the ability to collect pollution data from facilities pumping out at least 25,000 tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide a year. Democrats\u2019 probe into the nation\u2019s largest crypto mines has already revealed that at least two companies run crypto mines in the US that fall into that category. Both of those companies already report those emissions under the Clean Air Act requirements.\n\nBut the letter Warren and her colleagues sent yesterday asks the EPA to clarify whether it has already listed every crypto operation that meets the 25,000-ton threshold \u2014 and, if not, when it plans to do so. The letter asks for answers by no later than March 6th. The Verge reached out to the EPA and DOE, but did not receive comments by time of publication.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t concrete numbers yet on just how dirty or energy-hungry crypto mines are in the US, initial estimates are striking. The crypto industry\u2019s operations in the US likely use roughly as much electricity as all of the nation\u2019s home computers combined, according to a September report from the White House. That report recommended that the EPA and DOE work together to develop performance standards that would push crypto companies to transition to clean energy while using less energy overall. If that doesn\u2019t work, the report suggests that the Biden \u201cAdministration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation.\u201d\n\nIf that happens, the policies would primarily target Bitcoin \u2014 still the most popular and most polluting cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, have already ditched the energy-intensive code that the Bitcoin network refuses to give up."

        "content": "Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payment network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, has reached an all-time high in terms of capacity, or the amount of bitcoin (BTC) locked in payment channels.\n\nThe payment channel capacity on the Lightning Network has grown 63% since the beginning of last year, according to data from The Block Research. Currently, the network has over 5,490 BTC ($128 million) in capacity, up from 3,350 BTC on Jan. 1, 2022. This is being seen as a positive sign for the adoption of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to enable fast and cheap micropayments by allowing participants to transact directly without the need for immediate settlement on the blockchain. It operates as a network of bi-directional payment channels between participants, allowing for off-chain transactions that are eventually settled on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt was designed to mitigate the issues seen on the Bitcoin mainnet, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. The network achieves this by enabling users to open payment channels between themselves, which allows it to handle high amounts of low-value transfers without having to broadcast every transaction to the Bitcoin main network.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe network's ability to mitigate the issues seen on the Bitcoin mainnet has made it an attractive option for both businesses and individuals. For example, the integration of Bitcoin payments in El Salvador was made possible by Strike, a payment service based on the Lightning Network. Similarly, Twitter adopted the Lightning Network to enable Bitcoin tips on its platform in 2021.\n\nThe growth of the Lightning Network's capacity coincides with a short-term rally in Bitcoin's price. The cryptocurrency has increased by 38% since January 1, 2023, rising from $16,500 to $22,800 at the time of writing, per CoinGecko data. The price is still down 66% from an all-time high of $69,000 recorded in November 2021."

        "content": "More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the cryptocurrency market in 2022 as the fallout from the FTX collapse weighed on investor confidence.\n\nBitcoin rose above $23,000 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed an economics forum in Washington, D.C., saying that inflation is coming down.\n\nBitcoin added 1% to $23,236.80, according to Coin Metrics. Ether rose 1.3% to $1,667.63. Bitcoin struggled to hold the $23,000 level on Monday after dipping below that mark over the weekend.\n\nPowell said in a question-and-answer session at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. that although the process of getting inflation down has started, it \"has a long way to go\" and that these are \"the very early stages.\"\n\n\"We expect 2023 to be a year of significant declines in inflation. It's actually our job to make sure that that's the case,\" he said. \"My guess is it will take certainly into not just this year, but next year to get down close to 2%.\"\n\nCrypto prices briefly turned lower alongside the stock market, after Powell said future economic reports may force the central bank to keep hiking rates aggressively.\n\nTreasury yields declined during the speech \u2013 the 10-year note yield fell 1 basis point and the 2-year lost 5 basis points. The U.S. dollar index also dipped. Yields and the dollar index tend to move inversely to crypto.\n\nAfter climbing about 40% to start the year, bitcoin has hit a speed bump in the past week as investors who have doubted the staying power of the rally prepared for further macro-driven volatility in crypto prices this year."

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nShe got in touch online with the unnamed person in April and continued communicating with them over WhatsApp, per the outlet.\n\nThe executive was told she could receive the kitten for free, but that she would have to pay transport and insurance fees via cryptocurrency, per a case briefing the Hong Kong Police Force sent to Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe complied, opening a cryptocurrency account and sending the funds to the accused scammer's e-wallet, the authorities said.\n\nThen, the woman was fed a tall tale that the cat had died during the shipping process. At the same time, another unnamed individual posing as a foreign bank employee contacted her, saying she would be compensated for the cat's death with an insurance payout of around $150,000, police said, per the briefing.\n\nThere was just one catch: The executive would have to make another payment, this time as a guarantee or administration fee, according to police.\n\nShe followed the instructions, and by the time she realized the entire interaction was a scam, she'd bought $764,574 worth of cryptocurrency and sent it all to the fraudster, the authorities said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe total sum was transferred over 40 Bitcoin transactions between July and November. It was only in January that the executive thought something was amiss and reported her case to the police, the SCMP reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter.\n\nNo one has been arrested in connection to the case yet, police said.\n\nCrypto scams have surged worldwide in the last few years, with losses in 2021 totaling almost 60 times that of losses recorded in 2018, the Federal Trade Commission reported in June. Scammers made off with around $1 billion in crypto in 2021 alone, per the FTC.\n\nBlockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reported a higher estimate for that year, saying $14 billion was taken by crypto scammers in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPets are often in the mix, too. In April, New Zealand authorities warned of scammers selling puppies using photos they found online, asking potential buyers to transfer more than $1,200 in crypto for purchasing, transport, vaccination, or insurance fees.\n\nIn 2018, Bitcoin scammers targeted owners of lost dogs in North Carolina, demanding ransoms for the animals when they didn't have the pets in their possession."

        "title": "Looking for Exposure to Bitcoin? These 2 Small Bitcoin Mining Stocks Are a 'Must-Own,' According to One Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The end goal of investing is profit, and few investments have shown the long-term profit of bitcoin. Yes, the true story in cryptocurrency is its extreme volatility, but the underlying fact is simple: investors who bought into bitcoin five years ago, and held on, have tripled their money. Even this past January, BTC surged 40%.\n\nBut buying bitcoin isn\u2019t the only way to cash in on it, there are also the bitcoin mining stocks. These are firms, generally small, that own large-scale server rigs capable of computing the blockchain links \u2013 and creating new bitcoins. In fact, according to H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese, \"the median return for publicly traded BTC miners was 124% in January, more than 3x the performance of BTC.\"\n\nElaborating further on the opportunity, Colonnese writes: \u201cWe expect improved mining economics, driven by higher BTC prices and moderating energy costs (partially offset by rising network difficulty) to drive upward estimate revisions for the group throughout 2023 and see continued multiple expansion for mining stocks. As such, it is plausible the miners could continue outperforming BTC, in our view...\u201d\n\nOf course, Colonnese doesn\u2019t deny the risks inherent in this path \u2013 he notes that bitcoin mining stocks will be sensitive to negative macro-data \u2013 but he makes a compelling case that the positives justify the risks.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we\u2019ve opened up the TipRanks database and pulled the details on two small bitcoin mining stocks that Colonnese sees as potential winners in 2023. For investors interested in betting on the blockchain, these should present some interesting paths forward.\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR)\n\nThe first company we\u2019ll look at is Cipher Mining, a US-based bitcoin miner that is still in the early stages of its ramp-up. The company has three active mining sites, and is working both to expand its existing exahash capacity and to develop new mining sites. The company is currently generating bitcoin at a rate of approximately 1.4 EH/s.\n\nStory continues\n\nCipher\u2019s chief mining facility, Odessa, operates on up to 207 megawatts of power, and its mining operations came online this past November. Odessa is supplemented by two additional sites, Alborz, a 40 megawatt, wind-powered mining facility, and Bear and Chief, a site which was completed in October of last year and can operate at up to 20 megawatts.\n\nAll three of these sites are boosting their bitcoin production capabilities. Per Cipher\u2019s 3Q22 report, the last released, the company generated 196 bitcoin in that quarter. The fourth quarter report won\u2019t be out until March, but we do have the December and January monthly production updates available.\n\nIn December, Cipher mined 225 bitcoin, and in January, the company mined another 343. In each of those months, the company\u2019s bitcoin generation exceeded all of 3Q22 by a wide margin, and its generation rate is accelerating. As of the end of January, Cipher listed 424 bitcoin held as assets, 41,000 mining rigs deployed in its data centers, and a 4.3 exahash-per-second operating rate.\n\nCasting his eye on this bitcoin miner, H.C. Wainwright's Colonnese writes: \u201cWe are upgrading shares of CIFR to Buy from Neutral on strong execution, best-in-class mining economics, and improved sentiment for BTC\u2026 Cipher now has the sixth-largest hashing capacity of all publicly traded BTC miners in North America, and we estimate the company is capable of producing ~14.5 BTC per day. This equates to over $330,000 in daily mining revenues when applying current BTC prices of $23,000, a substantial increase over the ~$50,000 in daily revenues the company generated in October 2022. We applaud management\u2019s ability to rapidly scale the company\u2019s mining operations over the span of just a few months\u2026\u201d\n\nAlong with his new Buy rating on the stock, Colonnese includes a price target of $3, suggesting a 12-month upside potential of 76%. (To watch Colonnese\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis is the only analyst review on file for Cipher, which is currently trading for $1.70. (See CIFR stock forecast)\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies (HIVE)\n\nNext up is Hive Blockchain, a Vancouver, Canada-based company with bitcoin mining operations in its home country as well as in Sweden and Iceland. Hive Blockchain boasts that it operates its mining facilities, which take up to 50 megawatts of power, on 100% renewable energy sources.\n\nThose mining operations are extensive. As of the end of January this year, Hive Blockchain was operating at an exahash rate of 2.68 EH/s. The company has been deploying new mining server rigs in large numbers over recent months, significantly boosting its capacity.\n\nIndeed, the December and January monthly updates show that Hive\u2019s capacity has been growing. The company mined 213.8 bitcoin in December, and another 260 in January. Month-over-month, the company\u2019s mining operations generated a 22% increase in bitcoin.\n\nHive has committed to a policy of \u2018hold on for dear life,\u2019 or HODL; that is, keeping a large reserve of bitcoin to hold for the long-term. Under its HODL policy, Hive had holdings totaling 2,430 bitcoin at the end of January, worth over $56 million in US currency at current prices.\n\nH.C. Wainwright's Colonnese is impressed with Hive's execution, writing: \u201cHive consistently ranks in the top 3 publicly traded BTC miners when it comes to efficiency as measured by BTC mined relative to the company\u2019s active hash rate, which we attribute to above average uptime from both stable electricity sources and optimized proprietary software. In 2022, Hive produced 20% more BTC per EH of capacity than its peers, a significant competitive advantage, in our view, and a demonstration of Hive\u2019s operational prowess.\"\n\n\"While the stock has rallied [150%] YTD, alongside the rebound in BTC prices, we see additional share price appreciation driven by hash rate expansion and efficiency gains, as well as improved sentiment for BTC throughout 2023,\u201d the analyst summed up.\n\nIn-line with this stance, Colonnese rates the stock as a Buy, with a $5 price target to indicate its potential for ~39% share appreciation this year.\n\nThis small-cap bitcoin miner has slipped under the radar a bit, and only has 2 recent analyst reviews. They both agree, however, that it\u2019s a stock to buy, making the Moderate Buy analyst consensus unanimous. The shares are selling for $3.60 and their $6 average target indicates room for ~67% upside over the next 12 months.

        "content": "After a rocky 2022, bitcoin miners could be in for a lucrative year, at least if past market cycle patterns repeat.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency posted a 64% loss last year, coupled with skyrocketing electricity costs around the world and a dramatic drop in mining profitability made 2022 a bust for most of the crypto mining industry. But a rebounding market and upcoming halving cycle could be the catalysts the industry needs for a turnaround.\n\nThe next bitcoin halving, expected in the second quarter of 2024, should create a positive imbalance between bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand, Christopher Bendiksen, bitcoin research lead at CoinShares, said in a report Monday.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there has been a recurring tendency for the halvings to be closely followed by bull markets, leading to the now famed four-year bull/bear cycles in bitcoin price,\u201d Bendiksen said.\n\nWhen market conditions are strong, miners restrict new supply by holding more bitcoin on their own treasuries, meaning the supply of newly mined bitcoin hitting the market is much smaller than the actual production amount, Bendiksen said. But when there are challenges in the market, miners are forced to liquidate their holdings.\n\n\u201cBecause good times in mining tend to happen during bitcoin bull markets, and bad times tend to happen during bear markets, miner hoarding behavior happens right when demand is already overpowering supply, and vice versa,\u201d Bendiksen said. \u201cThis adds further fuel to the volatility fire, both to the upside and the downside.\u201d\n\nSome bitcoin mining companies have already reported a stronger start to the year. Riot Platforms increased its production 62% year-over-year last month, the company said in an unaudited report Monday. Riot reported selling 700 of its 740 mined bitcoin in January 2023, resulting in net proceeds of around $13.7 million, the company said.\n\nStronghold Digital Mining, which has been publicly traded since October 2021, has paused all debt payments until July 2024, giving the firm runway for the next 18 months, the company said Tuesday. Holding off on debt payments means Stronghold can take advantage of the current distressed mining market, a spokesperson said.\n\nAfter losing nearly 98% since its Nasdaq debut, Stronghold has rallied more than 30% so far this year. Analysts surveyed by CNN Business give Stronghold a buy rating with a median price target of $2 per share, a roughly 257% increase from its current price of around $0.56.\n\nIn yet another consolidation move spurred by the distressed market, mining companies Hut 8 and US Bitcoin Corp announced merger plans Tuesday. The two companies will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the new Hut 8 Corp. Hut 8\u2019s shares will be consolidated five-to-one, per the press release.\n\n\u201cOnce miners are better able to cover ongoing cash needs through mining revenue, the exacerbating effect from treasury liquidations on downside volatility is reduced, removing an ankle weight from the bitcoin price itself,\u201d Bendiksen said. \u201cThis in turn has the potential to act as a virtuous cycle.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A Taproot Wizard jpeg was mined into the Bitcoin blockchain on Feb. 1, sparking debate on the appropriate use of network resources, particularly inefficiencies due to increased block size.\n\nThis was possible thanks to the Ordinals protocol, which enables the storage of jpegs, videos, and other such data directly on the blockchain via Bitcoin-native digital artifacts, otherwise known as \u201cInscriptions.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlate staff members Liam Wright, James Van Straten, and CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory discussed the matter, covering what this could mean for scaling and efficiency, during a recent episode of BitTalk.\n\nUsing Glassnode data, CryptoSlate noted that Taproot Inscriptions activity had skyrocketed recently, which coincided with a spike in fees.\n\nBitcoin Taproot adoption\n\nThe Taproot soft fork went live in November 2021, enabling executable commands and specific new scripts, among other updates. In essence, the upgrade laid the foundation for smart contracts and dApps.\n\nTaproot adoption refers to the number of transactions that spend at least one Taproot input against the overall number of transactions. At the same time, utilization refers to the number of spent Taproot inputs against the overall number of spent inputs.\n\nThe chart below shows a gradual increase in both adoption and utilization rates, leading to an explosion around November 2022. Both adoption and utilization have reached all-time highs, at 7.5% and 2.8%, respectively.\n\nSpent outputs\n\nAn unspent transaction output (UTXO) refers to the amount of digital currency that remains following a transaction. It is a type of accounting that keeps track of who owns what.\n\nFollowing the Taproot soft fork, a new type of spent output was introduced \u2013 P2TR (Pay to Taproot,) which can be thought of as a new script method to handle the sending of Bitcoin either through either Schnorr signatures or Merkelized Alternative Script Treesroot (MAST.)\n\nThe chart below shows P2TR outputs gradually building since their introduction in November 2021. Late January sees a significant jump in activity, taking the current total number of Taproot spent outputs to 2.8%, compared to just 1% two weeks prior.\n\nRecent coverage of the Ordinals controversy has likely given rise to the acceleration of Taproot activity on the chain. However, on-chain metrics only suggest a further acceleration of Taproot activity and cannot answer where this trend may lead.\n\nThe CEO of Instasize, Hector Lopez, pointed out that the Taproot Wizard block was the biggest to date, at 3.96 MB, which is taking up space and limiting the number of financial transactions.\n\nFollowing this train of thought, a possible future scenario may see fees increase, potentially leading to competition between financial transactions and jpegs, driving fees even higher. Also, bigger block sizes will increase chain bloat.\n\nData from Hashrate Index shows that Taproot activity has coincided with an increase in transaction fees as they pertain to block rewards.\n\nFurther, if each proceeding block were to be completely filled to the 4 MB limit, projections put a 4 TB size on the blockchain by 2040. This point reiterates what others have said regarding the inappropriate use of network resources.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Gregory said a potential solution lies in filtering out the jpegs, so the nodes do not store that data. Anyone wishing to view the complete chain can do so via specific software designed for that purpose."

        "content": "Hackers stole a record $3.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency globally last year, led by thieves tied to North Korea, according to a blockchain analytics firm that tracks cybercrime.\n\nResearchers at Chainalysis called 2022 \"the biggest year ever for crypto hacking\" in a report published last week. Thefts rose from $3.3 billion stolen in 2021, the firm reported. Separately, a confidential United Nations report found that North Korea stole more cryptocurrency assets last year than in any other year, Reuters reported on Monday.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. investors poured millions into bitcoin, ether, dogecoin and other popular tokens in hopes of generating a fortune. But some investors instead suffered losses due to hackers, with their digital wallets plundered on platforms with poor cybersecurity.\n\nNorth Korean cybercriminals \"shattered their own yearly record for most cryptocurrency stolen\" and tallied $1.7 billion in thefts in 2022, the Chainalysis report said.\n\nGiven that North Korea's total exports in 2020 totaled $142 million, \"it isn't a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nation's economy,\" the researchers added.\n\nAs more investors lost money in crypto, U.S. lawmakers have reignited their calls to regulate the crypto industry. Scrutiny of the sector grew even more intense in November when FTX Trading, the third largest crypto platform, suddenly collapsed and declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe number of crypto hacks \"ebbed and flowed\" in 2022 with big spikes in March and October, Chainalysis said. October was \"the biggest single month ever for cryptocurrency hacking\" with 32 attacks totaling $775.7 million lost, according to the report.\n\nHackers have focused their activities on decentralized finance, or DeFi, platforms, which were tied to 82% of stolen funds last year, Chainalysis said. Criminals typically strike when crypto investors are using a so-called \"cross-chain bridge\" to transfer funds from one blockchain to another.\n\nThe biggest hack from October took place when someone looted $586 million in crypto from a cross-chain bridge owned by Binance. The company acknowleged the hack and said its security officers \"were able to minimize the loss.\"\n\nBad actors can exploit DeFi platforms because some crypto companies haven't prioritized security, said David Schwed, the chief operating officer at blockchain security firm Halborn.\n\n\"A big protocol should have 10 to 15 people on the security team, each with a specific area of expertise,\" Schwed said in Chainalysis' report. \"The DeFi community generally isn't demanding better security \u2014 they want to go to protocols with high yields. But those incentives lead to trouble down the road.\""

After the numbers were released, Treasury yields rose and the U.S. dollar index followed \u2013 both of which tend to move inversely to crypto.\n\nThe report \"delivered a blow to all those expecting the Fed to cut rates soon,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and writer of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. \"The bump in employment, and the lowering of the official unemployment rate to the lowest in over 50 years, suggests that scenario is a way off still, and reminds the market that the Fed has no other reason to bring rates down.\"\n\n\"Expectations are shifting to more tightening, and higher rates for longer (what the Fed has been saying all along), which is not good for risk-on assets,\" she added.\n\nAwaiting a crypto pullback\n\nFor several investors and analysts, the crypto market is showing a bullish trend, and likely found a bottom at $17,000 in December, but is likely to pause at least once more before taking off on a more meaningful bull run.\n\nBitcoin is trading \"at the deepest overbought condition in over two years\" and is \"due for a brake check,\" according to Wolfe Research.\n\nMany believe that the macro environment will continue to be a big challenge for risk assets including crypto. In 2022, crypto's correlation with stocks was at its highest and that trend isn't likely to be over.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Washington D.C. Economic Club on Tuesday, and several other Fed members are slated to deliver speeches this week.\n\n\"Given last week's failure to fully suppress the market's optimistic rate outlook, the Fed members will likely continue to remind the market that the Federal Funds rate will climb above 5% and will be kept there throughout the year,\" Hasegawa said."

After all, they benefit from the SegWit data discount, so theoretically a block full of digital artifacts would actually carry fewer fees than one filled entirely with ordinary Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBut if enough users start inscribing ordinal NFTs so that they seriously compete for blockspace with ordinary transactions, the users broadcasting ordinary transactions would need to increase their own fees for inclusion. In this case, miners would likely prioritize as many ordinary transactions as possible, because they have a higher fee per byte of data and they can fit more of them into a block, thus maximizing fees."

        "title": "Is Ray Dalio Right About Bitcoin? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "A well known investor and hedge fund manager, Ray Dalio caused a stir last week with his comments on cryptocurrencies. In an interview with CNBC, he had some positive things to say, noting that crypto and Bitcoin\u2019s accomplishments have been \"quite amazing\", but ultimately struck a skeptical tone when he reasoned that Bitcoin \"has no relation to anything... it moves and has no relation. It\u2019s a tiny thing that gets a disproportionate attention.\"\n\nThe billionaire Bridgewater Associates founder went on to say: \"It\u2019s not going to be an effective money. It\u2019s not an effective store hold of wealth. It\u2019s not an effective medium of exchange.\"\n\nIt should be stressed that Dalio is not arguing in favor of the status quo. In fact, he has gained attention both in and outside the world of finance for his views on the cyclical nature of history and empire, and his belief that the globe is currently going through the kind of radical power shifts that happen every couple of centuries or so.\n\nAs such, he asks broad questions, and hints at possible outcomes: \"We are in a world in which money as we know it is in jeopardy, right? We are printing too much and it\u2019s not just the United States, all the reserve currencies... And so in that world, the question is, what is money and how\u2019s that going to operate? So when we look at something like China\u2019s renminbi, and then you take the digital renminbi, I think you\u2019re going to see that become more and more a thing... I think the question over the next number of years is really what is money, not just as a medium of exchange, but a store hold of wealth.\"\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nDalio also suggested that: \"What would be best is an inflation linked coin. In other words, something where basically you would say okay, this is going to give me buying power because every individual wants, what do they want? They want to secure their buying power, if you want to save.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, these comments prompted significant pushback from Bitcoin\u2019s proponents, since the leading cryptocurrency is heralded by its advocates as addressing precisely the issues that Dalio points to. That is, in a shifting, unstable world, where people are questioning the reliability of money itself, where preserving wealth and buying power are genuine problems, and in which digital transactions are rapidly becoming the norm, Bitcoin is presented as an all-purpose solution.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bitcoin has a first-mover advantage, operates internationally and outside of institutional influence, and introduces a radical new framework for money and transactional capability: that of decentralization and separation from the state.\n\nThe possibility of transitioning into new kinds of money and value storage has become a reality, as evidenced by governments around the world assessing the viability of CBDCs. However, it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked that in democratic nations, there are voters opposed to such schemes, and there are coherent arguments stating that if we are to explore new ways of transacting, then we should take the generational decision to steer away from CBDCs and instead make use of digital currencies that operate independently from central banks.\n\nDebate and development are likely to intensify around these issues in the coming years, but the reality is that while bureaucrats maneuver slowly, cryptocurrency is a dynamic area not waiting for anyone\u2019s rubber stamp.\n\nWatch the recent FMLS22 session on Forex and crypto trends for 2023.\n\nDigital Markets\n\nA striking part of Dalio\u2019s comments was his opinion that Bitcoin has \u2018no relation to anything\u2019. It\u2019s an understandable point of view at first glance, but it seems to overlook the new varieties of trade and activity that cryptocurrencies are enabling and the thinking around their nature.\n\nIf we look broadly at Bitcoin and the many other blockchains that have followed in its wake, then it's true that they often appear separated from the physical world, but this aspect of crypto development-its detachment-can have beneficial effects.\n\nTaking in DeFi, NFTs, and the token-fuelled, ever-expanding ecosystems that are emerging around blockchains such as Ethereum, Cardano and Cosmos, we find fully functioning alternative markets and financial mechanisms, operating smoothly without having sought anyone\u2019s permission first, but doing so entirely in the digital realm.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are highly accessible to both users and developers, in the sense that while they require some technical proficiency, they are not gated or (for now, at least) restrictively regulated. This means mistakes will be made and will be allowed to occur, but it also means there is a tremendous opportunity for experimentation.\n\nBeing disconnected from physical markets isn\u2019t a disadvantage here, rather, it allows for rapid development, and there is a sense that what\u2019s being built is in position and ready to connect, as the wider world\u2019s ongoing digital transition continues.\n\nFurthermore, we should remember that while these networks are digital, their blockchain-based tokens are traded in exchange for plain old fiat currency, and any profits or losses taken are as real as the paper in a wallet.\n\nTrading Culture\n\nAnother point sometimes overlooked when assessing crypto is that it allows for a new kind of trade, not in physical goods or commodities, but rather, in cultural assets, or even in culture itself.\n\nThis kind of observation can start to sound a little abstract, but it simply requires a recognition that much of what is being created and exchanged on social media and in other ways over the web, and which drives web traffic globally, is culture. That means billions of people are networked together to exchange and amplify ways of thinking, trends and social swings.\n\nThrough certain aspects of crypto, whether that\u2019s meme coins, NFTs related to art and design, or tokens tying together all kinds of communities, these parts of the web, and of our cultural life, become tradable, and new online markets emerge.\n\nBitcoin Lays a Foundation\n\nDalio believes that Bitcoin receives \"disproportionate attention\", so it\u2019s worth asking why that might be, and what proportion of attention would be appropriate. For young retail traders entering markets for the first time, owning Bitcoin is no longer an exotic proposition, and crypto does not come across as an asset class that might simply cease to exist.\n\nIn fact, through being decentralized and digital-only, crypto is open for business 24 hours a day, every day of the year, to anyone, anywhere, and it\u2019s in a state of constant flux, all of which can make it a uniquely attractive proposition, particularly to those who are not invested in the conventions of traditional finance. And, within this nascent realm, it\u2019s Bitcoin that is the foundational currency, and which acts as a grounding layer from which everything else has developed.\n\nIf we accept that crypto, its culture and its products are now here to stay and that they are likely to attract more developers, traders and users with every generation that comes of age, then it\u2019s plausible that Bitcoin will come to be seen as having received disproportionately less attention than it actually should have."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts the second week of February in a newly bearish mood as multimonth highs fail to hold.\n\nIn what may yet bring vindication to those predicting a major BTC price come down, BTC/USD is back under $23,000 and making lower lows on hourly timeframes.\n\nFeb. 6 trading may not yet be underway in Europe or the United States, but Asian markets are already falling and the U.S. dollar is gaining \u2014 potential further hurdles for Bitcoin bulls to overcome.\n\nWith some macroeconomic data to come from the Federal Reserve this week, attention is mainly focused on next week\u2019s inflation check in the form of January\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nIn the build-up to this event, the results of which are already hotly contested, volatility may gain a fresh foothold across risk assets.\n\nAdd to that those concerns mentioned above that Bitcoin is long overdue for a more significant retracement than those seen in recent weeks, and the recipe is there for difficult but potentially lucrative trading conditions.\n\nCointelegraph looks at the state of play on Bitcoin this week and considers the factors at play in moving the markets.\n\nBTC price disappoints with weekly close\n\nIt is very much a tale of two Bitcoins when it comes to analyzing BTC price action this week.\n\nBTC/USD has managed to retain the majority of its spectacular January gains, totaling almost 40%. At the same time, signs of a comedown are on the cards.\n\nWhile comparatively strong at just under $23,000, the weekly close still failed to beat the previous one and represented a rejection at a key resistance level from mid-2022.\n\n\u201cBTC is failing its retest of ~$23400 for the time being,\u201d popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital summarized about the topic on Feb. 5.\n\nAn accompanying weekly chart highlighted the support and resistance zones in play.\n\n\u201cImportant BTC can Weekly Close above this level for a chance at upside.

The extent to which January\u2019s data supports the waning inflation narrative should be key.\n\n\u201cPost-FOMC, we have a heap of 2nd tier data releases including the important ISM services and NFP,\u201d trading firm QCP Capital wrote in forward guidance mailed to Telegram channel subscribers last week.\n\n\u201cHowever the decider will be the Valentine's Day CPI - and we think there are upside risks to that release.\u201d\n\nU.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) chart.

        "content": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated September 2, 2022 to its amended and restated short form base shelf prospectus dated January 4, 2022.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 7, 2023) - HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (Nasdaq: HIVE) (FSE: HBFA) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") is pleased to announce the production figures from the Company's global Bitcoin operations for the month of January 2023, with 260 Bitcoin produced in January, plus USD $180,000 of income from grid balancing, and a current BTC HODL balance of approximately 2,430 Bitcoin mined with green energy, representing an approximate 20% year over year growth (2,043 Bitcoin HODL in Jan 2022). The Company notes its year over year monthly production in January 2023 is consistent, during a period where BTC mining difficulty has gone up approximately 60%. Additionally, HIVE does not have any equipment financing or BTC backed loans.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/153904_841d0965f4f91ba0_001full.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/153904_841d0965f4f91ba0_002full.jpg\n\nSummary Overview:\n\nHIVE produced 260 Bitcoin in the month of January, from ASIC and GPU mining operations, representing an average of 110 Bitcoin Per Exahash. A 21% month over month increase, compared to December 2022 (214 Bitcoin produced).\n\nHIVE's year over year monthly Bitcoin production was consistent (260 Bitcoin in January 2023 and 264 Bitcoin in January 2022), during a period where the Bitcoin network difficulty increased approximately 60%.\n\nHIVE earned USD $180,000 in income from balancing the grid, in addition to Bitcoin produced in January. Based on the daily Bitcoin prices during the month of January, the income from grid balancing would equate to a mined value of 10 Bitcoin.\n\nHIVE deployed over 6,700 new generation ASIC miners in its data centers, representing one of the largest upgrades in the Company's history, to improve our gross mining margin and fleet efficiency.\n\nHIVE has deployed over 3,200 BuzzMiners in its facilities in Sweden and Canada. These miners are from the 5,655 BuzzMiners manufactured, tested, and received to date.\n\nHIVE has fully deployed all the 3,570 S19j Pro miners acquired in December 2022 into our New Brunswick and Lachute facilities. As a result of in-house software improvements by HIVE's technical team, we further increased our efficiency at our New Brunswick site by approximately 20% in average J/TH efficiency.\n\nHIVE expects to receive an additional 645 BuzzMiners in the next 2 months, representing a total production quantity of 6,300 BuzzMiners powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC for the initial production run. HIVE is the first company in the world to commercially deploy thousands of its own Bitcoin ASIC miners powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC.\n\nHIVE sells all of the Bitcoin earned from our GPU mining hashrate, with a focus to HODL the green Bitcoin mined from ASICs.\n\nStory continues\n\nJanuary 2023 Production Figures\n\nFrank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated, \"We are very happy to have overcome several big headwinds over the past year such has Bitcoin prices falling 50%, the Global Difficulty surging 50% which means fewer coins mined unless you increase both the efficiency of ASIC chips and number of machines mining which HIVE has done. Even with huge headwinds like the FTX bankruptcy and contagion, the HIVE management team has stayed focused and increased its BTC production and our HODL Bitcoin position. Further we have pivoted with our GPU chips away from Ethereum after the Merge and are using Ai to mine alternative coins and convert into Bitcoin, thus we are able to generate Bitcoin revenue. We have decided to sell the BTC earned using GPU/Ai and strive to HODL our Bitcoins created from hydro and geothermal electricity. We have not been using our ATM since November 30, 2022, and have been able to create other sources of revenue from balancing the grid to selling back energy while deploying the new Intel BuzzMiners and purchased other highly efficient ASIC machines from internal cash management. Our financial success has been from our company's values, culture, and strategy to have propriety software and strong global partnerships. Finally and fortunately we never borrowed at predatory 12-18% interest rates or kept our Bitcoin in crypto exchanges and I am very proud of the team's agility to adapt thoughtfully and quickly to the many external crisis's through the crypto winter bear market of 2022.\"\n\nAydin Kilic, President & CEO of HIVE noted \"We are proud to be producing 260 Bitcoin while also earning over USD $180,000 this month from our grid balancing initiatives. Our team has deployed over 6,700 ASIC miners in our data centers, including over 3,200 HIVE BuzzMiners, powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC and all of the 3,570 S19j Pros we acquired in December 2022. HIVE was the first public crypto mining company to realize income from its grid balancing program in Sweden. We view grid balancing as part of our core strategy, and whenever possible, we seek to hedge energy prices.\"\n\nMr. Kilic continued, \"We have increased our overall hashrate by 25% month over month from December 2022 to January 2023. We are continuously looking to optimize our allocation of energy as a resource, either to generate hashrate or sell energy back to the grid. Moreover, if unhedged spot prices are uneconomical in a specific jurisdiction, we quickly scale down our production. Additionally, our remaining GPU fleet is now generating approximately USD $80/MWHR in revenue, which is similar to the USD $/MWHR compared to Bitcoin ASIC miners in the current Bitcoin mining economics. We are constantly optimizing the deployment of our technology resources as a company to optimize profit. These advancements and agility allow us to generate positive gross mining margin during a crypto mining bear market. With a strong balance sheet of over USD $56 million of Bitcoin, HIVE is well positioned in the market today.\"\n\nThe Company's total Bitcoin production in January 2023 was:\n\n260 BTC produced;\n\n8.4 BTC produced per day on average;\n\n2.68 Exahash of BTC Hashrate (BTC ASIC hashrate plus BTC GPU Hashrate) as of January 31, 2023 comprised of 2.52 Exahash of ASIC BTC hashrate and 0.16 Exahash of GPU BTC Hashrate (the GPU fleet was curtailed to earn income for grid balancing) as of January 31 st ; and\n\nMonthly average of 2.37 Exahash, which is equal to 110 Bitcoin per Exahash, comprised of an average of 2.28 Exahash of ASIC mining capacity and an average of 90 PH/s of Bitcoin GPU mining capacity during the month.\n\nBitcoin HODL Update\n\nAs of the date of this press release, HIVE has approximately 2,430 Bitcoin, with a market value of over USD $56 million.\n\nBitcoin Global Network Mining Difficulty Is Volatile\n\nNetwork difficulty factors are a significant variable in the Company's gross profit margins. The Bitcoin network difficulty was 34.1T as at January 1, 2023 and increased to 39.4T as at January 31, 2023. Accordingly, Bitcoin mining difficulty ended the month about 15% higher than the beginning of the month.\n\nThe Bitcoin Network Difficulty is a publicly available statistic, that reflects the total number of Bitcoin miners online and is important in analyzing a company's gross profit margins, and number of Bitcoin produced. This data is available on many websites, here is one citation: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty\n\nAs more people mine Bitcoin (difficulty increases), the daily Bitcoin block reward which presently is fixed at 900 Bitcoin per day, gets split amongst more miners; thus each miner receives a smaller portion of the block reward. Conversely, as Bitcoin prices fall, many miners may lose money, and power down, thus taking their hashrate off the network, causing Network Difficulty to decrease.\n\nThose miners with the lowest costs of production; by virtue of having more efficient machines and/or lower energy costs, are able to continue their production during these volatile cycles. Not all miners will continuously mine during a given month. As a result, some miners will produce less Bitcoin than expected, relative to their advertised hashrate. For the foregoing reasons, HIVE will self-curtail part of its operations if the unhedged spot energy prices are uneconomical, thereby leaving part of its total gross hashrate unutilized.\n\nAll Bitcoin miners are striving to use the most efficient Bitcoin ASIC chips, and we are happy that we have been able to upgrade our global fleet during this crypto market downturn.\n\nATM Equity Program Update\n\nEffective as of the date hereof, the Company has terminated its at-the-market equity distribution agreement under which the Company had the option to sell up to USD $100 million of common shares of the Company at its discretion (the \"ATM Equity Program\"). The Company did not offer any shares under the ATM Equity Program after November 30, 2022. From inception of the ATM Equity Program to November 30, 2022, the Company issued 1,306,474 common shares (the \"ATM Shares\") for gross proceeds of USD $3,941,736. The ATM Shares were sold at prevailing market prices. A cash commission of USD $118,252 on aggregate gross proceeds from the ATM Equity Program was paid to the Company's sales agent.\n\nAbout HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company with a green energy and ESG strategy.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns state-of-the-art, green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of ETH and BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWe encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.\n\nFor more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit www.HIVEblockchain.com.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nCrypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group has begun to sell shares in several of its most prized cryptocurrency funds at a steep discount, as it seeks to raise capital to pay back creditors of its bankrupt lending arm.\n\nSoftBank-backed DCG has started to offload its holdings in several investment vehicles run by its subsidiary Grayscale, according to US securities filings seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe move to sell down the assets underscores the financial difficulties at DCG as it tries to raise funds to support collapsed lending units under crypto broker Genesis, while seeking to preserve its most cash-generative business.\n\nConnecticut-based DCG, founded in 2015 by former banker Barry Silbert, is one of the largest and oldest investors in crypto coins and businesses. It is backed by investors including SoftBank, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and Alphabet\u2019s venture arm CapitalG.\n\nGrayscale, DCG\u2019s asset management business, is an important asset: it earns hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lucrative fees for managing large pools of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies in funds that investors can buy shares in from their brokerage accounts.\n\nDCG is selling stakes in one of Grayscale\u2019s largest trusts even though the shares over the past two years have fallen to substantial discounts to the underlying value of cryptocurrency they hold.\n\nIt is seeking to raise money after the lending units of Genesis, its crypto broker, collapsed into bankruptcy in January, becoming the latest large crypto company to fail after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange rocked the digital asset industry.\n\nThe US group has been attempting to repay more than $3bn to its creditors and has been embroiled in a public dispute with the Winklevoss twins\u2019s Gemini exchange over the debts. To raise further funds, the group last month hired Lazard bankers to help sell its trade news site CoinDesk. It is also seeking to offload some of its $500mn venture portfolio, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nOn Monday, after months of negotiations, DCG reached an agreement with Genesis\u2019 main creditors, including Gemini. \u201cThis plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s recent share sales have focused on Grayscale\u2019s ethereum fund, where the group has moved to sell about a quarter of its stock to raise as much as $22mn in several trades since January 24, according to the filings. The company is selling at about $8 per share, despite each share\u2019s claim to $16 of ether.\n\n\u201cThis is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,\u201d DCG said.\n\nGrayscale earns a 2.5 per cent management fee on the 3mn of ether in the trust, equating to $209mn in the year to end September. DCG last sold shares in the Ethereum Trust in 2021, when the vehicle traded nearly at par with its net asset value, according to the filings provided by The Washington Service. Today the shares trade at half the value of the ethereum coin they represent.\n\nIts flagship bitcoin trust holds about 3 per cent of all bitcoin, worth $14.7bn, from which Grayscale earns a 2 per cent fee. It earned $303mn from fees on the bitcoin trust in the first nine months of 2022, according to securities filings.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell down smaller blocks of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund, according to the filings.\n\nThe group does not allow investors to redeem their shares for the coins held in the trusts, which would help close the significant net asset value gaps. Grayscale is suing the US Securities and Exchange Commission over blocking the creation of a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that this would benefit investors and allow redemptions.\n\n\u201cDCG faces a trade-off: they could allow redemptions and enable liquidity at par value, including for their own holdings, but they\u2019re better off not doing it because they make so much money from the management fees,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of Lumida Wealth. \u201cClosing the discount would mean giving up this cash cow.\u201d\n\nBefore cryptocurrency was easily tradable through reputable exchanges, the shares in Grayscale\u2019s trusts traded at a large premium to the value of the coins they held, incentivising holders of bitcoin and ethereum to hand over their coins for shares in the Grayscale vehicles."

        "content": "Since its launch on April 4, 2022, the DLCS has lost 57.2% (data ending Jan. 20, 2022 ). This performance reflects the difficult environment of the time due to the combination of macroeconomic factors such as inflation and rising rates and the impacts of crypto-specific events such as Terra/Luna, Voyager, 3AC and FTX. Since the FTX\u2019s collapse, DLCS has recovered 35.4%, and it is up 29.3% year-to-date in 2023 (data ending Jan. 20). Optimism on decelerating inflation and smaller rate hikes coupled with digital asset decentralization, interoperability and infrastructure is driving the rebound. The market will likely continue to capitulate in the short term and grow in the long term. DLCS will measure it all in real-time along the way."

        "content": "When Ordinals launched in January, it caused an uproar in the Bitcoin community as enthusiasts, advocates, and developers argued the merits of putting JPEG on the blockchain. While the heated debate continues, the number of Bitcoin inscriptions using Ordinals has already surpassed 11,000 on Tuesday, according to a Dune report.\n\nOrdinals are the latest project aiming to bring NFTs into the Bitcoin ecosystem. The first project, Counterparty, first introduced non-fungible tokens to Bitcoin with the Rare Pepes collection in 2014, with Stacks following in 2017. However, the Ordinals project is different because the assets, including JPEGs and even video games, are inscribed directly on satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain without needing a sidechain or additional token.\n\nThe Ordinals project has consumed the Bitcoin community and sparked new debates and questions about the ultimate purpose of the Bitcoin network. For some, Ordinals opened Pandora's box of threats to the Bitcoin network, including malware attacks and skyrocketing transaction fees.\n\nThe Ordinals block explorer should be browsed with caution, IMO. It has auto executing, unvetted pieces of JS code executing in your browser that possibly could be malware.

He also cautioned a spike in unemployment could spark a flurry of home sales, ruled out another financial crisis, and panned bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as pointless.\n\nEisman, a managing director of Neuberger Berman, is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble. He was portrayed by Steve Carell in the movie adaptation of \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHere are Eisman's 10 best quotes from the interview, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"Maybe this is the last hurrah right now for growth stocks. It will all depend pretty much on the Fed.\" (Eisman predicts the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated, pulling down the valuations of tech stocks.)\n\n2. \"Housing hasn't collapsed in the United States, but it's kind of locked and housing prices have gone down. So A), it's hard to sell and B), you're selling for less. Now, as long as people are employed, they're not going to sell their home down 40%. They'll just live in their home.\" (He explained that a sharp rise in mortgage rates has depressed demand for new houses and made homeowners balk at picking up sticks.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"The consumer is still in pretty good shape. As long as everybody's got a job, people will pay off their debts. If unemployment goes up, you'll see an increase in delinquencies and losses, but it's not going to be a calamity. It's just going to be what I'd call a normalization.\"\n\n4. \"Something bad could happen, we could have a recession. But my feeling is we'll have an old-fashioned, run-of-the-mill recession. We're not going to have some enormous meltdown crisis where the system is completely at risk, which is what happened in 2008.\"\n\n5. \"I can't say that there won't be breakage anywhere. There always could be breakage. What I would say definitively is that there will not be breakage in the US financial system, especially in the banks.\" (Eisman explained that regulators have sharply reduced banks' leverage and reined in their risktaking since the financial crisis.)\n\n6. \"When you're levered 40-to-one, to destroy the bank, you need a pebble. But when the bank is levered 10-to-one, you need a meteor. Now we could have worse credit in the United States, and the banks would earn less. But other than a couple of banks, not one bank in the United States will lose money.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"Oh my God. It's ridiculously hard. The whole world is telling you that you're an idiot, and then sometimes you think you're an idiot.\" (Eisman was underscoring the difficulty of holding a negative view on the mid-2000s housing market before it ultimately crashed.)\n\n8. \"I call this the Amazon disease. When Amazon came public, there was a lot of skepticism that this wouldn't work, and Amazon has basically conquered the world. So people are always looking for the next Amazon.\" (Eisman was discussing the immense hype around some growth stocks, and how some analysts and investors focus too much on the size of companies' total addressable market, and too little on whether their business models work.)\n\n9. \"It's very hard to short fiat currency because they all trade relative to one another. If you short the dollar, your problem is that in a basketball team where everybody is 5 feet 4 inches, the dollar is 5 feet 11 inches.\"\n\n10. \"Bitcoin is up a lot this year along with everything else speculative. You can't have a currency that moves 25% every six months. That's not a currency. That's a speculation. (Eisman said he doesn't understand what problem bitcoin solves, or why people other than speculators own it.)"

        "content": "Nearly reduced to rubble amid bitcoin\u2019s 2022 bear market and, in some cases, forced to liquidate holdings of the cryptocurrency to meet liquidity demands, some bitcoin miners are rebounding to start 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for exchange traded funds such as the VanEck Digital Assets Mining ETF (DAM ). DAM, which follows the MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index, is among the equity-based ETFs with intimate correlations to bitcoin. As such, the fund is benefiting from the digital currency\u2019s resurgence this year.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, as some of the ETF\u2019s holdings, some of which flirted with penny stock status in 2022, are positing dramatic gains in the early innings of 2023.\n\n\u201cYear to date, companies like Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital and CleanSpark have all gained between 40% to 110%, according to market data from TradingView. These share price surges are in large part due to a sustained rally in bitcoin\u2019s price. Since New Year\u2019s Day, the leading cryptocurrency has gained over 44%. As a result, mining economics are also improving. Hash price has jumped 25% even as hash rate (which, when it increases, normally causes hash price to fall) set new all-time highs in January,\u201d reported Zack Voell for Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nSpecific to the three miners mentioned above, their performances are material to DAM investors because each of those stocks is a top-five holding in the VanEck ETF. As of February 2, the trio combined for nearly a quarter of the fund\u2019s roster, according to issuer data.\n\nDespite the intense rally to start 2023, some DAM components and the bitcoin mining space at large still have plenty of work to do to reclaim lost glory. As of the end of January, the weighted average market capitalization of DAM\u2019s 20 holdings was just $2.9 billion. However, at the industry\u2019s peak, the combined market value of publicly traded bitcoin miners was around $100 billion.\n\n\u201cAlso, it is worth noting that the macroeconomic headwinds facing every market effectively killed all technology markets around the world. Bitcoin mining had no chance of escaping the bloodshed. Meta, for example, was the worst performer in the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 index last year. Apple, which dominates the weighting of the same S&P 500 index at roughly 6%, also ended last year down sharply added Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThat is to say, if tech stocks rebound this year, it could be an assist to bitcoin miners, including DAM member firms.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Beyond Basic Beta Channel."

        "title": "This Top Investor Says Recent Crypto Rise Is a 'Sucker's Rally.' Is He Right? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a woeful 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied a little this year. According to CoinMarketCap data, the granddaddy of crypto started 2023 at around $16,500 before rising to over $23,000. It has now fallen slightly and is nowhere close to its all time high of over $68,000, but it's still an almost 40% increase in five weeks.\n\nSome see the rally as a reason for optimism and hope the crypto winter might finally be thawing. But Peter Schiff, a popular economist and financial commentator, isn't convinced. On Jan. 18, Schiff tweeted: \"The #Bitcoin rally is providing cover for the #gold rally to continue unnoticed. As the financial media is distracted by the sucker's rally taking place in fool's gold, its (sic) paying no attention to the real rally going on in actual gold.\"\n\nWhy Schiff thinks this is a sucker's rally\n\nSchiff, who's known for predicting the 2008 economic crash, is also famous for his love of his gold and his criticism of Bitcoin. The founding member of Euro Pacific Asset Management, Schiff's main objection to Bitcoin is that it doesn't have any use. Unlike gold, which he believes is a hedge against inflation and could always be used in jewelry if nothing else, he argues Bitcoin is just a string of numbers. Schiff thinks gold is better than money, particularly as he isn't convinced the Fed will be able to curb inflation.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with RealVision, he labeled Bitcoin a \"fad\" and said, \"Bitcoin is not a currency -- it's not used as a medium of exchange really or a unit of account.\" He continued, \"It's just used for speculation, but it's not an investment asset like real estate, doesn't pay rent, it's not a stock, it doesn't pay dividends, it's not a bond, it doesn't pay interest.\"\n\nHe thinks that there are different forces behind the two price rallies. For him, Bitcoin has risen on speculation that various speculative assets that dropped significantly last year will now recover as the Federal Reserve relaxes its tightening measures and eases interest rate hikes. In contrast, he says people are buying gold because it's a hedge against both inflation and a potentially weakening dollar.\n\nIs Peter Schiff right about Bitcoin?\n\nInvestment decisions don't have to be either/or questions. Depending on the type of investor you are, it's about building a diversified portfolio of quality assets that you believe will perform well in the long term. As such, if you believe gold and Bitcoin could have value, you might own both of them.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nThat said, Schiff is almost certainly right to question whether Bitcoin can hold its recent gains. The crypto rally mirrors a rally in equities, which one Bloomberg article says is partly down to \"wishful thinking swirling that the inflation beast has been conquered.\" It is hard to believe that the Fed's economic tightening measures will end until it is confident inflation is under control. Some analysts think our inflation problems are far from over.\n\nIn addition, many economists warn that a recession could be in the cards. There's a lot of uncertainty, both about what is going to happen economically and what impact this would have on risky assets like crypto. On top of which, we don't know what impact increased crypto regulation will have, nor whether any other platforms will collapse in the ongoing fallout from FTX. The fact that Bitcoin is still nowhere close to erasing last year's losses is another reason for caution.\n\nRally aside, Schiff is not alone in arguing that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Warren Buffett thinks so, too. But there are plenty of Bitcoin fans who disagree, including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, who point to its potential as a currency in emerging markets and the role it could play in the international remittance market, among other things.\n\nBottom line\n\nDeciding whether to buy Bitcoin, gold, or any other investments means looking at the fundamentals and deciding how it might perform in the future and how it might fit into your portfolio. In a way, it doesn't matter whether this rally will be short lived or not. What matters is whether Bitcoin can overcome the hurdles it faces and outperform other investments in the coming decade or more.\n\nCryptocurrency is a high-risk investment. This does mean there's the potential for big returns, but you could also lose everything. Bitcoin may achieve some of the things its fans believe it can, but there are no guarantees. If you're considering investing, make sure you understand the risks involved, use a reputable crypto exchange, and only spend money you can afford to lose."

        "content": "What is blockchain? Is it hard to build one? Where do you start? Which programming language should I use?\n\nI get these questions quite often when meeting people who are interested in blockchain technology. You may also be one of those people, but don\u2019t worry, I was, too.\n\n4 Steps to Creating a Blockchain Create a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchain resources online, but it can be overwhelming and frustrating to understand as a beginner to this booming technology. However, this article is a little different than those other resources.\n\nI\u2019ll approach the subject in baby steps with you, and guide you through the basic concepts of blockchain and how to program one using Golang (Go).\n\nFor speed, endurance, and security, most blockchain core engines are built in C/C++ (Bitcoin, EOS, etc.\u2026), Go (Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum), Java (Ethereum), Rust, Haskell (Cardano) and/or Ruby (Ethereum), then provide bindings to other easy-to-use programming languages.\n\nAlso, some blockchain engines combine many programming languages for robustness and ease-of-use for developers. Ethereum is the best example of this.\n\nWhat Prerequisites Do I Need to Create a Blockchain?\n\nA network.\n\nCryptography.\n\nA data structure and algorithms.\n\nDecentralized systems.\n\nJavascript, Go or Python knowledge.\n\nYou only need to understand the basic concepts to program your first blockchain prototype, so let\u2019s begin with some theories.\n\nMore on Blockchain: Sushiswap vs. Uniswap: What Are the Differences?\n\nWhat Is a Blockchain?\n\nYou can\u2019t program something you don\u2019t understand, right? Let\u2019s break it down. Blockchain is not Bitcoin. Blockchain is not a digital currency, Blockchain is a set of different technologies that had already existed before its creation.\n\nSo, is this a blockchain?\n\nNo, but bear with me.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify things with an example and some figures.\n\nLet\u2019s take a MySQL database that stores some information in different tables.\n\nAn illustration of a MySQL database. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nWith the above database, there are some limitations. It allows you to do some tasks, including:\n\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) operations. Storing the same information twice.\n\nBut its limitations are many, including:\n\nWe can drop the entire database either mistakenly or intentionally. We can\u2019t share sensitive information with others. It\u2019s centralized, which means there\u2019s a single point of failure and a security issue. There\u2019s no way to trust everything that is stored in it. Ill-intentioned people can comprise the database. The database needs a manager. The users don\u2019t have power over their own data\n\nWe need something different that\u2019s transparent, reliable and independent from people. Something that\u2019s automatic, immutable, decentralized and indestructible. That\u2019s where blockchain kicks in.\n\nA blockchain is a secure, trusted decentralized database and network all in one.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Work?\n\nIn other words, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. These blocks are like tables in the database, but they can\u2019t be deleted or updated. The blocks contain information such as transactions, nonce, target bit, difficulty, timestamp, previous block hash, current block hash, Markle tree and block ID, etc, and the blocks are cryptographically verified and chained up to form an immutable chain called a blockchain or a ledger.\n\nAn illustration of a blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nThe same chain is then distributed to all the nodes (computers or miners) across the network via a P2P network.\n\nIllustration of a blockchain P2P network. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nSo, instead of a centralized database, all the transactions (data) that are shared across the nodes are contained in blocks, which are chained together to create the ledger. This ledger represents all the data in the blockchain. All the data in the ledger is secured by cryptographic hashing and digital signature and validated by a consensus algorithm. Nodes on the network participate to ensure that all copies of the data distributed across the network are the same.\n\n5 Key Concepts in the Blockchain Ecosystem Cryptographic hash and digital signature. Immutable ledger. P2P network. Consensus algorithm ( PoW, PoS, PBFT, ETc\u2026). Block validation ( Mining, Forging, etc\u2026).\n\nI will explain these concepts more in detail as we go.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using Blockchain?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using blockchain, including:\n\nRemoving intermediary organizations. An immutable ledger Transparency Security Reliability\n\nWhen Should You Use Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is not a silver bullet, so, it\u2019s best to use it when:\n\nThe data stored cannot be modified (proof of existence ). The data cannot be denied by its owner (non-repudiation). You want decentralization. You want one source of truth. You want high security. You don\u2019t care about speed. For example, Bitcoin takes 10 minutes on average to validate a block of transactions. But some blockchains are faster because they use different consensus algorithms other than PoW. We will talk about this later.\n\nBlockchain Use Cases\n\nBlockchain goes beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. It can be used in different sectors, including:\n\nReal estate : Land ownership.\n\nHealthcare : Securely record the patient\u2019s data.\n\nFinance : Reduce the taxes and intermediaries, anti-money laundering and cross border payment.\n\nSupply chain : Track items from the vendors to the customers, including verifying authenticity and original content creation.\n\nCybersecurity : DDOS attacks.\n\nGiving the power back to the user: Own your data and share it securely with whom you want (DID).\n\nCryptocurrency .\n\nVoting mechanism .\n\nBlockchain Platforms and Applications to Know\n\nBitcoin\n\nEthereum\n\nHyperledger Fabric\n\nEOS\n\nChainlink\n\nCardano\n\nDogecoin (meme coin)\n\nMore on Blockchain: 22 Crypto Apps to Know\n\nBlockchain Types\n\nThere are three types of blockchain:\n\nPrivate: Use only internally, and when we know the users (eg. Hyperledger Fabric).\n\nPublic: Everyone can see what is going on (Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n\nHybrid: In case you want to combine the first two.\n\nCreate Your Own Blockchain\n\nThere are two ways to build a blockchain\n\nThe easiest way is to use a pre-built blockchain open-source like Ethereum (create distributed applications, altcoins , decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , etc.), Fabric (configure a private blockchain), EOS or Cardano, etc. so that you don\u2019t have to deal with the core engine, which is difficult to implement. If that doesn\u2019t fit your requirements, then you can build one from scratch or fork, modify and/or improve an existing blockchain open-source code. For example, Litecoin and Bitcoin cash were forked from Bitcoin. This last method is tougher, more time-consuming and requires a lot of work and a strong team.\n\nIn this article, we will build a blockchain prototype from scratch so that you can thoroughly understand the blockchain\u2019s state machine.\n\nMore on Blockchain: What Is Layer 1 in Blockchain?\n\nHow to Create a Blockchain From Scratch in Go\n\nWe\u2019re going to create the first baby blockchain in Go. You can also learn how to create it in Python, and JavaScript. These prototypes can help you understand the concepts we described earlier. We\u2019ll complete this in four steps:\n\nCreate a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nA block contains information mentioned earlier, but to simplify things We are going to remove some. Let\u2019s delve into the specifics.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Go, try to familiarize yourself with the basics, including functions, methods, data types, structures, flow controls and iterations, etc.\n\nAn error occurred. Unable to execute JavaScript. Try watching this video on www.youtube.com , or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.\n\nA tutorial on how to build a blockchain in Golang. | Video: Tensor Programming\n\n1. Create a Block\n\nWe\u2019ll start with creating a folder with two files in it, main.go and block.go\n\nFolder structure\n\ngo // the folder main.go // file 1 block.go // file 2\n\nMain.go\n\n// use the main package package main //import the fmt package import ( \"fmt\" ) func main(){ fmt.Println(\"I am building my first blockchain\") // print this CreateBlock(\"The hearder will be shown here\", \"the body will be shown here\") // call the function that will create the block and pass some parameters in it. }\n\nIf you run this program it will show an error because the CreateBlock function is not defined yet, so go ahead and create it in block.go .\n\npackage main import ( \"fmt\" // this will help us to print on the screen ) func CreateBlock(Header, Body string){ fmt.Println(Header ,\"\n\n\", Body) // Show me the block content }\n\n2. Add Data to Your Blocks.\n\nThe beauty of Go is that you don\u2019t have to import or export functions, just declare them with capital letters, and Go will find them for you. Now, open a terminal and move to your created folder, and run go build , then run .\\go on Windows, or ./go on Linux and Macbook.\n\nScreenshot of the Go program that calls a function and passes a string of data. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nWe just created a simple Go program that calls a function and passes some string data. Let\u2019s add two more files, blockchain.go and structures.go . Now we have four files: main.go , block.go , structures.go , and blockchain.go\n\n3. Hash Your Block\n\nI will add to each line of code some comments in order for you to understand what I am doing.\n\nStructures.go\n\npackage main //Import the main package // Create the Block data structure // A block contains this info: type Block struct { Timestamp int64 // the time when the block was created PreviousBlockHash []byte // the hash of the previous block MyBlockHash []byte // the hash of the current block AllData []byte // the data or transactions (body info) } // Prepare the Blockchain data structure : type Blockchain struct { Blocks []*Block // remember a blockchain is a series of blocks }\n\nBlock.go\n\npackage main import ( // We will need these libraries: \"bytes\" // need to convert data into byte in order to be sent on the network, computer understands better the byte(8bits)language \"crypto/sha256\" //crypto library to hash the data \"strconv\" // for conversion \"time\" // the time for our timestamp ) // Now let's create a method for generating a hash of the block // We will just concatenate all the data and hash it to obtain the block hash func (block *Block) SetHash() { timestamp := []byte(strconv.FormatInt(block.Timestamp, 10)) // get the time and convert it into a unique series of digits headers := bytes.Join([][]byte{timestamp, block.PreviousBlockHash, block.AllData}, []byte{}) // concatenate all the block data hash := sha256.Sum256(headers) // hash the whole thing block.MyBlockHash = hash[:] // now set the hash of the block } // Create a function for new block generation and return that block func NewBlock(data string, prevBlockHash []byte) *Block { block := &Block{time.Now().Unix(), prevBlockHash, []byte{}, []byte(data)} // the block is received block.SetHash() // the block is hashed return block // the block is returned with all the information in it } /* let's now create the genesis block function that will return the first block. The genesis block is the first block on the chain */ func NewGenesisBlock() *Block { return NewBlock(\"Genesis Block\", []byte{}) // the genesis block is made with some data in it }\n\nBlockchain.go\n\npackage main // create the method that adds a new block to a blockchain func (blockchain *Blockchain) AddBlock(data string) { PreviousBlock := blockchain.Blocks[len(blockchain.Blocks)-1] // the previous block is needed, so let's get it newBlock := NewBlock(data, PreviousBlock.MyBlockHash) // create a new block containing the data and the hash of the previous block blockchain.Blocks = append(blockchain.Blocks, newBlock) // add that block to the chain to create a chain of blocks } /* Create the function that returns the whole blockchain and add the genesis to it first. the genesis block is the first ever mined block, so let's create a function that will return it since it does not exist yet */ func NewBlockchain() *Blockchain { // the function is created return &Blockchain{[]*Block{NewGenesisBlock()}} // the genesis block is added first to the chain }\n\nMain.go\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for _, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block: %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions: %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s run it now, go build then .\\go .\n\nResult. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nVoila. Easy, right?\n\n4. Chain Your Blocks Together\n\nOops, our blocks in the blockchain don\u2019t have any IDs and timestamps. So, let\u2019s add that information by modifying the main.go file, add these two lines in the for loop :\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i))\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for i, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) // print the block ID fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i)) // print the timestamp of the block, to make them different, we just add a value i fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block : %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block : %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions : %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s save the code and run it again, go build then ./go .\n\nFinal result of your blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nAs you can see, the blockchain is well structured. Except for the genesis block, each block contains its hash and the hash of the previous block, which makes it immutable. If the data in the block is altered, the hash will automatically change and the block will be discarded. The genesis block doesn\u2019t have any previous hash because it\u2019s the first one. There is no previous block.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Congratulations, you\u2019ve just created your first baby blockchain in Go.\n\nWe will gradually fulfill the blockchain requirements. Blockchain is a masterpiece that needs to be engineered the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nIn blockchain, there are also two common roles. A blockchain engineer and a blockchain developer. A blockchain engineer is a professional who thoroughly understands the principles of blockchain, security, and software engineering for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating the blockchain core engines and software. A blockchain developer is a professional who builds software on top of the blockchain called decentralized applications.\n\nMost blockchain developers use open blockchain platforms and frameworks like Ethereum, hyperledger fabric, EOS, etc. Now that you have the basics, it\u2019s up to you to decide which one you want to be."

        "title": "\u00a32bn bitcoin fiduciary duty case to go to trial - Law Gazette",
        "content": "A trial in London is the right place to decide a cryptocurrency dispute which could lead to a 'significant development' in the law of fiduciary duty, three Court of Appeal judges have ruled. They were overturning a decision by Mrs Justice Falk last year dismissing a claim by a Seychelles company against bitcoin developers based outside the UK.\n\nThe case, Tulip v Van der Laan and Others, was brought following a 2020 hacking attack on Dr Craig Wright (pictured below), the Australian computer scientist resident in the UK who claims to be bitcoin's inventor, 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. (In the lead judgment, Lord Justice Birss noted that the claim is 'hotly disputed' but is not relevant to the case.)\n\nWright contends that, because of the attack, he has lost the private keys to 111,000 bitcoin - currently worth \u00a32.1bn - owned by his company Tulip Trading and held on networks controlled by developers of open source software. He claims the developers owe a fiduciary duty to implement a software 'patch' to safeguard the assets. It has never been suggested that they had anything to do with the hack.\n\nThe developers, Birss said, 'contend that they have nothing like the power or control Tulip alleges and that duties of the kind Tulip contend for would be highly onerous and unworkable'.\n\nTulip appealed the High Court's dismissal of the case on six grounds, including that the judge was wrong to hold that it had no real prospect of establishing the claimed fiduciary duties. The appellants also argued that 'this is a developing, complex and uncertain area of law' and therefore the point should go to trial. A hearing is expected early next year.\n\nGranting the appeal, in a decision supported by Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Popplewell, Birss said: 'The conclusion is not that there is a fiduciary duty in law in the circumstances alleged by Tulip, only that the case advanced raises a serious issue to be tried.'\n\nThe substantive case would tackle issues including the governance of 'De-Fi' assets, he said. 'If the decentralised governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property.'\n\nHe acknowledged that for Tulip's case to succeed 'would involve a significant development of the common law on fiduciary duties'.\n\nFelicity Potter, partner at Wright's solicitors, specialist London firm Ontier LLP, said: 'This is a much-welcomed judgment. We asserted that it is inappropriate to summarily dismiss Tulip\u2019s claims at an early jurisdiction hearing where the disputed underlying facts have not been assessed by the court, and the Court of Appeal agreed. The scope of developers\u2019 duties must now be explored in detail at trial.'\n\nShe added that: 'The responsibilities owed by developers of digital assets to end users is of significant importance to all coin holders as the concept of digital assets becomes more mainstream.'\n\nJames Ramsden KC, who appeared for 14 of the developers, agreed on the potential importance of the case. 'The courts in this jurisdiction continue to lead the common law world in developing a legal structure for the De-Fi sector. This case will be the most important so far in maintaining that lead and continuing to establish this jurisdiction as the leader for De-Fi litigation. The outcome of this claim at trial will therefore have a profound impact and not just in the UK.'\n\nThe Tulip litigation is only one of a battery of cases brought by Wright over the past two years to secure cryptopassets and defend his reputation. In September the Court of Appeal in Oslo is due to hear his appeal against a Norwegian court's dismissal of a libel claim. The High Court in London is also due next year to hear a copyright dispute over Wright's claim to authorship of the seminal 'Satoshi' white paper. Meanwhile, Wright is due to appear before a divisional court in April to contest allegations that he broke an embargo on a London libel judgment.\n\nJohn Wardell KC, Bobby Friedman and Sri Carmichael, instructed by Ontier LLP, appeared for Tulip Trading. James Ramsden KC, instructed by Bird & Bird, for 14 developers; Alex Charlton KC and Daniel Khoo, instructed by Brett Wilson LLP, for two developers.\n\n\n\nThis article is now closed for comment."

Our team started the process by measuring the best in a given category and then compiled our list of recommendations.\n\nThen, we identified the criteria important to a gambling game and tested them with our experts and gamers.\n\nThe process of making this list was quite extensive. We researched everything from game rankings to in-game prize pools and made sure we covered everything.\n\nThis list of the best casino games is based on our personal experience playing at casinos and quotes from reviewers and other players.\n\nWe read through thousands of player experiences, trying to identify those games that have stood out and provided great entertainment or excitement. Our team considered a basic data set on each game, including its rules, payouts, and frequency of hitting jackpots.\n\nAs a result, we had only five casinos that offered high-quality live dealers, poker, slot machines, and many other popular casino games.\n\nWhat We Looked For\n\nWe\u2019re not only interested in online casinos for their gaming options but also for their ease of use and reliability. We analyzed various factors that contributed to the overall quality of each site we reviewed.\n\nCasino Reputation: We compiled a list of the most reputable and trustworthy online casinos to help you find a gambling site that our experienced team has vetted. For this, we considered factors like player satisfaction, payout rate, and the reliability of each site\u2019s customer support before awarding them one of our top casino reputations.\n\nWebsite Interface: We have carefully researched and selected casinos with user-friendly interfaces where all the games and bonus offers are clearly, and visually presented. This greatly affects how enjoyable your online casino experience will be.\n\nOnline Slots Games: We scoured the web looking for the best online casino sites and have compiled a list of the sites that offer hundreds of online slot games and other table games, poker, blackjack, and roulette.\n\nBonuses and Promotions: To ensure that these casinos are the best, we picked ones that value loyalty.

Here are some other tips:\n\nGaming Library\n\nBefore choosing a casino, you should check its gaming library. If a casino has a limited selection of games, it\u2019s probably not the best place to play. It\u2019s important to find a site that offers a wide range of games to find something you enjoy playing.\n\nCasino Reputation\n\nWhen choosing online casino games, you should consider the company\u2019s reputation and its licensing and regulation. Reputation is important because it can tell you what kind of experience you\u2019re likely to have if you use the casino. A company with a long history of customer service issues or legal problems might not be worth your time or money.\n\nDemo and Free Games\n\nCheck the casino\u2019s demo and free games. You want to make sure that they offer games that are fun, engaging, and easy to play before signing up. It\u2019s also important to see if there are any limitations on using these demos or free games before committing any money.\n\nFAQ\u2019s: Casino Games\n\nWhich casino games are most popular?\n\nBitStarz casino offers the best games. For example, many free slot machines have different themes, such as zombies and pirates. But there are also roulette tables where you can play games with other players from around the world. If you want something more exciting than classic slots, try playing video poker or blackjack at this casino!\n\nAre free casino games safe to play?\n\nYes. While it\u2019s true that free casino games aren\u2019t nearly as flashy as their real-money counterparts, they\u2019re just as fun and rewarding when you win. You can play them at home on your computer (or even on your phone or tablet) without worrying about losing any real money!\n\nYou only have to be careful of getting caught up in the excitement and spending too much time playing, which can lead to overspending.\n\nConclusion: USA Online Casino Games That Pay Real Money\n\nGambling is an activity that you can master. You just need to know how and where to start. This review has selected the best online casinos that are offering their services to customers all over the world. We are confident that these platforms can meet all your gambling needs, whether a simple game of slots or a high-roller game of poker.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in January 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the longest surviving cryptocurrency and has the largest market capitalization. This longevity, rapid growth and adoption makes bitcoin the best in terms of long-term investing. While bitcoin is in a category of its own, all other coins are known as Altcoins (alternative coin). The most popular altcoin being Ethereum, which serves as a platform for decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nIs buying Cryptocurrency Legal in Singapore?\n\nYes, it is completely legal to buy crypto in Singapore. However, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore). They are not considered legal tender. There is no protection available if you lose money from investing in digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nJust recently, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. In a nutshell, this means Salvadorans could use Bitcoin as an official form of payment in El Salvador.\n\nMAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) Regulation on Cryptocurrencies in Singapore\n\nCryptocurrencies are new, and regulation is still in its infancy in Singapore. MAS classifies Cryptocurrencies as digital payment tokens (DPT) and some regulation comes with the Payment Services Act 2019. The act mainly tries to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore doesn't safeguard your transaction or regulate them. In a nutshell, you are not protected.\n\nHowever, things are changing. In the beginning of 2021 (Jan 4) MAS announced enhancements to the Payment Services Act. Providers of storage or exchange of DPTs (cryptocurrencies) will have to comply with rules and regulations set by MAS.\n\nWhy invest in Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general appeal to supporters for a number of reasons. These are the most popular:\n\nSupporters are rushing to invest in cryptocurrencies because the technology is still in its infancy.\n\nThe supply is limited to 21 Million. It is a simple supply and demand mechanic.\n\nMany supporters like the fact that cryptocurrencies are decentralized and remove central banks.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin and other altcoins. The decentralized processing and recording system is more secure than current payment systems.\n\nSpeculators like it for its great returns and volatility. The ROI (return on investment) has been great for long term investors as well as day traders.\n\nRecent events and governments recognizing cryptocurrencies add to its adoption and acceptance.\n\nCapital Gains Tax \u2013 it depends on the country you live in, but generally it is less due to the lack of regulation.\n\nSome supporters view it as Gold 2.0 \u2013 as a store of value.\n\nShould you invest in Bitcoin \u2013 is it a good investment?\n\nBitcoin liquidity makes it a great investment if you are looking for short-term profits. Cryptocurrencies can also be a good long term investment because of high market demand and speculative nature.\n\nOther reasons why bitcoin is a good investment include:\n\nLow Inflation Risk \u2013 Bitcoin is immune to inflation, unlike many of the world's currencies, regulated by governments\n\nLiquidity \u2013 Bitcoin is one of the most liquid investment assets due to the number of trading platforms, exchanges and online brokers.\n\nStill early \u2013 Many believe cryptocurrencies are still in the very early stages and will continue to evolve and grow.\n\nCons of investing in Bitcoin\n\nHighly volatile \u2013 Price is notorious for always fluctuating back and forth. The cryptocurrency market is always changing and you should keep a close eye on the markets if you invest.\n\nProne to online hacking \u2013 There have been a couple of cyber attacks on exchanges in recent years. Investors that held their Bitcoin in those exchanges lost their investments. For example, this hack of Singapore headquartered exchange KuCoin that drained $280M from the exchange.\n\nRegulation \u2013 The bitcoin market is not regulated and is prone to scams and fraud.\n\nNot widely accepted \u2013 Bitcoin is still in early phases and not accepted by many companies as a form of payment.\n\nProne to theft or being lost \u2013 Private key can be lost or you hard drive can crash. You can go from a wealthy crypto millionaire to bankrupt in seconds.\n\nHow To Pay For Bitcoin in Singapore\n\nIt might be that the exchange you pick doesn\u2019t accept your preferred payment method. Pick an online crypto broker that accepts your desired payment method.\n\nSingapore residents can purchase bitcoins by using one of the following methods: credit cards, debit cards, wire transfer, e-wallets or with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBuy Cryptocurrency with a Credit Card\n\nThe easiest way is with a credit card is to use an exchange like Stormgain. Transactions are super fast and you get your bitcoin instantly.\n\nBuying With a Bank Account\n\nMost cryptocurrency exchanges support bank transfers as a form of payment. Payment services such as Xfers and PayNow are supported. Bank transfers are nearly instant and often free.\n\nIf you are using an exchange that is based outside Singapore, you will see an option of wire transfer or SWIFT payment. Wire transfers can take up to a week and are subject to fees. Fees are a lot higher and include currency exchange fees and bank transfer fees.\n\nBuy With Cash In Singapore\n\nYou might want to buy with cash. One of the ways is to find someone and exchange in-person, cash for BTC.\n\nWhile buying with cash might be convenient, it also has the highest fees of any methods we outline.\n\nCrypto ATM Singapore\n\nAnother option is to find a bitcoin ATM near you and simply deposit cash which is converted to Bitcoin. Singapore currently has 10 Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nThis is the list of crypto ATMs in Singapore:\n\nOperator's Name Location Opening Hours Fees Rating Bitcoin Exchange (Singapore) 531 Upper Cross St 03-11,\n\nSingapore 050531\n\n(link) 24/7 SGD 18.00 + 4.5% Good Coinunited.io 226 Upper Thomson Rd,\n\nSingapore 574363\n\n(link) Mon-Sat: 10:00 am \u2013 9:00 pm SGD 10.00 + 9.1% N/A Bitcoin Exchange (Singapore) 1 Rochor Canal Rd,\n\nSingapore 188504\n\n(link) 24/7 SGD 18.00 + 4.5% Good Daenerys Crypto ATM 11 Collyer Quay #02-28,\n\nSingapore 049317\n\n(link) Mon-Fri: 7:00 am \u2013 8:00 pm\n\nSat: 7:00 am \u2013 7:00 pm\n\nSun: Closed N/A Ok Daenerys Crypto ATM 68 Orchard Road #01-59,\n\nSingapore 238839\n\n(link) Mon-Sun: 11:00 am \u2013 7:00 pm N/A Ok Daenerys Crypto ATM 13 Stamford Rd,\n\nSingapore 178905\n\n(link) Mon-Sun: 5:30 am \u2013 12:30 am N/A Ok Cryptonic 304 Orchard Road,\n\nSingapore 238863 (link)\n\nMon-Sun: 11:30 am \u2013 7:00 pm N/A Good Daenerys Crypto ATM 109 North Bridge Rd, Singapore 179097 (link) Mon-Sun: 10:00 am \u2013 10:00 pm N/A Ok Daenerys Crypto ATM 10 Paya Lebar Road,\n\nSingapore 409057 (link) Mon-Sun: 7:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm N/A Ok Daenerys Crypto ATM 11 Collyer Quay #02-28,\n\nSingapore 049317 (link) Mon-Fri: 10:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm\n\nSat-Sun: Closed N/A Ok\n\nBuying with PayPal in Singapore\n\nTo buy with Paypal, you need to use a trading platform like Stormgain which accepts Paypal. Once you create an account, you will need to deposit funds through Paypal and then buy BTC.\n\nOne problem of using Paypal is the risk of chargeback fraud. This is when someone buys with Paypal and then requests a chargeback. In theory they get to keep both their money and bitcoin.\n\nA workaround is to use a peer-to-peer exchange like Paxful or an exchange like Stormgain which accept Paypal. These p2p exchange platforms are great for trading, but not long term holding.\n\nAnother option is to use something like xCoins, which was specifically built to facilitate Paypal to BTC transactions. It is still a little rough around the edges, and doesn\u2019t have the best security track record.\n\nP2P Exchanges (Peer-To-Peer)\n\nAnother option of buying bitcoin is to use a P2P crypto exchange like Binance P2P. This platform enables peer-to-peer buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBuy with Another Crypto\n\nThe easiest way to buy BTC with another crypto is on an exchange. Make sure the desired pair is listed on the exchange. To buy with ADA for example, you need to find the pair BTC/ADA. Once you find the desired pair, you can buy by following these steps. Make sure the exchange rate on the pair is fair.\n\nCreate account Deposit the desired cryptocurrency Go to the desired pair Click Buy BTC or Sell ADA Enter the amount you want to buy or sell Create a limit or market order\n\nChoosing a Bitcoin Trading Platform\n\nYou should look for a well regulated trading platform that is safe and secure, has low trading fees, reasonable transaction limits, supports your currency, has great customer support, and reputation.\n\nHow to store your Bitcoin\n\nBitcoins are stored in a wallet, called a digital wallet.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nThe best place to store bitcoin is in a cold wallet, called the digital wallet. Digital wallets are web-based or hardware-based (like a USB stick). You can store bitcoin on a mobile device, desktop computer, hardware wallet and keep it safe with private keys.\n\nHot Wallets\n\nThe other option is a hot wallet. Most exchanges allow you to keep your bitcoins in a hot wallet to stay liquid for easy trading and withdrawals.
