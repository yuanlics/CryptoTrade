        "title": "What Backs Bitcoin? - Yahoo Sports",
        "content": "20The argument that Bitcoin (BTC) has no value because it isn't backed by anything physical remains one of its major misconceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s a view that\u2019s been perpetuated by the likes of billionaire tycoon Warren Buffett and former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2014both of whom have been quoted saying Bitcoin has no value.\n\nBut now that Bitcoin ranks alongside the largest world currencies by market cap, it does beg the question ... what exactly does back it?\n\nBitcoin vs. fiat\n\nUp until relatively recently (the last century or so), most ordinary paper currency and coinage was directly redeemable for gold. This is because many of the wealthiest countries followed the gold standard, a monetary system where governments tied a fixed exchange rate for national currency to gold. As part of this system, countries kept sufficient reserves of gold in their vaults to 100% back their circulating currency supply, ensuring currency-for-gold exchanges were always possible.\n\nHowever, this also constrained the economy in the middle of the Great Depression, since governments were unable to simply source more gold to expand their money supply and stimulate spending.\n\nThe system was abandoned by Australia and New Zealand in 1929-1930; Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1931; and the United States partially left the standard in 1933.\n\nIt wasn't until 1971 that the United States fully left the gold standard, after then-President Richard Nixon ended the interconvertability of the U.S. dollar into gold, thereby nullifying the Bretton Woods system and essentially ending the age of the gold standard.\n\nInstead, countries switched to a fiat model, where the national currency isn't backed by a commodity like gold, allowing central banks to print new money whenever needed. Although it doesn't have intrinsic value, the value of fiat money is set by changes in supply and demand, as well as the strength of the government behind it. Since governments only accept payment of taxes in fiat currency, and tax evasion is illegal, their value is also partially maintained required tax payments.\n\nSo while fiat currencies are not formally backed by anything, we tend to buy into our fiat currencies with the confidence that they will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for goods and services. Essentially, our confidence in fiat currencies generates purchasing power, and therefore value, for fiat currencies.\n\nBut our confidence in fiat currencies suffers from a problem of induction. In other words, we presuppose that a sequence of events will occur as it always has, based on our previous experience. We can't really say for certain what lies ahead for the value of our traditional fiat currencies. Without a currency being formally tied to a commodity like gold, value becomes a contingency rather than a guarantee.\n\nIs Bitcoin backed by mathematics?\n\nLike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by a physical commodity, and instead derives its value in other ways.\n\nSince Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized entity that enforces its value, and it isn't backed by any commodity, many people mistakenly believe this means Bitcoin doesn't have any value.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin currently has an individual unit value of around $30,000, and a total market capitalization\u2014defined as the unit value multiplied by the number of Bitcoin in circulation\u2014of over $625 billion, clearly demonstrating that it is considered valuable by a large number of people.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn't actually backed by anything physical\u2014only the complicated mathematics underlying its blockchain technology and controlled supply. This ensures Bitcoin remains limited in supply and is resistant to censorship\u2014which imbues it with some of its value. As Anthony Pompliano said in a panel discussion on CNBC, \"If you don't believe in Bitcoin, you're essentially saying you don't believe in cryptography.\" For Pompliano, blockchain technology endows Bitcoin with inherent value, almost like a gold standard for crypto.\n\nThe rest of Bitcoin's value can be attributed to the fact that it was the first successful monetary system to operate without a centralized entity pulling the strings\u2014meaning its supply can't be forcefully inflated, it can't be easily confiscated like gold was during the 1930s, and it offers a level of financial freedom that few (if any) fiat currencies can match.\n\nBitcoin has also been shown to have utility value; thousands of merchants now accept it as payment for goods and services. In two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender, meaning that merchants have to accept it (though in the former, at least, adoption has reportedly been patchy).\n\nEl Salvador's Controversial Bitcoin Year: A Timeline\n\nThe level of confidence seen in a currency can be indicated, or even preserved, by its level of usage around the world. Whether it is performing well relative to other fiat currencies, the U.S. dollar is\u2014and will be for the foreseeable future\u2014a currency that can be spent almost anywhere. As a result, consumers are confident in the dollar. Purchasing power and practicality are valuable commodities themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is still some way from the mainstream. The crypto community has come a long way since the first Bitcoin transaction was spent on a pizza, but until mass adoption takes place, confidence in Bitcoin will ultimately not be as high, or as widespread, as confidence in established fiat currencies.\n\nDespite their obvious differences, Bitcoin turns out to be similar to a fiat currency insofar as it is backed largely by consumer confidence. As belief in the crypto space grows, so too will confidence in Bitcoin."

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Whether you call them Bitcoin NFTs, digital artifacts, or Ordinals, these new JPEGs are brewing up a storm and making waves across the crypto space. With Bitcoin Punks selling for upwards of 1.1 BTC (17.50 ETH), non-fungible tokens on the bitcoin blockchain are not to be ignored.\n\nSince when has the Bitcoin network become the hottest place to trade NFTs? What does this mean for BTC transaction fees, and why is the Bitcoin community against all this newfound interest?\n\nMost importantly, which Bitcoin NFT collection will be the next Bored Apes, and how can I buy these trending digital assets?\n\nWhat Are BTC Ordinals?\n\nThe Ordinal protocol allows users to inscribe data, like an image or file, onto an individual satoshi. In the same way that 100 cents make up one dollar, 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 BTC. Casey Rodarmor, the founder behind the protocol, claims that these digital artifacts \u201creflect what NFTs should be.\u201d\n\nWhile upgradeable NFT standards and enforceable royalties have become popular on other blockchains, Bitcoin NFTs are truly immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. This leads to some creative use cases, as speculated by the wider Bitcoin community:\n\nBitcoin NFTs are slightly different from their cousins over on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Ordinal NFTs store the entirety of the inscribed data directly on-chain instead of simply linking a JPEG to a non-fungible token.\n\nAll this was made possible following a loophole Casey Rodarmor discovered in the latest Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. Limited only by block size, data can now be stored on-chain on the world\u2019s most decentralized blockchain. What\u2019s more, the protocol doesn\u2019t really on any smart contracts. While this arguably streamlines the protocol, it complicates future utilities like DeFi integrations.\n\nAre Ordinals the First Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nDespite what the newer generation of cryptocurrency enthusiasts might believe, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen NFTs on the bitcoin network. Crypto veterans will remember NameCoin NFTs, which, while not quite resembling today\u2019s Apes and Punks, are widely considered the first non-fungible tokens.\n\nIn 2015, the Counterparty network hosted NFT trading card games and the now-iconic RarePepe Card Collection. While these early NFTs are technically considered Counterparty NFTs, they used bitcoin network functions to anchor references on the original blockchain, giving them their place in Bitcoin history.\n\nBitcoin Community and JPEGs: More Controversy\n\nLike any revolutionary new technology, Bitcoin NFTs have divided the Bitcoin community into two camps. Bitcoin maximalists have shunned Ordinals from the outset, arguing that BTC is a financial instrument. They believe that adding Ordinal NFTs into the mix only corrupts the network and dilutes the value of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin NFTs have arguably brought renewed interest to the network and raised the ceiling on potential use cases for Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals add an additional layer of culture and history to the bitcoin archives, while also benefitting BTC miners thanks to boosted transaction fees. Network congestion leads to limited block space and a spike in BTC gas.\n\nComplications with Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBefore strapping on your FOMO boots and diving into the non-existent Bitcoin Metaverse, there are a few things you need to know. The Ordinal NFT ecosystem is still in its infancy and demands a high level of technical knowledge to navigate effectively.\n\nFirst of all, there is no NFT marketplace on the bitcoin network. All Ordinal NFT trades are completed through trusted peer-to-peer trades in Discord servers and telegram channels. As is often the case, these trading environments attract plenty of scammers and nefarious actors.\n\nIf you\u2019re trading Bitcoin NFTs OTC, do your due diligence and use a reliable middleman or intermediary.\n\nAs if the barrier to entry wasn\u2019t already high enough, things just get more complex. You can\u2019t sell, transfer or trade a native Ordinal NFT unless you\u2019re running a full bitcoin node on your computer. Setting up a node isn\u2019t easy, and syncing it up with the bitcoin network can take up to three days.\n\nFortunately, there is an easier way to create a Bitcoin NFT. Sites like Ordinals.bot and Gamma.io simplify the process but severely limit your BTC transactions. Unless you\u2019re running a node, you still won\u2019t be able to sell or transfer your NFT.\n\nFinally, you can currently only hold one Ordinal NFT per bitcoin wallet. What\u2019s more, if you accidentally send the satoshi that your Bitcoin NFT is inscribed on, you\u2019ll lose it forever, even if you\u2019re sending it to a trusted crypto exchange like Binance.\n\nDiving into the world of Bitcoin NFTs is a bit of a jungle. The high barrier to entry has only added to the scarcity and FOMO surrounding these digital artifacts, which have been exploding on crypto news platforms. Thankfully, there are a few workarounds that make things easier.\n\nHow to Trade BTC Ordinals on Ethereum\n\nThere is a solution if you\u2019re itching to get your hands on a Bitcoin NFT but don\u2019t have the technical knowledge or time to go through the exhausting Ordinal onboarding process.\n\nEmblem Vaults are a unique approach to NFT trading that allows users to package data from other chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin into an Ethereum NFT. Each Emblem Vault contains private keys for data, like NFTs, that are stored on other blockchains. Emblem Vaults make it possible to trade NFTs from other networks like Bitcoin and Solana as if they were Ethereum NFTs.\n\nOne could argue that this represents peak irony in the crypto space. Even after all these years and all the progress the industry has witnessed, we\u2019re still generating Ethereum-native punk art on other chains. This isn\u2019t a new idea, but this is the first time we\u2019ve started repackaging these outsider punks to resell them on Ethereum.\n\nAs always, buying Emblem Vaults on Opensea carries an element of risk. Because anything can be coded into an Emblem Vault, it\u2019s difficult to know if the vault you\u2019re looking at contains a genuine Bitcoin Punk. Seeing the same Ordinal NFT listed three times in a row undoubtedly raises some red flags.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended to always conduct thorough research before buying any Emblem Vaults claiming to contain Bitcoin NFTs. Otherwise, you find yourself chalking up more capital losses on your crypto taxes.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOrdinal NFTs are the latest gold rush in the crypto market; however, the high barrier to entry makes it difficult to navigate and gives scammers and bad actors a platform to take advantage of unaware users.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin NFTs are increasing network congestion on the Bitcoin network. While this is great for Bitcoin miners, regular users suffer from higher transaction fees and network congestion.\n\nFAQs"

As part of this system, countries kept sufficient reserves of gold in their vaults to 100% back their circulating currency supply, ensuring currency-for-gold exchanges were always possible.\n\nHowever, this also constrained the economy in the middle of the Great Depression, since governments were unable to simply source more gold to expand their money supply and stimulate spending.\n\nThe system was abandoned by Australia and New Zealand in 1929-1930; Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1931; and the United States partially left the standard in 1933.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn't until 1971 that the United States fully left the gold standard, after then-President Richard Nixon ended the interconvertability of the U.S. dollar into gold, thereby nullifying the Bretton Woods system and essentially ending the age of the gold standard.\n\nInstead, countries switched to a fiat model, where the national currency isn't backed by a commodity like gold, allowing central banks to print new money whenever needed. Although it doesn't have intrinsic value, the value of fiat money is set by changes in supply and demand, as well as the strength of the government behind it. Since governments only accept payment of taxes in fiat currency, and tax evasion is illegal, their value is also partially maintained required tax payments.\n\nSo while fiat currencies are not formally backed by anything, we tend to buy into our fiat currencies with the confidence that they will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for goods and services. Essentially, our confidence in fiat currencies generates purchasing power, and therefore value, for fiat currencies.\n\nBut our confidence in fiat currencies suffers from a problem of induction. In other words, we presuppose that a sequence of events will occur as it always has, based on our previous experience. We can't really say for certain what lies ahead for the value of our traditional fiat currencies. Without a currency being formally tied to a commodity like gold, value becomes a contingency rather than a guarantee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs Bitcoin backed by mathematics?\n\nLike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by a physical commodity, and instead derives its value in other ways.\n\nSince Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized entity that enforces its value, and it isn't backed by any commodity, many people mistakenly believe this means Bitcoin doesn't have any value.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin currently has an individual unit value of around $30,000, and a total market capitalization\u2014defined as the unit value multiplied by the number of Bitcoin in circulation\u2014of over $625 billion, clearly demonstrating that it is considered valuable by a large number of people.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn't actually backed by anything physical\u2014only the complicated mathematics underlying its blockchain technology and controlled supply. This ensures Bitcoin remains limited in supply and is resistant to censorship\u2014which imbues it with some of its value. As Anthony Pompliano said in a panel discussion on CNBC, \"If you don't believe in Bitcoin, you're essentially saying you don't believe in cryptography.\" For Pompliano, blockchain technology endows Bitcoin with inherent value, almost like a gold standard for crypto.\n\nThe rest of Bitcoin's value can be attributed to the fact that it was the first successful monetary system to operate without a centralized entity pulling the strings\u2014meaning its supply can't be forcefully inflated, it can't be easily confiscated like gold was during the 1930s, and it offers a level of financial freedom that few (if any) fiat currencies can match.\n\nBitcoin has also been shown to have utility value; thousands of merchants now accept it as payment for goods and services. In two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender, meaning that merchants have to accept it (though in the former, at least, adoption has reportedly been patchy).\n\nThe level of confidence seen in a currency can be indicated, or even preserved, by its level of usage around the world. Whether it is performing well relative to other fiat currencies, the U.S. dollar is\u2014and will be for the foreseeable future\u2014a currency that can be spent almost anywhere. As a result, consumers are confident in the dollar. Purchasing power and practicality are valuable commodities themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is still some way from the mainstream. The crypto community has come a long way since the first Bitcoin transaction was spent on a pizza, but until mass adoption takes place, confidence in Bitcoin will ultimately not be as high, or as widespread, as confidence in established fiat currencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite their obvious differences, Bitcoin turns out to be similar to a fiat currency insofar as it is backed largely by consumer confidence. As belief in the crypto space grows, so too will confidence in Bitcoin."

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the third consecutive week but Bitcoin (BTC) price decoupled and is on track to close the week near the strong overhead resistance at $25,211. This suggests that the wider crypto market recovery is on a strong footing.\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s sharp rally from the lows, analysts remain divided in their opinion about its next move. Some traders believe that the current Bitcoin rally will turn down once again, while others expect the momentum to continue, starting a new bull phase.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nChances are that Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies will continue to rally until a vast majority of the bears turn bullish. After that happens, a sizable dip is likely. That could shake out several weak hands and give an opportunity to the stronger hands to add to their positions. A higher low followed by a higher high may confirm the end of the bear phase and signal the start of the next bull market.\n\nMeanwhile, select altcoins are looking strong and they may follow Bitcoin higher in the near term.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts to determine the critical levels to keep an eye on.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin is trading near the stiff overhead resistance at $25,211. The small trading range days on Feb. 18 and Feb. 19 indicate that bulls are not hurrying to book profits and the bears are wary of shorting at the current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought territory indicate that bulls are firmly in command. A tight consolidation near a stiff overhead resistance usually resolves to the upside. If buyers catapult the price above $25,250, the BTC/USDT pair could accelerate to $31,000, as there is no major resistance in between.\n\nConversely, if the price dumps from the current level, it could find support at the 20-day exponential moving average ($23,115). The bears will have to pull the price below $22,800 to break the bullish momentum. The pair may then collapse to $21,480, which is likely to act as a strong support.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears aggressively sold the rally to $25,250 but they could not tug the price below the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment remains strong and the bulls are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nBuyers are likely to have another go at the overhead resistance. If they manage to drive the price above $25,250, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-EMA. That will embolden the bears who will then try to sink the price to $22,800.\n\nFIL/USDT\n\nFilecoin (FIL) soared above the immediate resistance level of $7 on Feb. 17. This shows the intention of the bulls to start a new up-move.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAfter a brief consolidation on Feb. 18, the bulls continued the up-move on Feb. 19. This strong rally indicates aggressive buying by the bulls. There is a minor resistance at $9.53 but that is likely to be crossed.\n\nThe FIL/USDT pair could then take aim at $11.39. This level is likely to act as a major obstacle, but if bulls do not allow the next pullback to dip back below $9.53, the uptrend may continue. The next resistance is at $16.\n\nThis positive view could negate in the near term if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below $7.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to stall the up-move at $8 but the bulls did not allow the price to slip back below the breakout level of $7. This indicates aggressive buying on every minor dip. The rally picked up pace and reached the overhead resistance at $9.53.\n\nSellers may mount a strong defense at this level but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bears want to stop the rally, they will have to yank the price back below $8.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are languishing far below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) has been consistently hitting a new high for the past few days. Any asset that hits a new all-time high possesses strength.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe OKB/USDT pair turned down on Feb. 18, indicating profit booking above $58. In a strong uptrend, corrections usually do not last for more than three to five days. If the price turns up from $50, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $59. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey toward $70.\n\nAnother possibility is that the pair corrects sharply and retests the support at $45. If buyers flip this level into support, the pair may consolidate between $45 and $58 for a few days. The bears will have to sink the price below $44 to gain the upper hand.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that buyers bought the dip to the 20-EMA but the rebound lacks strength. Although the moving averages are sloping up, the RSI is showing a negative divergence. This indicates a weakening bullish momentum. If the 20-EMA cracks, the pair could slide to $47.50 and then to $44.35.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns up and breaks above $55, the bulls may have another go at the all-time high at $58.84. If this level is cleared, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nRelated: 5 ways to monetize your digital art with NFTs\n\nVET/USDT\n\nVeChain (VET) successfully held the retest of the downtrend line and thereafter broke above the overhead resistance, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have turned up and the RSI is near the overbought zone. This suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If buyers flip the $0.028 level into support during the next pullback, the VET/USDT pair may surge toward the next overhead resistance at $0.034.\n\nBuyers are expected to protect this level with vigor because a break above it could indicate the start of a new uptrend. The pair may then rise to $0.05. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($0.025).\n\nVET/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls kicked the price above the overhead resistance, indicating the start of the next leg of the up-move. If bulls sustain the price above the breakout level, the pair may pick up momentum and quickly rally to $0.032 and then to $0.034.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-EMA, several aggressive bulls may get trapped. That could start a deeper correction as longs bail out of their position. The pair may then slide to $0.022.\n\nRPL/USDT\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) has been in an uptrend for the past few days. The price has not broken below the 20-day EMA ($45) during pullbacks, indicating strong demand to buy at lower levels.\n\nRPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe inside-day candlestick pattern on Feb. 18 and 19 shows that bears are trying to stall the uptrend near $56 but the bulls are not willing to surrender their advantage. If buyers thrust the price above $57, the RPL/USDT could march toward the next target objective at $74.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the psychological level of $50. If this level gives way, the pair may slip toward the 20-day EMA ($45). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may signal a trend change in the short term.\n\nRPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that bears are trying to defend the $56 level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that buyers are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a break above the overhead resistance. If that happens, the pair could rise to $61 and thereafter to $74.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have given up and are booking profits. That may result in a deeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average and then to $38.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts the last week of February in a volatile mood as a crucial area of resistance fails to break.\n\nAfter a classic \u201cfakeout\u201d during low-volume weekend trading, BTC/USD is back below $25,000, with bulls still lacking momentum.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency saw what looked like the next stage of its 2023 recovery last week, making swift gains and even tapping new six-month highs.\n\nThe good times were not to continue, however, and February\u2019s progress has been much slower and hard won than January\u2019s 40% gains. How will the rest of the month pan out?\n\nA critical monthly close is due, along with a potential external price trigger in the form of minutes from the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin network fundamentals are due to leap to yet another all-time high, with miners in full recovery mode.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these factors and more in an overview of BTC price perspectives for the final week of February.\n\nRSI \u201cbearish divergence\u201d causes alarm\n\nAfter a mostly calm start to the weekend after days of macroeconomic data reactions, Bitcoin woke up late Sunday to rise back above $25,000.\n\nHowever, this was not to last, and as Cointelegraph reported, signs on exchange order books pointed to manipulative moves by large-volume traders.\n\nA subsequent comedown after the weekly close took BTC/USD below $24,000 before a bounce back to the same levels as Saturday, where the pair still traded at the time of writing, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: TradingView\n\nFor traders, there was natural cause to be wary.\n\n\u201cNot paying much attention to weekend PA.. BTC typically saves its meaningful moves for US stock market hours,\u201d Crypto Chase wrote in part of a Twitter summary.\n\nMonitoring resource Material Indicators initially flagged the order book activity, queried how long the phenomenon might continue with bulls powerless to make inroads higher.\n\nDo you think support will hold at the notorious bid wall to play the range again or will it spoof and dump?\n\n\n\nRemember #TradFi Markets are closed Monday.

Source: Material Indicators/ Twitter\n\nFellow trader and analyst Matthew Hyland admitted that it was \u201creally hard to tell\u201d whether Bitcoin could break higher on short timeframes.\n\nHolding the area around $22,800 in the event of a pullback, followed by the key breakout, however, \u201cwouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d he said on the day.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Matthew Hyland/ Twitter\n\nMore concerned about the rally\u2019s strength was Venturefounder, a contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, he warned that external factors such as \u201cmacro weakness\u201d could have an immediate bearish impact on crypto markets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin bearish RSI divergence continues\u2026 Almost the exact opposite way of the May\u2013July 2021 period. I think any macro weakness can have BTC snap back to $19-20k real quick,\u201d part of the comments stated.\n\nVenturefounder referenced the Relative Strength Index (RSI) metric, which measures how overbought or oversold an asset is at a given price point. In 2021, RSI was increasing versus a BTC price correction, subsequently ending in current all-time highs of $69,000 in November that year.\n\nAll eyes on FOMC minutes and U.S. dollar\n\nWhat form that \u201cweakness\u201d on macro markets might take remains to be seen.\n\nThe upcoming week holds considerably fewer potential macro triggers than the last, with a sprinkling of U.S. data releases, including personal spending in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE).\n\nHowever, the event on most crypto pundits\u2019 radar is the release of the minutes from February\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting at the Fed.\n\nThis was where the latest benchmark interest rate hike was decided, with expectations that Fed Chair Jerome Powell included talk of a moratorium on rate hike policy, if only theoretically.\n\n\u201cWe also have FOMC minutes releasing on Wednesday where Powell will describe what a rate hike \u2018pause\u2019 could look like,\u201d Crypto Chase mentioned about the event.\n\n\u201cMiddle of upcoming week is where I start considering swing entries.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the FOMC minutes will be plain sailing. Among them is financial market research resource Capital Hungry, which this week warned that \u201csneaky hawkish revisions\u201d may be revealed.\n\n\u201cFeds sneak in hawkish revisions out of the spotlight (not an active FOMC) with market already adjusted to CPI revisions and Jan report.

Source: Glassnode\n\nData from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode bears this out. Miners have begun retaining more BTC than they sell on rolling monthly timeframes, reversing a trend of net sales in place from mid-January.\n\nRaw data from MiningPoolStats meanwhile shows Bitcoin network hash rate also preserving its upward trend, remaining at over 300 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nBitcoin hash rate raw data chart (screenshot).

        "title": "What is Blockchain Wallet and How Does It Work? [Updated] - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular due to their many improvements over traditional fiat currencies. If you want to use any of these blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ll need to understand how blockchain wallets work.\n\nThe article explains what is blockchain wallet, gives reasons as to why you might use a blockchain wallet and describes the different types of blockchain wallets. It also includes a demo on the use of blockchain wallets.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Use a Blockchain Wallet?\n\nTraditional banking systems pose several problems for doing any transaction. For one thing, transactions are often slow. For another, any transaction has to pass through an intermediary, like a bank, meaning there is a central point of failure. And there are issues in keeping track of all accounts and balances; data can get jeopardized, manipulated, or even corrupted across multiple systems where the accounts and balances are maintained. Blockchain wallets reduce or eliminate these problems.\n\nWhat is a Blockchain Wallet?\n\nA blockchain wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to manage different kinds of cryptocurrencies\u2014for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum. A blockchain wallet helps someone exchange funds easily. Transactions are secure, as they are cryptographically signed. The wallet is accessible from web devices, including mobile ones, and the privacy and identity of the user are maintained. So a blockchain wallet provides all the features that are necessary for safe and secure transfers and exchanges of funds between different parties.\n\nIt is very similar to the process of sending or receiving money through PayPal or any other gateway used today, but you use cryptocurrency instead. Examples of blockchain wallets include Electrum, Blockchain.info, Jaxx, Mycelium, Samurai, and Bitcoin paper wallet. There are many more based on the needs you have and the security you require.\n\nHow Do Blockchain Wallets Work?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss what private and public keys are and how these keys are related to a blockchain wallet. Whenever you create a blockchain wallet, you are provided a private key and a public key that is associated with your wallet. Let\u2019s use email as an example. If you want to receive an email from someone, you give him or her your email address.\n\nBut giving out your email address doesn\u2019t mean someone will be able to send out emails via your account. Someone would have to know your email account\u2019s password to do that. Blockchain wallets follow a similar process using a public key and a private key together. A public key is similar to your email address; you can give it to anyone. When your wallet is generated, a public key is generated, and you can share the public key with anyone in order to receive funds.\n\nThe private key is top secret. It\u2019s similar to your password; it should not get hacked and you should not disclose it to anyone. You use this private key to spend your funds. If someone gets access to your private key, there is a high possibility that your account is compromised, and you might end up losing all the cryptocurrency deposits in your account.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nBlockchain Wallet Features\n\nNow that you know how Blockchain wallets work, it is imperative that you should know about their features. Here are some of the important features of Blockchain wallets:\n\nEasy to use. It\u2019s just like any other software or a wallet that you use for your day-to-day transactions.\n\nHighly secure. It is just a matter of securing your private key.\n\nAllows instant transactions across geographies. And these are barrier-free, without intermediaries.\n\nLow transaction fees. The cost of transferring funds is much lower than with traditional banks.\n\nAllows transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies. This helps you do easy currency conversions.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Types\n\nThere are two types of blockchain wallets based on private keys: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are like normal wallets that we carry for day-to-day transactions, and these wallets are user-friendly. Cold wallets are similar to a vault; they store cryptocurrencies with a high level of security.\n\nHot Wallets and Cold Wallets\n\nHot wallets are online wallets through which cryptocurrencies can be transferred quickly. They are available online. Examples are Coinbase and Blockchain.info. Cold wallets are digital offline wallets where the transactions are signed offline and then disclosed online. They are not maintained in the cloud on the internet; they are maintained offline to have high security. Examples of cold wallets are Trezor and Ledger.\n\nWith hot wallets, private keys are stored in the cloud for faster transfer. With cold wallets, private keys are stored in separate hardware that is not connected to the internet or the cloud, or they are stored on a paper document. Hot wallets are easy to access online 24/7 and can be accessed via a desktop or mobile device, but there is the risk of unrecoverable theft if hacked. With cold wallets, the method of the transaction helps in protecting the wallet from unauthorized access (hacking and other online vulnerabilities).\n\nWe can further break down wallets into three types:\n\nSoftware wallets; Hardware wallets, which you plug into your USB drive; and Typical paper-based wallets, for which you print your public key and private key on a piece of paper and keep it in a secure place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nSoftware Wallets\n\nA software wallet is an application that is downloaded on a device; it could be a desktop or a mobile device, or it could be a web-based wallet that can be accessed online. Breadwallet, Jaxx, and Copay are popular software wallets. We can further categorize software wallets as desktop wallets, online wallets (web wallets), and mobile wallets.\n\nDesktop Wallets Desktop wallets are cold wallets in which the private keys are stored in cold servers (in your desktop). You can unplug the wallet from the Internet, do some offline transactions, and then bring it back online. In case the main server is lost, then a cold server, basically your desktop, is used as a backup server.\n\n\n\nThese wallets can be downloaded on any computer but can be accessed only from the system they are installed on, so you make sure the desktop or the machine on which you are downloading the desktop wallet is safe (has a backup and is in a secure location), and that you\u2019re maintaining the hardware and not letting the machine go anywhere.\n\nThese wallets are definitely cost-efficient. Electrum is one of the most popular desktop wallets.\n\nDesktop wallets are cold wallets in which the private keys are stored in cold servers (in your desktop). You can unplug the wallet from the Internet, do some offline transactions, and then bring it back online. In case the main server is lost, then a cold server, basically your desktop, is used as a backup server. These wallets can be downloaded on any computer but can be accessed only from the system they are installed on, so you make sure the desktop or the machine on which you are downloading the desktop wallet is safe (has a backup and is in a secure location), and that you\u2019re maintaining the hardware and not letting the machine go anywhere. These wallets are definitely cost-efficient. Electrum is one of the most popular desktop wallets. Online Wallets\n\nThese are other kinds of hot wallets that run on the Internet. Users have the benefit of accessing these wallets across any device. It could be a tablet or a desktop, or you can access it from your mobile browser. The private keys are stored online and are managed by a third party. For example, GreenAddress is a Bitcoin wallet that is available on the web, has an Android app, is available on a desktop, and also is available on iOS.\n\nThese are other kinds of hot wallets that run on the Internet.

For example, GreenAddress is a Bitcoin wallet that is available on the web, has an Android app, is available on a desktop, and also is available on iOS. Mobile Wallets\n\nMobile wallets are similar to online wallets except that they are built only for mobile phone use and accessibility. These wallets have a user-friendly interface that helps you do transactions easily. Mycelium is the best available mobile wallet.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nA hardware wallet is a type of cold storage device, typically like a USB, that stores the user\u2019s private key in a protected hardware device. These wallets are similar to portable devices that can be connected to the computer (plugged in). As noted earlier, they are less prone to malicious attacks and are hack-proof. Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey are the top hardware wallets on the market.\n\nTo make a transaction from your hardware wallet, you have to ensure that the hardware wallet is plugged into your computer system.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nA paper wallet is an offline process for storing cryptocurrencies. This wallet is a printed paper that has both your private key and public key, which are accessed using a QR code. Since these wallets are safe, they are widely used for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Paper Wallet and MyEtherWallet are two widely used paper wallets.\n\nA paper wallet works with your software wallet to transfer funds from your software wallet to the public address shown on your paper wallet. First, you park your funds in a software wallet, then you transfer the funds from your software wallet to the public address printed on the paper wallet.\n\nBlockchain Wallets Comparison\n\nBlockchain.info is a cryptocurrency wallet that supports both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is easy to use and has a low transaction fee. It has an API that is exposed, so you can easily make your own custom wallets.\n\nLedger Nano S is a hardware wallet that offers high security for your account. It is available for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. It is also possible to maintain multiple accounts and access them anytime.\n\nBitcoin paper wallet helps you to print your own tamper-resistant Bitcoin wallet. It minimizes the threat of hacking.\n\nJaxx enables a user to exchange currencies within the wallet. It is available for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many other cryptocurrencies. With Jaxx, a user can view his or her updated balance as soon as the processing is complete.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis blockchain wallet video tutorial provides demos for the different kinds of wallets talked about here, including actual transactions.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinal Inscriptions and the ability to mint content other than transactions on the Bitcoin network have taken the blockchain by storm, with over 154,000 inscriptions created to date, according to Dune analytics. Now, a developer has adapted the Ordinals project for rival proof-of-work blockchain Litecoin.\n\nLaunched in 2011, Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency designed to be quicker at processing transactions than Bitcoin. Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who sold all of his Litecoin in 2017 to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe quest to bring Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain began on February 10, when a pseudonymous Twitter user, Indigo Nakamoto, offered 5 LTC (around $500) to anyone who could port Ordinals to Litecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, software engineer Anthony Guerrera launched the Litecoin Ordinals project on GitHub after forking the GitHub repository for Bitcoin Ordinals posted by Casey Rodarmor in January.\n\nLitecoin was chosen because it is the only other blockchain on which Ordinals could work, Guerrera said, due to its soft forks of the SegWit and Taproot technology found in Bitcoin\u2014both of which are essential to making Ordinals work.\n\n\u201cBasically, I was motivated by the bounty that Indigo and a few others put out for someone to port Ordinals to Litecoin,\u201d Guerrera told Decrypt via Twitter DM. \u201cI approached Indigo about a week ago to step up to the challenge.\u201d\n\nGuerrera says the bounty to port Ordinals to Litecoin grew from 5 LTC to 22 LTC, or around $2100.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGuerrera says that when he began working on the project, he found issues with its dependency on rust-bitcoin, which did not support the MimbleWimble upgrade on Litecoin.\n\nRust is a programming language designed for safety and performance. In September 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken launched the internal Tam\u00e1s Blummer Memorial Fund to support the development of rust, named in memory of a Bitcoin Rust contributor who passed away.\n\n\u201cI forked rust-bitcoin to make one that is able to work with Litecoin MWEB,\u201d Guerrera said. \u201c[This allows] Ordinals to decode the block data and safely ignore the extension block MWEB.\u201d\n\nLaunched in May 2022, MimbleWimble\u2014named after a spell from Harry Potter\u2014is an upgrade to the Litecoin blockchain that aims to enhance the network\u2019s privacy and transaction size.\n\nWith MimbleWimble as its secret sauce, Guerrera says the Litecoin blockchain is the perfect place for Ordinals because it can handle more data in an individual transaction at a lower cost than on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cHaving MWEB built into the chain allows for users to be able to transfer funds privately before inscribing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, a statement piece while maintaining privacy; is a huge advantage, unlike Bitcoin, which is a fully public ledger.\u201d\n\nLitecoin is currently the 16th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at $6.89 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Account abstraction on Bitcoin since day 1 - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nAccount abstraction has for a long time been a dream of Ethereum and has become a hot topic recently.\n\nWe demonstrate Bitcoin has shipped with account abstraction/unification since its genesis. Thus, all the salient features promised by AA can be and have been developed on Bitcoin, without any protocol changes and with little added complexity. Ethereum\u2019s flawed initial design requires constant and complex retrofits to realize AA, which is still yet to be delivered, over 14 years later than Bitcoin.\n\nAccount Abstraction (AA)\n\nTo understand AA, we need to understand how accounts work on Ethereum first. An Ethereum account is similar to a bank account, but holds ethers or ETH rather than fiat. There are two types of accounts on Ethereum, both identified by a unique address.\n\n1. Externally Owned Account (EOA)\n\nEOAs are accounts owned by something external to the blockchain: users. They are the traditional accounts that users create with a wallet like MetaMask. An EOA has a public address controlled by the user\u2019s private key, which can sign and initiate transactions. The validation of signature is hardcoded into the base layer and runs outside of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\n2. Contract Account (CA)\n\nThese accounts are commonly known as smart contracts and are controlled by their smart contract code, not a private key. The smart contract is run in the EVM. Also a CA has storage and code, neither of which an EOA has.\n\nMotivations for AA\n\nEOA suffers from an one-size-fits-all issue. Whether an EOA has a balance of 1 ether or ethers worth billions of dollars, it is secured by a single private key. If a user loses the private key (or seed phrase) due to a small mistake, she can lose everything. This makes self-custody non-viable for mainstream audience.\n\nAA seeks to improve user experience and eliminate the existence of two types of accounts by unifying EOA and CA. It makes EOA programmable by moving the validation logic of signed transactions into the EVM, as in CA. An EOA can be tailored to each user\u2019s needs.\n\nThe History and Current State of AA\n\nThere have been many proposals over the years on how to achieve AA on Ethereum.\n\nSome requires significant protocol changes such as EIP-2938. Others does not require protocol changes but fundamentally changes the workflow of a user wallet, such as the latest EIP-4337. It introduces a new mempool, a new actor called bundlers, and multiple new layers, among other changes. Given the enormous complexities introduced, it is not surprising EIP-4337 has not seen any meaningful adoption.\n\nAccount Abstraction on Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin equivalent of an account is a so-called Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). The bitcoins in a UTXO are controlled/locked by the smart contract code in it. To spend them, a user has to provide the matching \u201ckey\u201d, which typically requires some kinds of secret information.\n\nCrucially, there is no distinction between a UTXO controlled by a private key and a UTXO not controlled by one. The spending condition of a UTXO is always validated in the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM). The most popular types of UTXO has an address used by all Bitcoin wallets and is controlled by the corresponding private key\u00b9. However, its validation of signature is still done at BVM and NOT baked into the base layer and thus requires no special handling, in contrast to Ethereum.\n\nUse cases\n\nBitcoin has AA from the beginning since it unifies all account/UTXO processing. To corroborate this, we list some of the most prominent AA features that have been implemented on Bitcoin. Other AA features can be achieved similarly.\n\nSponsored transactions\n\nIt allows third parties (such as a paymaster and an application) to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users. This is needed to onboard users without any bitcoins. One way to enable it is using the ANYONECANPAY sighash flags. It allows anyone to add inputs to a partially signed transaction, which can be used to pay miner fees.\n\nDifferent signature schemes\n\nBitcoin uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called secp256k1 by default, the same as Ethereum. Since a UTXO is controlled by a programmable smart contract, we can use any alternative signature schemes. For example, we have implemented Schnorr and BLS signatures.\n\nWe have also implemented ECDSA on alternative curves like secp256r1, which enables hardware signing using the secure enclave of iOS and Android devices.\n\nVault\n\nA non-custodial Bitcoin vault has been built, where bitcoins locked inside can only be transferred after a user defined time delay. A user can also set a spending limit per day and whitelists/blacklists, among other things.\n\nRecurring payments\n\nA Patreon-like service on Bitcoin has been implement to allow recurring payments.\n\nMultisig\n\nBitcoin has built-in support for multisig out of the box.\n\nNOTE:\n\n[1] The smart contract is called Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH).\n\nWatch: Blockchain: Data Power-Ups and NFTs for eSports & Online Games\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Crypto in Hawai\u2018i Is Still a \u201cLab\u201d Experiment\n\nEleven companies participate in the Digital Currency Innovation Lab while the state explores regulations and advocates push for open markets.\n\nIllustration: Getty Images; Mallory Adams-Nakamura\n\nCryptocurrency remains a \u201clab\u201d experiment in Hawai\u2018i, with 11 companies providing digital currency services in the state as part of the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. The lab, scheduled to end last summer, was instead extended until Dec. 30, 2024.\n\nHouse Bill 2108, designed to help create a new regulatory framework in Hawai\u2018i, made it all the way to conference committee in the last days of the 2022 Legislature but never passed. State Sen. Glenn Wakai, who has introduced cryptocurrency legislation in the past, says he doesn\u2019t plan to introduce new legislation during the 2023 Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe state should be very deliberate in how it grows the crypto market in Hawai\u2018i. So many people got hurt and swindled. It\u2019s the government\u2019s obligation to protect the public from bad actors,\u201d says Wakai.\n\nRyan Ozawa frequently reports on cryptocurrencies as the news editor for Decrypt, an online news platform that aims \u201cto demystify the decentralized web.\u201d He also once provided community engagement services for the digital currency lab, though no longer serves in that role.\n\nHe strongly supports greater access to digital investments.\n\n\u201cIn the absolute freedom model, you do whatever you want but you could also lose your house. In the consumer protection model, you have to jump through hoops, but you\u2019re less likely to lose your house. I see both sides of it. I believe in the \u2018buyer beware but have freedom model,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nNathaniel Harmon, CEO and co-founder of OceanBit Energy, a local Bitcoin mining startup, however, says well-built rules would benefit local communities.\n\n\u201cWe need good regulation here in the state. These exchanges, if they\u2019re selling Bitcoin, it\u2019s just a commodity. It\u2019s like buying or selling steel or buying and selling gold. Everything else is a security. Its value is dependent on the work that the company does, and the utility the company provides, so we should have strict regulation around these unregistered securities,\u201d Harmon says.\n\nRecommended: Bypassing the Bitcoin Blockade\n\nCentralized vs. Decentralized\n\nSome advocates of cryptocurrency emphasize the distinction between centralized exchanges and decentralized cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are companies that let customers trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional money or other digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies or cryptocurrencies.\n\nFTX is one example of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange; it was run by Sam Bankman-Fried and is now in bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried has been charged with fraud, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nHowever, there are decentralized cryptocurrencies in which transactions are user-based and user-controlled. Some of the best-known cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are decentralized. Such cryptocurrencies can also be traded on most exchanges, centralized or decentralized.\n\nCryptocurrencies can also be bought and sold by individuals in Hawai\u2018i through companies participating in the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. They can use online exchanges and brokerages, and other platforms such as some ATMs in Hawai\u2018i.\n\nLab director Iris Ikeda, who is also the state\u2019s commissioner of financial institutions, says the lab was formed to study the use and effectiveness of cryptocurrency companies \u2013 and whether or not they should be regulated.\n\nLiam Grist is the founder of Cloud Nalu, a Hawai\u2018i-based company that is participating in the lab and provides \u201ca brokerage application for buying and selling Bitcoin while prioritizing holding your own keys (self-custody).\u201d He says HB 2108 could have been a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d by providing easier access to cryptocurrency and trading practices, while also allowing unfairly leveraged and shady exchanges like FTX to operate in the Islands.\n\nIkeda, however, says added protection provided by HB 2108 would have been helpful to consumers.\n\nAwaiting Federal Regulation\n\nGrist says, \u201cRegulation coming from our national government, or the (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), will have a bigger impact on the crypto industry \u2013 more than any legislation Hawai\u2019i can come up with.\u201d\n\nOzawa agrees that Hawai\u2018i should hold off on legislation until the federal government creates a national framework. \u201cThere is no doubt there will be government action,\u201d he says.\n\nThe regulatory climate for cryptocurrencies currently varies from state to state.\n\nGrist would like to see a greater acceptance of digital currency by Hawai\u2018i\u2019s banks. That acceptance, he says, would help residents and the local economy, and each bank would become a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d by safely storing individuals\u2019 cryptocurrency investments.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can really change the future is by engaging and integrating with and building a new system founded on better incentives, founded in real, hard money. It\u2019ll take awhile, but it\u2019s an important thing to do,\u201d Grist says.\n\nIkeda says the lab will continue to allow digital currency transactions and will continue to conduct research that could show the benefits of crypto, including economic development.\n\nRecommended: Bypassing the Bitcoin Blockade\n\nWhile Harmon and Grist both support the lab and a regulatory framework, they also believe a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin should be viewed differently.\n\n\u201cThe difference with Bitcoin is that you can actually hold your own keys to that Bitcoin,\u201d Grist says. \u201cYou can hold your own property, and nobody can control it. I hope it (the lab) will help legislators decide in the future, (that) when we come up with bills in support of digital currency, we separate Bitcoin from crypto because they are two very different things.\u201d\n\nHarmon adds: \u201cBitcoin has no leader, no company behind it. It\u2019s fully decentralized and sets the bar. The vast majority (of cryptocurrencies) are scams. \u2026 If you\u2019re a Bitcoin-only exchange, there should be a different set of laws than being an unregistered securities exchange.\u201d"

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's market capitalisation is $470.16 billion, just slightly higher than Visa's market capitalization of $469.87 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Companies Market Cap, Bitcoin has overtaken Visa's market capitalisation for the third time. The first time this happened was in December 2020, when Bitcoin reached $25,000 for the first time during a period of significant price growth, from $10,200 in September 2020 to $63,170 in April 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa's market capitalisation exceeded Bitcoin's between June and October 2022, but on October 1st, Bitcoin briefly surpassed Visa again before Visa regained its lead. The lead between Bitcoin's market capitalisation and Visa's widened after the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, which caused Bitcoin to lose over $100 billion in value over four days in November 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since then, Bitcoin has fully recovered and added $65 billion on top of its market capitalisation of $408 billion on November 6, which allowed it to overtake Visa once again. It's important to note that the market capitalisation difference between Bitcoin and Visa is small, so they are currently frequently overtaking each other by the hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has had a remarkable start to 2023 and has surpassed Visa's market capitalisation for the third time. This was due to a 14-day period of continuous price increases between January 4th and 17th.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently ahead of Mastercard, the second-largest payment processing network, which has a market capitalization of $345.24 billion, according to Google Finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's value is still 63 percent lower than its all-time high of $69,044, which it reached on November 10th, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist.

        "content": "The Electrum Bitcoin Wallet is a non-custodial digital wallet that uses hot storage, and can combine with the services of a cold storage hardware wallet for extra security. Electrum is one of the oldest Bitcoin wallets, having originated in 2011. This wallet uses two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure no one else can access your BTC.\n\nTop perks\n\nStraightforward installation\n\nElectrum makes everything easy to download and install, walking you through every step of the process in their installation wizard. This takes all of the complex technological mumbo jumbo and figures it out for you. With Electrum, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting anything wrong during setup. After installation, you can be sure that everything is correct, and get to storing your Bitcoin fast.\n\nHardware wallet compatibility\n\nBy default, Electrum offers hot storage, which is open to invasion from hackers. Electrum also gives users the option to transfer their Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, keeping their coins safe offline. Users can also download the wallet on an offline device to achieve a similar result. Electrum supports many of the most powerful and popular hardware wallets around. It recommends the Ledger Nano series of hardware wallets for storing Bitcoin.\n\nPersonalized security\n\nElectrum offers different options for securing the Bitcoins you entrust to them. With Electrum, you can choose whether you want your wallet to be set up with multiple-signature security, 2FA, or standard security for watch-only wallets. These options give you more flexibility in how your Bitcoin is stored.\n\nIf you are looking for the highest in security, you might want a multi-signature wallet, which is the most secure of Electrum\u2019s options. Standard wallets have the least security measures. These might be best for users who wish to hold their Bitcoin on an offline device or transfer it to a hardware wallet. For a good middle ground between these two extremes, 2FA is a good choice. This option provides an added layer of security, while still allowing quick access to your funds.\n\nOpen-source application\n\nElectrum\u2019s software is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view and comment on the layout of the application\u2019s code. This means anyone can look over the code to find potential software errors or vulnerabilities. With more eyes on the makeup of the system, potential cracks in the system\u2019s defenses can be spotted before hackers can exploit them. Because of this, Electrum\u2019s design will be consistently updated to ensure evolving security.\n\nWhat could be improved\n\nBitcoin only\n\nAspiring investors may choose another wallet over Electrum due to its sole focus on Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin is the only coin supported on Electrum. If you are looking for a place to store all your digital currency, Electrum cannot help with this. Bitcoin is not the only well-known cryptocurrency anymore. An increase in the number of supported currencies would give Electrum the ability to serve a wider variety of crypto traders.\n\nPast security issues\n\nElectrum\u2019s service has experienced some security breaches. Years ago, many users lost the Bitcoin stored on their hot wallets, and Electrum took much heat for it. Today, Electrum offers more robust security measures for their users. Electrum is once again considered a safe place to store Bitcoin. Yet, if a security breach can happen once, it may happen again. Malicious users are always finding new ways to get around successful security measures. Electrum\u2019s past safety failures raise concerns about the future, even with improved security measures in place. This encourages more users to invest in cold storage hardware to hold their coins should they choose to use Electrum."

After the seller confirms they've received the funds, the Bitcoin is released from escrow and sent to the buyer. This provides protection for both the buyer and the seller. However, it's worth mentioning there are scammers who attempt to steal people's crypto or cash.\n\nNo buying or selling fees\n\nThere are no fees for buying or selling Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins, making it an affordable way to invest in crypto. If you post an ad, LocalBitcoins charges a 1% escrow fee on every completed trade. You can avoid that fee by responding to ads instead of posting your own. It's an active exchange, so there are usually plenty of offers available.\n\nWide variety of payment options\n\nLocalBitcoins allows users to choose nearly any payment method they want. Users list the payment methods they'll accept in their ads. When you search for offers, you can add filters for specific payment methods.\n\nHere are some of the payment methods available on LocalBitcoins:\n\nBank transfers\n\nMoney wires\n\nPayment apps, such as Zelle and PayPal\n\nOther cryptocurrencies\n\nThe most notable payment method you can't use on LocalBitcoins is cash.

        "content": "To say that 2022 is a catastrophic year for cryptocurrencies would be an understatement.\n\nFollowing a series of high-profile collapses from stablecoins to crypto exchanges, investors entered 2023 with a mix of trepidation and resignation.\n\nHowever, it seems as though cryptocurrencies might be tumbling out of a rough patch as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several other cryptocurrencies have started to rise.\n\nToday, the price of Bitcoin has rallied by at least a third more since the start of the year.\n\nIs this a fluke, or has the dreaded \u2018crypto winter\u2019 begun to thaw to give way to summer?\n\nHas Bitcoin turned bullish?\n\nBitcoin is showing bullish tendencies these days/ Image Credit: Bitcoin.com News\n\nEven though the crypto market is still a far cry from its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021, there are signs that things are looking up.\n\nBitcoin, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation is experiencing an unexpectedly strong start to the year.\n\nThe question is why.\n\nFor a start, it might be due to the US Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its interest rate hikes, which helped Bitcoin to maintain its rising trajectory and outperform other asset classes.\n\nIn addition, analysts feel that favourable market conditions (i.e. US inflation easing for the seventh consecutive month) could see Bitcoin recapture some of its losses in 2023.\n\nAccording to Nigel Green, CEO of the financial advisory firm deVere Group, we might technically still be in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control.\n\nHalving \u2013 a pivotal event for Bitcoin\n\nBut a more likely reason behind the bullish behaviour is the once every four years Bitcoin halving event, which is due to take place in 2024.\n\nCurrently, miners are paid 6.25 BTC for each Bitcoin block mined. This number will reduce to 3.125 BTC next year at the halving.\n\nAs a result of the halving cycle, the supply of available Bitcoin in the market decreases, which raises the value of Bitcoins.\n\nFor that reason, halving is a monumental event that would help lift the prices of Bitcoin out of the doldrums.\n\nBitcoin halving could trigger prices to rise/ Image Credit: Cointelegraph\n\nAnd judging from historical data, investors can expect a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s pricing in the months after halving.\n\nIn fact, commodity guru Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin could reach six figures in a couple of years.\n\nI fully expect Bitcoin in the next couple of years, by probably around the halving, maybe 2025, to get to US$100,000. Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone\n\nLastly, survival of the fittest is an evolutionary theory that extends to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe shockwaves of 2022, while devastating to investors, should be seen as an industry-wide detox to get rid of the black sheep and the weak players.\n\nRaoul Ullens, the co-founder of Brussels Blockchain Week, seems to think so too.\n\n\u201cAn unhealthy ecosystem will not attract the masses. A drop in the crypto asset markets is not only necessary but also healthy, contributing as it does to rebalancing the valuation of cryptocurrencies,\u201d he said.\n\nCryptocurrencies are not going away\n\nThere might be no urgent case for CBDC now but the study by MAS does envision it/ Image Credit: Cointelegraph\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have suffered their worst year, but their biggest fans are more than aware of the risks involved with this volatile investment and choose to take the plunge anyway.\n\nAnd considering the growing interest in the metaverse, cryptocurrencies will continue to be used as a digital currency for transactions in the digital space.\n\nIn addition, it is likely that we will see the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the future, a move that will give digital assets more credence.\n\nTherefore, while the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) might have assessed that the case for CBDCs in Singapore is not compelling enough after a pilot study, they have not ruled out its possibility in the future.\n\nFor those who do not mind taking a punt, dipping your fingers into crypto right now might not be such a bad idea.\n\nRemember, just don\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Nasdaq"

Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nHistorical patterns\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s bear market of 2014 lasted for 426 days or 14 months, followed by 1,065 days or 35 months of bullishness that started in early 2015 and hadn\u2019t ended until 2018. Then a bearish period ensued that lasted for 427 days or 14 months, upon the end of which a bull market of 1,004 days or 33 months began.\n\nIn mid-2021, another bear market started, which ended at the beginning of 2023, thanks to the renewed optimism in the industry. Should the crypto expert\u2019s analysis prove correct, and history repeats itself this time around as well, it means that the crypto sector is in for another 33-35 months of the bullish rally, potentially aiming for $220,000 by mid-2026.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was at press time changing hands at the price of $24,872, recording increases on all of its charts, including gains of 0.77% on the day, 14.2% across the previous week and 9.54% over the past month.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn terms of its nearer future, Bitcoin seems set upon a bullish rally this week as well, as it targets the $25,000 goal upon capitulating and then forming a foundation for the next leg up, the pattern which has often repeated itself before.\n\nAt the same time, PricePredictions\u2019 machine learning algorithms indicate only a slight increase in the price of the maiden digital asset by March 1, as the sentiment on the 1-week gauges remains positive, Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The sudden surge of Ordinal projects has brought about a renewed interest in the oldest most successful blockchain in the world, the Bitcoin network. Although not an entirely new discovery, the rising popularity of these kinds of projects is seen to benefit Bitcoin or even the entire crypto landscape in a lot of ways.\n\nOrdinal projects refer to projects that are built within the Bitcoin blockchain, using its underlying technology to create new and innovative applications. Initially, it enables one to inscribe images or NFTs as well as other forms of digital data directly in each satoshi or a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThe proponent of the system is Udi Wertheimer, a self-employed developer and consultant in blockchain projects. The first of these digital artifacts was only launched in January this year, but they have experienced a boom since then. These were recorded spiking over 100,000 during the Valentine\u2019s Day celebration, which brought about system congestion within the Bitcoin network.\n\nDespite this rather unfortunate event, crypto enthusiasts are more than hopeful about the promises of these new projects. Ordinal projects are foreseen to benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem in many ways, including the following:\n\n1. Incentivizing Miners\n\nThe spike in the creation of Ordinals in the past couple of weeks has contributed to the increase in the transaction fees and typical block size on the Bitcoin blockchain. The demand is particularly boosted by the scarcity of block space in the system for inscriptions. These will hopefully be enough to incentivize miners as revenues coming from mining rewards are expected to go down at each halving of Bitcoin.\n\n2. Enhanced Security\n\nHigher transaction fees are projected by Wertheimer to bring about better incentivization for miners to further secure the Bitcoin network. He strongly believes that the rising demand for Ordinals will attract more people willing to pay fees to keep the blockchain safeguarded.\n\n3. More Profitability\n\nIn addition, the Ordinal projects developer believes that new use cases may be discovered later on that can potentially make Bitcoin more commercially profitable in the future.\n\n4. Enhanced Functionality\n\nOrdinal projects can add new features and capabilities to the Bitcoin blockchain that were not realized in its original design. As shown recently, the scope of Ordinal projects encompasses more than just the realm of NFTs. Aside from JPEG images, they can be used to inscribe other forms of digital art, profile picture (PFP) projects, and even the original 1993 version of the Doom video game.\n\n5. Increased Adoption\n\nBy making it easier and more efficient to use Bitcoin, ordinal projects can help further promote the adoption and usage of this cryptocurrency. This can lead to more users, more transactions, and more overall value in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, ordinal projects can help expand the utility of the Bitcoin blockchain in ways never fully explored before. Likewise, the introduction of these at the forefront of the crypto industry can support the Bitcoin ecosystem in widening its reach in various niches, making it a more useful and valuable technology for different users and businesses going onward."
