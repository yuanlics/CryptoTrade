        "title": "SEC's Gensler Warns Crypto Investors, but Differentiates Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nGary Gensler, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has recently made some comments on the legal status of Bitcoin that investors should note.\n\nGensler, who has spent much of his career with investment banks and government positions, has commented on the legal status of bitcoin in his role as the SEC chair several times since 2021. The SEC is designed to ensure a safe regulatory environment for investors and to protect consumers from illegal activity, making its positions important to any crypto investor.\n\nOn February 27, Gensler made comments in an interview about the state of the wider crypto industry. Specifically, he claimed that \u201ceverything but bitcoin\u201d could be considered a security in the world of cryptocurrency, while bitcoin could be considered a commodity due to its stature and resolutely-decentralized nature. The difference between securities and commodities is often determined by the Howey Test, based on a Supreme Court case from 1946, which dictates that the difference between the two is determined by the expectation that investors will profit as well as the status of the party offering a sale. Securities must follow a far more stringent series of restrictions than commodities do, so Gensler\u2019s determination of bitcoin\u2019s status could have major investment implications.\n\nIn what Time called a \u201cfederal offensive\u201d against the cryptocurrency industry, it noted that Gensler\u2019s SEC has been shutting down a variety of crypto businesses and leading other institutions like the Federal Reserve to decry the risks of crypto and stablecoins. Gensler has personally questioned exchanges\u2019 ability to custody funds, saying that, \u201cJust because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn\u2019t mean that it is.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that these are only his personal views and not in themselves a binding opinion of the federal government\u2019s, but nevertheless, they have been provocative enough for Ripple to call on Gensler to recuse himself in an ongoing legal battle between itself and the SEC.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s design renders it immune from many criticisms of the broader industry and Gensler has claimed unequivocally that bitcoin should be held to different standards. Any arguments against a particular exchange or altcoin project will not apply to the first-ever cryptocurrency. However, even if bitcoin itself will not be attacked, a frostier environment for the wider world of crypto could have negative effects. An important goal for Bitcoiners is widespread adoption, which could be more difficult if exchanges dealing in bitcoin go under. The same effects could hold for a crackdown on miners and lenders, even if Bitcoin exists worldwide.\n\nAs a result, investors need to be cautious about these developments and their potential impacts on the world of cryptocurrency, and also recognize the variety of reasons that betting on bitcoin remains the best and safest option for many. Even with a variety of hostile attacks to the ecosystem as a whole, one can never forget that Bitcoin is the first trailblazer, with years of experience in flourishing under hostile regulators. Any number of cryptocurrency projects could become more dicey propositions if the federal government takes up a firm offense, but Bitcoin has demonstrated time and again that it is capable of coming out of these periods stronger than ever before.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The hopeful optimism of Bitcoin (BTC) traders seemed to dissipate in the first week of March as key on-chain metrics provided resistance.\n\nNow Bitcoin is threatening a retest of the $22,000 level, and a wave of short sellers would stand to profit if that occurred. If the short sellers\u2019 strike price hits, some analysts believe Bitcoin could drop as low as $19,000.\n\nBitcoin options by strike price. Source: Coinglass\n\nA handful of analysts still project BTC to hit $25,000 in the short-term, on-chain data highlighting a few reasons for price resistance at higher levels.\n\nRealized price metric highlights profit-taking\n\nMarket participants\u2019 concern over the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes and high inflation are heavy macro headwinds facing Bitcoin and this has investors weighing the time value of money (TVM) of BTC investments. To measure TVM on-chain, Bitcoin holders can be put into groups based on the amount of time they held BTC and average the acquisition cost.\n\nInvestors that purchased BTC within the last six months benefited from the early bear market conditions and have an average realized price of $21,000, which places them in profit. The average market realized price across all BTC holders is $19,800, also currently in profit.\n\nConversely, BTC held for over six months has a higher realized price than the rest of the market groups at $23,500. When Bitcoin reaches above $23,500, the holders that have seen little TVM return for over six months potentially put pressure on a breakout as they get antsy to lock in profits.\n\nBitcoin supply cost basis by time held. Source: Glassnode\n\nLiquidity inflows increase but pale in comparision to 2022\n\nBitcoin price is highly reactive to interest rates and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which puts a strain on risk assets. The negative impact of these factors is great for short sellers but bad for Bitcoin. The best way for Bitcoin to withstand short-seller pressure is for new long liquidity and spot buyers to enter the market.\n\nAnalyzing exchange net flows is a good way to measure new liquidity and currently this metric reflects a 34% uptick since the start of 2023, but it lags behind the yearly daily average of $1.6 billion.\n\nBitcoin exchange volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nCurrently, the general consensus among analysts is that the ability to onboard new liquidity into the crypto market has been hindered by a crackdown on banks that support crypto-oriented businesses.\n\nThe uptick in unrealized Bitcoin profits mirrors previous cycles\n\nWhile some Bitcoin investors were realizing profit, positive on-chain signals appear when looking at the Net Unrealized Profit / Loss metric (NUPL). The NUPL metric shows the difference between unrealized Bitcoin profit and unrealized loss within the BTC supply.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, NUPL metrics on March 6 show:\n\n\u201cSince mid-January, the weekly average of NUPL has shifted from a state of net unrealized loss to a positive condition. This indicates that the average Bitcoin holder is now holding a net unrealized profit of magnitude of approximately 15% of the market cap. This pattern resembles a market structure equivalent to transition phases in previous bear markets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NUPL. Source: Glassnode\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 momentum may have paused in mid-February and many headwinds remain, there are positive signs that the transition out of the deepest phase of thbear market is near.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Shares of the trust \u2014 each representing a share of ownership of the Bitcoins in the pot \u2014 trade publicly on OTC Markets like shares of stock. If you have some Bitcoins and want shares of the pot, you can go to Grayscale Investments LLC \u2014 which runs the trust \u2014 and give them your Bitcoins, and they will give you back shares in the pot. If you have shares of the pot and you want some Bitcoins, however, you can\u2019t go to Grayscale and ask for the Bitcoins back. The pot is one-way. Bitcoins can come in, but they cannot leave.\n\nThis is suboptimal product design for customers, but it is very very good product design for Grayscale. As an asset manager, it is just good business to run a pot of money that can increase (when people put in Bitcoins) but not decrease (they can\u2019t take them out). Grayscale has got all these Bitcoins in the pot \u2014 about $14 billion worth \u2014 and, as the manager of the pot, it gets to charge fees on the money in the pot. The fee is 2% per year, so Grayscale collects about $280 million a year for sitting on its giant pot of Bitcoin. Grayscale also has a Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the same idea but for Ether; that has $4.7 billion of Ether in the pot and a 2.5% annual fee."

        "title": "Did Bitcoin Bottom in November? These Metrics Suggest So. - Blockworks",
        "content": "Hopeful signs are emerging for the crypto industry mid-term as on-chain metrics for bitcoin suggest the world\u2019s largest digital asset by market value may have hit its bottom in late 2022.\n\nThose include the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) and the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss metric (NUPL), both of which flashed a trend reversal following FTX\u2019s collapse in November.\n\nThe rally in digital assets, represented by the price increase in bitcoin (BTC), as well as ether (ETH) this year, is reinforcing that play. Both assets are up 35% and 30% on a year-to-date basis trading at $22,450 and $1,550 respectively, Blockworks Research data shows.\n\nData provided by CryptoQuant shows MVRV hit its lowest point on Nov. 9, right around the time revelations came to light that FTX had allegedly misappropriated user funds, at a reading of 0.75.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a metric used to determine whether an asset, in this case, bitcoin, is undervalued or overvalued.\n\nWhen the ratio is above 3.7, bitcoin is said to be overvalued and may be at a market top. Conversely, when the reading is below 1, the asset is considered undervalued and may be at a market bottom.\n\nThe last time the MVRV ratio was around as its November print was way back on Dec. 15, 2018, when the price of one bitcoin traded at $3,200. Despite a relatively uneventful year for price action in 2019, bitcoin never dipped below its 2018 lows.\n\nNUPL, a metric used to measure the average profit margin of all bitcoin holders, began to flash similar signs around the same time.\n\nLike the MVRV ratio, the NUPL can indicate whether bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued. Historically, NUPL levels above 0.7 (70% average profit margin) have signaled market tops, while levels below -0.4 (-40% profit margin) have signaled market bottoms.\n\nThe NUPL reading for bitcoin reached a low of -0.3 in November at a price of $15,800 and has held a positive reading since the middle of January. The NUPL is currently trending at 0.1 after crossing a 365-day moving average threshold, signaling bitcoin may have commenced a new upward cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that although there are indications of a potential \u201ccrypto spring,\u201d analysts cautioned at the end of February that it is still premature to declare at this point.\n\nThey warned against the lingering presence of ongoing inflation, the possibility of future rate hikes and wider macroeconomic uncertainty which may cause further downward momentum.\n\nPrevious price history is also telling. While it\u2019s entirely plausible a mean reversion following the November drawdown is well underway, a daily close below about $21,400 \u2014 the most recent nadir on Feb. 13, could hint at further pain.\n\nCryptoassets can fall considerably further and still maintain the current uptrend on macro timeframes, even if the late November low holds. But the total drawdown in the bitcoin price from its November 2021 peak to November 2022 trough, of about 77% is broadly similar to prior cycles in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nL2\u2019s a better indicator than the majors?\n\nSome like Rich Falk-Wallace, CEO of crypto data analytics platform Arcana suggest that on-chain activity is a better indicator of price for less utilized blockchains than for those fully utilized like bitcoin and ether.\n\n\u201cFor alternative coins and layer-2s, we\u2019ve seen 90%+ mid-term correlations between daily active users and prices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for bitcoin and ether, both chains hit full capacity around 2018, which means user numbers have essentially been static since that time.\u201d\n\nHitting capacity for bitcoin and ether refers to the point where they reached their effective block capacity limits, beyond which the fees grow exponentially to restrict further demand for block space.\n\nThis results in a gradual increase in daily active addresses since there are restrictions on address growth. Falk-Wallace further explained that the incremental increase in value for these chains must come from a rise in value per active address instead of an increase in users.\n\nThat means there exists a \u201cstrong relationship\u201d between daily active users and prices for alternative coins and layer-2s, where an increase in daily active users on those chains is highly correlated with an increase in bitcoin\u2019s price, over a medium-term period.\n\n\u201cIf you look at dollar value transferred on-chain, the metric is well correlated to BTC\u2019s price historically. And that bottomed \u2014 and has languished \u2014 since November,\u201d Falk-Wallace said.\n\nThat means, even if the bottom is in, investors may be in for a period of relative boredom.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Aside from the obvious high correlations to bitcoin prices, one of the most frequent criticism lobbed at the bitcoin mining industry is that the group isn\u2019t environmentally astute and that its core activity is a drag on climate efforts.\n\nIn theory, that could be seen as a sign that exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) aren\u2019t credible avenues for investors looking to tap into industries embracing clean tech and renewable energy. Interestingly, some experts argue that the opposite is true.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no denying that bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive endeavor, some market observers believe that related criticisms lack context and miss the mark when it comes to analyzing the industry\u2019s potential to drive increased adoption of renewable energy sources.\n\n\u201cHaving governments clamp down on Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage or attempting to switch how transactions are processed would not only undermine the Bitcoin network but also impede energy innovation, positive environmental outcomes and economic opportunity in America,\u201d wrote Dennis Porter for CoinDesk.\n\nAs Porter noted, bitcoin can serve as a catalyst for expanding renewable energy because it solves two of the biggest issues associated with traditional renewables, such as wind and solar: costs and reliability.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners stand ready to purchase excess energy from wind and solar farms, improving the revenue for renewable generation and preventing taxpayers from subsidizing the generation of energy. A win-win,\u201d he noted.\n\nThat\u2019s pertinent to the SATO investment thesis because the ETF, which follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, features a slew of bitcoin miners among its 37 holdings.\n\nDue to the drubbings incurred by many of those firms during the 2022 crypto winter, market values across the industry are well off prior highs. As a result, more than 63% of SATO members are classified as small-cap fare.\n\nBitcoin miners serve other objectives, including the potential for sending excess power back to energy grids, allowing grid operators to improve reliability while reducing customer costs.\n\n\u201cMiners aren\u2019t just good for renewables. They can also make use of stranded methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that is often uneconomical to bring to market. Methane is frequently vented or flared from landfills, abandoned wells, and oil and gas operations,\u201d concluded Porter.\n\nAdd it all up, and SATO could be more of a renewable energy play than meets the eye.\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee. However, SATO is not issued, sponsored, endorsed or sold by VettaFi, and VettaFi has no obligation or liability in connection with the issuance, administration, marketing or trading of SATO.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

By midday ET, GBTC shares fell slightly from their earlier high, trading around $12.50.\n\nGrayscale, represented by former solicitor general Donald Verrilli Jr., argued that the SEC had been \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in approving an ETF based on the futures market for Bitcoin, but then denying Grayscale\u2019s ETF based on the spot market.\n\nThe SEC, represented by senior counsel Emily Parise, countered that the futures market was regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through a surveillance agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while spot markets remain unregulated and are subject to fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe three judges for the court\u2014Sri Srinivasan, Harry T. Edwards, and Neomi Rao\u2014expressed skepticism toward the SEC position, seeming to side with Grayscale\u2019s argument that the futures market relied on the spot market for its underlying pricing, and therefore fraud and manipulation would affect both. Even as Grayscale provided data that showed the two markets were 99.9% correlated, Parise said that it was not empirically sufficient.\n\n\u201cIt seems there\u2019s quite a bit of information on how these markets work together,\u201d Rao noted to Parise. \u201cThe SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.\u201d\n\nJames Angel, a faculty member at Georgetown\u2019s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy specializing in market structure and financial regulation, told Fortune the judges seemed to understand Grayscale\u2019s economic argument that the SEC accepted one product and arbitrarily rejected another.\n\nEven so, the case will likely come down to the doctrine of Chevron deference, which entails courts giving agencies like the SEC latitude to interpret statutes related to their expertise. Even though the Supreme Court has recently reduced the amount of administrative deference, agencies such as the SEC generally have a wide remit to interpret statute\u2014in this case, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nEven as the judges appeared unconvinced of the SEC\u2019s arguments, Angel said that the outcome is still uncertain. \u201cMy crystal ball is cloudy,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThere is also the question of what would happen if the judges side with Grayscale. Rao asked Parise if the SEC would go back on its approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF. Parise said she could not speak for the commission, but that it would have to \u201cthink about the issue anew.\u201d\n\nGrayscale, a subsidiary of crypto empire Digital Currency Group, currently operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a fund holding nearly $15 billion in assets. When it launched in 2013, it represented one of the first financial instruments for investors to get access to Bitcoin without buying it directly.\n\nAlthough investors can buy shares of the trust, they cannot redeem them back into Bitcoin\u2014a limitation that has caused the fund to trade at a significant discount to the price of its underlying Bitcoin. Verrilli argued that converting the trust to a spot-based ETF would unlock $4 billion in value.\n\n\u201cThe court asked thoughtful, pointed questions about the inextricable link between Bitcoin spot markets and Bitcoin futures markets\u2014the exact points that are the bedrock of the case to convert GBTC to an ETF,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson told Fortune. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s final decision, and strongly believe that American investors deserve to have equal access to the Bitcoin ETF product that best suits their needs.\u201d\n\nGiven the recent torrent of enforcement actions by the SEC, a Grayscale win would set back Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crackdown against the crypto industry, although, as Parise alluded, it could also cause the agency to revisit its approval of a Bitcoin futures ETF. The approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would open the market to new investors, likely causing the price of Bitcoin to rise.\n\nEven with an uncertain outcome, the surge in GBTC\u2019s share price indicated investors are optimistic that judges would side with Grayscale. A decision is expected by the end of the summer."

        "title": "Is the IMF shutting the door prematurely on Bitcoin as legal tender? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There\u2019s been little sunlight this crypto winter, so it may seem odd to present the \u201cBitcoin as legal tender\u201d argument again. That is, will or should any country \u2014 other than El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR), which have already done so \u2014 declare Bitcoin (BTC) an official national currency?\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised the issue again last week in a paper putting forth nine crypto-focused policy actions that its 190 member countries should adopt. First on its list of \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d was elevating crypto to \u201clegal tender.\u201d Or, as the multilateral lending institution\u2019s executive board assessment stated:\n\n\u201cDirectors generally agreed that crypto assets should not be granted official currency or legal tender status in order to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not fair to ask the question with crypto back on its heels, but was the IMF right to warn its member banks about cryptocurrencies? And if so, what exactly is lacking in the composition of private digital money that makes it unsuitable as an official national currency? Maybe it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s well-documented volatility, but if that\u2019s the case, couldn\u2019t the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency still grow into a new role as an auxiliary scrip \u2014 perhaps in a few years when it has more users, is more liquid, and exhibits less price variance?\n\nThe IMF must tread carefully\n\n\u201cThe IMF\u2019s mandate is to promote global economic stability and growth. It is therefore reasonable that the IMF has recently advised countries to refrain from granting legal tender status to crypto-assets, which are, by design, often disruptive in nature,\u201d Gavin Brown, associate professor in financial technology at the University of Liverpool, told Cointelegraph. \u201cSuch disruption does arguably present just as many opportunities as threats, but the IMF must tread a more prudent path when faced with such open-ended uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are very good economic reasons why most countries would not want to adopt cryptocurrencies like BTC as their local scrip,\u201d James Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, told Cointelegraph. \u201cIn short, they don\u2019t want to lose the profits from printing their own money or the economic control over the economy that fiat currencies provide.\u201d\n\nWhile crypto maximalists may skewer governments for printing money non-stop to paper over deficits, \u201csometimes, the right thing to do is to print money,\u201d added Angel, \u201clike in the Great Recession or the pandemic. The trick is not to print too much, which happened in the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bitcoin was made for the Global South\u2019\n\nIn its policy paper, the IMF had multiple arguments for its position beyond crypto\u2019s well-documented volatility. It could expose government revenues to foreign exchange rate risk. Domestic prices \u201ccould become highly unstable\u201d because businesses and households would spend time deciding whether to hold fiat or BTC \u201cas opposed to engaging in productive activities.\u201d Governments would have to allow citizens to pay taxes in Bitcoin \u2014 and so on.\n\nAdopting crypto as legal tender could even affect a government\u2019s social policy objectives, the IMF paper stated, \u201cparticularly for unbacked tokens, as their high price volatility could affect poor households more.\u201d\n\nBut questions remain. Even if the IMF arguments are valid and hold in most circumstances, aren\u2019t there exceptions? What about developing countries struggling with inflationary currencies, like Turkey?\n\n\u201cBitcoin was made for the Global South,\u201d Ray Youssef, co-founder and CEO of Paxful \u2014 and a founder of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation \u2014 told Cointelegraph. \u201cIn the West, a lot of attention is paid toward the suspected volatility of Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the world runs on the dollar and the West is shielded from global inflation. Right now, Turkey has an inflation rate of over 50%, and Nigeria has an inflation rate of over 20% \u2014 in these economies, Bitcoin is a strong bet.\u201d\n\nBut even in instances like these, it may not be so easy. \u201cIn order for cryptocurrency to be used effectively as legal tender in developing countries, governments will [still] need to heavily invest in the technological infrastructure and a suitable regulatory framework,\u201d Syedur Rahman, a partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli, told Cointelegraph. If this can be done, it \u201cwill assist in financial inclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdopting a foreign/hard currency or monetary standard is a last resort to rein in hyperinflation,\u201d commented Angel. \u201cBut even weak governments like to have the power of the printing press, as it provides a taxation mechanism to pay the troops.\u201d\n\nThe Central African Republic made crypto legal tender in April 2022 \u2014 the second country to do so, after El Salvador. Some CAR representatives said that crypto would help reduce fees for financial transactions in and out of the country. Maybe that, too, is a valid reason to elevate crypto to official currency.\n\nRahman acknowledged that \u201cthere are benefits such as seeing a reduction in transaction fees for financial transactions. If there is a weak traditional banking system or lack of trust, then cryptocurrency undoubtedly can provide an alternative means of payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemittance is a great use case for Bitcoin,\u201d said Youssef. \u201cMoney transfer companies charge high fees and funds can take days to arrive.\u201d Bitcoin cuts down on fees, and transactions can take minutes. People who may not have a bank account can take advantage of remittances too. \u201cThis is a huge deal when you look at the amount remittances bring into some countries. In El Salvador, remittances account for over a quarter of the country\u2019s GDP.\u201d\n\nOthers were dismissive, however. \u201cI think legal tender status in this context is likely a gimmick. I\u2019m not sure how I might be more motivated to send BTC to someone living in CAR just because BTC is now viewed as legal tender in that jurisdiction,\u201d David Andolfatto, economics department chair and professor at the University of Miami\u2019s Miami Herbert Business School, told Cointelegraph.\n\nMoreover, the act of granting a \u201cforeign\u201d currency legal tender status \u201cseems to me to be an admission that a country\u2019s institutions cannot be trusted to govern society effectively,\u201d added Andolfatto, a former senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis where he became one of the world\u2019s first central bankers to deliver a public talk on Bitcoin in 2014.\n\nBitcoin remains questionable as legal tender because it does little to quell the so-called \u201cflight-to-safety\u201d phenomenon, wherein the demand for money shifts violently with sudden changes in consumer or business sentiment, Andolfatto explained.\n\n\u201cThese violent swings in the price level are unnecessary [...] What is needed is a monetary policy that expands the supply of money to accommodate the demand for money in times of stress. The provision of an \u2018elastic currency\u2019 serves to stabilize the price level for the benefit of the economy as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransaction fees are a friction on global economic activity,\u201d noted Brown, and developing nations often bear the burden of these inefficiencies. Still, \u201cIn my view, a pivot to crypto assets, such as in El Salvador today, is a risk too big to take,\u201d Brown said. Georgetown\u2019s Angel added, \u201cEl Salvador and CAR are special cases since they did not have their own currency to start with.\u201d\n\nMore maturity\n\nBitcoin is still relatively young and volatile. But with wider adoption, including institutional investors, couldn\u2019t it become a stable asset, more like gold? \u201cThere is some merit to this argument,\u201d says Andolfatto. \u201cI believe BTC price volatility will diminish as the product matures.\u201d But even if BTC remains stable for long periods of time, \u201cit will always be susceptible to \u2018flight-to-safety\u2019 phenomena that would generate sudden large deflations \u2014 or inflations if people are dumping BTC,\u201d he added. \u201cBTC will appear stable, but it will remain fragile.\u201d\n\nYouseff, like some others, suspects the IMF has ulterior motives in all this. The fund is interested in self-perpetuation, he suggested, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin has proven to lower inflation, give more people access to the economy and international work, increase transparency and act as a universal translator of money. It also has the potential to lessen a country\u2019s reliance on international centralized power \u2014 like the IMF. It\u2019s not hard to connect the dots on why the IMF is not welcoming of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cCryptoassets such as Bitcoin are still young in currency terms,\u201d noted Brown, but their inherent weaknesses like price volatility and pseudo-anonymity could present \u201cinsurmountable challenges from the perspective of nation-states. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has become a backstop alternative when fiat currencies fail through macroeconomic events such as hyperinflation and controls around capital flight.\u201d\n\nIf not the lead, still a supporting role?\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s agree with the IMF, crypto skeptics and others that there is no future role for Bitcoin as legal tender or official currency \u2014 even in the developing world. Does that still preclude BTC and other cryptocurrencies from playing a useful social or economic role globally?\n\n\u201cI see a very useful role for crypto technology, which is why I have been a vocal proponent of CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] since 2014,\u201d answered Angel. \u201cThere are very good reasons why over 100 central banks are working on these.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s skeptical about Bitcoin because \u201cgovernments have a long history of pushing private money aside. I\u2019m surprised that it has taken as long as it has for governments to react and attempt to push aside Bitcoin in order to get all the seigniorage revenue for themselves.\u201d\n\nOverall, crypto assets such as Bitcoin may continue \u201cto be held in limbo by many nation states and regulators,\u201d opined Brown, given that they are inherently anti-establishment but also \u201cnear impossible\u201d to ban in free societies.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets can still serve a positive role as \u201cthe trigger forcing the monopoly, which are central banks,\u201d to think again about their monetary policies \u201cand to innovate in response,\u201d said Brown."

        "content": "DC Circuit Court of Appeals judges grilled the SEC on why the regulator approved bitcoin futures exchange-traded products (ETPs) and not Grayscale Investments\u2019 proposed spot offering Tuesday \u2014 a line of questioning one analyst said could signal a ruling in favor of the crypto-focused asset manager.\n\nThe comments came in oral arguments in front of judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao and Harry Edwards Tuesday. The proceeding came after Grayscale and the SEC exchanged written briefs in recent months.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC last June after the agency did not allow the firm to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nGBTC launched in 2013 and holds $14 billion in assets. The trust has traded at a discount of more than 40% in recent weeks. Grayscale has said its preferred solution is converting the trust to an ETF.\n\nDonald Verrilli Jr., a former US solicitor general who Grayscale hired last year as a legal strategist, kicked off the hearing. Verrilli reiterated that the SEC\u2019s approval of ETFs investing in CME-traded bitcoin futures, but not for proposed ETPs that invest in bitcoin directly \u2014 such as what GBTC would convert to \u2014 is discriminatory.\n\nEmily Parise, an attorney representing the SEC, contended that bitcoin futures ETPs are different from the proposed spot bitcoin products the agency has denied. Bitcoin spot markets are \u201cfragmented and unregulated,\u201d Parise said.\n\nUnderlying products for the approved bitcoin futures ETFs instead trade only on CME, which is CFTC-regulated, she added, where the \u201cexchange has a surveillance sharing agreement that gives it access to information like market trading activity, customer identification \u2014 the tools to investigate fraud and manipulation if it were to occur.\u201d\n\nJudges grill the SEC\n\nRao, during the hearing Tuesday, interrupted Parise on that point, saying the SEC needs to explain how it views the relationship between bitcoin futures and the spot price of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me\u2026one is essentially a derivative of the other,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThey move together 99.9% of the time, so where\u2019s the gap in the commission\u2019s view?\u201d\n\nParise said the correlation between once-a-day futures prices and spot prices doesn\u2019t signal the \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the two.\n\nBut Rao added the SEC has not offered an explanation why Grayscale is wrong as it relates to the relationship between the bitcoin spot and futures markets. The judge said the SEC\u2019s ruling on a bitcoin futures ETF by fund group Teucrium recognizes the futures prices are influenced by the spot prices.\n\n\u201cIn approving the futures ETPs, it seems to be that the commission has to have necessarily drawn the conclusion that this arrangement would prevent fraud and manipulation on the underlying spot market,\u201d Rao said.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment about the oral arguments.\n\n\u201cThe court asked thoughtful, pointed questions about the inextricable link between bitcoin spot markets and bitcoin futures markets \u2014 the exact points that are the bedrock of the case to convert GBTC to an ETF,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson told Blockworks in an email.\n\nQuestions signal a potential ruling?\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst James Seyffart told Blockworks Monday he expected the judges\u2019 questions Tuesday could signal how they might rule on the case.\n\n\u201cRao is definitely team Grayscale,\u201d he tweeted during the hearing. \u201cGrayscale needs to get Judge Srinivasan or Judge Edwards on their side as well and they can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cSrinivasan seems to be leaning Grayscale as well based on this line of questioning,\u201d Seyffart added. \u201cWOW. The SEC lawyer seems to keep saying the futures aren\u2019t and I quote \u201cmanipulated in the *same way*\u201d and I don\u2019t even understand what she\u2019s trying to say.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSeyffart told Blockworks that he believes it\u2019s possible for all three judges to side with Grayscale \u2014 a \u201csharp reversal\u201d of what he thought before the oral arguments began. He quantified Grayscale\u2019s chance to win as 70% likely, noting that a decision could come as early as the second quarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the ruling tells the SEC to go back to the drawing board, where the SEC can put us back on the spot Bitcoin ETF denial merry-go-round by issuing another denial with different language and/or reasoning,\u201d Seyffart said in an email. \u201cSo this could still be far from over.\u201d\n\nGBTC was up about 8% on the day, as of about 1:00 pm ET.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nAn ominous-sounding technical pattern has appeared on bitcoin's (BTC) weekly price chart for the first time on record. Analysts, however, are split on what it means for cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's 50-week simple moving average has crossed under its 200-week SMA, confirming a \"death cross,\" a bearish indicator suggesting the short-term price pullback could become a more sustained downtrend.\n\nEven though the moving average-based death cross represents what happened in the past, many consider it a forward-looking indicator.\n\n\"The death cross formed on the weekly time frame makes for a cautious view of the near-term outlook and keeps the potential for a return to the $18,000-$16,300,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.\n\nOne could argue that the death cross has come at the right time for bears, considering the crisis at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and surging interest rate expectations across the advanced world.\n\nBitcoin fell nearly 5% last week as Silvergate said it was evaluating its ability to survive as a going concern. The leading cryptocurrency ran into offers around the 50-week SMA for the second straight week.\n\n\"Technically, the 50-week moving average continues to act as a valid resistance from which the selling intensifies,\" Kuptsikevich said.\n\nSome observers, however, don't see the death cross as a reliable indicator, because it is based on backward-looking moving averages and lags prices and has proved to be a contrary indicator in stock markets.\n\n\"A death cross is a nonevent. A weekly death cross means the 50-week average dropped below the 200-week average. They are *lagging* indicators that definitionally occur after a rapid decline,\" Timothy Peterson, investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Investments, tweeted last month.\n\nAccording to Peterson, the death cross has been unreliable as a standalone indicator in traditional markets.\n\n\"For the S&P 500 going back nearly 100 years, there have been 9 such occurrences: 1938, 48, 58, 63 , 70, 74, 78, 2001, '08.,\" Peterson said. \"Within 50 days, the average gain was 22% and the average loss was -9%. Within 200 days, the average gain was 46% and the average loss was -11%. Those are great risk/return odds.\""

        "title": "Ordinals: A New Innovation Powering Bitcoin NFTs and Maybe More - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "Since its introduction in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s renowned 2008 white paper, Bitcoin (BTC) has challenged traditional monetary systems, introduced trustless networks, and inspired innovation in the digital ecosystem. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s diverse use cases, it is primarily viewed as either \u201cdigital gold\u201d for inflation mitigation or a currency alternative that lets participants transact in a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. It typically has not been viewed as the blockchain on which you can build.\n\nBut now, with the launch of the Ordinals protocol, developers are able to innovate on top of the Bitcoin blockchain by creating inscriptions on individual units of Bitcoin, which can function similarly to the NFTs (non-fungible tokens) found on blockchains like Ethereum (ETH). This opens a realm of possibilities. A new value proposition on the oldest and most secure blockchain provides new functionality for the network, and is likely to attract innovators.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the launch of the Ordinals protocol, how Ordinals work, how they differ from traditional NFTs, and statistics about Ordinals transactions.\n\nOrdinals\u2019 origins\n\nDevelopers have been working on enhancements to the Bitcoin network for nearly a decade, focusing on additional exchange features and financial instruments. Years before the term NFT became mainstream, cryptographer Meni Rosenfeld released a white paper in 2012, detailing the concept of Colored Coins \u2013 segregated Bitcoins that would be colored according to their unique purpose. In 2014, Layer 2 protocol Counterparty enabled the minting and trading of digital collectibles on Bitcoin. Similarly, the Stacks network was launched in 2017 to facilitate Bitcoin smart contract deployment for more efficient transactions. Regardless, many such protocols lost popularity and developers turned to the Ethereum network to work on Layer 2 tokens and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n\nBut that changed this year. On January 21, 2023, developer Casey Rodarmor launched Ordinals to provide added functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain and \u201cMAKE BITCOIN FUN AGAIN.\u201d Ordinals is a Layer 1 protocol that introduces transformative blockchain technology to inscribe content and new functionalities onto Bitcoin itself. The idea for Ordinals came about during the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in November 2021, which was also the catalyst for Taro, a Layer 2 protocol that facilitates asset issuance on Bitcoin, transferred over the Lightning Network. Since then, Ordinals have sparked discussions about network scalability and Layer 2 potential.\n\nHow do Bitcoin Ordinals work?\n\nInspired by the mathematical concept of ordinal numbers, Ordinals are chronologically inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of a Bitcoin. Ordinals begin at zero and are serially numbered depending on the order in which they are mined \u2013 similar to serial numbers on U.S. dollar bills. Ordinals can contain image, video, and text files; these files are included on the transaction \u201cwitness,\u201d which authorizes trades through signatures and other important identifying data.\n\nDue to the lack of supportive Web3 infrastructure on Bitcoin, the Ordinals protocol did not originally have its own wallet interface for transactions. As of March 2023, supported wallets now include Ordinals Wallet, XVerse, and Hiro Wallet. In order to mint using Ordinals, Bitcoin participants must download Bitcoin Core and sync it to the nodes of the blockchain. Then, they can create a profile using a supported wallet and send satoshis to it.\n\nHow do Ordinals differ from NFTs on Ethereum and other blockchains?\n\nMinting Ordinals is similar to minting NFTs, but there are key differences that make the former simpler and arguably more secure. Whereas NFT files are stored off-chain, accessed by a link on the blockchain, and can be altered by smart contract developers, the data for Ordinals inscriptions are stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. By keeping minting completely on-chain, Ordinals are permanent and immutable. Additionally, NFTs usually have royalties attached to them; Ordinals do not. These characteristics are why Rodarmor refers to inscriptions as \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d and not \u201cBitcoin NFTs.\u201d\n\nOrdinals transaction data\n\nWithin the last year, interest in the NFT markets has waned. As the below chart demonstrates, total weekly value received by NFT platforms on Ethereum grew at the beginning of 2022, peaking on April 25 at over $1.7 billion.\n\nValue further slumped at the end of 2022, likely due to the FTX collapse and onset of \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d While the Ethereum blockchain NFT marketplace remains robust, with value stabilizing in January and February of 2023, activity is well off its all-time highs.\n\nOn the contrary, Ordinals have experienced a recent increase in activity. According to Dune, Ordinals inscribed with image and text files have experienced the highest volume levels. On March 1, 2023 \u2013 the day with the highest minting volume \u2013 the files varied, with 15,981 text files, 8,817 image files, 23 applications, two audio files, one model, and one video. Although Dune identifies that fees spent to inscribe Ordinals have declined since mid-February, cumulative fees are approximately $1.5 million.\n\nSource: Ordinals.\n\nDune lists the total number of Ordinals inscriptions to date as more than 320,000. Some of the most notable Ordinals thus far include Ordinal Punks \u2013 a tribute to CryptoPunks \u2013 and Taproot Wizards. Given that Ordinals are a fairly new protocol, it is likely that most cryptocurrency ecosystem participants don\u2019t yet know how to create or trade them. Once Ordinals become more mainstream, inscriptions are likely to increase faster.\n\nOrdinals may also help reignite interest in NFTs and other related digital tokens. For example, Bitcoin experienced a recent increase in volume and reached its highest level since August of 2022. Although difficult to determine, it is likely that the launch of Ordinals was a contributing catalyst for this movement. The Stacks token (STX) also recently increased in price, over 160% \u2013 possibly sparked by Ordinals rejuvenating interest in Bitcoin smart contract development.\n\nThe future of Ordinals\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has already opened doors to a substantial, untapped market in the form of Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals present other interesting potential use cases as well. For example, miners interested in ESG initiatives could use Ordinals to inscribe ESG compliance on the satoshis they mine. Ordinals may also be useful for tracking stolen coins based on serial numbers instead of order flow.\n\nOf course, those potential use cases, and even the currently popular NFT use cases, raise concerns about Bitcoin fungibility. Any Bitcoin is meant to be interchangeable with any other Bitcoin \u2013 Ordinals ascribing enhanced or decreased value to individual units of Bitcoin could mean that prices no longer reflect that fungibility. For that reason, many Bitcoin enthusiasts have expressed discontent with the launch of Ordinals, stating that it conflicts with Satoshi\u2019s original vision for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. Others have also raised concerns about the increased strain Ordinals put on the Bitcoin network by allowing files to be embedded in satoshis. Nonetheless, for the time being, Ordinals appear to be spurring increased interest in the Bitcoin blockchain, and are a bright spot in the current bear market.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "title": "U.S. Senate panel probes how crypto mining increases energy consumption \u2022 Alaska Beacon - Alaska Beacon",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The so-called mining for digital assets, or cryptocurrency, consumes as much electricity as some entire nations, and U.S. senators explored the issue Tuesday in what they said was their first-ever hearing focused on the energy implications of digital currency.\n\nCrypto mining in both Nebraska and Pennsylvania was discussed in particular by the members of the panel of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nTouting his legislative proposal to improve transparency of crypto mining, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, likened it to being \u201cmore like digital coal than digital gold\u201d and implored the industry \u2014 Bitcoin being the most popular currency \u2014 to \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d by improving energy efficiency as the world faces the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining in the United States uses as much power as we need to light every single home in our country, and that demand on our grid is only going to grow,\u201d Markey said in opening remarks.\n\nMarkey\u2019s bill, introduced Monday, would require cryptocurrency asset operators to report emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency, and would mandate the agency to conduct a study of energy usage required by thousands of robust, special-use computers to add new transactions to the decentralized digital accounting ledger, he said. The text of the bill was not yet published.\n\nThe hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate and Nuclear Safety featured testimony from Rob Altenburg, of PennFuture, a Pennsylvania-based clean energy advocacy organization; Courtney Dentlinger, an executive with the Nebraska Public Power District, a publicly owned utility; and Anna R. Kelles, a member of the New York State Assembly.\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s top Republican, Sen. Pete Ricketts, of Nebraska, pushed back on environmental concerns.\n\nReminding fellow members that CNBC ranked his state No. 1 last year for cultivating a crypto economy, Ricketts said he\u2019s \u201cparticularly interested in this topic as to whether this industry could result in more economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrypto asset mining is hardly alone in being an industry reliant on large data server banks,\u201d Ricketts later continued. \u201cFinance, technology, government, academia and many others use significant amounts of electricity to power their computing needs. We should be providing the tools for open competition in a free market and not allowing politicians or bureaucrats in Washington D.C. to pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nCheap electricity in Nebraska\n\nBoth Nebraska and Pennsylvania are home to crypto mining operations.\n\nCheap electricity in Nebraska \u2014 100% powered by publicly owned utilities \u2014 makes the state an attractive option for the crypto data centers, where acres of extremely fast computers encased in what look like metal shipping containers attempt to guess long combinations of numbers to verify a new transaction, some at speeds of up to trillions of guesses per second.\n\nOne 11-acre crypto mining site in Kearney, Nebraska, consumes as much electricity as the city itself, which has a population of 33,790, according to a local news analysis published in January.\n\nHowever, the industry has had \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the state, Nebraska Public Power District\u2019s Dentlinger told lawmakers, giving the example that just one of Nebraska\u2019s crypto mining facilities generated $1.8 million in state sales taxes and $3.8 million in local taxes over a 12-month period.\n\nDentlinger also argued that consistent electricity demand from a customer benefits the wider customer base.\n\n\u201cIn our predominantly non-metro and rural service area, diversification of businesses and economic growth is critical as these areas continue to see population declines,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIn fact, local leaders have been very receptive to crypto mining facilities as they\u2019ve seen the potential for significant economic development benefits for their communities.\u201d\n\nCrypto operations pop up in Pennsylvania\n\nPennFuture\u2019s Altenburg argued there\u2019s a different story in Pennsylvania, one where regulators can\u2019t keep tabs on crypto operations popping up across the state.\n\nLast year, a site inspection by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection found that a company in Clearfield County had plugged into a natural gas well site without seeking a permit. The company, Big Dog Energy, was running 30 natural gas generators to power its crypto operation. The EPA took the lead on investigating.\n\nAltenburg told lawmakers it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to know which or how many of Pennsylvania\u2019s thousands of fracked gas wells are being used in this way.\u201d\n\nAnother company, Stronghold Digital Mining, burns waste coal to power crypto operations. The company \u2014 which argues it is an \u201cenvironmentally beneficial\u201d Bitcoin miner for finding a use for an environmental hazard \u2014 sources from the ubiquitous piles of waste coal around the state and converts it into for electricity at two sites, one in Venango County between Pittsburgh and Erie, and the other in Carbon County northwest of Allentown, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWaste coal is a problematic fuel to say the least. As the name implies, it has low energy value compared to ordinary coal, so plants need to burn even more to generate the same amount of electricity. In the process, they emit more ozone precursors, fine particulates, acid gases, heavy metals, and it\u2019s the second-most carbon intensive generation, next to residual fuel oil,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nWhy crypto mining requires energy\n\nCryptocurrency mining involves the use of robust computing power to add to digital ledger technology, such as \u201cblockchain.\u201d\n\nThe decentralized digital financial record of transactions is a ledger or database where users, or \u201cminers,\u201d on a common network can agree on entries, sometimes called \u201cblocks,\u201d through a \u201cconsent mechanism.\u201d\n\nEnergy usage varies depending on which consent mechanism is used. For example, Bitcoin is based on a \u201cproof of work\u201d mechanism, which in part ensures security of the ledger by requiring miners to have access to special computers and considerable amounts of energy.\n\nAnother popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, recently switched to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d mechanism, which consumes a fraction of the energy \u2014 as of 2021 it accounted for 0.001% of global energy usage \u2014 because it relies on miners to risk a stake of their crypto assets as a way to enforce the integrity of the accounting ledger.\n\nU.S. power usage for crypto\n\nA September 2022 report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy warned that cryptocurrency mining uses a significant amount of energy that has only increased over the past five years.\n\nCrypto assets worldwide use 120 to 140 billion kilowatt-hours per year \u2014 or roughly exceeding the total energy usage of countries like Argentina or Australia, the report found.\n\nThe U.S. accounts for one-third of the world\u2019s crypto asset operations, consuming about 0.9% to 1.7% of the nation\u2019s electricity usage, which is about equal to the energy used to power all home computers or all residential lighting in the U.S., according to the OSTP.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered the interagency report in a March 2022 wide-ranging executive order on \u201cEnsuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,\u201d which included exploring energy implications and possible impediments to reaching the administration\u2019s climate goals.\n\nThose goals include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon-free electricity grid by 2035 and reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n\nMarkey\u2019s bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nSens. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, have signed on as co-sponsors.\n\nMarkey compared reducing the energy usage of cryptocurrency mining to updating energy standards for appliances or fuel economy for vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to end refrigeration or automotive technology. What we\u2019re saying is that we should be more efficient, we should be more aware of the emissions into our atmosphere that are avoidable,\u201d Markey said. \u201cSo on the one hand, this (cryptocurrency) is a very innovative sector, economically, and they count themselves as innovators. But all we\u2019re asking for them to do is look across the board at innovation.\u201d"

        "content": "Seasoned trader Tone Vays believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could be gearing up for a massive eruption to the six-figure level and go as high as $300,000.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Vays tells his 123,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin could explode between 792% and 1,238% from current prices in the next bull market.\n\n\u201cSo this is my projection. There\u2019s two paths. We can hit this line [diagonal resistance] twice like we did in the last cycle [2021]. [Or], we can hit this line once near the end like we did in the prior cycle [2017]. If we hit it near the end, we\u2019re going to go higher [$300,000]. If we hit it twice, we\u2019re going to go lower [$200,000].\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d rather [we] hit it twice. I\u2019m tired of Bitcoin being this cheap.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, it appears that he thinks Bitcoin could rally toward his initial target of $200,000 some time in 2025. Should BTC go higher and rally to $300,000, Vays believes that can happen in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nIn the short term, however, Vays thinks that the Bitcoin pullback is not yet over.\n\n\u201cThe [previous] week closed poorly, which at the moment sets us up for a pullback all the way down to the long-term moving average and $20,000.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $22,490.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What Do New NFTs Mean for Bitcoin's Future Valuation? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "New non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from Bitcoin known as Ordinals continue to generate a tremendous amount of buzz, hype, and speculation. But what impact will they actually have on the valuation of Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%)?\n\nFrom one perspective, Ordinals could be the key to unlocking new value on the Bitcoin blockchain. From another perspective, though, Ordinals could be a major distraction from the core purpose of Bitcoin, which is to become a new form of digital money. In a worst-case scenario, Ordinals might make Bitcoin less attractive for institutional investors and invite unwelcome regulatory oversight.\n\nThe Ordinals phenomenon\n\nWhile Ordinals are not NFTs in the traditional sense, they enable creators to \"inscribe\" content directly into individual blocks of the Bitcoin blockchain. The maximum size for an Ordinal is just 4 MB, but that is still enough space in order to squeeze a tiny game, photo, or image into a Bitcoin block. Previously, these Bitcoin blocks only held financial transaction data, but now some of them will include Ordinal data as well.\n\nTo date, more than 260,000 of these Ordinals have been created, and they have transformed from an interesting conversation piece into a real phenomenon. A single Ordinal (Ordinal Punk 94), for example, recently sold for $214,000. By way of comparison, that's more than the current price of a CryptoPunk NFT on the Ethereum (ETH -1.28%) blockchain.\n\nIn short, there's potentially real money to be made here, and that is going to incentivize even more entrepreneurs and innovators to develop the market for Bitcoin NFTs. By some estimates, the total value of the NFT market is now worth close to $20 billion annually, with Ethereum currently dominating the lion's share of that figure.\n\nEven if Bitcoin only gains a 10% market share of the overall NFT market, that could get investors excited about the future growth prospects of Bitcoin. After all, some forecasts now call for the NFT market to explode in value, to nearly $200 billion, by the year 2030.\n\nBitcoin meets the Bored Apes\n\nMy concern, however, is that the market for Ordinals is already becoming a bit too frothy and speculative just two months after being created. Case in point: Yuga Labs -- the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks NFT collections -- is now going to issue a new 300-piece NFT collection for Bitcoin called TwelveFold. While Yuga Labs says there will be no added utility for these NFTs (such as VIP access to Bored Ape Yacht Club events), it's almost certain there will be heightened demand for these NFTs simply due to their novelty and the potential to flip them for a huge profit.\n\nAdding Bored Apes into the Bitcoin discussion complicates matters considerably from a regulatory perspective. Until now, Bitcoin has avoided the scrutiny of regulators, who generally acknowledge that Bitcoin is the only crypto that should not be regulated as a security. Bitcoin is a digital currency, full stop. But if Bitcoin now offers NFTs, that argument becomes a lot harder to make.\n\nKeep in mind that there is already an SEC investigation into the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection from Yuga Labs. The SEC claims the Bored Apes might actually represent an unregistered securities offering.\n\nSo what happens when Yuga Labs issues the new TwelveFold collection for Bitcoin? It would be a shame if Yuga Labs somehow gets Bitcoin mixed up with regulators.\n\nMoreover, there is a very real risk that adding NFTs to Bitcoin might dissuade risk-averse institutional investors. How are large pension funds and endowments going to react when they find out there are tiny photos or videos potentially inscribed into their Bitcoin holdings?\n\nFor me, it would be like opening up my leather wallet and finding out that someone had drawn tiny cartoon figures next to the serial numbers on my U.S. fiat money. Yes, it's still money, and yes, it still works, but wouldn't you feel a bit silly carrying it around with you all day?\n\nWill Ordinals change the way investors value Bitcoin?\n\nThe current size of the NFT market pales in comparison to other markets where Bitcoin is making its presence felt. Even if you take the rosy view of things and say the NFT market is worth $20 billion, that's still just one-sixth the size of the global remittances market, where Bitcoin is playing an increasingly important role.\n\nThe value of other markets where Bitcoin is gaining market share are measured in the trillions of dollars, not billions. For example, Bitcoin is viewed by some investors as a form of \"digital gold.\" And the value of the world's physical gold supply is approximately $12 trillion.\n\nLong story short: NFTs probably won't move the needle when it comes to valuation. While there has been plenty of commentary saying Bitcoin NFTs could make Bitcoin even more valuable than it already is, my basic take is this: If you're buying Bitcoin because of the NFTs, you're doing it all wrong. Bitcoin is a fantastic long-term buy, not because of NFTs, but because of its role in key financial markets where it is becoming increasingly mainstream on a global basis."

        "content": "Print this page\n\n\u201cConfidence must be earned\u201d is the current ad slogan of Amundi, Europe\u2019s biggest asset manager. Keep it in mind while reading its latest thematic paper on what might follow crypto winter.\n\nParis-based Amundi can appear a bit bipolar about crypto. Last February it was reportedly investigating how to sell NFTs to clients while warning them about the \u201cpotentially destabilising systemic risk\u201d of stablecoins. Former chief investment officer Pascal Blanqu\u00e9 called bitcoin a \u201cfarce\u201d; his successor Vincent Mortier is more amenable:\n\n\u201cIf inflation remains above central banks\u2019 targets, bitcoin\u2019s limited supply may start to attract more attention,\u201d write Mortier and strategist Tristan Perrier:\n\nWhile bitcoin spectacularly failed to protect investors against galloping inflation in 2021-22, this was a period of dramatic rises in policy and market interest rates that pressured all asset classes. If inflation is high, but not rising, nominal interest rates will also likely stop climbing and may even fall a little. This is a much more favourable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status.\n\nAnd sure, maybe? The evidence we have suggests that as an inflation hedge bitcoin is useless (Smales, 2021), mostly useless (Conlon et al, 2021), randomly worse than useless (Matkovskyy and Jalan, 2020), or consistently worse than useless (Pinchuk, 2021). The inflation discussion also invites broader questions around whether finite supply is a precondition of all forms of existence (Aristotle, 350BC), and whether \u201cfuture potential\u201d can matter when applied to something that has unquantifiable exogenous risks but no intrinsic value (Amundi, 2021). But then, a firm doesn\u2019t collect more than almost \u20ac2tn in assets by seeding FUD.\n\nAmundi\u2019s \u201cfive reasons why recent setbacks may not mean the end of cryptocurrencies\u201d will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s been to Davos or Reddit. There\u2019s the shakeout, where a dotcom-style crash leaves behind a leaner group of eventual winners. There\u2019s proof-of-stake mining as a route out of the energy boondoggle. There\u2019s regulation, which \u201cis more likely than not to be a positive in the end\u201d. And there are signs that the financial mainstream hasn\u2019t abandoned all hope in crypto, Amundi says, somewhat self-referentially.\n\nWhat\u2019s important, Mortier and Perrier suggest, is to separate practice from theory. The experienced reality of crypto (fraud, hubris, incompetence, or some yet-to-be-determined combination of all three) might look unappealing but it\u2019s mostly just TradFi doing TradFi things, so the theory (code-is-law decentralisation) has emerged \u201cmostly unscathed\u201d.\n\nAnd sure? Mayyyyy-be?\n\nA person might argue that the dotcom bust wasn\u2019t defined primarily by bankruptcies and fraud \u2014 or had more promoter fraud and less alleged theft \u2014 which allowed for a period of industry consolidation and retrenchment. That\u2019s unlikely to happen to crypto. They might argue that in its current form, proof-of-stake mining invites concentration of control so is in direct opposition to Amundi\u2019s core argument. They might see recent crypto press releases from mainstream companies less as a sign of a healthy ecosystem than as the light only just reaching us from a long-dead star.\n\nAs for the positive tailwind of legitimacy through regulation, programmer Stephen Diehl posed the key question on these pixels earlier this month: without a point, what\u2019s the point?\n\nAmundi says that for investors to remain interested in crypto, someone\u2019s going to have to find something productive to do with a blockchain. Financial asset tokenisation is interesting in theory, but applying the concept comes with big hurdles around legality, delivery and adoption.\n\nThese are fair points but again are perhaps not up with recent developments, such as China\u2019s use of blockchain for some ABS contracts. While the experiment might be lowering costs by a few basis points, research so far hasn\u2019t been entirely convincing.\n\nMortier and Perrier conclude:\n\nBlockchains, cryptocurrencies and tokenisation do have a lot of potential, be it in powering new types of decentralised organisations that can offer serious economic and social advantages, or in enabling new ways of trading and managing assets. The most likely outcome is that they will simply need more time to mature before becoming mainstream, as was the case for other technologies in the past. However, they could still turn out to be a dead-end (which could allow time for another cryptocurrencies bull market to last a few years but not much more). At this stage, nothing is proven either way and the jury is still very much out.\n\nIsn\u2019t it normal to give evidence to a jury before expecting its verdict?"

The issue has spread across the industry as Paxos, the issuer of the third-largest stablecoin, was ordered by the New York Department of Financial Services on Feb. 13 to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nDerivatives metrics show buyers' shrinking appetite\n\nTraders should refer to the USD Coin (USDC) premium to measure the demand for cryptocurrency in Asia. The index measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer stablecoin trades and the U.S. dollar.\n\nExcessive cryptocurrency buying demand can pressure the indicator above fair value at 104%. On the other hand, the stablecoin\u2019s market offer is flooded during bearish markets, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nThe USDC premium indicator in Asian markets has been slightly positive for the past three weeks, but it is nowhere near the substantial 4% premium from early January. In addition, the metric shows weakening demand for stablecoins in Asia, down from 2.5% in the previous week.\n\nStill, the present 1.5% premium should be interpreted as positive considering the bearish newsflow regarding crypto-fiat payment railways.\n\nBitcoin's quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer.\n\nConsequently, futures contracts should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium in healthy markets. This situation is known as \u201ccontango\u201d and is not exclusive to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart shows that traders abandoned any prospects of exiting the neutral-to-bearish area on March 3 as the basis indicator moved away from the 5% threshold. However, the current 3% premium is lower than last week\u2019s 4.5%, reflecting fewer investors\u2019 optimism.\n\nOn the bright side, the 6.2% drop in BTC price had a near uneventful impact on Bitcoin futures markets. Higher demand for bearish bets using leverage would have moved the basis indicator to the negative area, known as \u201cbackwardation.\u201d\n\nAdditional volatility is expected on March 14\n\nIn the week following Feb. 27, Bitcoin\u2019s price lost 4.5%, indicating that investors are effectively worried about contagion from Silvergate Bank. Even though crypto exchanges and stablecoin providers have denied exposure to the troubled fintech firm, the cut-off from its payment processing system has raised uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts are now focused on the announcement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data on March 14. As Cointelegraph noted, CPI prints tend to spark short-term volatility across risk assets, although often short-lived in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nDerivatives metrics currently point to limited pressure from the Silvergate Bank saga, but the odds favor Bitcoin bears, considering the diminishing demand for stablecoins in Asia and the BTC futures premium.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The two-day developer conference was technical and thoughtful \u2014 a space to get one\u2019s hands dirty writing code.\n\nFedi's Leon Johnson organized and kicked off the conference. Source: Michaelayophotography79\n\nLeon Johnson, a conference organizer and the head of operations at Bitcoin company Fedi, told Cointelegraph that the conference is entering its fourth year and the profile of attendees has slowly evolved:\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we had a lot of what I would call hobbyists, enthusiasts, tinkerers. And those same people have now kind of progressed to work for Bitcoin companies.\u201d\n\nTrue to its name, the conference has advanced Bitcoin hobbyists to Bitcoin companies. Gaming company Zebedee, for example, spun up from interactions at Advancing Bitcoin, Johnson explained.\n\nAlex Leishman, CEO of River \u2014 a U.S.-based Bitcoin accumulation and Lightning Network company \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the event is a high-quality arena for builders:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be in workshops and presentations that really dig into the weeds and the inner workings of the innovations happening in the space \u2014 whether it\u2019s ordinals, Lightning Network, protocol upgrades \u2014 and what those then mean for user experience and for improving the actual products we\u2019re all trying to build.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, developers and computer scientists pitter-pattered on their keyboards throughout the conference. Attendees as young as 10 constructed hardware wallets from scratch, spun up code, and interrogated the blockchain and Bitcoin mempool. An entire day was dedicated solely to workshops.\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall was conference comp\u00e8re. Source: Michaelayophotography79\n\nEchoing comments made by other developers and computer scientists, Johnson highlighted that progress is good, but the layer-2 Lightning Network is still in its infancy, and Bitcoin is just a teenager at almost 15 years of existence. So, what does Bitcoin need to mature?\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs people. We need more than speculators. We need people that care about applications.\u201d\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of Fedi and maintainer of the Fedimint protocol, joined in: \u201cDon\u2019t gamble \u2014 it\u2019s a bear market, and bear markets are for building.\u201d It\u2019s time to \u201cget out there and inspire people,\u201d he suggested.\n\nRelated: UK is \u2018likely\u2019 to need digital currency, says BoE and Treasury: Report\n\nUncle Rockstar (not his real name), the brains behind some of Bitcoin company Strike\u2019s inner workings concluded the first day of talks. Rather than delve deeper into technical specifications, as other talks did, Rockstar chose to chide, reassure and motivate developers, particularly those working on free, open-source software.\n\nUncle Rockstar (who chooses to hide his features) gives a talk. Source: Alex Waltz\n\nBear markets can burn out the best of us, he explained during his talk. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to take a break and pick up a fiat job before returning to building.\u201d Leishman agreed:\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin is going to become the money of the world and is going to completely change everything. We can speed that up if we\u2019re smart about how we approach it.\u201d\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price continuing to wallow in the low $20,000s, the bear market continues to grind on. Advancing Bitcoin recently announced its intention to travel to M\u00e1laga, Spain with the concept in autumn. The Spain edition will focus on businesses and institutions and have less of a developer focus."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlock, Inc. thinks it and developers can build better Bitcoin mining rigs. That's why it's considering building a \u201cMining Development Kit,\u201d or MDK, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe company hopes its do-it-yourself kit will spur innovation in Bitcoin mining hardware, it said in an announcement, alluding to a statement from CEO Jack Dorsey on Twitter in 2021 that the company was \u201cconsidering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source.\u201d\n\nBlock wrote it would share more details in the coming weeks and months but mused that the MDK would include basic Bitcoin mining rig components, like a hashboard and controller board, open source firmware, software, and lots of documentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the MDK being useful for development projects focused on integrating Bitcoin mining into various novel use cases\u2014such as heating solutions, off-grid mining, home mining or intermittent power applications\u2014as well as optimization of Bitcoin mining hardware for traditional commercial mining operations,\u201d Naoise Irwin, Block mining hardware senior product lead, wrote in a blog post.\n\nBlock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nIrwin, who\u2019s also the co-founder of solar heating company SolarFlux, joined Block last month after starting his career on Wall Street in 2000 and transitioning to tech and strategy a decade later.\n\nAround this time last year, Block, Inc. announced it had contributed $5 million to a partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and infrastructure company Blockstream to pilot an all-solar Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.\n\nSince then, Block has also started designing its own Bitcoin mining semiconductor chips\u2014commonly referred to as ASICs, which stands for application specific integrated circuits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not totally out of place, although hardware accounted for less than 1% of a Block\u2019s $17 billion total net revenue in 2022. The bulk of it was generated from transactions, services, and Bitcoin. Block generates Bitcoin revenue when it buys and then sells BTC to its customers, like through its Cash App.\n\nThe rest came from hardware, which accounted for $164 million of that total, according to SEC filings.\n\nBut the company said it\u2019s set to make a big push into the \u201cBitcoin ecosystem\u201d with Spiral, an independent team contributing to open source projects; TBD, an open decentralized finance developer platform; and hardware projects, like its mining rigs and a self-custody wallet.\n\n\u201cWe believe our bitcoin ecosystem can help address inefficiencies in the current financial system, especially with respect to identity and trust,\u201d the company wrote in its annual report.\n\nStill, it had to disclose it\u2019s taken the same kind of battering on its Bitcoin holdings as other publicly traded companies. By the end of 2022, Block has invested a cumulative $220 million in Bitcoin. After factoring in a $118 million impairment loss, the fair market value of Block\u2019s BTC was $133 million.\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s share price experienced a 21% boost since the start of the year, investors don\u2019t yet seem swayed by Block\u2019s Bitcoin aspirations. The company\u2019s shares ended trading on Tuesday at $78.04, down 3% for the day."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJudges overseeing Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) questioned the financial watchdog Tuesday, digging into the agency\u2019s basis for denying Grayscale\u2019s application to establish a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe questions came during oral arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, overseen by Judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao, and Harry Edwards. Grayscale initiated legal action against the SEC in June of last year, after an application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot market Bitcoin ETF was rejected.\n\nA core element of the SEC\u2019s argument, delivered by SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise, is that Grayscale\u2019s application lacked data necessary to confidentially determine \u201cwhether fraud and manipulation in the spot market impacts futures [markets] in the same way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Judge Neomi Rao said it seems the futures price of Bitcoin is a derivative of the asset\u2019s spot price which move together 99.9% of the time. She said the SEC has not provided evidence that Grayscale\u2019s claims are wrong.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s quite a bit of information on how these markets work together,\" Rao said, adding that the SEC \"really needs to explain... how it understands the relationship between Bitcoin futures and the spot price of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOn behalf of Grayscale, former U.S. Solicitor General Don Verrilli argued that the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into a spot market Bitcoin ETF contradicted previous decisions \u201cgiving the green light\u201d for futures-based ETFs to trade in the U.S.\n\nHe described the SEC\u2019s denial as \u201cthe definition of arbitrary decision-making,\u201d arguing that Grayscale\u2019s spot market ETF would pose the \u201csame risk of fraud and manipulation\u201d that currently approved Bitcoin products that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nGrayscale first submitted an application to convert GBTC into an ETF in 2016. According to the company\u2019s website, it holds more than $14 billion worth of assets in the product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, shares of GBTC trade at significantly less than the underlying value of the Bitcoin held by Grayscale in its trust partly due to the product\u2019s structure, which prevents shares from being redeemed for Bitcoin. If it were converted into a spot market ETF, shares of BTC would likely track the price of Bitcoin more closely as arbitragers trade the difference away.\n\nAs of Tuesday, shares of GBTC traded at a 42% discount relative to the assets under management by Grayscale in the trust, a gap that\u2019s reached nearly 49% at its widest, according to Ycharts. However, shares climbed upwards of 7.6% to $12.68 amid Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments.\n\nAs of now, no spot-based Bitcoin ETF has been approved in the U.S. by the SEC, which has rejected numerous applications since the Winklevoss twins filed for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. But Bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts have traded in the U.S. since ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2021.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly cited its mandate to protect investors in the U.S. while rejecting spot-based Bitcoin ETF applications. When Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC into a spot market Bitcoin ETF was rejected last year, the financial watchdog said that Grayscale's application did not do enough to provide protection from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\""

        "content": "This post originally appeared on ZeMing M. Gao\u2019s website, and we republished with permission from the author. Read the full piece here.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler recently commented that, except for Bitcoin, all \u2018crypto\u2019 are securities.\n\nWe mostly agree but would further argue that even BTC is a security, according to the Howey test, due to its base-protocol being controlled and frequently changed by a centralized entity (Core developers and proponents behind the scene), which in at least one major forking event resulted in a re-issuance of all existing bitcoin. The genuine Bitcoin (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, BSV) alone satisfies that exception, thanks to its locked protocol that prevents control, re-issuance, and manipulation by any entity or group, hidden or apparent.\n\nIn addition, BTC does not have qualifications for a commodity exemption, while BSV does.\n\nWe are, in fact, encouraged by the SEC Chairman\u2019s straight and courageous interpretation of the law. Given the pressure that comes from a misinformed public and motivated stakeholders, it is not easy for public officials and legislators to hold a correct understanding of the pertinent law and technology.\n\nThe risk is that lacking such an understanding, they could be impeded by self-doubt, fearing being viewed as backward obstructionists. But we would like to tell Chairman Gensler\u2019s SEC that they are doing the right thing by enforcing the law, and what they are doing is helping to advance the technology, contrary to what some in the media are saying. This is because the crypto market has become cancerous and is the biggest obstacle to the true development of blockchain technology, and enforcing the securities law against illegal securities offerings and even Ponzi schemes makes a bit more room for the real technological and business innovations.\n\nThe Howey Test\n\nThe present legal standard in the U.S. for determining whether something is a security is summarized in the Howey Test according to a U.S. Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).\n\nThe Howey test has been quoted or formulated in various ways. For accuracy, the following is the exact quote from the original Supreme Court opinion:\n\n\u201c\u2026an investment contract, for purposes of the Securities Act, means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party\u2026\u201d\n\nThe above statement became the Howey Test, according to which if an instrument meets all the following criteria, it is a security:\n\npeople invest money in a common enterprise and are led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party\n\nIt should be noted that (1) the term \u2018investment contract\u2019 has been broadly interpreted to not only include an explicit contract, but any transaction or scheme that fits the description; and (2) the subsequent case law has downplayed the word \u2018solely\u2019 in the above fourth prong but instead used a reality test of substantial reliance.\n\nAt the same time, it should also be noted that most opinions, commentaries, and analyses of the Howey test neglect the following two important sub-elements in the Howey decision:\n\n(1) The actor and the act that \u2018led\u201d the investor to expect profits. That is, there has been an inaccurate overemphasis on the subjective state of the investor\u2019s mind, neglecting the promoter\u2019s objective acts to promote a suspect investment scheme.\n\n(2) The need for a nexus among the factors (actors and acts) found in the Howey test. The requirement of such a nexus is completely illogical, albeit implicit. The courts never put it that way explicitly in the past only because they never needed to. But the situation with Bitcoin and crypto has made it necessary to consider such a dimension in order to discern the differences.\n\nApplying the Howey test to crypto\n\nMost digital currencies offered to the public meet all of the elements of the Howey test easily because they all have a common enterprise operating to promote the value of a coin or token, which are purchased by investors who invested money and were led to expect profits through the effort of others (who most likely are the identified common enterprise, but can be another related party as an active participant).\n\nHowever, as will be demonstrated further below in this article, the four elements in the Howey test are not considered in isolation from each other. There must be a connection between them. That is, a nexus is required among the four elements. Especially to be classified as a security, the \u2018investment,\u2019 the actor or acts that \u2018led\u2019 the investors to expect profits, the \u2018efforts,\u2019 and the \u2018third party\u2019 identified in the Howey test should not be completely unrelated to any interest in the identified \u2018common enterprise.\u2019\n\nWe demonstrate that, under the Howey test and according to the principles of securities law, the only exception among the digital assets is one that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n(1) did not do pre-mining;\n\n(2) had no new issuance, re-issuance, secondary offering, and/or airdropping in its lifetime (through whatever hidden or clandestine means);\n\n(3) is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (PoW); and\n\n(4) has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nPre-mining by an issuer or a related party is relevant to the Howey test because it indicates not only the existence of a common enterprise, but also that there is a nexus between the common enterprise and the investment made by the coin purchasers. An issuer who does a pre-mining shows control and influence over the coin or token, and by the time when the coin or token was distributed to purchasers (investors), the investment by the purchasers clearly had a direct relationship with an asset (the pre-mined coin) of the common enterprise.\n\nNew issuance, re-issuance, a secondary offering, and/or airdropping may establish the issuer as a relevant common enterprise, even if this wasn\u2019t the case before the new issuance or re-issuance. This matter will be discussed further below in detail in the context of Bitcoin history.\n\nIf the underlying blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or any other consensuses that use different names but are, in essence, still Proof-of-Stake, the coin is a security. This is because PoS places an owner of the coin in a position akin to that of a traditional shareholder of a corporation. This will also be discussed below in detail.\n\nThe SEC has in the past indicated that it does not see Bitcoin as a security, as Bitcoin has been sufficiently \u201cdecentralized.\u201d\n\nHowever, we argue that even BTC is a security and that the SEC has misapplied its own standard due to its misunderstanding of BTC.\n\nBTC, a severely distorted version of Bitcoin, does not meet the nonsecurity standard. The following are some of the reasons:\n\n(1) It does not have true decentralization. It is centrally controlled by a small group of Core developers, who in turn are subject to the control or influence of certain interest groups hidden behind the scenes. The centralized nature of BTC is strongly evidenced by the fact that it does not have a locked base protocol, and further by the fact that it has indeed frequently changed the base protocol by exercising the power of that centralization.\n\n(2) Even though bitcoin was not a security to start with, BTC subsequently became one by covertly re-issuing the coin as a new coin, namely BTC, when the BTC blockchain forked from the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n(3) Further, it has been deliberately transformed from the original bitcoin\u2019s design of utility (a Peer-to-Peer cash system) to a purely speculative investment.\n\nThe original Bitcoin (BSV) is the only exception\n\nThe original Bitcoin, however, is an exception. Bitcoin is not a security, according to the Howey test.\n\nBut the reason why the original Bitcoin is not a security, according to the Howey test, is not because of what most people vaguely claim, that Bitcoin is sufficiently decentralized. That claim is very vague and quite useless, because the concept of \u2018decentralization\u2019 is far more complicated than most people even realize (See Decentralization \u2013 a widely misunderstood concept). Further, decentralization can be easily faked to mislead people who don\u2019t fully understand the inner workings of the system.\n\nWith the above notion, we give a very simple and basic reason why the original Bitcoin is not a security according to the Howey test, and develop the thesis from there:\n\nIt is not a security because it does not have a \u2018common enterprise\u2019 as defined in the Howey test and the securities laws.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s own use of \u2018sufficient decentralization\u2019 as a reason to exonerate BTC is actually also based on similar reasoning, specifically, there is no common enterprise whose effort is expected by the investors to promote the investment. But it is not fully and precisely reasoned due to its lack of sufficient understanding of how Bitcoin and BTC actually work from a deep inside viewpoint. As a result of the SEC\u2019s insufficient reasoning, it may reach erroneous conclusions when it is applied to actual coins such as BTC and BSV.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with arguments that Bitcoin is a security from the law enforcement viewpoint, but then provide rebuttals to prove that BSV, not BTC, qualifies as an exception.\n\nThe prima facie argument why Bitcoin is a security:\n\nEven with the original Bitcoin, a \u2018common enterprise\u2019 does exist, and therefore is a security. There are three candidates that could qualify as the requisite \u2018common enterprise\u2019:\n\nThe coin issuer The developers who work together as a common law partnership, whether incorporated as one or not The miners who collaborate to maintain the blockchain as a common-law partnership, whether incorporated as one or not.\n\nAny one of the above three, qualifies as a common enterprise, would be sufficient.\n\nThe rebuttal, why the original Bitcoin is not a security:\n\n(1) The issuer is not such a common enterprise. Although the original issuer (Satoshi Nakamoto) could be classified as an \u2018enterprise,\u2019 it is not the kind of \u2018common enterprise\u2019 in the context of the Howey test, which requires more than a mere existence of an enterprise, but also that the enterprise is a common enterprise connected, or having a nexus, with the other elements in Howey test, especially \u2018the investment\u2019 and \u2018the efforts of others.\u2019 See the later section of this article for more discussions on the connectedness or nexus.\n\nMore specifically, as far as his role as the \u2018issuer\u2019 is concerned, the original issuer Satoshi Nakamoto himself was not and never became a common enterprise that received an investment in the meaning of the Howey test.\n\nFirstly, Satoshi issued 21 million bitcoin tokens all at once, not to himself, nor to a treasury of his or his company, but to an automated unilateral contract to which he was bound. He did not do any pre-mining. At the initial issuance, he, as the issuer, did not sell any bitcoin to anyone. Further, when the tokens were issued, they had no value. When the tokens subsequently gained value, no proceeds of the token transactions went to Satoshi by virtue of his being the issuer (and Satoshi\u2019s subsequently becoming a miner earning bitcoin is an entirely separate matter).\n\nTherefore, unless Satoshi subsequently makes substantive changes to the automated unilateral contract, he cannot be a common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test because there is no nexus between him and the investment (coin purchases).\n\nSatoshi as the issuer essentially cut himself out of the loop where the securities law applies.\n\nThe fact that after the issuance of bitcoin, Satoshi himself became a miner on the same basis as any other miner in the world according to the automated unilateral contract does not change the above conclusion because even though it is the same person, a miner plays a different role. And whether the miners are a requisite common enterprise will be a different issue discussed below.\n\n(2) The miners of bitcoin are not the common enterprise either. This is not only because miners are decentralized due to the Proof-of-Work consensus (as the SEC also correctly recognized), but more importantly because bitcoin miners are highly specialized by acting according to the terms of the automated unilateral contract. They do not participate in any governance, such as policies/protocol making. They have their own corporate structures, each with its own company shares as securities, but that has nothing to do with whether bitcoin is a security or not. The purchasers of bitcoin do not make an investment in the miners. The miners do not receive any proceeds from the coin purchases. They are just paid with bitcoin for their specialized service.\n\n(3) Neither are developers are not a common enterprise. But this is not because they are merely individuals and not Incorporated (a misunderstood issue by most people, very likely by the SEC as well), but because they have no power to change the base protocol which relates to the terms of the issuer\u2019s unilateral contract, as the base protocol is supposed to be locked and set-in-stone. Developers only work on improving the software to better execute the base protocol and the unilateral contract, which are fixed both in the technical sense and the legal sense. Unable to change the base protocol and the issuer\u2019s unilateral contract, the developers have no power to carry out any kind of new issuance or re-issuance of the original bitcoin. They may have a fiduciary duty to the bitcoin issuer and the bitcoin owners, but they are not a common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test that is connected to the investment from the bitcoin purchasers.\n\nTherefore, the original Bitcoin is not a security because there is no requisite common enterprise in the meaning of the Howey test and the securities laws.\n\nBut it should be clear at this point that only the original Bitcoin, BSV, not BTC, satisfies the conditions laid out in the above rebuttal for an exception to the Howey test. Only BSV has kept the original Bitcoin protocol, locked it and set it in stone, and has never made any changes to cause a new issuance or re-issuance of the coin, intentionally or not.\n\nBTC does not.\n\nBTC does not qualify for an exception\n\nTo put it succinctly, history shows that BTC\u2019s core developers, colluding with miners and \u201ccrypto\u201d exchanges, effectively changed the nature of Bitcoin, and reissued the coins as a new and different coin.\n\nThe above conclusion may seem odd to people who do not have a solid grasp of how bitcoin works and what happened in the past. Most people\u2019s attention is superficially on the name \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 and the ticker \u2018BTC.\u2019 They automatically assume that because BTC continued with the original name and ticker, it must be the original coin.\n\nBut the correct identity of which coin is the original Bitcoin is of legal, technical, economic, and financial significance, and must be investigated and determined as such, and cannot be based on a passive recognition by the misled public.\n\nThe fact becomes clear once one gets to the root of the issue to understand the actual definition, identity, and history of Bitcoin.\n\nHere is the simple and straight fact:\n\nEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally issued and fixed by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case, they were fed deceptive information.\n\nOnce such a new coin is issued, we have a new issuer. But unlike Satoshi, the original issuer who had completely and cleanly cut himself off the securities loop (see above), the new issuer is actively in the game and stays so.\n\nMore specifically, the new issuer is now clearly the requisite \u2018common enterprise\u2019 according to the Howey test and the securities law. Accordingly, the underlying coin (BTC in this case) became a security, even if it was not initially.\n\nThe above is exactly what happened in Bitcoin history. Among the multiple forks of Bitcoin, BSV is the only one that kept the original protocol unchanged. This can be proven beyond any doubt, not only in what it stands for in principle but also in exactly what it actually is and does.\n\nThe unchanged base protocol is critical in this analysis, not only because it is the only way to maintain genuine decentralization but also because it is the only way to maintain the nonsecurity nature of the original coin and not to corrupt into a new coin that effectively becomes a security.\n\nBTC did exactly the opposite.\n\nWithout a locked base protocol, the BTC Core developers have always had control, both direct and indirect, over the blockchain and the coin. Even though there is a pretense of the full node consensus, the Core has acted with an effective dictatorship when needed.\n\nFor example, the major political change SegWit only had a limited voluntary uptake among the nodes when proposed. Only 20% to 30% of the nodes by hash power signaled acceptance. BTC Core developers responded by saying that if these nodes didn\u2019t implement SegWit the Core would change the proof of work algorithm and bankrupt them. That threat was effective. It was just one example to show the kind of centralized control BTC is under, despite the false impression of being decentralized it has created.\n\nAfter SegWit, BTC Core developers continued to make changes, including Taproot, that were not voted on by the majority of users or exchanges and were forced upon everybody.\n\nPut aside the numerous protocol changes that BTC has made, the first major event of forking, which eventually led to BTC and BCH is an undeniable event that constituted a new issuance or re-issuance, as discussed above.\n\nThe moment when BTC forked by changing the original protocol, the coins became a different coin. Whether that new coin is a security or not must be determined by its own nature and characteristics, because it cannot automatically inherit the nonsecurity status from the original coin, given that the very substantial nature of the coin has changed.\n\nThe new issuance of BTC as a different coin had both a legal and technical character. Legally, as discussed above, it was reissued as a security because the new coin satisfies all four elements of the Howey test.\n\nBut it is also necessary to understand how it did it technically, not because the technical aspects would change the legal conclusion in this case, but because it is helpful to better understand it and to avoid confusion caused by the deep technical obfuscation.\n\nBefore forking, just one set of coins (bitcoin) existed on one chain. At the moment of forking, two separate blocks were generated each representing the different chain, let\u2019s say chain A and chain B, the picture of the entire set of coins looks like the following:\n\nChain A: contains all the original UTXOs on the previous blocks before the fork, plus new UTXOs created in the first forked block on chain A. Let\u2019s call them UTXO Prior, and UTXO Fork-A, respectively.\n\nChain B: contains all the original UTXOs on the previous blocks before the fork (identical to that of Chain A), plus new UTXOs created in the first forked block on chain B. Let\u2019s call them UTXO Prior, and UTXO Fork-B, respectively.\n\nThat is, at the moment, the only difference between chain A and chain B is that between UTXO Fork-A and UTXO Fork-B on the new blocks, which are of a very small number compared to the unchanged UTXO Prior on the historical chain. UTXO Fork-A and UTXO Fork-B would have different addresses because they were generated in different blocks by different miners meant to build different chains. But all the UTXOs in UTXO Prior are identical on both chain A and chain B because they are the exact copies of the original chain, with just one difference: they are now on different chains.\n\nBut because there are two different chains, clearly, we now have two different sets of coins, including those in the identical UTXO Prior. Not only do they exist on different chains, but they are also presented to the market as two different assets.\n\nWith the above picture, now ask the following critical question:\n\nWhich of the above two sets of coins is the original bitcoin?\n\nIf one is not confused by the technical obfuscation, the answer is simple and clear: it has to be the one chain that maintained the original protocol. The one that has changed the original protocol becomes a new coin.\n\nAnd technically, it became a new coin and was recognized in user wallets by way of \u2018airdropping.\u2019 This kind of airdropping may not be easy to tell because the users of the wallets may not explicitly observe an actual event of airdropping (i.e., new coin being dropped to the wallets for free), but in reality, what happened was exactly the same as an airdropping.\n\nJust imagine the user of a wallet that has the original bitcoin. When the fork occurred, the original UTXOs owned by the user remained in his wallet, but something material had happened due to the forking: now those UTXO addresses suddenly became two different sets of coins, one on chain A (BCH and subsequently BSV), and one on chain B (BTC). The user automatically owns both. This has happened not because something has changed in the user\u2019s wallet but because something has changed on the blockchains and further on the coin exchanges.\n\nBut since the coins on chain A are just a continuation of the original bitcoin, the coins on chain B have been simply created out of thin air, the equivalent of an airdropping.\n\nWe are, of course, not against, as a matter of principle creating and issuing new coins. But the key matters at hand now are as follows:\n\n(1) as far as the securities law is concerned, which one is the original bitcoin that has established itself as a nonsecurity, and which one is newly created?\n\n(2) is the new coin still a nonsecurity?\n\n(3) does the market deserve to know the correct answers to the above questions?\n\nWe believe the answers to those questions are clear. BTC became a new coin at the fork, and the new coin qualifies as a security. And as it continued to be offered to the market without registration, it violated securities law.\n\nAnd the fact that BTC was able to fool the market into believing that itself was the original bitcoin not only lends no relief to the above conclusion, but in fact, it aggravated the offense because not only did it become an illegal security, but it also committed active fraud against the investors.\n\nHere, the exchanges were also involved because it was their decision in collusion with the Core developers to assign the then-existing ticker BTC to chain B and call it Bitcoin when they should have done the opposite if they followed the principle of the base protocol set by Satoshi. Other than that principle, there was no other self-evident truth in determining which was which. Doing the opposite of what the original base protocol indicated, their only explainable motivation then was ulterior.\n\nIn addition to creating a new coin that was a security, the airdrop also triggered a taxable event, as the new coin was no longer the original asset that had been held, unsold, not transferred or exchanged, but a materialized profit from the original asset, thus a taxable income.\n\nBCH did the same at a subsequent fork between BCH and BSV, and, therefore also became a security.\n\nBelow in this article, we discuss further the difference between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and also the important matter of nexus.\n\nPoW, PoS, and the Howey test\n\nIn this article, we explain the legal reason why the \u2018specialization of services\u2019 in PoW has an impact on whether the underlying asset is a security or not.\n\nIt is mostly because the \u2018specialization of services\u2019 separates the investment from the requisite common enterprise and therefore yields a negative result according to the Howey test.\n\nHowever, this \u2018separation\u2019 can be destroyed if the issuer pre-mines the asset (coins or tokens), because once the issuer pre-mines, a nexus exists between the money investment and the issuer which is now a suspect of the requisite common enterprise according to the Howey test.\n\nThe genius of PoW is deeply and widely misunderstood. The PoW as originally designed by Satoshi maybe essentially described as follows:\n\nA competitive economic system that requires nodes to each perform and demonstrate a signal-work in order to prove both its honesty and ability to perform a utility-work.\n\nThe bifurcation of work into two different kinds of work in PoW, namely a signal-work, and a utility-work, is critical not only to the overall design of Bitcoin as a scalable and secure system but also to the question of the Howey test. The bifurcation of work leads to specialization and labor division, which in turn, along with a locked base protocol, causes the nonexistence or disappearance of a common enterprise requisite, according to the Howey test.\n\nTherefore, the original bitcoin that is based on PoW and has a locked protocol is not a security because the buyers of bitcoin do not invest in a common enterprise.\n\nIn contrast, a crypto asset based on PoS is a security under the Howey test because the stakers are analogous to shareholders of a company, and the stakers (shareholders) bought the tokens (1) as an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits (4) predominantly from the efforts of others.\n\nThe common enterprise\n\nIt is clear both PoW and PoS satisfy the first element of the Howey test: investment of money.\n\nIt is also quite easy to identify a common enterprise working behind any crypto asset, be it PoW or PoS. The common enterprise may be the issuer of the asset, a group that maintains a consensus, a group of developers, a company that builds the common infrastructure, or the mining business as a collective whole in their effort of operating the blockchain according to the rules set by the issuer, etc. Legally speaking, the \u2018common enterprise\u2019 does not need to be an incorporated legal entity. The common law standard applies.\n\nIf the above two are established, it is also fairly easy to establish the other two elements of the Howey test as well: investors also have an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others.\n\nTherefore, it may appear that even bitcoin with PoW meets the Howey test, is thus a security suspect.\n\nHowever, it is the existence or absence of a nexus between the investment and any common enterprise in the ecosystem that is important. It makes the genuine bitcoin based on the original PoW consensus different from other coins. See below.\n\nNexus required in Howey test\n\nConcerning the Howey test, a focus has been on the existence or lack thereof of a \u201ccommon enterprise.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is an implicit nexus among the four elements required in the Howey test. The nexus is especially important between the first test element and the second one (\u201cinvestment of money\u201d and \u201cin a common enterprise\u201d), meaning that for the Howey test to be positive, investors must have invested the money into the common enterprise.\n\nIf there is no common enterprise for investors to invest into, the transaction does not meet the Howey test. Or, although an enterprise does exist in the ecosystem, the investment has nothing to do with the enterprise (but is rather related to something else), it still does not meet the Howey test. The mere existence of both an investment and an enterprise somewhere in the ecosystem does not qualify for the Howey test.\n\nIn other words, if the investors have invested money into something that\u2019s different from the identified \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d the Howey test would result in a negative, and the asset would not be a security.\n\nIt is the absence or existence of this nexus that is the most important difference between PoW and PoS.\n\nThe requisite nexus exists in PoS\n\nA PoS system not only has a distinctive \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d it also has the requisite nexus.\n\nWith PoS, once a common enterprise is found to exist (which usually does), the nexus is inherently there, and it is quite obvious. There is no separation, not even an essential and substantive distinction, between possessing coins and performing validation by the validators in PoS. The validators derive their acting power and benefit directly from the very fact that they hold \u201cshares\u201d of this common enterprise. The shares, in essence, are non-distinguishable among all shareholders, except for a nonessential difference in the manner in which they receive a \u2018dividend.\u2019\n\nWhether they are staking to become a validator or not, they are all investing into this same enterprise (the common enterprise). This makes the PoS coin holders essentially the same as any shareholders who have shares of a conventional enterprise and therefore are holders of a security.\n\nIn other words, with PoS, coin purchasers effectively buy shares of a common enterprise which runs the PoS-based blockchain creation and validation business. They are all shareholders of the common enterprise. When some shareholders happen to also stake for validation using the shares and thus receive an extra benefit, they are nonetheless still shareholders of the same common enterprise and do not change the non-staking coin purchasers\u2019 role as shareholders either.\n\nThis is akin to a company\u2019s equity shareholders who are also workers or employees of the company receiving an extra benefit in wage compensation, except that PoS ties the stakes even more directly with the compensation by not even requiring the \u201cshareholder-employees\u201d to perform real work other than exercising voting rights proportional to each one\u2019s shares.\n\nNo requisite nexus in genuine PoW\n\nIn contrast, with genuine PoW, mining nodes derive their benefit by performing real work. The fact that a mining node may also own some coins (bitcoin, for example) is merely incidental. The ownership of the coins does not constitute the business of mining. Performing the mining work does. There is a fundamental separation between possessing coins and performing mining work by the PoW miners.\n\nIn other words, even if one could characterize holders of bitcoin as some kind of investors who have invested in something, that \u2018something\u2019 is not an identifiable \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d in active operation. Rather, they just purchased a thing (a commodity), not the share of a common enterprise.\n\nThe case is particularly clear and strong with the genuine bitcoin based on genuine PoW.\n\nFirst, the investors did not invest in an issuer to create more coins. The issuer of bitcoin, namely Satoshi, issued all the coins all at once in the beginning without having any coin purchasers\u2019 participation. The bitcoin issuer isn\u2019t a continuing enterprise that needs investment. In the case of bitcoin, the truth is that Satoshi, the issuer, would have received no money either directly or indirectly from the investments by others had he, not himself mined coins as a miner on exactly the same terms as the other miners. And the fact that the issuer did also do mining is coincidental and has no inherent relationship with the issuer\u2019s identity.\n\nIn this respect, any secret arrangement, such as pre-mining, that gives the issuer an unfair advantage makes the asset a suspect. The genuine bitcoin had no such arrangement.\n\nSecond, bitcoin purchasers did not invest in the mining business. It is the shareholders of the mining companies who have invested in the mining business, and these shareholders are a different category than the coin holders. The company shares of a mining business are clearly securities, and no one could honestly argue they are not, but there are different from bitcoin.\n\nThird, bitcoin purchasers did not invest in a common infrastructure development business. Shareholders of the blockchain infrastructure development companies have invested in the development business, but again they are in a different category than the coin holders. Likewise, the company shares of an infrastructure business are clearly securities, but they are different from bitcoin.\n\nAn example of a nonsecurity digital asset\n\nOne distinct example is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).\n\nBSV is the original Bitcoin, according to the whitepaper \u201cA Peer-to-Peer electronic cash system. \u201d It is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (POW); and has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nNot only the legal theory but also the actual evidence supports the lack of a gravity center acting as a force to attract speculative investors.\n\nDue to its emphasis of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cash payment utility (versus \u201cdigital gold\u201d and \u201cstore of value\u201d narratives) by design, BSV clearly has far less attraction to pure speculative investors. The way the market has treated BSV is, in fact, a harsh and bitter showing that BSV can only succeed on its having developed real utility and not by merely selling a narrative. (But is it not what it should be like in a real world of business?)\n\nBut at the same time, this rather peculiar phenomenon is also circumstantial evidence that BSV is not a security but a commodity which lives or dies based on its utility.\n\nAs BSV\u2019s ecosystem further develops, coin purchasers are more and more purchasing the satoshi tokens for the utility (to actually use them) rather than with a mere expectation of profit.\n\nIn the case of BSV, the empirical behavior and the legal theory are in harmony. Both the lack of an investable common enterprise and the lack of nexus in an actually invested common enterprise, along with the asset\u2019s being centered around utility, clearly demonstrated a nonsecurity asset.\n\nThe spirit of the law\n\nLastly, looking beyond the letters of the law, it is relevant to consider the spirit of the law as well. The spirit of the securities law, including the Howey test, is to protect investors from issuers/sellers of certain things that have a strong speculative nature.\n\nThere is a twofold reason why \u201csecurities\u201d as a category are particularly risky:\n\nFirst, those behind securities are strongly motivated to get investors\u2019 money; and\n\nSecond, the investors, on the other hand, are strongly drawn to a prospect of receiving a return without actually doing any work because all work is done by others in the enterprise that is supposed to create the underlying return.\n\nTherefore, when a common enterprise exists as a center of gravity to pull many investors in, you want some protection for the public. This gravitational pulling is critical in assessing the reality and is also reflected in the Howey test\u2019s use of the word \u2018led\u2019 in the phrase \u2018led to expect profit\u2019, a word that deserves much more attention than it has had in the past.\n\nThe securities law does not make fundraising illegal per se. It just subjects fundraising process to certain regulatory requirements.\n\nHowever, almost none of the existing crypto coins and tokens were issued and exchanged in a manner that satisfies such regulatory requirements. Therefore, to be legal, a crypto must pass a negative Howey test and be thus considered not to be a security.\n\nFor this purpose, a digital asset that runs on a genuine decentralized PoW consensus with a base protocol locked according to the law passes a negative Howey test and may not be required to register as a security because such an asset does not have a common enterprise that exists and acts as the center of gravity.\n\nEspecially, if the digital asset is further designed to primarily serve as a nontrading utility, it tends to be even less likely to form a center of gravity that is in itself speculative and also attracts speculating investors.\n\nBTC and the other cryptos do not have such qualities in reality.\n\nTo reveal the reality, an empirical demonstration that is more than mere theoretical considerations would be necessary to show such nonspeculative characteristics. To this end, the factfinder is encouraged to compare the messages that run deep and run on top of the ecosystem and the mindset of each coin, and ask these questions:\n\nIs it not the main message of BTC to the world \u2018the number go up\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BSV to the world, \u2018utility and value only, not the price\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BTC to BSV \u2018enjoy staying poor\u2019?\n\nIs it not the main message of BSV to BTC \u2018wake up and do something useful\u2019?\n\nSecurities, commodities, and currencies\n\nIn the U.S., securities, commodities, and banking products are placed under different jurisdictions. Securities are under the SEC, commodities under the CFTC, and banking products under the FDIC. Because the SEC has the most strict and burdensome registration and reporting requirements, it is usually advantageous to be classified as a commodity or a banking product rather than a security.\n\nTo escape from the Howey test, a digital asset must either prove it is an exception that does not fall into the definition of a security according to the Howey test or prove it is a statutory exemption.\n\nFor coins and tokens that were created from nothing and further promoted by an identifiable entity or people, it is very hard to argue for an exception of the Howey test. As a result, the focus has been on arguing that the thing is either a commodity or a currency as an exemption.\n\nCommodities\n\nHistorically, the enactment of laws such as the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 and CFTC Act of 1974 did provide legislative exemptions to commodity trading, such as the futures and options from the securities law.\n\nHowever, these laws have quite restrictive definitions of \u2018commodities\u2019 under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. The legal definition of \u2018commodities\u2019 is quite different from that in economics.\n\nIt is a misunderstanding that anything that can be classified as a \u2018commodity\u2019 in terms of economics would be automatically exempted from securities law. To be statutorily exempted, it would have to literally fall within the legal definition of a \u2018commodity\u2019 with no ambiguity, and this certainly does not include bitcoin, nor any crypto coins.\n\nAt the present time, barring new legislation that clearly brings bitcoin and certain crypto coins under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, an ambiguity exists between securities and commodities and, accordingly, between the jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC. For example, just because the CFTC claims certain crypto asset are commodities does not exclude the SEC from claiming the same as a security. Without clear legislation, there could be competition and even conflict between the two branches of the government agency.\n\nBut we also argue that a true commodity should not clearly be a security according to the Howey test in the first place. We note that the purpose of the commodities law was to eliminate unnecessary litigations due to ambiguities in the securities law interpretation rather than simply carving out exemptions in contradiction with the securities law.\n\nTherefore, the statutory exemption should be sought and provided in a principled manner. This is necessary to bring harmony to the two sets of laws, which are meant to serve the same society.\n\nIt is important to note that the commodity laws in the U.S. were created at a time when all commodities were physical, and as a result, only the derivatives (such as futures, forwards, and options) based on commodities had significance to the financial markets and therefore needed to be regulated. The spot market of physical commodities did not have such needs and certainly did not have an effect of speculative investments to impact investors.\n\nWith digital assets such as bitcoin and crypto coins, this has all changed. Regardless of whether you see them as securities or not, these things can be traded directly (i.e., without forming derivatives) on exchanges with the same level of investor participation that of stocks, and clearly with even higher level of speculations. The entire crypto mass is a testament to this dire effect. See The Cancerous Crypto.\n\nThe law, therefore, must look at the substance instead of form. If investors need protection on the stock market by securities law, they certainly also need the same kind of protection on speculative offering and trading of digital assets if what\u2019s being offered and created clearly meet the Howey test.\n\nIn this sense, just because something is a commodity in an economic sense should not result in an automatic exemption from securities law.\n\nOn the other hand, if something does not clearly meet the Howey test (or even clearly does not meet the Howey test), while at the same time clearly has characteristics of a commodity, it should be regulated under the CFTC. This should not only include the derivatives but also include spot trading on exchanges.\n\nApplying the commodities law to BTC and BSV would show that BTC does not have strong qualifications for a commodity, but the genuine Bitcoin BSV does (see below).\n\nCurrencies\n\nAlternative to commodities, currencies is another potential exemption of securities law.\n\nRipple, for example, argues that its XRP is a currency, and therefore is exempted from securities law.\n\nHowever, as the SEC has clearly argued in its case against Ripple, the currency exemption applies only to legal tender such as a fiat currency.\n\nThe Ripple case is another example of confusion over terminologies. The word \u2018currency\u2019 has different meanings in different contexts. When it comes to securities law exemptions, it is the specific legal definition, not the definition in economics or technology, that applies.\n\nAgain, what is important is the substance, not the form or words. The reason why a conventional fiat-based currency isn\u2019t a security is not because it is a currency in an economic or technical sense but because it does not meet the Howey Test. Specifically, (1) a conventional fiat-based currency is not issued by an enterprise but by the government; and (2) obtaining a conventional fiat-based currency is not an investment, nor with an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others, but to get a reliable medium of value exchange.\n\nCurrently, no cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, has really become legal tender. A convincing argument can be made that the genuine bitcoin BSV is a currency in a technical sense, but it would still be hard to persuade a court that it is a currency in a legal sense (i.e., legal tender).\n\nHowever, we do believe BSV is a true commodity and, therefore, should be exempted from the securities law, an alternative to finding an exact exception to the Howey test. See more discussion on this point below.\n\nThe genuine Bitcoin BSV qualifies for the commodity exemption, but BTC does not\n\nApplying the commodities law to BTC and BSV, it is clear that BTC is much less like a commodity than BSV is.\n\nThe most important characteristic of a commodity is standardization. A commodity is standardized both in its substance (as a good or service) and in its contracts.\n\nFor bitcoin, there would be no standardization if its base protocol kept changing. The base protocol affects the substantive nature of bitcoin. The change in the base protocol is analogous to a change in the manufacturing process that results in a material of different chemical properties, thus destroying the standardization of the substance, as the thing you buy the next time might be different from what you think it is today. The fact that it is always labeled and packaged under the same name does not mean it is the same thing when measured by its properties, such as what it can or cannot do.\n\nIn addition, a base protocol change directly affects transactional contracts, resulting in less reliable contract standardization. To the users, when a script created for a transaction could be rendered unusable sometime in the foreseeable future (which has already happened with BTC), there would be no reliable standardization in contracts. Besides, if the base protocol is changed in such a manner that it alters the original automated unilateral contract between the bitcoin issuer and miners (which again has already happened with BTC), it destroys another aspect of standardization.\n\nIn comparison, BSV does not suffer any of those problems thanks to its locked protocol.\n\nTherefore, from a commodity viewpoint, there is a sharp contrast between BTC and BSV. BSV has the most evident characteristics of a commodity, but BTC does not.\n\nWe also note that BSV being a true commodity is congruent with it being a non-security according to the Howey test. It ought to be.\n\nAs illustrated above, BSV clearly is not a security. In consideration of the harmony between the two sets of laws, a true commodity should not clearly be a security according to the Howey test in the first place. The purpose of the commodities law was to eliminate unnecessary litigations due to ambiguities in the securities law interpretation rather than simply carving out exemptions in contradiction with the securities law.\n\nThe same is also why Congress passed laws treating traditional commodities differently than securities in the first place. An apparent characteristic of a commodity is that it is a standardized good or service with standardized contracts. But it also has implicit characteristics that are related to the Howey test.\n\nSpecifically, a typical commodity does not read on the Howey test to behave like a security. People buy a commodity primarily for its utility, not as an investment, or at least are not actively led by others to believe it is an investment, to expect a profit from the effort of a recognizable third party (a common enterprise). This line is blurred when people buy derivatives such as futures of a commodity, but such futures are still underlined by a real commodity whose main property is utility rather than speculations. It was precisely for this reason, the commodities laws were created to avoid unnecessary litigation in securities law.\n\nIn addition to utility, the production and promotion of a commodity should not be under the control of a single entity or an effective global partnership acting in coordination (the common enterprise). Otherwise, the thing would look more like a security. This would be the case especially when the controlling common enterprise is able to create among the investors a belief in speculations that are detached from the actual utility. Besides, imagine a producer being able to create a virtual commodity out of thin air and \u2018issue\u2019 it to others. It would make the producer more of an issuer of a security than a producer of a commodity.\n\nIn conclusion, BTC does not have good qualifications for a commodity and should not enjoy the commodity exemption. But if BTC could even be remotely considered as a commodity, the genuine Bitcoin (BSV) is certainly much more so. As a commodity, BSV should be regulated as such instead of a security. This means BSV is an exemption from the securities law, an alternative to finding an exact exception to the Howey test.\n\nLegislation considerations\n\nAt the same time, new legislation could further clarify the legal definition of a commodity to properly take digital realities into consideration.\n\nWith multiple bills being introduced in Congress (for example, S.4760 \u2013 Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022, and H.R.7614 \u2013 Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2022), it is important that legislators understand not only the apparent issues but also the nature of the new asset class well. Currently, two opposite types of risks exist at the same time. One is the risk of inaction causing prolonged uncertainty, and the other is herd action hyped by misunderstandings.\n\nThe risk is that, given the public pressure, the legislators may be too eager to please the crowd, desiring to be viewed as heroes protecting technological advances. But in reality, the opposite is true. The crypto market has become cancerous and is the biggest obstacle to true development of blockchain technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only digital assets that are not a security are ones that satisfy all the following conditions:\n\n(1) did not do pre-mining;\n\n(2) had no new issuance or re-issuance in its lifetime;\n\n(3) is based on genuine Proof-of-Work (PoW); and (4) has a locked base protocol according to the law.\n\nExcept for the genuine bitcoin (BSV), other cryptos, even BTC, are all nonexempt securities.\n\nThe genuine bitcoin BSV is not a security. It is also a true commodity. Having harmony between the laws of commodities and securities on a utility blockchain that serves as an authentication layer in a global data network is for everyone\u2019s good. See Blockchain as the New Global Data Network\u2019s Authentication Layer.\n\nWatch: Dr. Craig Wright\u2019s keynote speech on Cloud Security, Overlays & Blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Just a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was inspired by Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT protocol which showed developers that\u2014using Taproot\u2014users could post arbitrary data to the blockchain.\n\nHow did we do it? \ud83d\udca1 Ordinals showed us it was possible to publish arbitrary data to Bitcoin. We saw this and decided to follow a similar process. At its core, all that was needed was two functions: one to submit rollup blocks, and another to retrieve them. pic.twitter.com/u6etICUAtg \u2014 Rollkit (@RollkitDev) March 5, 2023\n\nIn the traditional sense, rollups are batches of transactions that are \u201crolled up\u201d off chain into one transaction, and then posted to Ethereum as a single on-chain transaction. This helps free up blockspace and lower transaction costs on the network, while still inheriting the settlement assurances of the base chain.\n\nA sovereign rollup is one that does not need a smart contract or use a settlement layer for validation\u2014scalable and secure and with the \"sovereignty\" of a layer 1.\n\nHowever, some proponents of Ethereum, a network known to use layer-2 \u201crollups\u201d as a transaction scaling solution, have taken issue with Rollkit\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a Web3 and Ethereum investor, said on Twitter that the sovereign rollup \u201cis actually an alt L1 that stores its block data on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alexei Zamyatin, founder of the Bitcoin DeFi protocol Interlay, sovereign rollups as proposed by Rollkit inherit \u201cnothing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cData availability\u2014okay, but honestly, that's been used since 2012,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe entire post describes 'I write some data to Bitcoin' with fancy buzzwords.\u201d\n\nRollkit is still bullish on the possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis new integration expands the possibilities for rollups, and also has the potential to help bootstrap a healthy blockspace fee market on Bitcoin, enabling a more sustainable security budget,\u201d the company writes.\n\nSome are likening sovereign rollups to Stacks, a high functionality layer 1 protocol that settles its blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain for security purposes. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said on Twitter that this is an apt comparison, but noted some key differences.\n\nOn one hand, it takes 150 Stacks blocks before a transaction reaches\u201dBitcoin finality\u201d on Stacks, but only 1 with sovereign rollups. On the other, Stacks blocks publish their data to Bitcoin in an efficient manner by merely hashing the data on-chain, whereas sovereign rollups publishes the full data.\n\n\u201cThe technically challenging part for both the Stacks layer and sovereign rollups is moving BTC in and out of the layer, said Ali. \u201cThe decentralized BTC peg is the most important part.\u201d"

        "title": "An Adventurers Guide to the Bitcoin-Based Ordinals NFT - NFT Plazas",
        "content": "An Adventurers Guide to the Bitcoin-Based Ordinals NFT\n\nOrdinals are inscriptions of content onto individual satoshis that can be tracked and held by users. The data is purely on chain, doesn\u2019t rely on other protocols, and will therefore survive as long as the bitcoin blockchain is up and running. Many new services have emerged that allow users to inscribe, hold, and sell inscriptions. Everyone is doing it. It\u2019s all the rage.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt the beginning of this year, a bitcoin developer named Casey Rodarmor released a bitcoin native protocol called ordinals, that allows individual satoshis to be \u201cinscribed\u201d with arbitrary data, enabling them to host images directly on the bitcoin network\u2026 no third party image hosting services, no links required, all directly on chain. This is a significant contribution to the bitcoin network that opens up a world of possibilities for the blockchain that most regard simply as a monetary instrument. This innovation has been met with strong opinions from both sides of the emotional spectrum. Bitcoin maxis regard it as graffiti on the blockchain that threatens to clog up the mempool, raise mining fees to untenable levels, and possible introduce exploits. Others see this as a breakthrough innovation that allows bitcoin to be a platform for free expression. Since its launch just weeks ago, almost 300,000 \u201cinscriptions\u201d (the Ordinal term for NFTs) have been created, and that number is quickly growing. Even projects like Yuga labs, famous for their Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has decided to jump in with a new project.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nOrdinals are called ordinals because in number theory it denotes that numbers signify an order. Ordinal numbers are integers (natural numbers like 1, 2, 3\u2026) and can be used to identify an objects place in a list. Satoshis, the fundamental unit of bitcoin where each Satoshi is worth 1 / 100,000,000) of a bitcoin are not naturally ordered and do not have unique identifiers. When people transfer Satoshis between each other, as Casey Rodarmor puts it, they are held in a Satoshi goo superposition, indistinguishable from one another. This was the first basic innovation of Ordinals, creating a protocol that identifies and tracks individual satoshis. The details are somewhat complex, so feel free to read more about ordinal theory on the Ordinals website.\n\nNow that individual satoshis have unique identifiers and can be tracked across the blockchain, they can be inscribed with content. The details of this are also complex, but essentially they are inscribed through an envelope serializing procedure that recognizes the ordinal protocol, denotes the inscription content type, and then includes the actual data in the OP_FALSE and OP_PUSH sections of a bitcoin transaction. Altogether, \u201cthe inscription content is contained within the input of a reveal transaction, and the inscription is made on the first sat of its first output.\u201d\n\nOne very important thing to note about inscriptions is that they are inherently limited by the megabyte contents of a bitcoin block. This means that currently 4MB is a hard cap on the size of the data one can inscribe. However, in reality the current practical limit is considerably smaller than that, around 400kb. The reason for this lower limit is because larger data will not be relayed by the Bitcoin Core. The only exception to this is bitcoin miners who have the ability to accept and transmit larger transactions. So yeah, 400kb for the average user. That\u2019s pretty small, which is an interesting constraint on the type of content that can be hosted there. Its also important to mention that the cost of an inscription is directly related primarily to the size of the inscription, as well as how in demand blockspace is at the time of inscription.\n\nNow that we have some of the basics and mechanics down, lets dive into how you can start inscribing, browsing inscriptions, finding a marketplace where these are bought and sold, and holding your inscription (heads up: it will need an ordinal compliant bitcoin taproot wallet). At first, inscribing and holding inscriptions required a lot from its users. You had to be running a full bitcoin node using Bitcoin Core 24 or newer. Even getting to this stage is a task beyond the reach of most. Syncing a full node \u2013 meaning the entire history of the blockchain \u2013 requires several days or weeks of downloading time, and a large disk on which to store the almost 500GB. Once the full node is synced, a few configurations need to be implemented using the command line in the bitcoin node. Additionally, the Ordinal client needs to be installed, and can only be interacted with on a command line basis. A taproot bitcoin wallet is needed otherwise inscribed sats could be accidentally lost and transferred. It\u2019s a lot, and not for beginners.\n\nWallets\n\nLuckily, with the enthusiasm for Ordinals, several companies have developed tools that accomplish all this for you\u2026 and they are growing and developing at a blistering pace. Lets start with wallets. As mentioned, you need a bitcoin Taproot wallet that plays nicely with the ordinal client to ensure you can hold your inscriptions without accidentally transferring them. Several wallets have stepped up to the plate. Two of the best available are Sparrow Wallet and Hiro Wallet. These are both fairly wysiwyg, and there are good guides on how to use them for managing inscriptions. Additional available ordinals wallets include ordinalswallet.com and xverse.app.\n\nInscription Services\n\nNow that you have a wallet that can hold and manage inscriptions, lets talk about resources that allow you to make your own inscriptions. There are two that have really risen to prominence in these early days. The first one is gamma.io. Gamma was one of the first out of the gate offering ordinal minting services, and they have been rapidly developing new tools. Their basic service is an incredibly simple 5 step process that involves choosing the type of data (single image, or text), drag and dropping data to be uploaded and inscribed, fee estimation for the inscription, giving your ordinal compliant wallet address, and finally payment for the inscription. Its really simple once you have the wallet figured out. In their recent tweet, they described some new functionality including minting in bulk (multiple inscriptions at the same time), linking inscriptions to higher resolution assets that are hosted off chain, and generating a dedicated collection page for users. All very cool stuff! Additional minting services that are worth mentioning include inscribenow.io, ordinalsbot.com, ordswap.io, ordimint.com, and generative.xyz.\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing one of our biggest releases yet \u2014 one we know will change the game for #Bitcoin Ordinals: Ordinal Collection Mints \ud83d\udc8e In our typical fashion, this isn\u2019t just a bulk mint option. It\u2019s so much more. Buckle up\u2026 \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Gamma.io (@trygamma) February 28, 2023\n\nMARKETPLACES\n\nWith all the sustained hype around Ordinals, its no surprise a multitude of marketplaces have come into being that allow users to buy and sell inscriptions. In general, there is significant overlap between inscription services, wallets, and marketplaces. Nevertheless, to date, there are a few key players in the space. Marketplaces are either trusted or trustless, meaning that you either rely on the marketplace to act as an intermediary between buyer and seller (trusted) or not (trustless). Trustless marketplaces typically use a PBST mechanism which stands for \u201cpartially signed bitcoin transaction,\u201d which allows buyer and seller to put funds and inscriptions in a conditional contract that only executes when all conditions are met. Trustless intermediaries are more in line with the ethos of decentralization, but both have been working seamlessly for all parties. Additionally, these marketplaces are their own islands: there is currently not a general marketplace where all ordinals that are for sale are listed. Each of the following marketplaces have a unique set of ordinals for sale. The most used frequently used sites are ordinals.market, ordswap.io, ordina.ls, and scarce.city. Of these, Scarce.City is worth distinguishing based on the fact that they are an auction house that has been in the space since the beginning of #rarepepe, which makes their prestige, longevity, and mechanism of sale orthogonal to the other marketplaces mentioned. Another class of buying and selling avenues worth mentioning are the various telegram and discord communities that have sprung up like wildflowers around this space. There are innumerable ordinal projects / collections that have bespoke chat spaces devoted to them, where buyers and sellers often meet.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nThe last class of repositories worth sharing are general informational sites. We are still very much in the early days of ordinals, but as a type of digital asset, they seem to have the hallmarks of one that will stand the test of time. Data inscribed on the most trusted, longest running, and widely adopted blockchain is a recipe for longevity. This innovation has actually caused me to reconceptualized the purpose and significance of bitcoin: I see it now as not just the most innovative monetary instrument in the history of humanity, but now it\u2019s a time capsule that preserve information longer and further into the future than any other that I am aware of. This is historic. Coming to this realization and understanding has required uncountable hours scouring the web for small scraps of information. The best way for you to begin that knowledge journey is by first reading ALL of the information contained on ordinals.com. Next, I recommend searching for any and all podcasts that Casey Rodarmor has done (which are many), and listening to all the nuance of his technical explanations and plans for the future. We are currently in V1, so to speak. After that, getting involved in the various chat rooms and visiting all the resources mentioned here will help crystallize your understanding of the mechanics. Here are a few podcasts and videos you might invest some time listening to: resource1, resource2, resource3, resource4.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this explainer. I know it\u2019s a lot. All new technologies are, even though most of them will fail. For my money, I strongly recommend investing the time to learn about Ordinals. They are not going anywhere, and understanding them with a level of nuance is an easily claimed feather in the cap that even many seasoned crypto enthusiasts have yet to claim. Bitcoin native NFTs are a significant advancement of human ingenuity and the possibilities portended by the bitcoin network.\n\nFollow me @DANCETURN to receive regular updates about ordinals, what they mean, how they are changing the game, and the latest Ordinal tech.

        "content": "Description: Norway is putting on a major Bitcoin conference with high-signal speakers, topped off with an otherworldly rave running on Lightning.\n\nBy Erik Dale\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Erik Dale, an organizer of the upcoming Northern Lightning Conference and host of a Scandinavian Bitcoin podcast.\n\nScandinavia may not be the first region that comes to mind when you think of Bitcoin (BTC), but Norway has become the \u201cbiggest Bitcoin mining hub in Europe.\u201d With less than 0.07% of the world population, the Norwegians churn out nearly 3% of Bitcoin\u2019s global hash rate, mostly thanks to cheap, stranded and renewable hydropower in the north. And now, Norway is hosting the world\u2019s \u201cmost Bitcoin experience\u201d \u2014 Northern Lightning 2023.\n\nA pure-signal conference\n\nNorthern Lightning 2023 will take place in Bergen, Norway, from March 17\u201319, and the Norwegians are going all out.\n\nEverything has been designed for and by Bitcoiners: from the keynotes to the food, the parties and the merch. Merch will be limited to 21 numbered copies. Our vision is to create an annual, intimate experience bringing Bitcoin to a new Nordic city each year until \u201chyperbitcoinization\u201d is achieved and beyond.\n\nThis first edition will be a three-day Bitcoin conference in a historical setting among Bergen\u2019s dramatic scenery and wooden harbors, headlined by the greatest minds in Bitcoin, with the opportunity to orange pill hundreds of no-coiners at a massive party running on the Lightning Network.\n\nHodlonaut, Knut Svanholm and Peter Todd are just some of the great Bitcoiners who will be joining, covering topics like monetary liberation, Bitcoin adoption and lightning innovation.\n\nFocused on bringing Bitcoiners together and creating deep connections with minimal stage staring, Northern Lightning also wants to provide the purest signal anywhere. Even the DJs are Bitcoiners.\n\nA rave running on Lightning?\n\nEven the DJs? Yes.\n\nThe highlight of Northern Lightning will be one of the world's largest AFK Bitcoin onboarding events \u2014 an all-night rave with hundreds of no-coiners set to use Lightning. Headlined by Norway\u2019s leading electronic artists, including Karolinski, Matiago, Klysterik, Antibakke and Trym S\u00f8vdsnes, it is set to be a unique orange-pilling opportunity. A lineup this good would fill any venue. So, what happens when 400 thirsty no-coiners meet 200 Bitcoiners, and they all need to use Lightning to buy a beer?\n\nWith the goal of creating an unforgettable, real-world experience of Bitcoin for everyone every year, a rave running on Lightning is a perfect start. Partygoers can use Lightning when buying drinks, renting towels or buying merch, and even buying Bitcoin for cash peer-to-peer when onboarding.\n\nIt\u2019s all designed to offer a little less conversation and more Bitcoin action.\n\nAnd as for the venue, Smien Laksev\u00e5g Verft is Bergen\u2019s oldest ship wharf, recently converted into a nightclub opening directly onto the fjord, which will offer free welcome drinks, as well as sauna use and an all-night barbecue.\n\nNot only for adults\n\nTalk of raves may not appeal to the more family-oriented, but Northern Lightning 2023 has got you and your little ones covered, too.\n\nMy own daughter, Lykushka (who is nine), is organizing the kids\u2019 corner and workshop, a space to educate young minds about Bitcoin while having lots of fun. I love when my kids make friends with other Bitcoiners\u2019 kids; they\u2019re usually brilliant too.\n\nKIDS' CORNER & WORKSHOP \u26a1#NorthernLightning 2023 is proud to present our new project lead for the #Bitcoin kids experience.\n\n\n\nLykushka (9) will ensure it's safe and fun to bring your family:https://t.co/EPM8MpfQGn pic.twitter.com/Tez9kKlW0J \u2014 Erik Dale \u26a1 (@EuroDale) February 24, 2023\n\nWhether the event will make them think mommy and daddy are more or less nuts remains to be seen, but they will be welcomed every day until 10 pm Central European Time at Northern Lightning.\n\nAlmost sold out\n\nNorthern Lightning is less than two weeks away, and passes are selling out fast.\n\nThe main conference pass, including access to keynotes, workshops, dinners, meetups and parties, will sell out this weekend. After that, only limited passes will be available, but the limited passes are pretty awesome, and you won\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nCointelegraph is sending a crew to cover Northern Lightning 2023. Join us in Bergen."

Of those, the highest bid was 7.1159 BTC, or roughly $159,500. The lowest successful bid was 2.2501 BTC, or just over $50,000.\n\nThe top 288 bidders will receive their inscriptions within the week, per Yuga.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJust a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was inspired by Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT protocol which showed developers that\u2014using Taproot\u2014users could post arbitrary data to the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did we do it? \ud83d\udca1 Ordinals showed us it was possible to publish arbitrary data to Bitcoin. We saw this and decided to follow a similar process. At its core, all that was needed was two functions: one to submit rollup blocks, and another to retrieve them. pic.twitter.com/u6etICUAtg \u2014 Rollkit (@RollkitDev) March 5, 2023\n\nIn the traditional sense, rollups are batches of transactions that are \u201crolled up\u201d off chain into one transaction, and then posted to Ethereum as a single on-chain transaction. This helps free up blockspace and lower transaction costs on the network, while still inheriting the settlement assurances of the base chain.\n\nA sovereign rollup is one that does not need a smart contract or use a settlement layer for validation\u2014scalable and secure and with the \"sovereignty\" of a layer 1.\n\nHowever, some proponents of Ethereum, a network known to use layer-2 \u201crollups\u201d as a transaction scaling solution, have taken issue with Rollkit\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a Web3 and Ethereum investor, said on Twitter that the sovereign rollup \u201cis actually an alt L1 that stores its block data on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Alexei Zamyatin, founder of the Bitcoin DeFi protocol Interlay, sovereign rollups as proposed by Rollkit inherit \u201cnothing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cData availability\u2014okay, but honestly, that's been used since 2012,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe entire post describes 'I write some data to Bitcoin' with fancy buzzwords.\u201d\n\nRollkit is still bullish on the possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis new integration expands the possibilities for rollups, and also has the potential to help bootstrap a healthy blockspace fee market on Bitcoin, enabling a more sustainable security budget,\u201d the company writes.\n\nSome are likening sovereign rollups to Stacks, a high functionality layer 1 protocol that settles its blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain for security purposes. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said on Twitter that this is an apt comparison, but noted some key differences.\n\nOn one hand, it takes 150 Stacks blocks before a transaction reaches\u201dBitcoin finality\u201d on Stacks, but only 1 with sovereign rollups. On the other, Stacks blocks publish their data to Bitcoin in an efficient manner by merely hashing the data on-chain, whereas sovereign rollups publishes the full data.\n\n\u201cThe technically challenging part for both the Stacks layer and sovereign rollups is moving BTC in and out of the layer, said Ali. \u201cThe decentralized BTC peg is the most important part.\u201d"

        "content": "Galaxy Research\u2019s report highlighted the top Ordinals sales, which were fascinating.\n\nIt was projected that Bitcoin NFTs built on inscriptions and ordinals would be about $4.5 billion by 2025.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] Ordinals have been a topic of discussion since its launch. Interestingly, Ordinals recently crossed the 300,000 mark. At press time, there were a total of 302,076 inscriptions.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOrdinals are getting mainstream popularity\n\nIn this regard, Galaxy Research published a detailed report about the current scenario of ordinals and the direction the market can head towards in the coming years.\n\nThe report mentioned the top five Bitcoin NFT sales to date. An NFT from the Ord Punks collection topped the list as it was sold for 11.5 BTC, which was worth over $273,000. Ord Rock grabbed the second spot, which was sold at $213,845.\n\nCritics had their share\n\nOn the other hand, Galaxy Research\u2019s report highlighted a few key criticisms of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nA major criticism was that inscriptions will make the blockchain bigger and harder to download.\n\nAnother criticism centered around the very fundamental functionality of Bitcoin. The blockchain was made solely for the P2P electronic cash system to make financial transactions and not to serve as a decentralized storage system.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nA time jump to 2025\n\nThe report mentioned that Galaxy Research\u2019s base case for the market size of Bitcoin NFTs built on inscriptions and ordinals would be $4.5 billion by 2025.\n\nThis was a very ambitious figure considering the current NFT market. As per Statista, revenue in the NFT segment is projected to reach $3,546.00 million in 2023.\n\nAdditionally. it\u2019s interesting to note that by 2027, 64.45 million users are anticipated to enter the NFT market.\n\nHowever, inscriptions can reach a cumulative market worth of $1.5 billion if the market turns bearish, which was only 13% of the entire Ethereum NFT market at the time of writing.\n\nOrdinals state in Q1 2023\n\nGalaxy Research\u2019s projection of the future for Ordinals looked promising, and its current state-backed it. For example, just after reaching the 200,000 mark, Ordinals took only a few days to raise the figure to 300,000.\n\nOut of the total Ordinals, image inscriptions led the market, followed by text.\n\nTherefore, considering Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance, and Ordinals increasing popularity, it is likely that several collections will move to Ordinals over the coming months, which will increase its market size."

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC]: Indicators point at a bull cycle, and on-chain data reveals\u2026 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "BTC\u2019s NUPL suggests that the coin has commenced a new bull cycle.\n\nHowever, increasing coin dump indicates a lack of investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nIn a new report, CryptoQuant analyst Sachi found that the assessment of Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) revealed that the leading coin has commenced a new bull cycle.\n\nThe NUPL is a metric used to evaluate the profit margin of the BTC market in relation to its market capitalization. A value below zero indicates an accumulation phase, while values above 0.5 suggest a distribution phase.\n\nAccording to Sachi, \u201cthe crucial threshold to monitor is 0.2.\u201d In the current market, BTC\u2019s NUPL has reached this \u201ccrucial\u201d position.\n\nThe review conducted by the analyst on BTC\u2019s historical performance found that a golden cross, which typically occurs between the 128 and 200-day moving averages, signals the end of the accumulation phase when the NUPL metric reaches or surpasses 0.2. This signifies the commencement of a bull market.\n\nSachi concluded that a bull cycle was underway as all three critical factors were present once again in the current cycle.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nAccumulation has slowed, but only because\u2026\n\nFor the first time since the unexpected fallout of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, BTC traded momentarily above the $25,000 price mark on 16 February.\n\nAlthough the king coin\u2019s price later went on to trade below $25,000, for a few weeks, investors anticipated that BTC would reclaim the price position, leading them to open several long positions.\n\nHowever, things failed to go as expected, leading to dwindling conviction in any further price rally. Investor\u2019s confidence plummeted further on 3 March when BTC\u2019s price suddenly fell by 5%, dropping from $23,500 to $22,240 due to a sense of insecurity and doubt surrounding Silvergate Capital.\n\nThis led to the liquidation of the long positions earlier opened.\n\nWhile Sachi opined that the decline in accumulation and other factors ushered in a new bull cycle, a look at on-chain data and price chart revealed otherwise.\n\nFirst, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has been in a downtrend since 21 February. The fall in Open Interest coincides with a 10% fall in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nWhen the Open Interest of a crypto asset falls, it means that the number of outstanding contracts or positions in the market has decreased.\n\nIt is often accompanied by a decline in market sentiment or a decrease in the number of traders willing to take positions in the market. As expected, this drives down the value of an asset.\n\nRead Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nFurther, on a daily chart, increased coin distribution has put the buyers at the sellers\u2019 mercy. Key momentum indicators such as the RSI and MFI were positioned in downward trends and rested below their respective neutral regions.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a negative -0.09 at press time, indicating the severity of coin distribution. Without a change in conviction, this usually precedes a further price drawdown.\n\nLastly, a look at BTC\u2019s funding rates across exchanges confirmed the lack of confidence that permeated the market at press time. Per data from CryptoQuant, as of this writing, short positions exceeded long positions. It was the highest negative funding rate year-to-date."

You should also have a clear exit strategy planned out before buying or selling any Crypto.\n\nThere are plenty of expectations in the crypto market in store for 2023 and the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin looks very bright. However, you will need to carry out your research and be cautious, while continually reading news about the price changes of Cryptocurrencies you want to invest in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How To Buy Bitcoin Cash: A Complete Guide - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "Alihan Usullu / iStock.com\n\nMost people are familiar with bitcoin, but fewer people have heard of bitcoin cash, which was created as an alternative to bitcoin.\n\nWhile it may share part of the same name as bitcoin, these two crypto assets are very different. Bitcoin cash operates on a separate blockchain and aims to be a faster and more efficient digital cash system than bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nIn 2017, some of the original bitcoin developers believed that the Bitcoin blockchain was too slow and inefficient. They wanted to build a more scalable alternative.\n\nAs a result, they modified the code and the original Bitcoin blockchain was split into two separate blockchains \u2014 Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This event is referred to as a \u201chard fork\u201d and resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash (BCH).\n\nBCH operates on a decentralized network and can be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks.\n\nAccording to its developers, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain offers several benefits to users, including:\n\nUltra-low fees : The network fee for a typical BCH transaction is less than $0.01.\n\n: The network fee for a typical BCH transaction is less than $0.01. Speed and reliability : BCH transactions are smooth and take just seconds.\n\n: BCH transactions are smooth and take just seconds. Security : BCH operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, which is considered one of the safest blockchain protocols in the world.\n\n: BCH operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, which is considered one of the safest blockchain protocols in the world. Fixed supply : BCH has a cap of 21 million tokens, which ensures that the supply is limited and therefore more resistant to inflation.\n\n: BCH has a cap of 21 million tokens, which ensures that the supply is limited and therefore more resistant to inflation. Privacy: Using BCH can offer more privacy than traditional banking methods, as blockchain transfers are conducted anonymously.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nHow Can I Buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nLike other cryptocurrencies, there are multiple ways to buy bitcoin cash such as using cryptocurrency exchanges, peer-to-peer networks or crypto ATMs.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nA cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash. These exchanges act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, and they make money by charging fees on transactions.\n\nA good crypto exchange has a good reputation, high security, features an intuitive user interface, offers low fees and has high liquidity for your preferred crypto assets.\n\nFor example, Coinbase is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that supports bitcoin cash. You can buy, sell and store bitcoin cash on Coinbase, along with many other cryptocurrencies. Other reputable cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Kraken and OKX.\n\nTo buy bitcoin cash on a crypto exchange, you\u2019ll have to create an account, verify your identity and deposit funds. Once you have funds in your account, you can place an order to buy BCH.\n\nP2P Networks\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to buy cryptocurrency directly from other people on peer-to-peer exchanges. Some benefits of P2P networks include multiple payment options, no trading fees and greater flexibility in terms of legal restrictions.\n\nHowever, P2P trading can also be risky. There are plenty of scammers on these networks who take advantage of the lack of a central authority to govern transactions. In addition, there is often lower liquidity on P2P marketplaces so trades may take longer to complete.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCrypto ATMs\n\nCrypto ATMs are convenient options if you happen to have one in your area. They allow you to purchase bitcoin cash and other cryptocurrencies with cash, debit cards or credit cards.\n\nOne benefit to crypto ATMs is that they offer a high degree of anonymity, especially for users who buy with cash. However, they typically have much higher fees than online exchanges. In addition, they may not offer access to as many cryptocurrencies as online exchanges.\n\nIs Bitcoin Cash Safe To Buy?\n\nAs with any investment, buying bitcoin cash involves risk. As shown by BCH\u2019s price history, it\u2019s a highly volatile asset that has experienced many sudden increases and decreases in price. BCH\u2019s value may follow events in the cryptocurrency market and the economy as a whole or be directly related to its own development as a digital asset.\n\nBefore deciding whether to buy bitcoin cash, it\u2019s essential that you do your research and fully understand the potential risks.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with the risks involved and have done your due diligence, there are steps to ensure the safety of your investment. For example, purchasing bitcoin cash on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange or P2P network with strong security measures in place helps mitigate the risk of fraud or hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to store your bitcoin cash in a secure wallet, such as a custodial wallet offered by a reliable crypto exchange or an offline hardware wallet. Research different options to protect yourself against potential theft.\n\nIs It Better To Buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?\n\nWhen it comes to deciding whether to buy bitcoin or bitcoin cash, there\u2019s no right answer as it ultimately will depend on your investment strategy and financial goals.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBoth bitcoin and BCH have advantages and disadvantages, so you should do your research and consider factors such as transaction speed, fees and overall market performance before making a decision.\n\nOn one hand, bitcoin is the more widely recognized cryptocurrency and has a much larger market capitalization and mainstream adoption than bitcoin cash. With a current market cap of over $400 billion, it\u2019s the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency and may have greater potential for preserving its long-term value.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin cash has some technical advantages over bitcoin, such as faster transaction times and lower fees. So if your goal is to use cryptocurrency as a secure digital payment method rather than a long-term investment, bitcoin cash may be a better option.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBitcoin cash is an established cryptocurrency that shares many of the same characteristics as bitcoin, with some notable improvements to its technical capabilities. If you\u2019re interested in buying bitcoin cash for the first time, make sure you know how to securely conduct transactions and store your crypto assets.\n\nBy taking these precautions and staying informed about the cryptocurrency market, you can make an informed decision about whether buying bitcoin cash is a safe investment for you.\n\nInformation is accurate as of March 7, 2023."

        "title": "Exploring the Relationship Between NFTs and Bitcoin Valuation - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The relationship between NFTs and Bitcoin is explained in detail. Bitcoin NFTs future depends on how the NFT market as a whole.\n\nThe growth of an NFT-like initiative on the Bitcoin blockchain during the past month suggests that the largest cryptocurrency may be about to enter a new phase. However, according to analysts, it needs to increase its accessibility and security to be the biggest. More than 260,000 of them have been developed so far. The latest non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from Bitcoin, known as Ordinals, continue to stir up a lot of excitement, hype, and speculative activity. How much of an effect will they have on the price of Bitcoin though? Let see explore the relationship between NFT and Bitcoin\n\nAccording to one viewpoint, Ordinals might be the key to revealing hidden Bitcoin valuation. Nevertheless, from another viewpoint, Ordinals might significantly detract from Bitcoin\u2019s primary goal of developing into a new type of digital currency. In the worst case, Ordinals might deter institutional investors from investing in Bitcoin and entice unwanted regulatory inspection. In other words, there could be money to be earned here, which will encourage more businesspeople and inventors to grow the market for Bitcoin NFTs. Some estimates place the current year value of the NFT market at close to $20 billion, with Ethereum now accounting for the lion\u2019s share of that sum.\n\nIn comparison to other markets where Bitcoin is making an impact, the NFT market\u2019s current size is tiny. The worldwide remittances business, where Bitcoin is becoming more and more significant, is still one-sixth the size of the NFT market, even if you take the optimistic view of things and estimate the NFT sector is worth $20 billion.\n\nIt is assessed in trillions of dollars, not billions, how valuable other markets are than those where Bitcoin is gaining market share. For instance, some investors consider Bitcoin to be a type of \u201cstore of wealth.\u201d Also, the physical gold reserves around the world are worth about $12 trillion.\n\nHow would NFT and Crypto Integrate?\n\nThe planned Web3 would include both NFTs and cryptocurrencies, which are important components of the metaverse. Users cannot trade one NFT for another, unlike bitcoin. However, consumers who interact with one might also utilize the other.\n\nA user needs a cryptocurrency wallet that is typically used for cryptocurrencies to buy non-fungible tokens. Platforms also save NFT keys here as evidence that they are the rightful proprietors of an NFT collection. Users keep their cryptocurrency wallets secure and secret, just like an offline wallet. Even though many NFTs can only be bought using cryptocurrencies, there are frequently possibilities for people who want to use their local money and credit cards.\n\nThe Risk Associated Association of NFT and Crypto\n\nWorking with NFTs and cryptocurrencies carries some risks, much like trading stocks or making investments.\n\nDue to various sponsorships, influencers may recommend non-fungible tokens, alternative coins, or other cryptocurrencies to their followers. As a result, young people may lose their own money if they don\u2019t understand the source of the influencer\u2019s income.\n\nIndividuals might encounter information from influencers pushing cryptocurrency or selling NFTs on social media that highlights the potential for investments to rise, but they might not comprehend the reasons for this. For instance, the influencer can be promoting a course which is how they primarily generate income. Or perhaps they have a sponsorship and a platform to advertise. In that regard, they don\u2019t profit significantly from NFTs or cryptocurrencies.\n\nHigh-risk investments include NFTs and, particularly, cryptocurrencies. The purchase and sell rates change often, just like the stock market. This implies that a young person who invests a lot of money in cryptocurrency risks losing all or the majority of it.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Everything you need to know about Hard Fork (Bitcoin) - ClearTax",
        "content": "The 2004 iteration (codenamed San Andreas) of the popular video game franchise Grand Theft Auto offered a perfect blend of open-world exploration, humour and action. However, it found particular favour among developers. The numerous modifications to the game enabled gamers to drive fast cars or real-life cosplay characters.\n\nForking in cryptocurrency is synonymous with video game mods. It implies alterations in the basic crypto protocol whose acceptance depends on the platform\u2019s stability.\n\nWhat Is A Hard Fork?\n\nSynonymous with the modifications in video games, forking is essentially an alteration in the crypto transaction chain. These splits create newer crypto versions and are possible because of the decentralised nature of transactions.\n\nForks can be soft or hard, depending on the impact it creates on the online community. Soft forks are flexible and allow users to use the forked and un-forked versions interchangeably.\n\nIn comparison, hard forks are rigid and behave as individual units that are not interchangeable. The 2017 Bitcoin hard fork gave rise to Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold. They work independently, and unlike original Bitcoins, they comprise 8 MB blocks instead of 1 MB.\n\nWhat Are The Types Of Bitcoin Hard Forks?\n\nBitcoin Hard forks are irreversible changes derived from the original BTC blocks. The BTC community has witnessed numerous hard forks aiming to create a dent in the blockchain. Some popular BTC hard forks include:\n\nBTC XT : With a capacity to perform up to 24 transactions per second, BTC XT was one of the first prominent hard forks. With a block size of 8 MB, BTC XT initially witnessed great success with over 1,000 nodes within six months. However, eventually, users lost interest in the project, and it soon ended operations.\n\nBTC Classic : The demand for larger block sizes gave rise to Bitcoin Classic in 2016. Unlike BTC XT, BTC Classic utilises 2 MB per block. Although some developers support BTC Classic wholeheartedly, its importance has steadily declined.\n\nSegregated Witness : Initially launched as a soft fork, Core developer Pieter Wuille introduced SegWit in 2015. It aims to make room for more transactions by reducing the size of individual transactions. However, it simply served the purpose of promoting a hard fork.\n\nBTC Cash Hard Fork : The BTC community realised the need to deal with the occasional snags and delayed transactions faced while dealing with BTC. After a series of soft forks aimed to improve usability, the 2017 hard fork gave rise to BTC Cash. Unlike regular BTC, BTC Cash uses 8 MB blocks, thus making it more scalable and improving the user experience. Its split from the normal BTCalso indicates that it rejects BTC transactions and blocks.\n\nBTC Gold Hard Fork: To make Bitcoin mining more scalable and equal, developers introduced BTC Gold. Unlike regular BTC, it requires basic equipment, and users can mine it on standard graphics processors instead of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Gold forking enabled further decentralisation and experimentation devoid of quality compromise.\n\nOther BTC Hard forks: BTC has undergone numerous other experiments in the form of hard forks, which include\n\nBitcoin Diamond\n\nSuper Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Atom\n\nBitcore\n\nBitcoin God\n\nBitcoin Private\n\nBitcoin Zeo\n\nBitcoin Post-Quantum\n\nWhy Do Hard Forks Happen?\n\nIn simple terms, hard forks are essential upgrades that can transform the blockchain and improve its network. When these upgrades undergo these irreversible changes, they split into two versions: the original blockchain and the upgraded one.\n\nHard forks can happen when developers try to improve the functionality, debug potential errors or resolve a disagreement within the crypto network. When developers tweak the network functionality, they usually allow those not in consensus initially to re-join.\n\nHard forks can also happen accidentally, although they are easily resolvable due to a lack of consensus. Accidental hard forks can occur when two miners work on the same block instantaneously until another miner mines the subsequent block.\n\nForks of other blocks or networks are eventually abandoned because of a lack of consensus. This makes the actual block longer and the more profitable one to invest in.\n\nEffects Of Hard Forks On The Crypto Landscape\n\nThe crypto landscape is primarily favoured for its decentralised and transparent structure. Any substantial changes are visible online in the premise of hard forks and their effect on the crypto community.\n\nThree ways in which hard forks can affect miners and users alike are as below:\n\nAlthough the transparent nature of Bitcoins makes it easy for anyone to inspect and tweak, it may pose difficulties in reaching a consensus to resolve issues. For example, BTC Cash resulted from non-consensus arising out of diversity in perspectives. It is crucial to note that hard forks often cause temporary price volatility.\n\nSince anyone can create a BTC by tweaking the blockchain network, each form of cryptocurrency can have several versions resulting from a hard fork. BTC alone has more than 27 different versions, all existing autonomously.\n\nHard forks represent the diversity and the entire network of BTC or other cryptocurrencies. It promotes empowerment for participants from around the globe, allowing them to research and bring in relevant changes. However, differences in perspective can also cause chaos and potential instability. Such a situation also helps manifest innovation and omits negativity.\n\nH22ard Fork vs Soft Fork\n\nThere are certain inherent differences between Hard Forks and Soft Forks, which are as below:\n\nHard Fork Soft Fork When the underlying source code of a blockchain undergoes irreversible changes, thereby changing its security parameters or adding a particular feature. Soft forks are code changes that can add features and functions without altering the source code and are useful for introducing new features at the programming level. Hard fork nodes in the underlying blockchain will stop processing the blocks in the older network when a blockchain rule is reformed. Soft forks result in a single split, thereby retaining the original blockchain. Soft forks are thus backward node compatible. Hard forks preserve the privacy and security definitions of a blockchain, although that requires a lot of electricity and computing power. Soft forks do not cause any volatility or changes in the security code, thereby saving additional power consumption.\n\nNot all modifications introduced in GTA-SA were widely accepted. The successful ones paved the way for necessary updates in the newer GTA V.\n\nLikewise, hard forks are those changes that actually affect the blockchain and create a new version. The growing popularity and magnetic appeal of investing in BTC require implementing updates. These would stabilise the blockchain network over time."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is still in the grips of bearish headwinds that have seen it struggle to retain the $1 trillion threshold, and its representative digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC), is no exception. However, its historical movements have suggested this could be an opportunity to buy BTC before the price increases.\n\nTaking into consideration the previous significant ups and downs for Bitcoin, as well as the activities in between, the flagship digital asset has been demonstrating a steady pattern of ideal times for decision-making in crypto trading strategies \u2013 buy, hodl, and sell \u2013 as observed by the pseudonymous crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards on March 7.\n\nIn line with these observations, the current bearish moment seems to be a good time to buy Bitcoin before its price begins another bullish movement upwards, at which point the better strategy would be to hodl and then sell when the price peaks, as indicated on the chart which ranges back to 2013.\n\nBitcoin historical patterns. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs noted by crypto expert Ali Martinez, Bitcoin\u2019s current price was below a critical area of support between $23,050 and $23,730, where 1.63 million addresses purchased more than 910,000 BTC. According to him, if Bitcoin failed to regain this zone as support, it could trigger a sell-off that could push BTC down to $20,700 or even as low as $19,300.\n\nBitcoin in/out of money around price. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $22,406, representing a marginal decline of 0.05% over the last 24 hours, in addition to the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset losing 4.73% across the week and 4% over the previous 30 days, as the charts indicate.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThat said, Bitcoin\u2019s further movements will depend on a range of factors, including directly related events such as the announced release of a Bitcoin debit card by Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and crypto exchange Bybit, as well as the sentiment in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape, which continues to await for the next major development that will influence the market\u2019s direction.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "For some time now, the value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar.\n\nFocus on the value trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSince November last year, the two trends have been proceeding almost in unison.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe market value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days is rather flat and monotonous.\n\nIn fact, it has been doing nothing but lateralizing within a very compressed range between $22,200 and $22,500 now since Friday 3 March, with only a few brief excursions just above or just below.\n\nIt is as if after the sudden drop from $23,400 to $22,400 last Friday the price has stabilized.\n\nIn fact, that drop was only the latest in a series that began on 21 February, after failing for the fourth time to break the $25,000 mark.\n\nSomething similar had already happened in early February to Bitcoin, after it failed its fourth attempt to break above $24,000 on Thursday 2 March.\n\nThen between late January and early February it tried four times to move steadily above $24,000 without succeeding, at which point it began to fall, stopping eight days later around $21,600.\n\nThereafter, it later lateralized around that figure for four days, only to suddenly break down that wall and head straight for $25,000 on 15 February.\n\nAt that point, it seems to have begun a phase similar to the one that just ended, but at levels $1,000 higher.\n\nIn fact, it tried four times to break above $25,000, only to start falling on 21 February.\n\nThe descent lasted ten days, instead of the eight days of the previous medium-short-term cycle, and it has now been sideways in the very narrow range of $22,200 to $22,500 for four days.\n\nShould it manage to return above $24,000 within a couple of days, or even break through the $25,000 wall, the medium-short-term cycle would have replicated itself in almost the same way.\n\nIt is worth noting that $25,000 seems a much more difficult resistance to break through than $24,000.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe trend in the market value of Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar, although at different levels.\n\nIt was again on Friday 3 March that the price of ETH fell to $1,560, and since then it has continued to lateralize within a very compressed range between $1,560 and $1,580.\n\nThis trend seems identical to that of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPreviously, while Bitcoin tried unsuccessfully four times to move steadily above $25,000, Ethereum tried unsuccessfully to move above $1,700, although for three days, from 17 to 19 February included, it seemed to have succeeded.\n\nThe decline began on 21 February, at the same time as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIn contrast, between late January and early February, when Bitcoin was trying four times to exceed $24,000, Ethereum\u2019s price had remained almost consistently above $1,600.\n\nFrom this difference it seems to emerge that at this stage Ethereum\u2019s price trend is influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s, and not vice versa.\n\nIt is worth noting that another difference concerns percentage movements.\n\nFor example, after the four failed attempts to get back above $24,000, BTC then lost 11% in eight days, while ETH lost 13% in five days.\n\nAnd after the failure of the fourth attempt to get above $25,000, BTC lost 11% again, while ETH lost 9%, this time both in ten days.\n\nThe comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum: value trend, regulation and market\n\nThus what seems to be dragging the trend of Ethereum\u2019s market value during this period is the trend of Bitcoin\u2019s market value, with small differences that make it clear how the two trends actually move independently, but with the latter heavily influencing the former.\n\nExtending the comparison to the whole of 2023 shows that Bitcoin since late 2022 has gained 34%, while ETH has gained 30%. And extending it to November 2021, when all-time highs were touched, BTC loses 67% while ETH 68%.\n\nThus, there are more differences in this early 2023 in favor of Bitcoin than there have been since the highs were touched.\n\nSpecifically, in the past 30 days, Bitcoin\u2019s price has lost 3.5% while Ethereum\u2019s has lost 5%.\n\nIt is possible that this difference is affected by the words of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently, whereby he suggests that only Bitcoin is a commodity, while Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, should actually be considered securities."
