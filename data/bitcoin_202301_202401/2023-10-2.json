        "title": "Ian Freeman of \u2018Crypto Six' sentenced to 8 years in NH bitcoin case - NBC Boston",
        "content": "A federal judge on Monday sentenced a New Hampshire man to eight years in prison for running an unlicensed bitcoin exchange business and fined him at least $40,000, although a hearing will be held to determine how much money multiple people who said they were victimized by his enterprise will get.\n\nIan Freeman, whose story was the subject of an episode of an NBC10 Boston docuseries titled \"The Crypto Six,\" was taken away in handcuffs following his sentencing in U.S. District Court in Concord. Prosecutors said Freeman, a libertarian activist and radio show host, created a business that catered to fraudsters who targeted elderly women with romance scams, serving as \u201cthe final step in permanently separating the victims from their money.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you, Ian,\u201d supporters shouted as he was led out of court.\n\nFreeman, who is in his 40s, said in court he did not believe he broke the law. He said he was trying to get people to adopt bitcoin. He said there were times he detected fraud and protected many potential scam victims. He apologized for not being able to help them all.\n\nGet Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston\u2019s newsletters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to be taken advantage of,\u201d said Freeman, who said he cooperated with law enforcement to help some people get their money back.\n\nFreeman said he devised a series of questions for customers, including whether a third party was putting them up to their transactions or if they were under duress. Some victims lied about their circumstances, he said. Freeman also said he didn\u2019t learn about scam victims until he saw their stories in the news.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how strict I was or how many questions I asked,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a two-week trial, he was convicted of eight charges in December, although his conviction on a money laundering charge was later overturned by the judge. The prosecution is appealing it to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nFreeman was sentenced on the remaining charges, which include operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. Freeman\u2019s lawyers said they planned to appeal and asked that he remain free on bail for now, but U.S. District Court Judge Joseph LaPlante didn\u2019t allow it.\n\n\u201cThere was real harm caused by his conduct,\u201d LaPlante said.\n\nThe sentencing guidelines called for much longer term, ranging from about 17 years to nearly 22 years in prison. Freeman, who doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record and has been monitored by the government for at least the last two years in Keene, where he lives, had asked for a sentence of a little over three years in prison.\n\nHis wife, Bonnie Freeman, said he was a positive role model and leader at a local church. Sheriff David Hathaway of Santa Cruz County, Arizona, described Freeman as an \u201cadvocate for freedom and the American dream\u201d and \u201cpromoting free trade capitalism and individual liberty.\u201d\n\nIt starts with an early morning raid by the FBI all caught on camera as the federal government cracked down on the group later dubbed \u201cThe Crypto Six.\u201d In this episode we breakdown the federal case against some Free Staters who were charged with wire fraud and money laundering but with a new twist\u2026 using cryptocurrency. Three members of the Crypto Six speak out about their federal indictment, including Ian Freeman, host of the talk show \u201cFree Talk Live\u201d, Aria DiMezzo, the high priestess of the Reformed Satanic Church of Keene and Nobody, the former Pope Indigent of the Church of the Invisible Hand.\n\nThe transactions were handled at bitcoin kiosks in bars, online and through an app.\n\nLast month, one of the victims described herself as a lonely widow who got scammed by a man she met on a dating site. At his instruction, she sent $300,000 to Freeman, wiping out her life\u2019s savings. Another woman told a similar story of taking out three loans and selling her late husband\u2019s truck to send money to the man who duped her.\n\nFive other people were arrested with Freeman in 2021. Three pleaded guilty to wire fraud for opening accounts at financial institutions in their names or in the names of churches to allow someone to use the accounts to sell virtual currency. They received light sentences. A fourth pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Charges were dismissed against the fifth person."

        "content": "\"So, you're looking at the ending of the Wild West period of crypto. Is that kind of what we're talking about?\" This question, posed by Kevin O'Leary during a recent discussion at Benzinga's Crypto Unlocked event, set the stage for a candid conversation about the future of cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Yes. And it's a good thing. Listen, I'm an investor. I want to see Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) at a hundred thousand dollars. It's never going to get there, ever, if it's never going to be owned by institutions. It's never going to be owned by institutions where the next crypto exchange gets sued every week. It's over. It's over. That's got to stop. And we've got to figure it out,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThe Shark Tank star and financial expert elaborated on the crucial need for institutional investment to drive the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to new heights. \"If we want institutions to get a 1% to 3% allocation so that you can start to see capital appreciation on crypto assets, we're going to need real money. We can't do it with the crypto community. It's too small. There's a fraction. It's a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the world financial system.\"\n\n\"We've got to open it up, and we've got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters, and you know, that's over. It's just over. And it's boring too. I'm sick of it,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nThe discussion, which took place ahead of Benzinga's upcoming conference in New York on Nov. 13, brought to light the challenges and opportunities facing the crypto space. O'Leary's candid remarks underscore the need for a regulatory framework that encourages institutional investment while mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities in the crypto space.\n\nO'Leary is slated to be a keynote speaker at Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards, where attendees can use the code BZFINTECH to receive a 20% discount on their ticket purchase.

        "title": "Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "\u201cHalving\u201d is an automatic event that occurs every four years on the bitcoin blockchain. Not only is halving a massive technical happening that serves as an anti-inflationary model for bitcoin, but it is also of considerable interest to investors: for all past halvings (in 2012, 2016, and 2020) were followed by massive bull runs that propelled the value of BTC to historic highs.\n\nThe fourth halving event is expected to happen in April or May 2024 \u2014 and the future may look different from the past. What are the implications for the price of BTC? Can we expect another historic bull run in crypto? What is the optimal investment strategy for investors during a halving event?\n\nIn this article, we explore the answers to all these questions \u2014 and more \u2014 in our in-depth analysis of BTC halving events in the run-up to 2024.\n\nBitcoin, Halving, and Scarcity on the Blockchain\n\nOne of the key features of bitcoin is a mechanism of forced scarcity. The reasoning is that for something to hold value, it must be finite and scarce. Consequently, the main feature of bitcoin is a limited supply \u2013 only 21 million BTC will ever be created.\n\nNew bitcoins are issued through a complex cryptographic process called mining, a complex and computationally (and financially) demanding process whereby transaction validators compete for the potential to earn returns in the form of bitcoin.\n\nThe blockchain forces a system of diminishing returns to control the supply of bitcoin \u2013 miner rewards reduce by half every four years, or roughly the time it takes to add 210,000 blocks to the blockchain. Hence, bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d events.\n\nThis system helps ensure that bitcoin does not suffer from the same inflationary tendencies plaguing fiat currencies by controlling the currency flow and reducing the returns from mining. Hence, the timeline for bitcoin production extends out for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe History of Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nBitcoin was born on January 3, 2009, with the mining of \u201cBlock 0\u201d \u2013 the \u201cGenesis Block\u201d \u2013 of the bitcoin blockchain. The genesis bitcoin miner was Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of the blockchain.\n\nInitially, miners were awarded 50 BTC for adding a block to the network. Satoshi Nakamoto accumulated nearly 1.1 million BTC as mining rewards in this period. As the blockchain became more popular, other miners entered the space.\n\nHistorically, bitcoin users can be broadly divided into four overlapping categories \u2013 early investors/blockchain evangelists, tech enthusiasts, retail users, and big institutional investors.\n\nIn the pre-halving era, bitcoin was mainly traded among its original investors and enthusiastic early adopters. The new cryptocurrency was virtually worthless at this stage. In July 2010, bitcoin first started trading at $0.08.\n\nBy 2011, the launch of the first bitcoin exchanges brought new users to the ecosystem, driving the price above $1 for the first time. The same year, bitcoin surged to $31 before suffering a 99% crash in value due to security breaches and hacks.\n\nFirst BTC Halving (2012)\n\nThe first halving of BTC occurred on November 28, 2012, with the writing of block 210,000 to the network. The mining rewards were halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The inflation rate, which was 50% the previous year, was reduced to just 12% after the halving.\n\nBitcoin was in a steady recovery phase in 2012. After crashing to $0.01 in June 2011, the crypto slowly clawed back to $12 by November 2012. Since the 2012 halving was the first-ever event of its kind, it didn\u2019t have the same level of anticipation as the later events.\n\nThe vast majority of users didn't know what to expect. And bitcoin had not evolved into a speculative investment asset at this point. So, the halving did not immediately impact the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe closing price for BTC on December 31, 2012, was $13.45. However, everything changed in the new year \u2013 by April 2013, the price rose to $250 before facing a 50% correction. Further price consolidation and another massive rally drove the price to $1,100.\n\nHowever, we cannot entirely attribute those later gains to the halving. It was later revealed that the price manipulation by a single individual using bot accounts at the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange may have significantly pushed the price of BTC above $1000.\n\nStill, 2013 proved to be a landmark year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, catching the attention of mainstream media and investors in a big way. The first halving did play a significant role in the price history of BTC.\n\nSecond BTC Halving (2016)\n\nDriven by memories of 2012 \u2013 2013, expectations were relatively high in the crypto community in the build-up to the 2016 halving event. The stature of bitcoin has also changed drastically since 2012, attracting more speculative investors.\n\nThe 2016 event occurred on 9th July and reduced mining rewards from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Inflation was reduced from 12% in 2012 to around 5% post-halving in 2016.\n\nBTC started that year at $434. The price started increasing noticeably a few months before the halving. It peaked at $735 on June 21 before undergoing a minor correction and eventually settling at $663 on the day of the halving.\n\nOver the next three months, there were minor corrections and recoveries in the price of bitcoin. The next big rally began in October and propelled BTC to $975 in the final week of December 2016. This bullish trend pushed bitcoin above $1,000 in the first week of January.\n\nBy September 2017, bitcoin had breached the $5,000 mark for the first time. After a significant correction, the crypto continued its upward trajectory, reaching an all-time high of $19,783 in December.\n\nYet again, experts cited market manipulation as a significant factor behind the massive bitcoin rallies in 2017. This time, researchers alleged that individuals used the stablecoin Tether to create price support for bitcoin during bear runs in a coordinated strategy.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that investor frenzy also played a big part in the bitcoin bull run of 2017. And the ultimate catalyst for this series of events was the second BTC halving of 2016.\n\nThird BTC Halving (2020)\n\nAfter the historic gains in 2017, expectations ran high for the third BTC halving. However, the COVID-19 outbreak crashed the price of BTC in March 2020, complicating matters.\n\nThe halving event occurred on 11th May, reducing block rewards to just 6.25BTC. Inflation in BTC was also pushed down further to under 2%.\n\nBTC had a strong Q1 in 2020, starting at around $7,200 in January before reaching $10,000 in mid-February. This was followed by a pandemic-induced collapse in March-April, driving prices below $6,800.\n\nHowever, bitcoin recovered to $9,900 by May 9, attributed to rising excitement about the upcoming event. The third halving event further decreased the inflation levels in bitcoin, driving it even below gold.\n\nHowever, the collapse of traditional markets in the latter half of 2020 pushed bitcoin to new heights. From $9,000 before the halving, the value of BTC soared to $28,000 by the end of the year, driven by a massive increase in the inflow of investor money.\n\nIn hindsight, COVID-19 was both a blessing and a curse for bitcoin in 2020. After triggering an initial collapse, the pandemic soon facilitated capital inflows into crypto. It played a significant role in elevating bitcoin to the rank of a bonafide investment option in the mainstream.\n\nUpcoming Fourth Halving (2024)\n\nThe fourth halving of bitcoin is expected towards the end of April or early May 2024, with a tentative date of April 25. Since we cannot accurately predict the speed at which blocks are mined, the actual timing of the event can vary.\n\nPotential Impacts and Speculation\n\nOnce miners add block number 840,000 to the blockchain, the mining rewards will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. A likely reduction in the annual inflation rate of Bitcoin from 1.8% to 0.9% due to the decrease in supply will likely follow.\n\nThese are the intended outcomes of the halving event \u2013 why Satoshi Nakamoto chose to design the system as it exists today. However, with each successive event, the actual direct impact of the halving has a smaller footprint on BTC prices.\n\nSince more than 92% of BTC has already been mined, the supply shock from the halving will be relatively low. The volatility will be driven mainly by investor sentiment, particularly outsiders, due to FOMO and speculators looking for short-term gains.\n\nThe main impact will be keenly felt in the mining arena, where lower rewards and high costs potentially trigger an exit of nearly 30% of the total operations. The overall impact of this development on network security remains to be seen.\n\nWhat Should Investors Look for After a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nUnder the existing protocol, bitcoin will undergo 33 halving events between 2012 and 2140. Although a sample size of 3 events is small in the grand scheme, we can still identify several patterns from these past halving events.\n\nChanges in Miner Trends and Behaviors\n\nFor miners, each halving event doubles the production costs per BTC earned. However, until now, this was offset by the massive increases in bitcoin price that followed after each halving event.\n\nThe hash rate is an important metric that shows the total processing power committed to securing the blockchain by miners. A higher hash rate indicates the presence of more mining equipment and, possibly, more miners.\n\nAccording to the hash rate chart for BTC, there has been a constant increase in mining operations since the second halving event in 2016. Although the market crash drove down the price of BTC in 2022, the mining curve is still relentlessly going up.\n\nThis has grave implications for miners in 2024. As of 2023, the average BTC cost is around $15,000. After the halving, this will double to $30,000. Unless the price of BTC surges back to pre-2022 levels, many mining operations could shut down in 2024.\n\nProfitability concerns have already been affecting many bitcoin mining companies since 2022 due to rising energy costs and a fall in the value of bitcoin. With the halving of rewards to 3.125BTC, experts estimate that 15% to 30% of mining operations will stop in 2024.\n\nMiners are investing heavily in equipment upgrades in 2023. The newer mining rigs can improve energy efficiency by up to 25%. Miners not investing in better ASICs may see their profits dwindle to zero after the 2024 halving.\n\nHalving events also have severe implications for network security. The network may become more vulnerable to 51% attacks if the hash rate falls significantly. However, given the sheer size of the BTC blockchain, it would take a massive fall-off in miner activity to make the system dangerously insecure.\n\nShifts in Market Sentiment and Investor Reaction\n\nIt is much harder to gauge the potential impact of halving events on bitcoin market sentiment. There are far too many variables at play. For instance, in 2020, the unprecedented pandemic played a pivotal role in bringing liquidity to the crypto markets.\n\nHowever, we can analyze past market sentiment and investor reaction. The run-up to a halving event has been accompanied by rising excitement, minor volatility, and relatively smaller bull runs in BTC.\n\nIn all previous instances, the actual event was followed by minor corrections. Major rallies have occurred after a few months, often driven by investor excitement and a lower supply of BTC.\n\nAs outlined in the graphs below, the typical aftermath of a halving event has looked something like this:\n\nAn initial bull run that lasts for anywhere from 365 days to 540 days.\n\nA bearish correction lasting close to 400 days.\n\nA sideways run until the next halving, lasting around 450 to 500 days.\n\nSource: Breakdown of BTC's Price Performance After Previous Halvings, Will History Repeat? (cryptopotato.com)\n\nA cursory glance at the halving data also shows that the impact of each successive halving event on BTC prices may be weakening. Over 92% of the total supply of bitcoin has already been mined by now. With most of the coins already in circulation, future reductions in supply will have a lower impact on the price of BTC.\n\nMuch of the volatility will come from investor sentiments in 2024. Here, a distinction can be made between the reactions of the various communities of bitcoin investors:\n\nThe HODLers : Long-term BTC enthusiasts and early adopters will play a small role in the market. The standard playbook for them is to keep HODLing no matter what \u2013 seasoned investors typically make purchases during market downtrends like the ones in 2022.\n\n: Long-term BTC enthusiasts and early adopters will play a small role in the market. The standard playbook for them is to keep HODLing no matter what \u2013 seasoned investors typically make purchases during market downtrends like the ones in 2022. The Speculators/Newcomers : Fear of missing out (FOMO) also plays a huge role in the crypto markets. As media coverage of the halving increases, there could be an influx of new investors into crypto. Speculators who only care about short-term gains will also become more active and add to the overall volatility.\n\n: Fear of missing out (FOMO) also plays a huge role in the crypto markets. As media coverage of the halving increases, there could be an influx of new investors into crypto. Speculators who only care about short-term gains will also become more active and add to the overall volatility. Institutional Investors: Whales, financial institutions, private companies, and even governments hold bitcoins worth billions of dollars in 2023. The actions of these investors are driven mainly by factors including interest rates, the performance of traditional markets, and other economic/political factors and are much harder to predict.\n\nHow Can Investors Prepare for Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThere are better times for serious investors to make any moves in the market than a bitcoin halving event. Most investors and HODLers try to accumulate BTC at favorable rates before the halving event.\n\nThis allows you to avoid market volatility and increase the chance of high returns. \"Buy low and HODL\" remains our preferred strategy for BTC in 2023. The optimal accumulation period is usually between the market bottom (the most recent event was in 2022) and the next halving \u2013 an average of around 500 days.\n\nBased on historical data, the best time to move into BTC has been 900 to 1000 days (just short of 3 years) after a halving event. That is the typical time the market ends its bull and bear runs, leaving BTC at historic lows as panicked short-term investors try to offload their holdings.\n\nWhile halving events can generate massive levels of hype, it is crucial to keep perspective \u2013 with each cycle, the impact of halving on BTC prices has decreased. Investor sentiments and external events have primarily driven the volatility after halving.\n\nIn 2023-24, the cryptocurrency markets face unprecedented pressure from external factors like energy prices, rampant inflation in traditional markets, and regulatory pressure from governments worldwide, especially the United States.\n\nUnder the circumstances, our strategy is to avoid getting caught up in the trading frenzy in the immediate run-up and aftermath of a halving. We believe investors preparing well in advance are more likely to see gains.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nHalving remains a pivotal event in the evolving story of bitcoin\u2013and will remain that way for the foreseeable future. However, its actual impact on the price and supply of BTC is trending downward with each event. External factors like interest rates, regulatory developments, and energy costs have a far more significant impact.\n\nThe main impact of the halving is more psychological these days \u2013 massive gains recorded during the previous cycles generate hope and FOMO in the minds of many investors. Although gains made by BTC after halving have steadily declined over the cycles, we can never rule out another massive bull run.\n\nWhether you are investing in traditional assets or crypto, it is vital to maintain a balanced portfolio for optimal returns and risk mitigation.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price gained 6% from Oct. 1 to Oct. 2, but after failing to break the $28,500 resistance, the price dropped by 4.5% on the same day. This decline happened because of the disappointing performance of Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were launched on Oct. 2 and concerns about an upcoming economic downturn.\n\nBitcoin price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nThis correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price on Oct. 3 marks 47 days since Bitcoin last closed above $28,000 and has led to the liquidation of $22 million worth of long-leverage futures contracts. But before discussing the events affecting Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, let\u2019s attempt to understand how the traditional finance industry has affected investor confidence.\n\nOverheated U.S. economy could lead to more Fed action\n\nInvestors have heightened their expectations of further contractionary measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve following the release of the latest U.S. labor market data on Oct. 3, revealing that there were 9.6 million job openings at the end of August, up from 8.9 million in July.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell indicated during a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in August that \u201cevidence suggesting that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could necessitate a monetary policy response.\u201d\n\nConsequently, traders are now pricing in a 30% chance that the Fed will raise rates at their November meeting, compared to 16% in the previous week, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nThe Ether futures ETFs launch falls short\n\nOn Oct. 2, the market welcomed nine new ETF products expressly designed to mirror the performance of futures contracts linked to Ether. However, these products saw trading volumes of under $2 million during the first trading day, as of midday Eastern Time. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the trading volumes fell short of expectations.\n\nEthereum futures-based ETF volumes on Oct. 2, USD. Source: K33 Research/@VetleLunde\n\nOn the debut day, the trading volume for Ether ETFs significantly lagged behind the remarkable $1-billion launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. It\u2019s worth noting that the Bitcoin futures-linked ETF was introduced in October 2021 during a flourishing cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis occurrence may have dampened investors\u2019 outlook on the potential inflow after an eventual Bitcoin spot ETF. Still, there remains uncertainty surrounding the probability and timing of these approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRegulatory pressure mounts as Binance faces a class-action lawsuit\n\nOn Oct. 2, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Binance.US and Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao in the District Court of Northern California. The lawsuit alleges unfair competition aimed at monopolizing the cryptocurrency market by harming its competitor, the now-defunct exchange FTX.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that CZ\u2019s statements on social media were false and misleading, particularly since Binance had previously sold its FTX Token (FTT) holdings before the announcement on Nov. 6, 2022. The lawsuit asserts that CZ\u2019s intention was to drive down the price of FTT.\n\nThe criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried will begin on Oct. 4 in New York. Despite CZ\u2019s denial of unfair competition allegations, speculation within the crypto community continues to circulate regarding this matter.\n\nBTC\u2019s correlation to traditional markets seems higher than anticipated\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price decline on Oct. 3 appears to reflect concerns about an impending economic downturn and the potential Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy response. Furthermore, it demonstrated how closely cryptocurrency markets are tied to macroeconomic factors.\n\nExaggerated expectations for the cryptocurrency ETFs also signal that the $28,000 level might not be the consensus for investors, given the regulatory pressures and legal challenges, such as the class-action lawsuit against Binance, which underscore the ongoing risks in the space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Over the past 12 months, some investors learned the hard way why they needed to move their crypto offline. Those who kept Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins on crypto exchanges like FTX lost control of their assets, sometimes forever. Events drew a red line under the storied crypto adage: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nFTX\u2019s loss was hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger\u2019s gain, however. The Bahamas-based exchange\u2019s November 2022 bankruptcy filing delivered to Ledger \u201cour biggest sales day ever,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief experience officer, Ian Rogers, told Cointelegraph, and \u201cNovember turned out to be our biggest sales month on record.\u201d\n\nParis-based Ledger has been on a strong growth curve recently, though the past year has not been without controversy. In May, for instance, the firm drew industry ire when it launched a new secret recovery phrase storage service called Ledger Recover. Still, it remains one of the best-known and most-used crypto wallet makers in the world.\n\nCointelegraph recently caught up with Rogers and Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier in New York City to discuss the new crypto climate in the United States, the latest trends in crypto storage and differences in doing business in the U.S. and Europe, among other topics.\n\nCointelegraph: Many think that the crypto/blockchain sector is still in the doldrums or moving sideways at best, but you see reasons to be cheerful even here in the U.S.?\n\nPascal Gauthier: What happened in 2023 \u2014 and went virtually unnoticed \u2014 is a change of tone regarding Bitcoin. When the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] implied that Bitcoin was a utility and/or commodity \u2014 and not a security [like other altcoins] \u2014 this triggered two things: large companies like BlackRock began their ETF [exchange-traded fund] application process, and then the media narrative around Bitcoin changed almost overnight.\n\nAs 2023 began, Bitcoin was for drug dealers, terrorists, bad for the planet, etc. \u2014 and suddenly it became completely kosher. The biggest financial institutions in the U.S. are suddenly doing Bitcoin.\n\nCT: The BlackRock application for a spot-market Bitcoin ETF was a turning point?\n\nPG: Big money is coming into crypto; it\u2019s been announced. It may take a few years to really finally arrive, but if you look at Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard\u2026\n\nCT: What about U.S. regulations? Aren\u2019t they still a barrier?\n\nPG: The next administration will decide the fate of crypto in the United States. If Biden stays in power, this administration could continue to be aggressive toward crypto. If it\u2019s someone else, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nCT: Let\u2019s talk about offline storage devices. Mark Cuban said in 2022 that crypto wallets were \u201cawful.\u201d Did he have a point?\n\nPG: A lot of our early customers used our [cold wallet] product to \u201cbuy and hold.\u201d You would purchase a Ledger [device], you put your Bitcoin in it, and then you put it someplace and forget about it. But that\u2019s not what we recommend now.\n\nRecent: AI a powerful tool for devs to change gaming, says former Google gaming head\n\nToday, you can connect your wallet to Web3 and use your private keys to do many things, including buying, selling, swapping and staking crypto, as well as engaging with DApps [decentralized applications] and even declaring your taxes.\n\nCT: On a 1 to 10 scale, where would you put cold wallets today in terms of user experience (UX)?\n\nPG: For the industry, it\u2019s a three. For Ledger, maybe a four \u2014 and we\u2019re striving to be a 10. The industry has a lot to do in terms of UX and UI [user interface].\n\nIan Rogers: Your hardware-software combo today is not just about hardware and software. It\u2019s an end-to-end experience.\n\nWhen you\u2019re buying an Apple iPhone, for instance, you\u2019re not buying a piece of hardware; you\u2019re buying into the Apple experience. We would ultimately like that to be the same thing with Ledger. Our approach is to do the absolute best user experience possible without compromising on security or self-custody.\n\nCT: Still, there\u2019s these UX issues like the 24 seed words you need to recover your private key if you lose your Ledger device. Some users go to great lengths to safeguard those words, even engraving them in steel just in case their house burns down. Doesn\u2019t that sound sort of extreme?\n\nPG: It is a little backwards to have something like a metal plate in your home. It\u2019s not very 21st century. But we came up with a solution for this.\n\nGauthier (center) speaking at the Viva Technology conference. Source: X\n\nWhen you use a Ledger product, you end up with your Ledger device and a PIN code. And you will also have those 24 words that become your master password, basically. You need to keep those 24 words safe, and this is a major barrier to entry for a lot of people. They don\u2019t trust themselves with those 24 words. They don\u2019t trust themselves not to lose them.\n\nSo, we came up with a service called Ledger Recover [i.e., an optional paid subscription service provided by Coincover that is expected to launch in October] to deal with that. It allows you to shard your private key into three encrypted shards and then send them to three different custodians. They cannot do anything with the [single] encrypted shard. Only you can bring your 24 words together again if necessary.\n\nCT: Don\u2019t we already have something like that with \u201csocial recovery,\u201d where you entrust your cold wallet recovery to several friends or \u201cguardians?\u201d\n\nPG: Social recovery doesn\u2019t really work. We\u2019ve done something that resembles social recovery \u2014 but with businesses [i.e., Ledger, Coincover and EscrowTech]. You will have to present your ID if you want to initiate the shard recovery.\n\nCT: You were criticized when you first announced the Ledger Recover service in May. Then, the launch was postponed amid the \u201cbacklash.\u201d There were security concerns. People said these three shard-holding companies could reconstruct your private key.\n\nPG: There is still a lot of education to be done for people to understand really how security works. People said [at that time] that it might be a good product if it were more transparent and easier to adopt. So we didn\u2019t go live in May, as planned, in order to make the product \u2018open source,\u2019 which adds something in terms of transparency though not security,\n\nCT: But couldn\u2019t three sub-custodial companies, at least in theory, collaborate and reconstruct your privacy key?\n\nPG: It\u2019s not possible. They don\u2019t have the necessary tools necessary to decrypt and reconstruct.\n\nCT: Moving on to Ledger\u2019s business model, do you sometimes worry that as big institutions like Fidelity Investments or banks like BNY Mellon enter the crypto space that users may simply park their crypto with them? If they get hacked, those giant custodial institutions will then make them whole again. Or at least that is sometimes the thinking.\n\nPG: We\u2019re a pure technology company. So when Fidelity decides to become a [retail] crypto custodian, they\u2019ll probably come to us and buy a part of our technology to build their own technology stack.\n\nCT: Your business strides several continents. You\u2019re based in France, but you sell many of your devices in the United States. You have first-hand experience of those two business climates \u2014 the U.S. and Europe. Are there key differences when it comes to crypto?\n\nPG: Europe has a tendency to over-regulate or regulate too fast, generally speaking. Sometimes people say, well, you know, Europe has clarity because it has MiCA [Markets in Crypto-Assets, the EU\u2019s new crypto legislation], while in the U.S., there is a lack of clarity and lots of lawsuits.\n\nBut in the U.S., the way that the law is designed is slow and bumpy. It takes time to change laws in the U.S., but when change finally does come, it\u2019s often for the better.\n\nMagazine: 6 Questions for JW Verret \u2014 the blockchain professor who\u2019s tracking the money\n\nIf you look at the biggest tech champions in the world, they're mostly American or Chinese. Zero are European.\n\nCT: Are you linking heavy regulation with a lack of innovation?\n\nPG: It\u2019s hard to say if they are directly linked, but Europe has always had a heavy hand in terms of taxation and regulation.\n\nIan Rogers: To me, there\u2019s no question they are linked. At LVMH [the French luxury goods conglomerate where Rogers served as chief digital officer for five years], we worked with a lot of startups. Every European startup wanted to get to the U.S. or China to \u201cget scale\u201d before they came back to Europe. Europe is not a good market if you\u2019re a startup.\n\nCT: But Ledger remains positive about the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology overall?\n\nPG: Things are not necessarily what they seem to be. It was our [late] French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who said: \u201cGive time for time.\u201d There\u2019s something going on now, and only the future will be able to make clear what is happening."

        "content": "A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF is looking very likely, with the world's leading crypto asset manager, Grayscale, as a possible front-runner to be approved by the SEC. In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: \"I am surprised it has taken so long. I'm not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious,\" Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n\"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy,\" Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao's opinion said, in part, \"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: \"It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared\u2026 To me it's anyone's guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto.\"\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Boost Brings Solana up 15% as Bears Lose $94 Million - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has reached its highest price in over a month, breaking the $28,000 barrier.\n\nShort liquidations on crypto-tracked futures, totaling $94M, led to a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d and contributed to the BTC rise.\n\nSolana saw significant gains, up by nearly 15%, as traders gained faith in the network.\n\nThe anticipation of ETF approvals and positive macroeconomic developments further support this bullish sentiment.\n\nFactors such as the avoidance of a US government shutdown and speculation about the Fed\u2019s rate hikes have contributed to the positive sentiment.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $28,000 barrier to reach its highest price in more than a month. Analysts cited seasonality and ETF optimism as a few factors contributing to the increases.\n\nLast week, traders at the Japanese exchange Bitbank were already keeping an eye on the $28,000 mark for Bitcoin. In the previous bull market, the $28,500 served as a significant support level. In the next weeks, it may turn into a level of resistance, making it an important price level to watch for.\n\nShort Selling Liquidations\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin and Ether prices could be attributed to short liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets. Approximately $94 million worth of bets against price increases were impacted on Sunday, leading to a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d This occurs when short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, creating excess demand and a scarcity of available stock.\n\nThe data reveals that almost 30,000 negative bets were settled, the majority of which happened on the cryptocurrency market OKX.\n\nLiquidation happens when a trader\u2019s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a loss of their initial margin. It occurs when a trader cannot fund or meet the margin requirements for their leveraged trade.\n\nSome traders attributed Sunday\u2019s advances elsewhere to past seasonality.\n\nSolana Takes the Lead in Altcoin Surge\n\nIn the last day, Ether (ETH) crossed the $1,700 mark, Bnb (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) all saw price increases. Solana\u2019s SOL tokens are the reason behind most of the gains, up almost 15%, mostly because of some traders\u2019 newfound faith in the network.\n\nSolana (SOL) has had a strong week, gaining over 25%. Open interest in Solana now stands at $321.13 million, up 2.37% from the previous session. In the last 24 hours, the long/short ratio is 0.965, with short holdings at $534.18K and long positions at $304.30K.\n\nThe SOL price may encounter probable resistance at $25 and $27. If it breaks out above these levels, it might rise to $32 in the future. A downturn, however, can resume if it fails to hold its current position, leading to potential support levels at $18 and $16.\n\nSome significant events in the Solana ecosystem provide the background to the SOL price momentum. Solana announced their merger with leading global e-commerce platform Shopify back in August 2023.\n\nThe partnership would let millions of businesses to take blockchain payments with ease by immediately integrating Solana Pay, a decentralised payment protocol, into Shopify\u2019s platform.\n\nAnalyzing the Macro Landscape\n\nSeveral events have had a positive impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price. Firstly, they discussed the looming threat of a US government shutdown . Although this risk has arisen in the past due to disagreements over government spending, it has been resolved.\n\nJust hours before a crucial midnight deadline when funding for federal agencies was due to run out, President Joe Biden signed the short-term spending package passed by Congress into law.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the Senate approved the legislation, following an unexpected shift in the House earlier in the day, where lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill to prolong government funding. This came after several days of uncertainty regarding the possibility of avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nThe second factor is the growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may have concluded its rate hikes. While this is still uncertain and has been a topic of discussion for some time, recent developments have eased some concerns. However, it\u2019s important to note that this situation remains fluid, and market sentiment can shift unexpectedly.\n\nThird factor may be the optimistic retail sales and factory output data from China last month which have rejuvenated risk sentiment in financial markets. This has paved the way for continued price increases in the leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAltcoins Downtrend on the Horizon?\n\nThe recovery has the potential to expose altcoin bears who engaged in leveraged bearish positions last month due to concerns about potential FTX creditor selling. These traders face the risk of exchanges forcing them into liquidation if the market moves against their positions, potentially resulting in a margin shortfall. The possibility of forced short liquidation is adding upward pressure on SOL\u2019s price, leading to a rally driven by a short squeeze. The most significant near-term risk is now a positive one: the covering of short positions in altcoins could lead to leveraged liquidations that boost the entire cryptocurrency market. SOL is a cryptocurrency to watch in this context.\n\nVanEck launched an official Ether futures ETF, leading to expectations of increased demand in the cryptocurrency markets. Analysts predicted a 90% chance of the ETF approval in the first week of October.\n\nThe SEC may no longer utilise justifications and continue to refuse to approve ETFs on spot Bitcoin, according to the US Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, which found Grayscale to be in the right and the SEC to be in the wrong.\n\nBecause of this, a lot of people now consider approval to be quite likely, and the market is responding accordingly.\n\nBlackRock has an ETF approval rate of more than 99%, so when news of its request in this respect broke, the price of BTC also increased past $31,500.\n\nSeptember Historically a Bad Month for Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe Federal Reserve employs interest rate increases to slow economic activity when consumer prices are high, but they can also lower the prices of investments like stocks and cryptocurrencies. As a result, financial assets as a whole have struggled.\n\nThe stock market often had a terrible month in September. According to statistics , the S&P 500 has fallen a median of 0.42% in September since 1928 and has experienced gains just 44.7% of the time.\n\nOver the past five years, Bitcoin has experienced an average monthly price decline of 8.5% in September, contrasting with increases of 7.9% in November and 11.1% in December, along with an average gain of 24.6% in October. Bitcoin\u2019s price has increased from the start to the end of September only 28.6% of the time since October 2014, with an average decline of 4.82%.\n\nSimilarly, Ether has seen an average 8.5% price decline in September over the past three years, followed by an average 17.5% increase in October. Since November 2017, Ether\u2019s price has been higher from the start to the end of September only 25% of the time, with an average loss of 10.8%.\n\nEther\u2019s monthly performance, according to data , has been worse in June than in September, with the price falling an average of 15% in that month."

        "content": "FTX's multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency blowup hasn't destroyed all faith in the industry. In a new documentary premiering Monday, FTX customers, insiders and investors tell CNBC that despite not receiving a single dollar's worth of cryptocurrency back, they're optimistic on the industry and plan to keep investing. Evan Luthra, an app developer, entrepreneur and angel investor, told CNBC he lost $2 million in the collapse of FTX. Luthra said he knew when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2022 that he wouldn't have \"access to any of this money for the next few years.\" He continues to speak at crypto conferences.\n\nFTX customer Evan Luthra talked with CNBC in Miami before speaking at a crypto conference. CNBC\n\n\"I do want everybody to understand that the mistake here was not bitcoin , the mistake was not crypto,\" Luthra said. \"The fundamental reason why we buy bitcoin, why we use bitcoin has not changed.\" Luthra said his hefty loss on FTX hasn't shaken his bitcoin bullishness. \"I know it's going to end up at over $100,000 sooner or later anyways, so for me it's a great buy,\" he said. Bitcoin is currently trading at about $26,900, down from a high of about $69,000 in December 2021. \"All the success is made in the trenches, not when everybody's already celebrating,\" he said. FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, spiraled into bankruptcy after its swift collapse last year. Shortly afterward, FTX investigators said they discovered $8.9 billion in customer assets were missing from the exchange. FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces seven criminal charges of fraud and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection begins in New York on Tuesday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves Manhattan federal court in New York after a court appearance, June 15, 2023. Fatih Aktas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAt a bankruptcy hearing in April 2022, an attorney for FTX said $7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets had been recovered from the exchange. So far, none of the customers interviewed by CNBC have received any of their money back. Jake Thacker, an FTX customer in Portland, Oregon, told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exchange shortly after he lost his job in the tech industry. \"I'm in quite a big hole right now,\" Thacker said. \"I'm probably going to have to file for bankruptcy.\"\n\nFTX customer Jake Thacker told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the crypto exchange. CNBC\n\nThacker told CNBC he \"would encourage people to still invest in crypto.\" \"I probably would give them some different advice at this point,\" he said. That advice would come with the warning: \"Here's what I learned, don't make the same mistakes I did.\" Bhagamshi Kannegundla said he first heard about FTX in an advertisement featuring comedian Larry David that aired during the Super Bowl. \"I was like, oh my goodness, there's all these big name people utilizing FTX,\" Kannegundla said. \"So I was like, OK, hey, I think I'll be safe using this.\" Less than a year later, Kannegundla said, he was out $174,000, representing around 60% of his crypto portfolio, from FTX's collapse.\n\nBhagamshi Kannegundla, an FTX customer, told CNBC he sold his bankruptcy claim to reinvest in crypto. CNBC\n\n\"Based on all the other bankruptcies and everything that happened in the crypto market, I was really, really worried about getting anything back, and then how long I would have to wait,\" Kannegundla said. Instead of waiting for the recoveries to eventually be distributed to FTX customers, Kannegundla went online and found a company that would help him sell his bankruptcy claim for pennies on the dollar to get a little bit of cash more quickly. Kannegundla said his bankruptcy claim was for $174,000. He received around $19,000 in the sale. \"The buyer was, after all the due diligence and everything, it went down to like 11% of the $174,000,\" he said. Years later, if the FTX bankruptcy process recovers more than the 11 cents on the dollar for his claim, the buyer pockets the difference. Kannegundla said he will have \"zero regrets\" if that money gets recovered because he has a different strategy. \"I wanted to get the cash from the bankruptcy claim, primarily to invest in crypto again,\" he said. \"I felt as if there was a good chance for me to make money in the next five to 10 years.\" Kannegundla said he understands that it may be an odd choice. \"People might think I'm crazy for this,\" he said. \"After going through the FTX and all these other bankruptcies, why would you want to buy any more crypto?\" \"When you believe in something as far as technology, you will go through it, you know, it's kind of like the same person who bought like, let's say Amazon stock,\" he said. Another FTX customer, Sunil Kavuri, who has a background in traditional finance, said he moved his digital assets from rival exchange Binance to FTX because he believed it was a safe place for his money. He pointed to the fact that the company raised money from top venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm. \"I thought OK, this is a very safe, institutionally backed exchange,\" he said.\n\nBahamas-based crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11, 2022. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIn an email to CNBC, Kavuri said he hasn't purchased any crypto since the collapse of FTX because he \"wanted to take a break from suffering a massive loss.\" Over the last 10 months, he said, the majority of his time has been spent fighting \"for the rights of all FTX users that lost money due to the FTX bankruptcy.\" \"It hasn't shaken my faith in the underlying asset itself,\" Kavuri said. \"I think cryptocurrencies generally, it should be here to stay.\"\n\nFTX customer Sunil Kavuri told CNBC his loss on the exchange hasn't shaken his faith in the underlying asset. CNBC\n\nAcross the industry, crypto still has its believers despite the madness of 2022. Brett Harrison, the former president of FTX's U.S. business, said he was blindsided by his parent company's collapse. But he's doubling down on cryptocurrencies. Harrison, who left FTX less than two months before its demise, told CNBC he \"had no reason to suspect that FTX wasn't anything other than extremely profitable and in great shape\" prior to his departure.\n\nBrett Harrison, former president of FTX US, left the company less than two months before its collapse. CNBC\n\nHarrison said he's been raising money to start a new company in the space called Architect Financial Technologies. \"I'd really like to build a technology and a tech-forward brokerage that allows people to trade seamlessly and easily in digital assets and any kind of other tokenized products in addition to other asset classes,\" Harrison said. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, said he felt like he was late to the game. He didn't make his first bitcoin investment until October 2020. He later started Skybridge to focus on digital assets.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, spoke with CNBC at his office in New York. CNBC"

        "content": "Unchained, a leading bitcoin financial services provider, has expanded its collaborative custody network with the addition of Coincover, a company known for protecting and insuring over 5 million crypto wallets, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This move aims to bolster the security of Unchained's collaborative custody product, which now secures over $2 billion in Bitcoin, representing a 37% year-over-year increase since October 2022.\n\nUnchained, known for its multisignature collaborative custody, caters to institutional investors, corporate treasuries, governments, and retail customers. This approach leverages the decentralized capabilities of the Bitcoin network, requiring a minimum of two private keys to access an account's Bitcoin holdings. This security measure is designed to mitigate the risks associated with single points of failure, a concern underscored by recent incidents involving custodians like Prime Trust and Fortress Trust, lenders such as BlockFi and Celsius, and exchanges like FTX.\n\n\u201cWhen considering a custody solution, we believe clients should ask themselves two fundamental questions: 1) What happens to your bitcoin if their company disappears, and 2) Can they move or access your assets without your knowledge and consent,\u201d said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. \u201cWe believe that the current solutions fall short of a great answer to both these questions, and are excited to move the industry forward with more robust delegated custody solutions.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Coincover to Unchained's network strengthens custody by further decentralizing keys, ensuring investors maintain full control over their Bitcoin holdings, rendering them immune to exchange hacks and collapses. With Coincover and Kingdom Trust as custodial partners, Unchained aims to protect clients' Bitcoin against issues like rehypothecation or single points of failure, such as hacks or firm bankruptcies.\n\nDhruv Bansal, co-founder and CSO of Unchained, stated, \u201cIn a world where bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 per coin, will the largest bitcoin stakeholders continue to singularly trust any one single custodian?\u201d\n\nUnchained says it plans to continue expanding its collaborative custody network by partnering with additional firms while also offering options where clients maintain control of their private keys.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Babylon introduces its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at Cosmoverse 2023, addressing the untapped potential of idle Bitcoins for PoS chains and dApps\n\nIstanbul, Turkey --News Direct-- Babylon\n\nBabylon, the blockchain project that aims to convert the 21 million bitcoins into a decentralized staking asset for the Proof of Stake economy, unveils its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at the Cosmoverse 2023. Earlier this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin staking to secure PoS chains. Recent data from Glassnode\u2019s reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation. A staggering 66% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, positioning idle Bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nBabylon positions itself as the first marketplace to connect the $500B decentralized trust to earn yield for providing security capital. The company was able to gain support from prominent Cosmos chains that are exploring to adopt Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Zaki Manian, co-founder of Sommelier Protocol, said, \u201cFor years interactions between bitcoin and the growing web3 application layer have been limited to bridging and swapping. Babylon Bitcoin staking lays the path for consensus layer integration with modular and app chains\u201d.\n\nPoS chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains usually have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital. Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to stake Bitcoin instead of their native tokens. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high security. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chain\u2019s inflation pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Babylon's protocol doesn't just harness these idle bitcoins, it transforms them into a security backbone for PoS chains,\" said David Tse, Co-founder, Babylon. \"Our approach seamlessly integrates Bitcoin staking with almost any PoS protocols in a modular fashion, allowing any bitcoin holder to earn staking rewards from a wide variety of PoS chains. This not only amplifies economic incentives but paves the way for broader adoption, underscoring Bitcoin's diverse utility beyond its widely-recognized role as a store of value.\"\n\nBabylon overcomes the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language by amalgamating it with advanced cryptographic techniques. It allows bitcoin holders to lock their bitcoins on the Bitcoin network in a self-custodian way, yet the locked bitcoins can serve as a first-class staking asset for PoS chains with desirable properties such as yield-generation, slashability, and on-demand unstaking. In addition, Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol does not require any soft or hard fork of Bitcoin.\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nBabylon MVP showcases the first implementation of this new technology, where bitcoin testnet coins are staked to secure Babylon PoS chain, which will serve as the control plane for other PoS chains to access to the Bitcoin staking protocol. The MVP comes with a modern explorer and a very straightforward web application for bitcoin holders to test Bitcoin staking.\n\nAfter the MVP debut, Babylon will focus on adoption in various ecosystems. This includes the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains, which is heavily reliant on native staking. Within Cosmos, the top ten protocols boast a combined $2.5 billion worth of staked assets, with an average staking ratio of 50%. Furthermore, 34 integrated PoS chains have shown a strong desire to reduce the 21 day unbonding time for assets staked in Cosmos. Demand for Babylon\u2019s time-stamping protocol was made clear when the Osmosis governance proposal to utilize Bitcoin staking was passed with a 99.9% vote in favor.\n\nThe Company successfully secured a seed funding round, spearheaded by IDG and Breyer Capital\u2014prominent early backers of Coinbase and Circle. With this momentum, the firm is actively seeking additional investment to bolster the advancement of the Bitcoin Staking protocol, among other initiatives.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a transformative research paper on Bitcoin security co-authored by Babylon co-founders David Tse, a professor at Stanford, Fisher Yu, Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, and co-authors. This Bitcoin security research paper achieved a significant milestone as it has been accepted by the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, recognized as the world's leading security conference. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nBitcoin Staking Protocol MVP: https://btcstakingscan.devnet.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nBabylon\n\nShalini Wood, CMO\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-positions-bitcoin-beyond-store-of-value-unveiling-its-bitcoin-staking-protocol-mvp-at-cosmoverse-2023-586215540"

        "content": "Nine years ago today, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made his most substantial public remarks on the nature of Bitcoin, a then five-year-old project that had just broken into the financial mainstream by passing $1,000 the year prior.\n\nAt that time, Assange was not new to Bitcoin. In fact, Wikileaks had discussed accepting Bitcoin since as far back as 2010, when early efforts were made by users to introduce the journalistic agency to the payment method.\n\nUltimately, Wikileaks began accepting Bitcoin in 2011, a move the organization has since credited for helping break its banking blockade in the wake of its publishing of classified U.S. government information.\n\nThat said, a 2014 interview, unearthed by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, shows Assange was every bit as convinced about the technology years later.\n\nIn the video, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a bold statement about Bitcoin that has since proved to be remarkably accurate. In the interview, Assange labeled Bitcoin as \"the most interesting thing on the internet,\" and his words have aged well as the cryptocurrency has seen a staggering surge in value over the years.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Bitcoin was trading at a fraction of its current value, yet Wikileaks was using the technology as a publishing platform, in part, to prove the existence of information it published.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Assange discussed the nature of Bitcoin, and cryptography in general, as a tool for civilians to resist government overreach.\n\n\"The ability of cryptography to create situations where it can defend the people who use it against the full might of a superpower. The full might of a superpower doesn't help you solve a math problem,\" he said. \"It's not something you can get at through overwhelming coercive power.\"\n\nAssange's foresight regarding Bitcoin's significance is evident when we consider the cryptocurrency's remarkable price trajectory since the interview. In 2014, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $380 per coin across exchanges.\n\nFast forward to 2023, and Bitcoin is trading at $28,000, marking an increase of over 7,000% in the nine years since.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mature and gain acceptance, it remains closely tied to the principles of decentralization and censorship resistance that Assange and WikiLeaks championed. Assange is still in prison for publishing key information in the public interest, and his fight for freedom remains a core Bitcoin cause.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Digital asset investment products experienced inflows for the first time in six weeks from Sept. 22 to 28, according to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report from European digital assets management firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)-related investment products were the biggest gainers, with inflows in the amount of $20.4 million for the week.\n\nGood week, everyone. Here are the latest #FundFlows and observations by CoinShares Head of Research @JButterfill.\n\n\n\nThis week inflows: US$21m (after 6 weeks of outflows)\n\n\n\nWe believe these inflows are a reaction to a combination of positive price momentum, fears over US\u2026 pic.twitter.com/0VHHBh1n50 \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) October 2, 2023\n\nSolana (SOL) investment product inflows came in second, with $5 million, as the only other asset to show inflows. Per CoinShares, this is its 27th week of inflows, with only four weeks of outflows for 2023, making it \u201cthe most loved altcoin this year.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Ether (ETH) products experienced outflows in the amount of $1.5 million. This marks its seventh consecutive week of outflows and, according to CoinShares, solidifies its status as \u201cthe least loved altcoin.\u201d\n\nRelated: CoinShares says US not lagging in crypto adoption and regulation\n\nFlows for other altcoin investment products, including XRP (XRP) \u2014 which saw more inflows than Solana during the previous week \u2014 were negative and minimal.\n\nCoinShares analysts attributed the lack of altcoin movement alongside Bitcoin\u2019s trend-breaking momentum to a combination of factors:\n\n\u201cWe believe the inflows are a reaction to a combination of positive price momentum, fears over US government debt prices and the recent quagmire over government funding.\u201d\n\nThe quagmire referenced by CoinShares involves the ongoing negotiations over U.S. government funding. Earlier in the previous week\u2019s cycle, fears over a funding bill stalemate led to predictions that the U.S. government would shut down on Oct. 2.\n\nHowever, a last-minute effort by Senate leaders allowed for the passage of a stopgap that ensures funding through Nov. 17. Whether Congress and the president can come to terms to fund the government beyond the current measure\u2019s expiration remains to be seen.\n\nGeographically, Germany, Canada and Switzerland led the charge for the week, with digital asset investment product inflows amounting to $17.7 million, $17.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Australia and France held the line, metaphorically speaking, with $100,000 for the former and zero for the latter.\n\nThe United States, however, registered $18.5 million in outflows, with Sweden and Brazil following suit at $1.8 million and $900,000 outgoing, respectively."

        "content": "Why bitcoin is inspiring a digital Swiss franc makeover\n\nMoves are afoot to create new digital versions of the Swiss franc to run alongside physical cash. \u00a9 Keystone / Gaetan Bally\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies has inspired central banks and private enterprise to redesign money, including the Swiss franc, by clothing it in the latest digital technology.\n\n7 minutes\n\nSwitzerland is well placed to take a leading role, having established a network of cryptocurrency companies, collectively known as \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d, which interact with the traditional financial sector.\n\nSwiss bankers are enthused by way digital blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could automate time-consuming tasks, such as processing transactions, and open new avenues of business.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is going to fundamentally change our business, everyone is looking into it,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire Bordier, president of the Association of Swiss Private Banks, told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\n\u201cA fundamental competitive pillar of the financial industry is IT. One of the reasons that Switzerland welcomed the creation of Crypto Valley was to remain in the game during the constant evolution of IT innovation.\u201d\n\nDifferent designs\n\nThe goal is to speed up financial transactions, reduce fees and automate different parts of the financial chain. But what does this mean for banks, traders and the person on the street? It ultimately depends on the exact design of the new digital money.\n\nThe creators of bitcoin invented blockchain to give users total control over their money and the freedom to spend it without needing a bank \u2013 much like handing someone physical cash, but in the digital world.\n\nA separate breed of cryptocurrency, called stablecoins, seeks to curb wild price swings by pegging to traditional currencies or other assets to stabilise their value (see animation).\n\nMore\n\nMore Stablecoins explained This content was published on Traditional cryptocurrencies can rapidly change in value. A new form of cryptocurrency backed by traditional money promises more stability. Read more: Stablecoins explained\n\nNo state-backed digital franc yet\n\nGovernments and central banks fear losing control of money to this new breed of private digital cash. Many countries have adapted financial regulations to prevent bitcoin users from sidestepping controls on money laundering and fraud.\n\nBut the traditional financial world also spies an opportunity to leverage DLT to retain their edge. Cryptocurrencies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of experimentation with money.\n\nIn answer to bitcoin, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is one of dozens of central banks currently testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a type of cryptocurrency controlled and backed by the state.\n\nMore\n\nMore Explained: The technology behind bitcoin and blockchain This content was published on To some, it\u2019s a load of hot air. Others see a revolutionary technology that will transform the way we exchange nearly everything of value. Read more: Explained: The technology behind bitcoin and blockchain\n\nA recent survey of 86 central banks by the Bank for International Settlements found that 93% are engaged in CBDC experiments. Many have ramped up activities in response to increasing public enthusiasm for bitcoin and the emergence of other private digital currencies, such as the now-defunct Libra/Diem project from Facebook that once took root in Geneva.\n\nThe potential use-cases for digital money are varied: replacing physical cash, tracing criminal financial flows more effectively or enabling people in countries with weak banking systems to manage their finances on smartphones.\n\nDLT can also give people greater access and choice for loans and financial trading, says Thomas Eichenberger, Chief Product Officer at Sygnum bank, which specialises in digital assets. \u201cA better user experience and cost efficiencies would be the natural consequence of intermediary-free finance,\u201d he told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\nBut while the intention looks benign on paper, the very thought of central banks replacing bank notes with new versions of digital money has raised alarm bells worldwide.\n\nAttack on cash?\n\nIn Switzerland, the Swiss Libertarian Movement has launched a popular initiative, dubbed \u201cCash is Freedom\u201d, that demands constitutional protection for physical cash.\n\nThe Swiss Libertarian Movement fears that digital money could be abused to monitor people\u2019s payments, erasing the anonymity offered by physical cash.\n\nExternal Content\n\nPatrick Schueffel, a professor at the Institute of Finance of Fribourg\u2019s School of Management, believes CBDCs could be employed for far more sinister purposes, particularly by autocratic states. In the worst case, they \u201cpose a threat to liberal democracies\u201d, he told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\nThe new technology could be leveraged to monitor payments, block \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d transactions, such as those that harm the environment, or simply freeze \u201cundesirable\u201d people out of the financial system, he warns.\n\n\u201cThis is dangerous even in a country like Switzerland,\u201d Schueffel said. \u201cIf the authorities have this power at their disposal, they could be tempted to use it.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s office has noted intrusive surveillance concerns. \u201cWhen it comes to the creation of digital currencies, the primary principle to be observed is privacy by design and by default, which requests that projects take privacy interests into account at the very start to develop a concept that is in compliance with data protection principles as standard,\u201d it said in an emailed statement.\n\nAt present, however, the SNB sees no sense in producing a digital franc for high-street shoppers as this would step on the toes of commercial banking activity. The SNB is instead working with banks and the stock exchange to produce a so-called wholesale CBDC to speed up payments in financial trading.\n\nThis would work hand-in-hand with digitised versions of securities, like company shares, which can change hands at lightning speed, 24/7, rather than the current delay of several days. The holy grail is an \u201catomic swap\u201d: the instantaneous exchange of security and money.\n\nThis leaves a void for a digital currency intended for general retail use. Commercial ventures are intent on filling the gap with stablecoins backed by Swiss francs deposited at banks.\n\nCurrency competition\n\nThe Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) in June announced the intention of commercial banks to issue a retail stablecoin using DLT, which would \u201cpotentially allow for a wide range of new applications, reduce risks, increase efficiency, and open up whole new areas of business\u201d.\n\nThe SBA argues that the input of the traditional financial sector remains essential to ensure stability, consumer safety and to avoid scandals, such as the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, that have plagued the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe digital makeover of money has also created competition between countries to be the first to design a more efficient next generation of national currency.\n\nSwiss Stablecoin, a private enterprise that is designing its own digital franc, worries that waiting for other countries to digitise their currencies first could reduce future global demand for the Swiss franc. \u201cIt would be fatal to leave this field to foreign providers,\u201d Swiss Stablecoin founder and former parliamentarian Pascale Bruderer wrote in an opinion piece she co-authored for the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung newspaper."

        "content": "While cryptocurrency continues to make headlines, the recent focus has been on declining valuations rather than stunning surges. Bitcoin (BTC), the quintessential decentralized crypto, is still primarily viewed as a speculative investment. Despite being around since 2010, using bitcoin for everyday small transactions remains impractical and, in many cases, unwise.\n\nDue to their continuously changing value, decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be somewhat risky for purchasing and merchant acceptance \u2013 as exemplified by the famous case of an individual who spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas in the early days of bitcoin, an amount that would now be worth more than $200 million. To help combat these concerns, a distinct category of cryptocurrencies, known as stablecoins, was launched in 2014.\n\nWhat is a stablecoin?\n\nAs their name implies, stablecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies engineered to maintain a fixed value. This level of stability and predictability sets them apart from other cryptocurrency varieties, including bitcoin. Stablecoins are typically tethered to a benchmark currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. When someone acquires a stablecoin for $1, a corresponding coin is generated, and the dollar used as collateral is usually deposited in either a commercial bank account or short-term assets like T-bills. When the stablecoin is redeemed, the coin is effectively removed from circulation (a process known as \u201cburning\u201d) and the original dollar is returned. These types of stablecoins are referred to as fiat-backed stablecoins, but there are other forms as well, such as algorithmic stablecoins that seek to maintain value by dynamically minting or burning coins based on demand.\n\nHow are stablecoins used?\n\nHolding a stablecoin in a wallet is similar to holding a paper dollar in a wallet \u2013 it may be safe, but it is not necessarily a good investment. However, stablecoins can serve several purposes:\n\nAs a safe haven: In countries like Argentina, where high inflation and currency devaluation are prevalent, workers are challenged with preserving the value of their paychecks. Stablecoins, particularly those tied to the U.S. dollar, provide a reliable and straightforward means to safeguard earnings from volatile fluctuations. This makes them particularly popular in nations with unstable currencies, such as Venezuela and Iran.\n\nIn countries like Argentina, where high inflation and currency devaluation are prevalent, workers are challenged with preserving the value of their paychecks.

This makes them particularly popular in nations with unstable currencies, such as Venezuela and Iran. For efficient money movement: Cryptocurrency has emerged as a convenient channel for international money transfers. Since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, more than $225 million has been sent to the country in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and dogecoin. However, these decentralized cryptocurrencies carry the risk of price fluctuations between the sender\u2019s initiation of the transaction and the recipient\u2019s need for the funds. Converting these assets to stablecoins before transferring them eliminates this risk, ensuring the intended value reaches the recipient.\n\nCryptocurrency has emerged as a convenient channel for international money transfers.

Converting these assets to stablecoins before transferring them eliminates this risk, ensuring the intended value reaches the recipient. For swift, \u201con-chain\u201d transfers: Large-scale digital asset traders \u2013 typically institutional investors such as cryptocurrency hedge funds \u2013 must swiftly move funds in and out of decentralized cryptocurrencies to catch a rise or exit before a fall. The delay involved in transferring funds from a traditional bank account to a cryptocurrency exchange can result in significant financial losses, often amounting to millions of dollars. To mitigate this risk, these investors prefer to hold their capital in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, which can be easily converted between different coins, ensuring agility in their investment strategies and the ability to react promptly to market dynamics.\n\nAre there risks to consider?\n\nAlthough generally considered far less risky than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have experienced exceptions that reveal potential pitfalls. The most significant setback occurred in May 2022, when Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a collapse that erased approximately $20 billion worth of circulating coins.\n\nTerra\u2019s failure was not an isolated incident. In January 2021, Basis Cash caused losses of $30.74 million for its investors. Another stablecoin, Titan, issued by Iron Finance, also faced a collapse \u2013 impacting notable backers like Mark Cuban, who later called for increased regulation of stablecoin issuers. Meta, the technology conglomerate which owns and operates platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, attempted to instill trust by creating a stablecoin initially named Libra and later rebranded as Diem. The goal was to enable Meta\u2019s billions of individual users to conduct global financial transactions, which would potentially shake up the world banking system. However, similar to other stablecoins, it encountered strong opposition from regulators and politicians globally, eventually leading to its abandonment.\n\nWhat is next for stablecoins?\n\nWith more than $120 billion minted, stablecoins have gained widespread popularity. Tether, the largest stablecoin, accounts for $11 billion of that. The continued adoption and use of stablecoins in various sectors indicate their potential. For example, Visa recently announced its expanded stablecoin settlement capabilities, which encompass the high-performing Solana blockchain and USDC, a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn addition, PayPal\u2019s recent entry into the stablecoin arena with the introduction of the PayPal USD \u2013 a fiat-backed, regulated stablecoin \u2013 is a notable development. With its established history in the payments industry and strong trust among consumers and regulators, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin could potentially have a transformative impact, allowing users to store the new coin within PayPal or external wallets for flexibility and security. This opens doors for various use cases, including peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and making purchases at merchants, potentially broadening the utility and accessibility of stablecoins.\n\nWhat should credit unions be doing?\n\nThe following are considerations for credit unions to keep in mind with the increasing popularity of stablecoins:\n\nFollow this segment of financial services. Stablecoins represent an evolving segment of the broader crypto industry, one that is gaining in acceptance and trust \u2013 and being scrutinized by regulators. They also represent a potential competitor to regulated banking services by supporting DeFi (Decentralized Financial Services), which are banking services provided by unregulated entities.\n\nStablecoins represent an evolving segment of the broader crypto industry, one that is gaining in acceptance and trust \u2013 and being scrutinized by regulators.

Monitor your members\u2019 activity. Some of your members are holding stablecoins. Tracking outflow from share deposits to crypto exchanges should be a regular report to understand the magnitude of the both the dollar volume and the number of unique members that are participating. These same members could be valuable to the credit union, as they might also be early adopters of other advanced services.\n\nSome of your members are holding stablecoins.

These same members could be valuable to the credit union, as they might also be early adopters of other advanced services. Consider potential use cases in your strategic planning. There are a few pilots of moving tokenized deposits between financial institutions that have taken place over the last few years. Tokenized deposits are a form of stablecoin moving between banks and credit unions over a private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain. This moving of tokenized deposits is an alternative for B2B payments and cross-border payments. If B2B payments or cross-border payments are something that fits with your credit union model, consider participating in a pilot case of tokenized deposits in the near future.\n\nIt is imperative for your credit union to keep a pulse on the latest developments concerning stablecoins. As this unique type of cryptocurrency becomes more popular and integrated into the financial ecosystem, stablecoins are likely to play a significant role in the future of digital finance."

        "title": "Mixing Bitcoin With 60/40 is Like Using Kerosene as Kindling - Morningstar.ca",
        "content": "Bitcoin has performed surprisingly well for the year to date. The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe trusty \"balanced\" portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index [VBAIX] has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60/40 fund might be dead. Balanced funds\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of US stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nSo far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin.\n\nWe say think very carefully before you do that.\n\nCompared with other assets, bitcoin's volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\nRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023\n\nEven though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin's impact on the 60/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly four times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behaviour of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.\n\nHow Much is a Lot?\n\nLet's say in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60/40 portfolio \u2013 that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested.\n\n(For the purposes of this example, let's also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn't change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis \u2013 that will become important in a second.)\n\nOur study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: a 60%/38%/2% split between stocks/bonds/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%/30% S&P 500/Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\nBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nFurther up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90/10 portfolio than a 60/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong.\n\nThe closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!)\n\nDecomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\nBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nAlthough adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\nBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWith that said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren't likely to hold in practice. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.\n\nWhen it comes to security selection \u2013 picking individual stocks, for example \u2013 the \"do nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\nFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nEven one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nWe see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it's permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.\n\nEven so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would say those investors should tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.\n\nMost digital assets, including the cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, are not currently classified as shares of registered securities and therefore do not fall under Morningstar\u2019s editorial policies.

Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today, I\u2019m joined by Jaime Leverton, who is CEO at Hut 8. Jamie, welcome to the program.\n\nJaime:\n\nThanks so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be here.\n\nIan:\n\nWe have been planning this I think for over eight months. So it holds the record as the longest in the works Public Key episode. I don\u2019t know about the audience, but I\u2019ve got a ton of anticipation. You are famous, I think, in crypto circles. You\u2019re one of Coin Telegraphs 15 Most Influential Entrepreneurs in Web3, and you run a publicly traded cryptocurrency firm, which is a rare, rare thing. Tell us a little bit about Hut 8 for people that aren\u2019t familiar.\n\nJaime:\n\nSure, happy to. So Hut 8 is one of the oldest publicly traded Bitcoin miners. We started as a pure self-mining Bitcoin company. We went public initially on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2018. We\u2019re headquartered in Canada. All of our operations today are in Canada as well. Then we moved up to the Toronto Stock Exchange proper in 2020, and then we\u2019re the first Canadian company in our space to do a list onto the Nasdaq, which we did in the spring of \u201921. Since I took over the company, which is coming up on three years now, we\u2019ve diversified the business model quite a bit. We still do self-mining of Bitcoin, but at the end of January 2022, we closed on the transaction to purchase five traditional data centers across Canada, two in Toronto, two in Vancouver, and one in Northern BC and Kelowna. So those are five data centers that do traditional types of workloads, co-location, cloud managed services.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot going on in that space right now with the boom in AI compute demand we\u2019re seeing. So within the realm of Bitcoin miners, we\u2019re unique in that we are fully diversified between traditional data center compute and Bitcoin mining compute. The other thing that makes us stand out from our peers is we\u2019re actually the first public company to start holding Bitcoin on balance sheet, which we did really from inception going back to 2018.\n\nIan:\n\nWe\u2019ll definitely dive into Bitcoin on balance sheet. We\u2019ve had a number of folks who specialize in the accounting and some of the legal technicalities of dealing with that. I\u2019d love the CEO perspective, but maybe we can start at the beginning because I think you and I have a shared enterprise IT background prior to crypto. You\u2019re a relatively recent joiner to the space. Talk about your career that led you into the world of cryptocurrency. I\u2019m always fascinated by the origin stories here.\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll try to keep it as net as possible. I started my career in trad tech back in 2000. I did my MBA at Dalhousie University on the East Coast of Canada with a concentration in marketing informatics, which was really the precursor to what we would now consider big data or business intelligence, and because that program was so unique, IBM recruited myself and one other from that program and moved me from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Toronto. I\u2019m actually from a small town about two and a half hours east of Toronto. So that was me coming to the big city for the first time in the spring of 2000.\n\nI started working for IBM. I spent the first 10 years of my career working at IBM in a variety of different roles, quite a bit of it spent in the media and entertainment sector, doing a lot with emerging technologies in that space. Then I ultimately made the decision to leave IBM at the end of 2009, and that really kicked off the second half of my career journey, where I\u2019ve worked for a number of companies, all Canadian owned and operated, really focusing on more transformation type of mandates, so going into business units or companies that are struggling with something and really driving or attempting to drive a fix of the business unit or the problem or grow it out in a significant way.\n\nSo over the course of the 10 years from me leaving IBM to me ultimately taking over at Hut 8, I had the opportunity to work for companies like Blackberry, Bell Canada, National Bank, Cogeco Peer 1, a lot of it spent on the infrastructure side. So the majority of my career has been in and around the data center world. So when I got the call to look at this opportunity with Hut 8, ultimately, what a Bitcoin mine really is is an industrial scale stripped down data center.\n\nSo it\u2019s a technology I really understand. I understand the operations, the vendors, how the whole system works, albeit they\u2019re completely different from a security and a redundancy perspective, how you build a Bitcoin mining data center versus a traditional data center, but because I understood the motion and the operations and I had gone down the rabbit hole with respect to Bitcoin in the 2017-\u201918 run, so I was already a big believer in the space, I had looked at other opportunities to come into the space, but ultimately didn\u2019t find the right fit until it was the opportunity to take over Hut, which I did did in December of 2020.\n\nIan:\n\nWow. When you first saw crypto back in 2017, what drew you into it? What appealed? Also maybe the other side of that, what scared you a little bit since you didn\u2019t immediately jump into the industry professionally at least at that time?\n\nJaime:\n\nWell, so a couple things happened. I spent some time working within one of Canada\u2019s large banks in their capital markets division and really had the opportunity to see how capital markets was functioning from the inside. I had the opportunity to go across the capital markets business and understand how they were interacting with each other, with customers, within the broader industry. It really felt like an industry that was ripe for some disruption. It appeared to me to be behaving the same way it had behaved for decades.\n\nSo I went proactively searching for what could be that disruptor for the finance industry and ultimately found Bitcoin, but it was still early, it was still speculative. There were a lot of bad actors in the space. There was a lot of drama. So I just paid attention to it from a peripheral perspective.\n\nAt that time, \u201917-\u201918, run I was running Canada and Asia Pacific for Cogeco Peer 1, which is a traditional data center company. Almost overnight, we saw this overwhelming demand come in from a completely new segment of customers, and really what they were were Bitcoin miners looking for anywhere to plug in servers. They were willing to come into traditional data center environments despite the fact that they were paying arguably retail rates for co-location, but they were so desperate to get somewhere to plug these miners in that they were willing to come into, as I say, traditional spaces.\n\nNow, there are a whole lot of problems that get introduced when you actually try to mix ASIC-based computing in a traditional data center environment. The industry learned those the hard way in that \u201917-\u201918 run. Then ultimately, because the economics didn\u2019t hold, most of those Bitcoin miners that came into a traditional data center environment quickly went under when the economics turned against them as that bear came around quite quickly in \u201918, but through that process, I learned about mining and got just really, really interested in, ultimately, the promise of this technology.\n\nInitially for me, it was about banking the unbanked. It was about really bringing something completely different to every world without borders, without centralization. Then I think for many of us, once you go down that rabbit hole and that fire sparks within you, it\u2019s really, really hard not to eventually make your way into this space.\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s hard to go back once you\u2019ve seen it. You bring up a point that I would love your perspective on, which is as an outsider to the mining industry, it seems like it\u2019s a boom and bust market mixed with geopolitics, right? So when I was coming into the industry two and a half, almost three years ago, everybody was getting kicked out of China, where it seemed like at least 50% of the mining activity had migrated to, I think, driven off of cheap power, and suddenly China said, \u201cNo more. Everybody\u2019s out.\u201d\n\nThen we\u2019ve seen over the last year with the downturn in asset prices it seems like a lot of people were turning off their rigs or actually going outright bankrupt and having asset sales. What is the economics around the mining industry? How does this work? How do you manage to successfully run a publicly traded company in that context? It seems like it would be really challenging.\n\nJaime:\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong. It is very, very challenging. We do see cycles in crypto. I think the Bitcoin cycle, historically, is quite predictable. It all centers around the halving. Generally, we have seen the halving creates a bit of a supply shock because the amount of block rewards available to miners drops by 50% every four years, and that shock to the industry ultimately tends to trigger a new bull cycle, so a new cycle of price appreciation for Bitcoin, which generally happens about six months after the halving.\n\nSo initially, that shock causes really challenging economics for miners because, obviously, the amount of revenue you can generate drops by 50%, but what we see in the network, just based on how the network is designed, the most inefficient miners tend to also shut off immediately following the halving because they just can\u2019t afford to run. So the network is always dynamically self-adjusting based on where the economics are.\n\nSo really, the strategy going into any halving event is to make sure you\u2019re in the top 50% as far as the efficiency curve so that you can continue to mine even after the halving award drops by half, but really, the industry is optimistically waiting for that next cycle of price appreciation for Bitcoin, which is where all of the economics turn in in a Bitcoin miner\u2019s favor in that window. My perspective, and actually I\u2019ll take a step back, we did see a lot of pain in the industry last year across crypto, but that miners were not immune to that. Much of it had to do with leverage.\n\nSo the miners that got into the worst trouble and the bankruptcies that we saw in the space were really driven off of having too much debt that they couldn\u2019t service when mining economics turned suddenly and more negatively than anyone expected. We did have the perfect storm of events last year between an energy crisis, which drove up our number one operating expense as a miner is energy. So prices skyrocketed. Bitcoin price turned earlier than people expected. It didn\u2019t hit the all time highs that people were expecting and it dipped lower than people were expecting. So that obviously has a dramatic impact on our economics.\n\nThen the third factor, which really nobody expected, was the network cash rate continued to hit all time highs, and we\u2019re seeing that momentum also flow into 2023. So our economics are the most challenged perhaps that they\u2019ve ever been since Bitcoin mining really started back in \u201908-\u201909. So from my perspective, one of the things we\u2019ve been very, very focused on since I took over was taking on as little leverage as possible, really having a balance sheet first approach to the business so that you\u2019ve got some insulation from these cycles that can be difficult to predict.\n\nThen the other thing is really looking at a diversified business model, as I talked about. So one of the reasons that we went into the traditional data center space was so that we would have a mix of fiat-based income streams, as well as the self-mining, which ultimately generates the Bitcoin as the output. So from my perspective, those are the two most important things you can do to manage the cycles is a diversified business model that gives you fiat-based income streams that aren\u2019t directly related to Bitcoin mining economics and cycles, and to make sure your balance sheet is robust. So again, I mentioned we\u2019ve been keeping Bitcoin on balance sheets since inception. We now have over 9,000 Bitcoin on our balance sheet, and that gives us a lot of optionality throughout market conditions.\n\nIan:\n\nWhat\u2019s the strategy with Bitcoin on the balance sheet? Are you holding forever as some of the folks in the community might claim to be or is there a more active trading strategy behind that?\n\nJaime:\n\nThis is something we\u2019re constantly looking at. I have no intention to sell down our Bitcoin stack at present. We are selling monthly production to fund operations. As we\u2019re going through, we\u2019re going through a merger, which I\u2019m very, very hopeful we\u2019ll ultimately get final shareholder and regulatory approvals in the next few weeks. I\u2019m happy to talk a little bit about what that will look like and what Hut 8 will be on the other side, assuming that transaction is ultimately approved and successful.\n\nSo our view in the bull market, one of the things we were doing with the stack of Bitcoin that we had on our balance sheet was actually putting it to work. So we had strategic relationships with both Galaxy and Genesys, and we were using a portion of our Bitcoin stack to generate a fiat-based yield. Now, ultimately, when market conditions turned and there was a lot of pain and noise in the industry, we pulled that back so that all of our Bitcoin would be custodied and wouldn\u2019t have any direct market exposure.\n\nThen over the past nine months as we really wanted to be able to enter into the right types of growth opportunities, including the merger we\u2019re working through with USBTC, having that much Bitcoin on balance sheet gives us a lot of optionality to grow the business because, ultimately, it serves as a great currency to put towards growth.\n\nWe did announce about six weeks ago or so a credit facility with Coinbase, so it\u2019s a $50 million US credit facility, where we\u2019re using a portion of our Bitcoin to secure that facility. Coinbase is one of our custodians as well. So it\u2019s a very elegant way to access non-dilutive capital at competitive rates to allow for us to continue to fund and grow the business. So that Bitcoin on balance sheet gives us a lot of optionality, more security and downside protection for cycles.\n\nOver time, I believe, as we get more regulatory clarity and more sophisticated counterparties coming into this space, I think there will be an even greater opportunity for us to really put that stack to work in an increasingly meaningful way, and that is my intention going forward.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, that\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s such a diversified business. Talk about what\u2019s going on with the merger. I think this is a pretty exciting development for Hut.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. So we were vocal with our intention to continue looking for inorganic growth opportunities, the first one being the transaction that we closed to buy the Tarago data center assets at the end of January 22. Then we continue to look for the right opportunity to grow further. Really, I think one of the most important things that I was looking for in a strategic partnership like this was I think cultural fit is incredibly important. The USBTC team, really great group of entrepreneurs, young, positive, hungry, they had also been able to capitalize on some amazing growth opportunities during the bear market and really grow their business out in a meaningful way.\n\nI was looking for an opportunity to get geographic diversification. As I mentioned, we\u2019re entirely Canadian based from an operational perspective, and USBTC is entirely US-based. So their assets are in Texas, Nebraska, and Niagara Falls, and then their corporate team is based in Miami. So very synergistic. There\u2019s really no overlap as far as where we\u2019re positioned on the map.\n\nThey had also embarked on a diversified approach. So they have three primary business lines. They do self-mining of Bitcoin. They also do hosting. Then they built out a category called managed infrastructure operations, where they take their team and their purpose-built in-house software, and they actually go to other people\u2019s sites and manage Bitcoin mining operations for them. That really provides \u2026 It\u2019s two product lines that are fiat-based cash flows, one that\u2019s Bitcoin-based in the prop mining, and different levels of capital intensity. So self-mining of Bitcoin is the most capital intensive in that you have to build and pay for all of the infrastructure, as well as the miners themselves.\n\nThe hosting side of the business, much less capital intensive in that you only have to put capital towards the infrastructure and the clients you\u2019re hosting bring the miners. Then with respect to the managed infrastructure operations, really no capital intensity. It\u2019s software and labor. So that gives us, when we think about ultimately if we\u2019re successful in the merger, these businesses coming together. We have three different primary fiat-based revenue lines. In addition to the repair center, we also have a repair business where we repair third parties mining equipment, and there\u2019s a fiat-based revenue component to that. Then we\u2019ve got, obviously, the self-mining side of our business and my data center business.\n\nSo as these things all come together, it allows us to be very opportunistic in when and how we deploy capital based on what we\u2019re seeing in the markets in which we participate. Obviously, one of the things we would like to be able to avoid and are lucky that we historically have been, you don\u2019t want to be deploying capital into mining equipment in the peak bull market. We saw a lot of people in the last cycle deploying significant amounts of capital into machines that we\u2019re trading at a hundred dollars, north of a hundred dollars per terahash when the real market price is more like high teens, low twenties for that equipment.\n\nSo having the optionality to allow us to flex in and out of segments based on where we think the right deployment of capital exists or makes the most sense is one of the things I really, really like about our business and is incredibly differentiated from anyone else in the space.\n\nIan:\n\nThe strategy makes a ton of sense. One of the things that\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m curious your perspective because you sit on both the GPU, a purview into the world of artificial intelligence and into crypto, and it feels like we\u2019re in a similar cycle to what you just mentioned about the overpriced, overheated market when it comes to GPUs right now.\n\nI had a conversation with somebody the other day that said they were doing an M&A type activity and the value being placed on the GPUs that the to-be-acquired company had was greater than the enterprise book value of the entire company. So GPUs are a hot thing to get right now. Are you seeing that in your business as well, like access to Nvidia chips just being challenged or is this driving demand for you because you had a stockpile ready to go in advance?\n\nJaime:\n\nWell, right now, the biggest demand is for a specific card Nvidia manufacturers called the H100. So that\u2019s absolutely supply constrained, but yes, we are seeing demand, obviously, has exponentially increased for space for people to be able to \u2026 Right now, it\u2019s all about generative AI. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of the demand coming into this space. I think we\u2019ve seen AI hype cycles go \u2026 Well, the first paper on neural networks, I believe, dates back to 1943, and we\u2019ve seen many cycles for AI as well where it\u2019s the next big thing, robots are going to take over the world, and then it peters off and then it comes back. I think this time does feel materially different than prior cycles. I think that the big difference is the way consumers are actually able to interact with AI in a meaningful way, which has not occurred in the past. So I\u2019m not saying that this is the cycle that is here to stay, but it definitely feels different would be my perspective.\n\nI think one of the really fascinating things about how Hut has evolved as well, the company was named after Hut 8, which is the Hut number that Alan Touring worked in during World War II. He built out the bomb and ultimately helped to crack the code that allowed the winning of the war. So that cryptography ultimately formed the basis on which blockchain and Bitcoin technology was built.\n\nThe other thing that is interesting though, Alan went on to write about AI and, ultimately, machines being able to be indistinguishable from humans, and he wrote that paper, I believe, in 1950. So our company is named after the godfather of crypto and AI and where the unique public company that is existing in trying to lead in the convergence of these two worlds.\n\nIan:\n\nI didn\u2019t know the history around the name, but I love that. That\u2019s such a great insider reference. One of the big criticisms that I think the industry at large gets is environmental in nature. I think I\u2019ll summarize as being like, \u201cHey, this Bitcoin thing doesn\u2019t need to exist, so therefore any amount of power consumed by Bitcoin is wasted power.\u201d We\u2019re in an energy constrained world, and we\u2019re in a situation with climate change where, \u201cHey, we should stop all unnecessary power consumption.\u201d\n\nWhen you and I first met, we got into this discussion on this topic, so I know you\u2019ve got some strong opinions here. Build the case why what I just said, the poor man\u2019s summary of, I think, the anti Bitcoin mining argument doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Then I think your organization\u2019s also done some pretty exciting stuff specifically related to greening of the industry that we should also touch on.\n\nJaime:\n\nThis is a big topic that I\u2019m very passionate about and could spend an hour on my soapbox on. So I\u2019m going to try to not do that. I\u2019ll break it into three categories. First of all, having a value-based conversation about compute workload, which is ultimately what that is and the value Bitcoin, does Bitcoin deserve energy, that\u2019s a very dangerous argument to have. Are we then saying that all other workloads we should debate on their value to society? There are a lot of very terrible workloads out there that have never debated their energy profile. So that is complicated.\n\nI would also say if you look at where we\u2019re seeing the highest level of Bitcoin adoption right now, it\u2019s in Argentina for obvious reasons. So if you\u2019re going to talk about values, you really have to have to talk to people who don\u2019t sit in a privileged position from being me in Canada or those of us that are in the United States or Europe that have stable currencies and stable governments.\n\nBitcoin solves a really serious problem that affects a large portion of the globe, and we\u2019ve still got just under two billion people unbanked that Bitcoin is an answer for. So a challenging argument and one that I really don\u2019t think holds any water if you think about the promise of Bitcoin and what it does that no other technology in the history of the world has been able to do from a store of value perspective and transfer of value perspective.\n\nWhen we get into the energy conversation, I think it\u2019s really driven on people not understanding the industry or how it works. I think the easiest way for me to describe a real life use case is our site in Medicine Hat. So our largest site in Canada is in Medicine Hat, Alberta. We\u2019ve got 67 megawatts. Medicine Hat is an independent power authority in that the city also owns their own power generation. When we set up our Bitcoin mining facility, we built it directly next to one of their cogen facilities.\n\nNow, that facility always was producing the same amount of power, but for the most part, that power would sit idle waiting for peak demand. It was always there to support the constituents, but it wasn\u2019t being monetized or put to productive use until we built the Bitcoin mine next to it. So what that did for the community as a whole, now that 67 megawatts of power is being utilized and monetized at all times, but when there\u2019s peak demand on the grid, we power off.\n\nSo Bitcoin mines are built to power up and down based on the cost of electricity because if it\u2019s not economical for us to mine Bitcoin, we\u2019re not going to mine Bitcoin, we shut down, and that always coincides with peak demand. So the community at large gets to use the power when they need the power, but the power that\u2019s available is never being wasted. It\u2019s always being monetized and utilized and going where it\u2019s most needed.\n\nThat made us one of the largest sources of revenue, obviously, for the power side of the community or one of the largest taxpayers for the community. We brought 30 skilled labor jobs into a community that really, really needs them without taking anything away from the community or the constituents. We are purely a net benefit. We almost operate like a battery in that we move up and down as required by the needs of the grid.\n\nIan:\n\nCan I ask a question on this because I\u2019ve heard the Bitcoin battery argument before, and I\u2019m such a novice when it comes to understanding the energy industry? So I think the way it goes is power plants, hugely capital intensive to build, take years if not decades to construct a new power plant of any generation technology, and once it\u2019s built, you may not have \u2026 Let\u2019s say that it has 100 megawatt supply capacity. That 100 megawatts, you may not have demand for that most of the time, but there\u2019s no-\n\nJaime:\n\nExactly. Generally, you\u2019re only hitting that peak demand maybe 10%, 15% of the year on the very, very cold days, the very, very hot days, but it has to be available to support those days. Otherwise, it-\n\nIan:\n\nThis is where the power plant concept seems strange to me. If I was talking about in my house, I would just turn things off and I would be consuming nothing, but in a power plant, it\u2019s not trivial to cut down the power generation capacity, particularly if I have to, and it\u2019s hard to scale up quickly to meet that peak demand when it comes.\n\nJaime:\n\nThat\u2019s right. Exactly.\n\nIan:\n\nSo the operators want to run at full capacity all the time.\n\nJaime:\n\nCorrect. That\u2019s right.\n\nIan:\n\nMost of the time, they\u2019re just dumping that power into nothing.\n\nJaime:\n\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s absolutely right. Yup.\n\nIan:\n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not as clueless as I thought on this.\n\nJaime:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIan:\n\nSo you\u2019re suddenly there with your infrastructure to consume this. Do you have a formal agreement with the power generator to say, \u201cOkay. When you hit some point of consumption, we will start powering off machines,\u201d and you match their demand from other consumers in line?\n\nJaime:\n\nSo most Bitcoin miners have exactly this relationship with their power provider and their local community. We see a lot of this in Texas in ERCOT, where miners are helping to support grid stabilization during peak weather events and those kinds of things. It makes the most headlines. The mechanics of each contractor are slightly different, but I would take it back to first principles, which is if there\u2019s a spike in demand for power, power prices naturally go up and we naturally have to shut down when power prices go up because it\u2019s no longer economical for us to mine. There\u2019s a price at which it no longer makes sense to have those miners running, and it\u2019s always going to coincide with peaked grid demands. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s built.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, and is your pricing dynamic? I know my home energy bill is fairly static. I\u2019m not seeing changes in price throughout the billing period of a month, but I assume you\u2019re a wholesale consumer, not a retail consumer, so your billing probably works a little different.\n\nJaime:\n\nEach miner\u2019s PPAs are slightly different. Some have fixed components, variable components. Again, no PPA is created exactly equal, but the other thing that I think is so exciting and not talked about very often in our space is because a miner\u2019s number one operating expense is energy, we\u2019re constantly on a mission to find lowest cost energy solutions.\n\nSo one of the most exciting things happening in this space over the last couple of years have been miners that are going and using flare gas directly in oil and gas fields, capturing flare gas, using that to mine Bitcoin right at the site, which means that that carbon isn\u2019t being flared off or emitted into the environment. So the beautiful thing about a Bitcoin mine, you can really set it up anywhere there\u2019s an energy source. It does not need to be connected to the grid.\n\nTransmission and distribution has always been the biggest challenge for these stranded negative energy assets, which Bitcoin solves for. Again, captures a flare gas uses that to mine, makes sure that carbon doesn\u2019t go into the atmosphere, and when that flaring site runs out of gas, the rigs can literally just pick up and move to the next flare site. They\u2019re broadly portable.\n\nThe other great area of innovation is in waste methane. So we\u2019re seeing miners set up next to landfill sites, which have a similar problem. So you can use waste methane to create energy, but the landfills generally aren\u2019t able to dump that energy into the grid so they don\u2019t have an offtaker for it. Whereas if you set a mining facility up next to a landfill, you can actually use that waste methane to power the mine and keep that methane out of the atmosphere.\n\nAll of this is happening directly by the industry. The industry\u2019s coming up with this innovation. The industry is funding it. We\u2019re not dependent on government programs or government subsidies. This is all private sector driven, which is an entirely net benefit to the environment. It\u2019s a net benefit to have less gas being flared. It\u2019s a net benefit to have less methane going into the atmosphere, and Bitcoin miners are the only offtaker right now that can set up in all of these remote locations.\n\nIan:\n\nWhat does it look like when you set up next to a landfill or a natural gas drilling site? Is it like a trailer full of racks of servers?\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, they\u2019re generally on trailers, skids on trailers. Most Bitcoin mines are set up in containers. So picture a shipping container. Generally, they\u2019re between one megawatt and two and a half megawatts per container, and you can put those on flatbeds and drive them around.\n\nIan:\n\nDrive them anywhere.\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, but we\u2019re simplifying here. Then from an industry perspective, wherever we can, one of the things that has driven a lot in ERCOT in West Texas, there was a huge boom in renewable projects going on out there, solar farms, wind farms. Those are intermittent power sources, and many of them ended up being constructed in areas where there wasn\u2019t actual enough demand, load demand to support the projects. So we\u2019ve seen a number of Bitcoin miners set up directly next to wind farms, solar farms, and they\u2019re able to consume that energy when it\u2019s available. Then otherwise, they\u2019re using grid energy.\n\nSo just a ton of great stories coming out of innovation in this space. In fact, KPMG wrote and published an article a few weeks ago talking about the benefits of Bitcoin mining to the renewables transition, which is the best thing that our industry could hope for, to now have credible third parties that have done the work, that understand the space, that understand the incredible potential that Bitcoin miners have to help more rapidly and sustainably drive and help fund the renewable energy transition is incredible. So I expect we\u2019ll see a lot more of that research start to come out in the next six to 12 months.\n\nIan:\n\nAwesome. We\u2019ll link to that article in the show notes so that people can go and read it themselves. This is where I wanted to go with the conversation is, what\u2019s your perspective on getting the industry to carbon neutrality or potentially all sourced green energy? I don\u2019t know if the economics make sense today to do something like that. Obviously, you\u2019re not going to catapult the business into bankruptcy. So is there a transition plan on which you foresee this happening where you\u2019re 100% sourced from green energy? Is it possible to look that far into the future?\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to look that far into the future, for sure. Where we use natural gas, we\u2019ve established a program to start offsetting that natural gas consumption to ultimately get to a carbon neutral state. We came together as an industry over two years ago and formed the Bitcoin Mining Council. That council publishes research on a regular basis and has been able to demonstrate that the industry is broadly run, it\u2019s run on \u2026 The majority of the industry uses renewables. I think it\u2019s up to over 58% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable sources today, and that\u2019s research that will continue.\n\nWe do see some miners in the US now using nuclear as a source, which is, obviously, emission-free. I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more nuclear in our future. Then one of the things we are challenged with is how do you really capture the benefit of miners converting flare. So it\u2019s almost using flare to power. Flare isn\u2019t a renewable source, but you\u2019re actually taking carbon out of the atmosphere. So that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think has been fully standardized or thought through, and the same would be true with waste methane.\n\nIan:\n\nYou\u2019re still burning it. So there\u2019s still some carbon emission, but I\u2019m guessing the argument is that it\u2019s quite a bit lower than just releasing the methane or releasing the flare directly into the environment.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, materially lower.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. That\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ll see if we can find a reference of somebody that\u2019s done some research on this and include it in the show notes too.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah. Dennis Porter\u2019s done some great research. Daniel Batten\u2019s done some great research. Luckily, there\u2019s increasingly bodies of good research out there.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. I\u2019m curious as you look to the future, you\u2019ve obviously got a great diversification strategy for the business. What comes next? You\u2019ve got the merger, obviously, that\u2019s in the near future, but I imagine you\u2019re thinking a few steps ahead. Where do you go after that?\n\nJaime:\n\nI\u2019m always trying to think a few steps ahead. Hut\u2019s got such a great track record of being where the puck\u2019s going. So I think I\u2019ve put a lot of pressure on myself to keep that track record alive. Our focus is getting to the other side of this transaction successfully this fall, but we\u2019ll certainly continue to push the envelope when it comes to driving and leading innovation in this space. Really, I spent a lot of time thinking about how these worlds come together.\n\nI think when we think about what is AI, really, AI is scalable everything. There\u2019s no limit to where AI could ultimately go, but what AI lacks is truth, is hardcoded truth. It lacks provenance, it lacks identity, and that\u2019s what blockchain technology can really provide. It\u2019s really scalable truth at the end of the day. So I think these worlds, in order for them to both reach their maximum potential, they need to work together. I think that\u2019s the intersection that\u2019s going to get the most innovation and attention over the next few years.\n\nIan:\n\nThe service level discussion there on the AI meets blockchain, I haven\u2019t seen people going deep on it. So it\u2019s interesting for you to bring that up, but I think you\u2019re incredibly well-positioned to lead these two things together into the future. So Jaime, this was a fantastic conversation. Thanks so much for joining us, and I\u2019ll talk to you again soon.\n\nJaime:\n\nThanks again for having me, and sorry for making the record of the most difficult interview to schedule.\n\nIan:\n\nIt was absolutely worth it.\n\nJaime:\n\nGood. Thanks again."

        "content": "Analysts have unveiled their forecasts for October as the Bitcoin (BTC) price has pushed past the $28,000 mark. The cryptocurrency is currently experiencing an upward trajectory in October, firing up hopes for a productive month.\n\nAnalysts Predict A Bullish Run For Bitcoin Price In October\n\nThe month of October also referred to as Uptober in the crypto community has always been a bullish month for Bitcoin with a lot of gains. The cryptocurrency has always finished October with gains, doing so 8 of out 10 times since 2013.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, October has been one of the highest-performing months for Bitcoin. The crypto analyst highlighted this in a post on X (formerly Twitter), along with a graph of Bitcoin\u2019s average monthly performance.\n\n\u201cHistorically, October + November are the best performing months for #Bitcoin,\u201d Miles stated.\n\nAnother crypto analyst who is also bullish on Bitcoin this month of October is Michael Van De Poppe. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin reaching a $40,000 mark is reasonable due to a pre-eminent Q4 of 2023, triggered by a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the pre-halving rally.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Uptober. Welcome to Q4, which is leading towards a great quarter, potentially fueled by ETF approvals and the pre-halving rally. Potentially #Bitcoin to $40,000 is reasonable.\u201d Michael\u2019s post on X read.\n\nWelcome to Uptober. Welcome to Q4, which is leading towards a great quarter, potentially fueled by ETF approvals and the pre-halving rally. Potentially #Bitcoin to $40,000 is reasonable. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 1, 2023\n\nCrypto traders are also high-geared up with Uptober due to Bitcoin experiencing its first ever green in September since 2016, marking the strongest one Bitcoin has experienced since 2016. This pivotal movement of Bitcoin in September sets the pace for October (Uptober).\n\nCrypto trader Ran Neuner also pointed out the last time Bitcoin experienced an upward trajectory in September and the positive effect of this significant move, along with a yearly chart of Bitcoin on a post on X yesterday October 1, 2023.\n\nAdditionally, On-chain analytics firm Santiment recently revealed on X that Bitcoin\u2019s sharks and whale holders have now accumulated up to 13.03 million BTC in 2023, presenting a promising long-term outlook for Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to the analytic firm, the whales and sharks addresses have been accumulating Bitcoin and Tether quietly for the past six weeks.\n\nBTC Holders Are On the Rise\n\nThe expectations of approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have since had a positive effect on the BTC price. The crypto asset experienced a significant increase in adoption in different regions of the world.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recently pushed past its resistance level of $27,500 and it is currently being traded at $28,300 as of the time of writing. This shows that the cryptocurrency is slowly gaining momentum in what is established to be one of its most bullish months.\n\nCo-founder of Reflexivity Research, Will Clemente revealed Bitcoin\u2019s metrics of long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs) on X a few days ago, as well as data on Bitcoin\u2019s holder supply, circulating supply, and adjusted supply.\n\nThe chart illustrated by blockchain data and intelligence firm Glassnode showed that three out of four Bitcoin are presently owned by long-term holders. The percentage of BTC supply held by Bitcoin\u2019s long-term holders accounted for 76.09%, reaching its highest level ever and pointing to strong conviction among these \u2018diamond hands.\u2019\n\nBTC breaks above $28,000 to kick off October | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Blasts Up 8% \u2013 Is a New Bull Market Starting?\n\nIn recent times, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been abuzz with talks about Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) trajectory. This attention is further intensified by its notable 8% surge, sparking discussions about the potential onset of a new bull market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price stands at an impressive $28,000 with a robust 24-hour trading volume of $12 billion, indicating a 4% rise in a single day.\n\nUnwavering in its dominance, Bitcoin retains its top spot on CoinMarketCap, boasting an enviable market capitalization of approximately $547 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the circulating supply of Bitcoin hovers around 19,501,531 BTC coins, inching ever closer to its predetermined cap of 21 million.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nTaking a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour chart, several key price levels emerge.\n\nKey Technical Levels: The pivot point, an essential metric, is pegged at $27,347. As for resistance levels, the immediate one is at $28,706, followed closely by $29,417 and $30,275. Conversely, Bitcoin finds its immediate support at $26,636, with subsequent layers of support positioned at $26,000 and $25,325.\n\nIndicators Show Overbought Market Conditions\n\nTechnical indicators further shed light on Bitcoin\u2019s current status. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, sits at 78. Traditionally, an RSI level that eclipses the 70 mark signifies overbought conditions, alerting traders to possible pullbacks in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) unveils a value of 124, contrasted against its signal line placed at 393. Notably, the MACD line below the signal line suggests a potential shift towards downward momentum.\n\nThe 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50 EMA) is another noteworthy metric. Currently valued at $27,000, it provides a bullish sign as Bitcoin\u2019s price trades above this level.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIn the realm of chart patterns, Bitcoin presents a symmetrical triangle pattern, climaxing with a breakout at the $27,350 mark. Historically, such breakouts are often precursors to bullish momentum, suggesting that Bitcoin\u2019s ascent might continue.\n\nTo wrap up, the trajectory for Bitcoin leans heavily bullish. For investors, there\u2019s a possible strategy in buying above the $27,500 mark, with targets set at either $28,800 or $29,300.\n\nHowever, a word of caution: should Bitcoin struggle to cross the $28,300 barrier, it could catalyze a selling trend.\n\nLooking forward, Bitcoin seems poised to challenge the $28,800 resistance level in the upcoming days. And, if the market remains favourable, there\u2019s a plausible chance for Bitcoin to strive for the $29,300 pinnacle.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay up-to-date with the world of digital assets by exploring our handpicked collection of the best 15 alternative cryptocurrencies and ICO projects to keep an eye on in 2023.\n\nOur list has been curated by professionals from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring expert advice and critical insights for your cryptocurrency investments.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to discover the potential of these digital assets and keep yourself informed.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews.com\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

        "title": "Ether futures ETFs fizzle on US debut - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe hotly anticipated rollout of exchange traded funds linked to ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, in the US has turned into a damp squib, with modest investor interest.\n\nNine ETFs holding futures contracts based on ether \u2014 the token of the Ethereum blockchain on which most \u201csmart contracts\u201d are written \u2014 debuted on the same day after regulators expedited the approval process to sidestep a potential US government shutdown, now averted.\n\nHowever the funds saw combined trading volume of just $6.6mn on Monday, according to data from AB Bernstein. This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday. Total trading volume was $6.6mn which was a disappointing start,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at Bernstein, who believed media attention was focused on the impending trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in New York.\n\nChhugani believed the lacklustre launch was \u201cnot surprising, given the continued weak retail sentiment\u201d towards cryptocurrencies, whereas BITO launched at the peak of a digital bull market.\n\n\u201cLike any listed security, success or failure cannot be measured on the first days of trading with market sentiment and the macro environment all having a bearing on performance,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products.\n\nDespite rallying 10 per cent last week in anticipation of the wave of launches, the price of ether is still down 64 per cent from its peak in November 2021.\n\nIt fell 4 per cent to $1,663 on Monday as the launches underwhelmed \u2014 although as the ETFs are futures products, rather than investing in the \u201cphysical\u201d spot cryptocurrency, purchases do not have any direct impact on the price.\n\nBitcoin is also down by 57 per cent from the highs it briefly touched in November 2021 as cryptocurrencies have proved to be procyclical \u201chigh beta\u201d assets.\n\nThe bulk of the trading that did take place was in the pre-existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which changed its name to add \u201cand Ether\u201d on Tuesday, when it broadened out to incorporate both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTF traded $4.6mn, according to Bernstein. The liveliest of the newly launched ETFs was the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which saw turnover of $879,000, ahead of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), at $516,000.\n\nNevertheless, Chhugani argued that, if and when more retail investors do return to crypto there will be \u201cwide availability of fair, secure and regulated products that help them attain crypto exposure without worrying about losing their savings from fraudulent exchanges\u201d.\n\nDave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry, believed the funds would be popular with financial advisers, who cannot invest client money in crypto itself, but can do so via ETFs.\n\nEther is reasonably popular in Europe, where ETPs investing in both crypto futures and the physical spot currencies are permitted in many jurisdictions. The 13 pure ether ETPs available on the continent have combined assets of \u20ac1.1bn, according to data from TrackInsight, compared to \u20ac2.6bn in 20 bitcoin ETPs.\n\nOverall, ether has a market capitalisation of $200bn, compared to $535bn for bitcoin and $83bn for tether, the third-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe launches come as the US ETF industry remains barred from what is sees as the crown jewel of the crypto firmament \u2014 spot bitcoin funds.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to allow the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, citing fears of fraud and manipulation on the unregulated exchanges on which the digital tokens trade, concerns that it does not have about futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated venue.\n\nThe SEC has thus far maintained this stance despite losing a court case to crypto manager Grayscale, which sued over the regulator\u2019s refusal to let it convert its $17.4bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private fund, into an ETF, in August.\n\nAfter that defeat, one school of thought was that the SEC might satisfy the court\u2019s ruling \u2014 and equalise its treatment of spot and futures bitcoin ETFs \u2014 by retroactively axing BITO and its sister bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s willingness to allow ether futures ETFs would appear to have put that idea to bed.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nChhugani believed a \u201cdistinct shift\u201d was now evident in the SEC\u2019s stance towards crypto ETFs, with applicants \u201cseeing a more engaged SEC being responsive, unlike the past\u201d.\n\nHe believed the first such bitcoin ETFs would be approved sometime around early January.\n\nSpot ether ETFs may follow not long after, with Ark and VanEck among the groups to have filed to launch products. Grayscale has also filed to convert its existing $5bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that, like bitcoin, the listing of these ethereum futures ETFs is ultimately paving the way for a spot ethereum ETF in the US,\u201d said Duke."

        "content": "A UK man who accidentally threw \u00a3165m of Bitcoin cryptocurrency into landfill has revealed his latest plan to retrieve his digital fortune.\n\nAfter spending a decade fighting with Newport City Council, James Howells told the Independent he\u2019s decided to \u201cgo to battle\u201d.\n\nThe 37-year-old IT systems engineer threw away his hard drive by mistake in 2013.\n\nHe put the hardware from an old laptop in a black bag in his hallway.\n\nIt contained 8,000 Bitcoins in cryptocurrency.\n\nREAD MORE: The Bitcoin pioneers who accidentally lost nearly $1 billion between them\n\n\u201cI woke up the next morning and my ex-partner had already taken the bags to the landfill site; she thought she was doing me a favour, it wasn\u2019t her fault\u201d he said to the newspaper.\n\nHe planned to use environmental health and data recovery experts to help him recover the hard drive.\n\nOnce legally at the dump site, he hopes AI and a mechanical arm can help him sift through the debris and recover his funds from the gadget.\n\nHe also wants to use robot dogs to deter thieves from searching for and stealing the digital funds.\n\nHowever, the council have refused his access to the landfill, despite Howells offering to cover any costs.\n\nHis new legal team wrote to the local authority on 6 September to request access.\n\nUnsplash\n\nThe council was given two weeks to respond before possible escalation in the courts.\n\nHowells hopes once his hard drive is recovered, he can make Newport the UK\u2019s first \u201ccrypto hub\u201d.\n\nHe\u2019s promised to gift the 160,000 residents \u00a350 in bitcoin each and install crypto point-of-sale devices in all independent stores.\n\n\u201cThe idea is then people will have to learn how to use bitcoin, and that will then help them themselves going forward in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUntil the door is fully slammed shut by a court, then I will continue trying, as I have over the last 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nUnsplash\n\n\u201cThe court is the last step for me, I am no longer asking Newport City Council for access, I am now going to be asking a judge for access.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Newport City Council made the following comment.\n\n\u201cNewport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins, which may or may not be in our landfill site,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe council has told Mr. Howells on multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cThe council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear and consistent in our responses that we cannot assist Mr. Howells in this matter. Our position has not changed.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC), along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market, has opened the week on a very positive note, the gains are starting to slow down, and the battle between bulls and bears intensifies, focused specifically on one key price territory.\n\nAs it happens, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset needs to preserve its bull market support level at $24,900. Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s goodnight to the bull,\u201d as observed by pseudonymous cryptocurrency expert CoinsKid on a 4-hour Bitcoin chart shared in an X post on October 3.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis and prediction. Source: CoinsKid\n\nAccording to the expert\u2019s observations, should the maiden cryptocurrency indeed succeed in holding this key support level, its next move could take it towards and beyond the psychologically significant $30,000 level.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $27,593, which represents a decline of 2.7% in the last 24 hours while still recording increases of 5.02% across the previous seven days and a 6.34% gain on its monthly chart, as per the most recent data.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, another pseudonymous crypto trading analyst, Cryptoinsightuk, noted that the chart patterns of Bitcoin\u2019s weekly relative strength index (RSI) indicated the possibility of a 1,100% move \u201cin the right circumstance with a supply squeeze\u201d and the introduction of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThat said, popular crypto expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is not as bullish although still highly optimistic, predicting a return of enthusiasm among investors in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to the potential spot BTC ETF approval and the traditional pre-halving price surge, looking at a possible $40,000, as Finbold reported on October 2.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "What will the next Bitcoin halving cycle bring?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event is exactly what it sounds like - it reduces the total supply of Bitcoin by 50 per cent. Picture Shutterstock\n\nThis is branded content.\n\nData by exchanges shows that around 4.6 million Australians hold cryptocurrencies of some description, and Bitcoin is the most popular.\n\n\n\nIf you're one of the Aussies holding the dominant coin, it's about time you learned about the Bitcoin halving cycle and what it means for your investment.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving event?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event is exactly what it sounds like - it reduces the total supply of Bitcoin by 50 per cent.\n\n\n\nThis profitable event is hard coded into Bitcoin's infrastructure, which means it'll never stop until the total supply reaches 21 million Bitcoins.\n\nWhen a coin's supply is reduced, it means each holder has a larger percentage of the coin, which in turn makes it more valuable.\n\n\n\nEven though nothing is guaranteed in crypto because of its high volatility, history has taught us that Bitcoin's halving leads to an increase in value and the start of a bull run.\n\nAn Overview of Past Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nWhen Bitcoin's total supply reached 10,500,000 in November 2012, it set off the first Bitcoin halving event that led to a boost in market value.\n\n\n\nThis event was followed by a halving in 2016 and 2020, which means the next event will take place in 2024.\n\nIf you're not already holding Bitcoin in your crypto portfolio, now is the time to start investing.\n\n\n\nAustralians can buy Bitcoin (BTC) via CoinSpot, the largest crypto trading platform in the country, and we suggest using a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy to help manage value fluctuations.\n\nHow Bitcoin Halving Impacts Crypto\n\nIf you analyse price charts from the first two Bitcoin halving events, you'll notice the following two patterns taking place:\n\nBitcoin's value begins to increase around one year prior to the halving.\n\nBitcoin's value decreases around one year following the event, and it continues until the next one.\n\nThroughout the most recent cycle, which began on May 11 2020, the same pattern occurred and Bitcoin along with many other cryptocurrencies reached their all-time high, with the following events taking place during the May 2024 Bitcoin halving event:\n\nA continuing increase in Bitcoin's value during Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.\n\nA potential bull run starting prior to May 2024.\n\nMaking a Profit During a Bitcoin Halving Cycle\n\nBitcoin halving changes the total supply of Bitcoin, which is proven to kickstart an increase in value. Given how influential Bitcoin is in the crypto market, it's also enough to ignite a bull run.\n\n\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin's value started to rise around one year before the halving, which means the best time to buy is when the coin hits the bottom.\n\nEven though the bottom has already taken place during the current cycle, there are still several months to begin accumulating Bitcoins.\n\n"
