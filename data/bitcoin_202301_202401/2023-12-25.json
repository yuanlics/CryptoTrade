        "title": "Spot bitcoin ETF approval may be coming in January, experts say. Here's what it means for investors - CNBC",
        "content": "Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged in 2023 as investors await approval for the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which would be a milestone for cryptocurrency investors, experts say. In early December, the digital currency topped $44,000 for the first time since April 2022, and year-to-date gains were above 160%, as of Dec. 21, mostly fueled by optimism for a spot bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, discussions between the Securities and Exchange Commission and asset managers hoping to list bitcoin ETFs have advanced to technical details, signaling to some experts that an approval could be imminent. More than a dozen firms \u2014 including BlackRock , WisdomTree, Valkyrie and others \u2014 are waiting for the green light from the SEC, which could come in early January.\n\n\"For ETF investors, this would be the best product on the market,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \"All the other options right now have flaws to varying degrees.\" Currently, U.S. investors can buy bitcoin futures ETFs, which own bitcoin futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. The long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF would invest in the digital asset directly.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nIf the SEC signs off on a spot bitcoin ETF, Armour anticipates a \"batch approval,\" with multiple ETF listings on the same day. \"I would expect them to rule on spot ETFs holistically because most issuers are taking similar approaches\" with applications, he said. \"There are a lot of good signs that the SEC is taking the most recent batch of filings more seriously,\" Armour said. \"I'm more optimistic about a bitcoin ETF than ever before.\" Some crypto investors expect a bitcoin rally upon approval, but it's also possible the price will dip as investors sell to collect profits, Armour said.\n\nCryptocurrency remains an 'extremely volatile' asset\n\nWhile SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF may make the asset class more accessible to the masses, experts urge investors to consider their risk tolerance and goals before piling in. \"I think it depends on the investor,\" said certified financial planner Ben Smith, founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee. If you're a more aggressive investor with an appetite for higher risk, a spot bitcoin ETF could fit into a diversified portfolio, he said.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "The price of bitcoin has slipped lower over the past 24 hours, pulling back below the $42,000 mark as sell pressure increases. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell 3% over the past 24 hours to $41,998 at 1:00 p.m. ET, according to The Block data.\n\nBitcoin BTC -5.59% 's retracement follows a rise in factors contributing to sell pressure on the digital asset, particularly among the short-term holder cohort.\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, more than 25,000 bitcoins have been transferred from cold wallets to exchanges in the last 24 hours. The movement contributes to the liquid supply of the asset, thereby influencing price dynamics.\n\nBitcoin's circulating supply in profit has moved closer to a yearly high of just over 90%, with the current measure according the The Block's Data Dashboard at 89.4%. Also, data from The Block shows an uptick in transaction activity among the short-term holder cohort, those who have held the digital asset for 90 days or less.\n\nBitcoin network transactions spike\n\nTransactions on the bitcoin network, meanwhile, have reached an all-time high. According to data from The Block, the number of transactions on the bitcoin network reached an all-time high of 633,000. Daily trading volume on the bitcoin network now stands at over $28 billion.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThis is a retracement from a mid-December yearly high of over $38 billion, but still almost twice the trading volume seen throughout November and October of this year.\n\nThe recent volatility in the bitcoin market has caused the liquidation of over $44 million in leveraged positions. According to data from Coinglass, the vast majority of these liquidations have been shorts, with over $38 million wiped out in the past 24 hours, compared to only around $6 million in long positions.\n\nApproval of spot bitcoin ETFs\n\nYear-to-date gains for bitcoin are currently above 155%. The digital asset's gains have been mostly fueled by optimism that the Securities Exchange Commission is getting ready to approve one or more of the spot bitcoin ETF applications that have been filed with the regulatory body. More than a dozen firms including BlackRock, WisdomTree and Valkyrie are waiting for the green light from the SEC.\n\nAnalysts anticipate spot bitcoin ETFs being approved in the first quarter of 2024. However, ETC Group Head of Research Andr\u00e9 Dragosch believes \"the approvals will only lead to a short-term price spike at first.\"\n\n\"However, the capital entering bitcoin gradually, over time will double the price of the digital asset in 2024,\" Dragosch added."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value soared from the cost of electricity to mine Bitcoin in 2009 to over $43,407 by 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance fell from 100% to 52% by 2023, diversifying the crypto landscape.\n\nThe crypto market cap grew from zero in 2009 to $1.63 trillion in 2023, outlining Bitcoin\u2019s and the crypto industries\u2019 meteoric rise over the last decade and a half.\n\nBitcoin demonstrated resilience and volatility, fluctuating prices due to global events and trends.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey from a price of $0.003 in 2009 to over $37,000 in 2023, alongside its fluctuating market dominance, highlights its status as a top-performing asset and store of value. Despite its dominance dropping from 100% to 52%, reflecting a more diverse crypto market, Bitcoin\u2019s significant volatility has been central to its rapid value appreciation.\n\nThis growth, mirrored by the crypto market cap\u2019s rise to $1.4 trillion in 2023, showcases Bitcoin\u2019s impact and profitability in the financial world over the last 15 years. Below is an outline of its trajectory, taking the price on Christmas day.\n\nYear Bitcoin Price On Christmas Day\n\n\u2013 $ Bitcoin Dominance CoinMarketCap\n\n\u2013 $ Billion 2009 0.003 100% 0.00 2010 0.25 99.5% 0.05 2011 4.07 99% 0.10 2012 13.34 98% 0.10 2013 669.50 98% 1.50 2014 320.20 98% 4.44 2015 449.92 99% 6.86 2016 883.73 95% 14.85 2017 14,146.95 48% 494.90 2018 3,881.91 55% 122.02 2019 7,206.91 70% 184.89 2020 24,165.49 69% 648.67 2021 50,654.88 40% 2.37 T 2022 16,801.54 43% 770.4 2023 43,407.50 52% 1.63 T\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Shift From 2009\u2019s Negligible Value To 2012\u2019s Steady Growth\n\n2009 To 2012\n\nIn its infancy, Bitcoin was a mere concept, valued at the price of electricity necessary to mine Bitcoin, which was roughly $0.003 in 2009, with the entire crypto market cap at virtually zero.\n\nBy 2012, as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose to $13.34, the total market cap reached $0.10 billion, indicating a young but growing interest in the cryptocurrency space. This period laid the groundwork for the crypto revolution despite the infant market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Early Growth: Price Trends And Public Sentiment (2013 To 2016)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Emergence: A Look Back At 2013 To 2016\n\nThis era marked Bitcoin\u2019s entry into public consciousness. 2013 saw a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $669.50 and the market cap expanding to $1.50 billion, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nHowever, the following years witnessed fluctuations, with the market cap reflecting these changes at $4.44 billion in 2014 and $6.86 billion in 2015, finally reaching $14.85 billion in 2016. These figures underscored the growing but volatile nature of the market.\n\nBitcoin Surge And Volatility Between 2017 And 2019\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride: From 2017\u2019s Record Highs To 2019\u2019s Recovery\n\nDuring this era, Bitcoin experienced a period of substantial growth and corrections. The year 2017 was a milestone, with Bitcoin\u2019s price reaching $14,146.95 and the total market cap soaring to a staggering $494.90 billion.\n\nThis bubble, however, was followed by a significant correction in 2018, with the market cap dropping to $122.02 billion. The market cap 2019 ($184.89 billion) reflected a partial recovery, indicative of a market that was beginning to mature and stabilize.\n\nBitcoin During The COVID-19 Period (Between 2020 And 2022): Market Resilience and Pandemic Impact\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Evolution Through Pandemic Turbulence\n\nThe pandemic years were a testament to Bitcoin\u2019s resilience. In 2020, the price escalated to $24,165.49, with the market cap reaching $648.67 billion, driven by a surge in institutional investment and a quest for digital safe-haven assets.\n\nThe trend continued in 2021, with the market cap peaking at $2.37 trillion. However, 2022 saw a pullback in both price ($16,801.54) and market cap ($770.4 billion), reflecting global economic uncertainties and market corrections.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Throughout History\n\nBitcoin has stood as a pioneering force since its inception in 2009. Initially, Bitcoin held an unchallenged dominance of 100%, reflecting its status as the sole player and first cryptocurrency in the crypto market.\n\nThis dominance, a measure of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, remained exceedingly high in the early years, hovering around 98-99%. However, as the crypto market expanded and diversified, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance gradually reduced.\n\nFrom a commanding presence of nearly 100% in 2009, it experienced fluctuations, notably dropping to 48% in 2017 during the ICO boom and Ethereum\u2019s introduction into the crypto market in 2015-2017, then partially recovering and eventually stabilizing to a more contested position of around 52% by 2023.\n\nThis shift illustrates not just the growth of Bitcoin in absolute terms but also the rapid emergence and expansion of other cryptocurrencies, reshaping the digital asset landscape.\n\nChristmas Day And Bitcoin: Understanding Historical Price Patterns\n\nThe Christmas day price analysis reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s performance during this festive season mirrors the broader market trends. The market cap data adds context to these trends, showing how the entire crypto market has responded in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nFor instance, the high market cap during the bull runs of 2017 and the pandemic years contrasts with the lower market caps during the bearish phases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day Price Predictions: Expert Opinions\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s future, especially based on Christmas Day prices, is difficult to predict. Adam Back, a key figure in the cryptocurrency sector, believes that Bitcoin\u2019s value could reach $100,000 before its next halving in April 2024.\n\nAdam Back explains that his prediction is influenced by factors such as the historical impact of Bitcoin halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price, in prior years, increasing mainstream adoption, and broader economic conditions. However, caution is always advised to crypto investors because the crypto market is still young and influenced by various factors. Making predictions is challenging but intriguing for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s evolution to a store of value asset, digital gold, from the cost of electricity to a value of mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars is not just a story of financial growth but also one of technological innovation, evolving public perception and education, and the ever-changing dynamics of the global economy.\n\nThe fluctuating dominance of Bitcoin, once the unrivaled king of cryptocurrencies, is now sharing the stage with many other digital assets, particularly Ethereum, which highlights the diversification and maturation of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow has Bitcoin\u2019s price changed on Christmas Day since 2009?\n\nSince 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day price has grown from just $0.003 to $43,407.50 in 2023, reflecting its evolution from a novel concept to a significant financial asset.\n\nWhat does the decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance indicate?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decreasing dominance, from 100% in 2009 to 52% in 2023, indicates a diversifying crypto market with the emergence of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expanding the digital asset landscape.\n\nHow did the crypto market cap evolve alongside Bitcoin\u2019s growth?\n\nThe crypto market cap has grown significantly, from virtually zero in 2009 to $1.4 trillion in 2023, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price increase and indicating increased investor interest and market maturity.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s historical Christmas Day prices predict its future?\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day prices provide insights into historical trends, predicting its future based on these prices is complex due to the influence of various unpredictable market factors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided is for educational and analytical purposes only. The historical data on Bitcoin\u2019s value on Christmas Day is not indicative of future performance or investment advice.

        "content": "Crypto investors of all sorts are patiently waiting on spot bitcoin ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) soaring in anticipation of the potential sign off. Dinara Co-Founder & CEO Laurence Latimer joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what would happen both immediately, and down the line, if the ETF is approved and how other cryptocurrencies can benefit from it.\n\nLatimer believes \"it would be a massive event for the industry\" and that it would be a \"great support for the institutionalization of digital assets and the mainstreaming of digital assets, widespread adoption.\" However, he also believes that \"much of the price movement has largely been priced in\" and that there is some \"frothiness\" in bitcoin prices.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: As the markets price in rate cuts into the new year, those in crypto are betting big money on a spot Bitcoin ETF and it becoming a reality as the SEC gives companies a new deadline of December 29 to make final changes to their applications. The new deadline has led many industry watchers to predict a wave of approvals come January, but not necessarily news there. Bitcoin is now trading above $42,000, reaching levels this month we haven't seen since April of 2022.\n\nAnd for his take on what is coming next for crypto, let's bring in Laurence Latimer, the co-founder and CEO of Dinara, a crypto-trading platform. Laurence, thank you for coming in here today. So what is the importance of this spot Bitcoin ETF? I've been tracking this for months. I've been seeing the enthusiasm. But I guess the big question is when we get this finally maybe on January 10, is it a sell-the-news event?\n\nLAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, and I thank you for having me. First of all, as we come down to thinking about what's happening for the Bitcoin approvals-- Bitcoin ETF approvals, the reality is much of the enthusiasm, as you just said, much of the attention has-- and much of the price movement has largely been priced in. That's what we think here at Dinara, and that's certainly what we believe.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's going to be a massive event for the industry. The work that's gone into that from some of the largest firms in the industry has been happening over two-- some of them over two years. So it is a really massive event. It's a great sort of support for the institutionalization of digital assets and the mainstreaming of digital assets, widespread adoption. But we do think there's maybe a little bit of frothiness there and that the kind of price movement that many are expecting to see may already be mostly priced in.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, do you think about the perhaps tail, the longer tail of it? We'll see a jump, perhaps, early on in inflows into some of these ETFs, but then what after that? What is perhaps a good baseline for us to consider looking at the amount of flows that actually make their way into one of the riskier parts of the asset classes out there?\n\nLAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, well, you know, we made some predictions for 2024, and so this sort of falls firmly in the space there. We think that there's going to be some real meaningful appreciation across the whole industry. In October, the overall market cap for digital assets sat at around $1 trillion. It's now about $1.6 trillion. We think by the end of 2025, you'll be sitting at about $2.5 trillion in overall market cap. So if you kind of averaged that across the industry, we think there's another 50% or so upside built into the, you know, pricing of all assets. We think Bitcoin's among them.\n\nWhat we'll see is that ETF demand that's created there will put a nice floor and support for price movement. We also think there's some optimism around the legislative front. We hope to see some thoughtful legislative action at some point in 2024 as well. That will, again, put some upward pressure.\n\nAnd then you have Bitcoin halving, which is a technical piece that's happening, I believe, in April. And that traditionally has also put some upward pressure on the price of the asset."

        "content": "Investors of virtual digital currencies, popularly known as cryptocurrencies, have experienced a roller coaster ride in the year 2023. However, cryptocurrencies have given profitable returns this year. The grand old cryptocurrency, Bitcoin price has jumped over 160% this year, which is second best to over 350% generated during 2020.\n\nThis year, the crypto space has witnessed a myriad of regulatory onslaught that tested investors\u2019 nerves. But, this hard to categorise asset class has literally dwarfed any other asset category when compared with returns it has generated and rewarded investors in minting money.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the sector was plagued with many obstacles. Be it FTX, TerraLuma debacle, inviting regulatory ire, suits filed against many leading exchanges, several countries shutting the doors fearing the consequences - losing or rather handing over economic power into the hands of private currencies, etc.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s 160% rebound in 2023 is a gamble on ETF \u2018Demand Shock\u2019\n\nThese concerns filled the air of negativity in market pricing. It is this situation that caught the eye of savvy investors - the large asset backed institutional investors.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, many others jumped in with spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF), clearly indicating the huge institutional appetite waiting to grab their share.\n\nAccording to a private surveyor, it is expected that approximately $60.6 billion could flow into Bitcoin from the combined stock and bond ETFs, and about $9.9 billion from the gold market, totalling around $70.5 billion in potential new capital influx.\n\nCurrently, the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies stands at $1.66 trillion.\n\nYear 2024 holds many promises for crypto assets. Artificial intelligence or AI is set to go on stream which will create immense potential for the blockchain ecosystem. The decentralised ledger technology (DLT) will play a crucial role in the financial sector. Hence, building a suitable regulatory environment will be a top priority.\n\n(Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here!)\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to 2024, there is considerable excitement within the crypto community regarding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and several innovations taking place in the Defi space. The approvals of Spot ETF applications filed by various institutional investors is also another key event the industry is looking forward to,\" said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay.\n\nThese are some of the areas that were dwelled into during 2023 and are slowly and surely getting addressed.\n\nIn fact, the deliberations over several key issues during the World Economic Forum held in India and across the globe helped alleviate some concerns. There is consensus over building a global framework to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s success in the coming year will hinge on fostering a sense of security among consumers. Transparency, strong ethics, and values will be the guiding principles for businesses to thrive amidst the dynamic crypto landscape,\" Pagidipati said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin rose on rumors in 2023. How to predict what comes next?\n\nMeanwhile, the bitcoin mining company Micrastrategy\u2019s CEO Michael Saylor continued to accumulate bitcoins and he is now believed to be sitting on profits. Saylor began buying the crypto more than three years ago and at last check held more than 158,000 bitcoins, worth approximately $4.7 billion.\n\nHis firm has so far sold only once - A 708 bitcoin sale in December 2022, worth $11 million at the time.\n\nThere are a few reasons behind Saylor accumulating bitcoin. ETF approval by Securities Exchanges Commission (SEC) and bitcoin halving in April.\n\nAccording to Saylor, mainstream investors have lacked a \u201chigh bandwidth\" compliant channel for investing in Bitcoin, a gap that the spot Bitcoin ETF is poised to fill.\n\nFollowing spot bitcoin ETF approval, the next important event is a supply shock during April\u2019s halving, reducing daily Bitcoin production from 900 to 450.\n\nCryptocurrencies are still in nascent stages of growth.

        "title": "MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet produces over 300% gain for investors in 2023 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article MSTR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nMicroStrategy was founded almost 35 years ago and existed for most of its history as a little-known software company focused on business intelligence. But in 2023, the stock has soared 337%, making it one of the biggest gainers in the U.S. among companies valued at $5 billion or more, topping Nvidia's 234% rally and Meta's 194% surge. Unlike its tech peers, which rely on revenue growth and market share gains to fuel their stock prices, MicroStrategy's investor appeal is almost exclusively due to bitcoin . The company began buying the cryptocurrency in mid-2020 and has since amassed roughly 174,530 bitcoins, worth about $7.65 billion as of late Friday. Wall Street is so enamored by the story that the stock has about doubled bitcoin's gain this year. \"It's really bitcoin,\" said Joseph Vafi, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has a buy recommendation on the stock. \"All the other stuff is healthy and doing a good job, they're not neglecting it. It's doing well, it's leading software in its sector. But it's basically something we don't have to worry about.\" MicroStrategy's market cap is $8.5 billion, meaning 90% of its valued is tied directly to its bitcoin holdings. When bitcoin plummets or soars, so does MicroStrategy. In 2022, bitcoin's 64% drop pushed MicroStrategy down 74%. Even after its huge pop this year, MicroStrategy shares are still below where they were trading at their high in 2021, during peak crypto. The bitcoin strategy dates back to July 2020, when the company said it would start putting some of its cash towards alternative assets, including digital currencies. At the time, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $1.1 billion, built on a software business that had been shrinking since 2015. Annual revenue was just under $500 million, and profit was minimal.\n\nAt the halfway point of 2020, MicroStrategy had just over $530 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Co-founder Michael Saylor, who was CEO at the time, saw that money sitting virtually idle on the sidelines due to low interest rates and wanted to put it to work. From there, he had to decide whether equities, precious metals or bitcoin would be the best use of funds. \"The reason we decided to buy bitcoin is because bitcoin represents a form of digital gold,\" Saylor said on the first earnings call after the company announced its strategy. \"It's harder than gold. It's smarter, it's stronger, it's faster than gold.\" Saylor's decision created a way for investors to have stake in bitcoin through routine purchases of stock, rather than having to buy the coins directly. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO last year and assumed the role of executive chairman, told CNBC's Morgan Brennan last week that he expects the bull market in bitcoin to continue next year. He said 99.9% of the capital in the world is invested in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities, with only 0.1% allocated toward bitcoin. \"People, as they get educated on digital assets, are realizing that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to this digital asset and so they're moving from .1 to .2%,\" said Saylor, who co-authored a book about bitcoin last year titled \"What is Money?\"\n\nwatch now\n\nNovel use of cash\n\nMicroStrategy isn't the first company to put some of its cash pile into alternative investments, and it's not the last to look for ways to generate outsized returns on that money. Earlier this month, GameStop gave CEO Ryan Cohen, who gained minor celebrity status as an investor, permission to use company cash to purchase stock. But MicroStrategy is unique in that it's become viewed almost exclusively as a bitcoin holding company. \"Michael Saylor's kind of a visionary,\" said Vafi. \"He saw this as an opportunity to really exploit the fact that they had a lot of cash and a pristine balance sheet and start this bitcoin treasury experiment. And it's worked out well and so they're continuing down that path.\" In analyzing why MicroStrategy's stock has so dramatically outperformed bitcoin this year, Vafi described it as a \"scarcity premium,\" because there are limited ways for equity investors to tap the market. That's potentially changing in the new year, as investors gear up for a flurry of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, there are bitcoin futures ETFs, which are comprised of contracts to buy and sell bitcoin but not of the cryptocurrency itself. And investors can buy into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , a fund that owns bitcoin and trades over the counter rather than on a major exchange. Grayscale sued the SEC last year after the regulator denied its application to create a spot bitcoin ETF on concerns about investor protections. In August of this year, an appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale, a decision than many in the industry viewed as paving the way for a new crop of ETFs. Asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have filed with the SEC for their own products. Vafi said the prospect of competition poses little threat to MicroStrategy. \"I call it right now a very high-class problem to a certain degree,\" he said. \"If a bitcoin ETF gets approved, the price of bitcoin is probably headed higher and potentially materially higher.\" MicroStrategy also presents more than just a bet on the direction of bitcoin. While ETFs are passively managed, MicroStrategy has the option to put its bitcoin holdings to work, using them, for example, as collateral to create more business opportunities. \"MicroStrategy is encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment around bitcoin as well as the increased institutional demand that we are seeing today,\" Shirish Jajodia, the company's vice president of treasury and investor relations, told CNBC in an email. \"We do believe it will have a positive impact on the adoption of bitcoin by mainstream investors as well as corporations.\" MicroStrategy's software business is a big plus too, Saylor said on the company's most recent earnings call. It's a proven cash flow generator, enabling the company to buy more bitcoin, he said. For the many investors betting against MicroStrategy, it's been a tough year. As of early December, crypto stock short sellers were down $6.1 billion for the year, with the rally in Coinbase hurting them the most, according to S3 Partners. In the first three quarters of the year, short sellers spent $2.19 billion covering their bets, the firm said, with the majority of the buying in Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Short sellers this year have lost $4 billion on Coinbase and $1.4 billion on MicroStrategy, according to data provided by S3 last week. Some 23% of MicroStrategy's shares available to the public are shorted, S3 said, which is second highest among crypto companies, behind only bitcoin miner Marathon Digital . The average for U.S. stocks is 5%. MicroStrategy shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to snapping pu bitcoin. The company said it purchased roughly 16,130 bitcoins in November for over $593 million, even with the price continuing to rise. That's more bitcoin than it's bought in any full quarter since the first three months of 2021. \u2014 CNBC's Kate Dore contributed to this report WATCH: Bitcoin bounces back above $43,000"

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin in India - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The grand old cryptocurrency has had plenty of aficionados in the Indian crypto space. Consensus and YouGov conducted a global survey on crypto and Web3 in unison. They published a report on June 23, revealing that 32% of Indians had bought cryptocurrencies at some point, and 21% still owned digital assets. It also revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) dominated the cryptocurrencies purchased.\n\nLevying a 30% tax on income received from digital assets didn\u2019t dent the sentiment in the country regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a report published by the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, the digital assets market in India is expected to clock $241 million by 2030.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, India comes across as a country with millions of prospective cryptocurrency investors. Based on data from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 68% of this demographic falls within the 15\u201364 age range, indicating a higher likelihood of interest in cryptocurrencies such as BTC.\n\nThis article explains how to buy Bitcoin in India on centralized and decentralized exchanges, systematic investment plan (SIP), over-the-counter (OTC) deals or direct peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a centralized crypto exchange in India\n\nCatering to millions of prospective Bitcoin buyers, there are hundreds of centralized exchanges operating in India, both local and multinational. One needs to check factors such as ease of use, security and low fees when zeroing in on an exchange.\n\nOne needs to complete the exchange registration process, including verifying their phone number and email. The next step is Know Your Customer (KYC), a government-mandated procedure that requires the person to submit a soft copy of their identification documents with the exchange. A team verifies these documents before giving access to the applicant. KYC regulations aim to prevent financial crimes such as identity theft and money laundering.\n\nOne can buy Bitcoin via OTC or P2P trading on a centralized exchange. OTC trading has a minimum order size. For instance, CoinDCX has a minimum order size of 15,000 Tether (USDT) or 12,00,000 Indian rupees (whichever is lesser), while WazirX OTC Desk serves large crypto volumes worth $50,000 and above.\n\nOne may take the P2P route to buy BTC for lower denominations. The role of the exchange is to facilitate a direct deal between the buyer and the seller while acting as an escrow, ensuring nobody is at a loss. The exchange holds the money paid to the seller. Once the buyer receives BTC, the amount is transferred. The buyer can pay in fiat or any other cryptocurrency acceptable to the seller.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a decentralized crypto exchange in India\n\nAs the name suggests, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is designed to facilitate P2P transactions without any decisive role for a single person or a group of executives. Instead, based on the input provided by participants, a smart contract executes the transactions.\n\nDirect transactions between users on the blockchain eliminate any need for DEXs to act as intermediaries. As trades get executed on top of the blockchain network via a smart contract, every transaction incurs a fee along with the trading fee. This is, however, less than what one incurs on centralized exchanges. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs do not take custody of users\u2019 funds, so the end-user always controls their digital assets.\n\nTo execute a transaction on a DEX, one needs to connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the exchange. However, DEXs don\u2019t allow buying Bitcoin with fiat currency, so one needs to transfer another cryptocurrency for Bitcoin. Transactions can be conducted without fulfilling KYC requirements. While transactions on DEXs might be anonymous for now, they could be brought into the regulatory ecosystem as it evolves.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin via SIP in India\n\nA systematic investment plan is a disciplined approach to regularly invest a fixed amount in assets at predefined intervals. SIP allows one to keep buying Bitcoin consistently over a predefined period. SIPs have been a fundamental component of conventional market instruments, including stocks and mutual funds. Thanks to SIPs, investors can capitalize on market fluctuations while retaining their portfolios for a long time.\n\nTo invest in SIPs, one needs to download the app of a service provider offering SIPs, complete the registration and KYC procedures, and select the relevant option on the screen. The next step is to choose the coin one wants to invest in (in this case, BTC), set the day and frequency of the plan, and start the SIP.\n\nHow to make direct P2P crypto transactions in India\n\nTo conduct direct peer-to-peer crypto transactions, one can opt for either on-exchange or off-exchange methods. On-exchange transactions involve using a P2P service on a crypto exchange platform where users register, complete identity verification (KYC), and then browse and initiate transactions with other users. The platform holds the cryptocurrency in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction.\n\nOff-exchange or OTC transactions require finding a trusted buyer or seller, often through personal networks or OTC brokers, and directly agreeing on transaction terms. Payment is usually made via bank transfer or digital wallets, and the cryptocurrency is transferred directly to the receiver\u2019s wallet. In both methods, it\u2019s important to prioritize security and adhere to local regulations.\n\nDirect P2P cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted through the exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly between individuals, offering various payment options, including bank transfers and online wallets.\n\nThey typically charge low trading fees, provide noncustodial wallets, and use escrow services to enhance security. With features like auto-matching and multiple payment methods, these exchanges cater to diverse needs while ensuring user safety and minimizing the risk of fraud and hacks in the P2P crypto market.\n\nModes of payment for cryptocurrency transactions in India\n\nCrypto exchanges in India allow one to transfer money using bank transfer (debit card or credit card) via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI). When conducting P2P trading, the seller might take payments in any mode they prefer, along with regular IMPS and UPI. These modes include regular Paytm, a digital payment service, and Lightning UPI, fast real-time transactions on Paytm with a single click without a PIN.\n\nOne can also pay for BTC using other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH), Polkadot\u2019s DOT (DOT) and Cardano (ADA), though many sellers prefer using stablecoins, such as USDT and USD Coin (USDC). However, buying Bitcoin via PayPal is not supported in India yet.\n\nMethods to store Bitcoin\n\nAfter buying Bitcoin, the next step is to store it securely. One can choose from several types of Bitcoin wallets, such as desktop wallets, mobile wallets, online wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. Many buyers leave their Bitcoin with the exchange, which may not be suitable because the exchange holds the cryptocurrency and not the buyer.\n\nHardware wallets and paper wallets store Bitcoin offline, making it safe from thieves, though one still has to be careful not to lose the private key or the paper wallet itself. Mobile wallets have the advantage of convenience, and one can carry their BTC around and use it the way they want at any time. Desktop and online wallets typically offer a level of security comparable to keeping Bitcoin on an exchange.\n\nWallets can also be categorized as custodial or noncustodial. When storing funds in custodial wallets, users have no control over their private keys, and funds lie in the custody of a third party. In contrast, noncustodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys and, subsequently, their funds.\n\nBitcoin regulations in India\n\nIndian law requires anyone who has made gains from trading virtual digital assets (VDAs), including Bitcoin, to pay tax at a rate of 30% plus 4% cess, a tax levied on the tax for spending on a specific purpose. When buying Bitcoin on an Indian exchange, the onus to ensure compliance is on the exchange.\n\nHowever, when buying BTC on an international exchange or conducting a P2P transaction where BTC exchanges hands, the buyer and seller must ascertain that compliance requirements are met.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin in India?\n\nAlthough purchasing Bitcoin in India presents possible investment prospects, careful thought must be given. Regulatory uncertainties exist despite the legality of cryptocurrencies. Decision-making is impacted by variables such as market volatility, a lack of detailed guidelines and prospective policy changes.\n\nAccessibility via exchanges that facilitate rupee transfers is a benefit; however, there are still restrictions on some payment options. It\u2019s critical to assess one\u2019s own risk tolerance, comprehend market dynamics, and stay current on regulatory changes.\n\nEven though Bitcoin offers opportunities for investing, careful consideration and knowledge of India\u2019s changing cryptocurrency scene are necessary before making any decisions.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

Additionally, the bullish sentiment is likely to spread to altcoins as well. Hence, if Bitcoin rises, several altcoins are likely to march higher.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIt is always tricky to predict which coins will outperform in the next bull phase because every bull market has its own set of leaders. However, it is sometimes seen that coins leading the markets out of the bear phase and holding on to their gains are the ones that are likely to do well.\n\nThe tokens chosen have risen sharply from their 52-week lows, indicating solid demand from the bulls. Let\u2019s look at their possible target objectives on the upside and the critical support levels on the downside.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has risen sharply from its November 2022 low of $15,460, signaling the start of a new uptrend. The momentum picked up after buyers propelled the price above $32,000.\n\nBTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls remain in command. Buyers will try to push the price to $48,000 and then to $52,100. This zone is likely to act as a formidable resistance in the near term, but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-week exponential moving average ($34,000), the uptrend may continue.\n\nA rally above $52,100 will complete a rounding bottom pattern. This setup has a target objective of $88,740. However, before the BTC/USD pair reaches this level, the bears will mount a vigorous defense at the current all-time high of $69,000.\n\nOn the downside, the 20-week EMA is the vital support to watch out for. If this level gives way, the pair may drop to the 50-week simple moving average ($28,566).\n\nBTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat. Buyers will try to drive the price above $45,000 and start the next leg of the up-move. If they do that, the pair may climb to $48,000 and then to $52,100.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($41,306), it will suggest the start of a pullback. The pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($38,079) and later to the crucial support at $32,000. The deeper the retreat, the greater the time needed to start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) has been gradually trying to recover after the sharp fall during the last bear market. The price has risen sharply from the June 2022 low of $880, indicating that bulls are making a comeback.\n\nETH/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action of the past few days has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which completed when bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $2,143. The pattern target of this bullish setup is $3,406. Sellers may fiercely protect the zone between $3,406 and $3,582, but if the bulls prevail, the ETH/USD pair could rise to $4,000 and later to $4,868.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break below the moving averages. That will indicate aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels. The trend will favor the bears if the pair plunges below the uptrend line of the triangle. The failure of a bullish pattern is a negative sign and may result in further downside.\n\nETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rebound off the breakout level of $2,143 shows the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. A break and close above $2,403 will signal the resumption of the uptrend. The pair may then climb to $3,000.\n\nMeanwhile, sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to yank the price back below $2,143. If that happens, it will suggest that higher levels are being viewed as a selling opportunity. The pair may then plummet to the strong support at $1,900. That may keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for some more time.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a huge outperformer in the past few months. It has skyrocketed from its low of $8 in December 2022 to the current levels.\n\nSOL/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-week EMA ($43) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating a potential trend change. Although the risk of a fall to the 20-week EMA remains high, the dips are likely to be purchased.\n\nThe SOL/USD pair has a minor resistance at $95, but if this level is crossed, the next stop is likely to be $143. This level could attract strong selling by the bears because if bulls overcome the $143 resistance, the rally may extend to $200.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to drag the price below the 20-week EMA. That may start a range-bound action for some time.\n\nSOL/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been rising steadily for the past few days, and the pullbacks are finding support at the 20-day EMA ($66). This suggests a positive sentiment where the traders view the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nA minor risk to the continuation of the rally in the near term is that the RSI is showing a negative divergence, suggesting weakening momentum.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may dip to the 50-day SMA ($55) and later to the psychologically important level at $50.\n\nRelated: AI deepfake nude services skyrocket in popularity: Research\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) is one of the few tokens that has broken above its 2021 highs, indicating that the coin is in a long-term uptrend.\n\nOKB/USDT weekly chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are trying to propel the price above the resistance of the $59 to $38 range. If they manage to do that, the OKB/USDT pair is likely to start the next leg of the up move. The pair could rise to $80 and subsequently to $100. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that bulls remain in command.\n\nSellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below $54 and keep the pair stuck inside the range for some more time. A break below $38 will signal that the bears are back in the game.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls and the bears are witnessing a tough battle at the $59 level. If bears come out on top and sink the price below $54, the pair could gradually dip toward the support at $38. That could keep the pair range-bound for a while longer.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA ($58) is sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers overcome the obstacle at $65, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective (INJ) broke above the April 2021 high of $25.30, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The breakout of a previous major high signals strength and attracts buyers.\n\nINJ/USDT weekly chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move of the past few weeks has pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that the rally may be getting over-extended in the near term. That could start a corrective phase or a consolidation.\n\nThe first strong support on the downside is at $25.30. If buyers flip this level into support, it will signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The INJ/USDT pair could surge to $43 and thereafter to the psychological level of $50.\n\nAlternatively, if the price dips and sustains below $25.30, it will suggest aggressive profit booking by the bulls. That may sink the price to the 20-week EMA ($14).\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe long wick on the Dec. 12 candlestick shows that the bulls tried to halt the rally at $25.30, but the bulls persisted. They continued their purchase on Dec. 13 and pushed the price higher. That has sent the RSI into deeply overbought levels, warning of an impending correction in the near term.\n\nThe pair is likely to retest the breakout level of $25.30. If this level holds, it will increase the likelihood of the resumption of the uptrend. On the contrary, if bears tug the price below $25,30, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($22). This remains the key level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may start the decline to $14.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "5 reasons why a spot Bitcoin ETF approval could send BTC price above $100K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There has been extensive debate about whether the launch of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will lead to a price correction after the initial excitement from investors subsides. While some arguments hold merit, they overlook the broader perspective. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF will be a game-changer in various aspects, including volatility, correlation with traditional finance assets and market liquidity.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF prospects. Source: Eric Balchunas/Bloomberg\n\nArbitrage desks and the ETF providers have likely created a buffer to support the initial demand and prevent market front-running. Nevertheless, whether it takes a few hours or several months, this buffer will eventually deplete. When examining a longer time frame\u2014months instead of days\u2014the price of Bitcoin is determined by the balance between immediate demand and the supply of coins at a specific price level.\n\nBitcoin is validated, boomers enter the market, and issuers compete for dominance\n\nThe initial question to consider is why someone would wait until Bitcoin's price surpasses its all-time high to start investing. Most individuals are either lazy or cautious, meaning they are hesitant to open an exchange account or invest in anything that hasn't received their broker's endorsement. Even if Grayscale offers Bitcoin-backed trust funds, there is little incentive for traditional investment brokers to offer such products.\n\nIt's important to note that the median retirement savings for North Americans under 34 is $17,600, while those between 35 and 64 have accumulated a substantial $142,100, according to Vanguard. This data suggests that millennials and Generation Z are not the ones who will propel Bitcoin's price to $100,000 and beyond. In essence, the first reason the spot Bitcoin ETF is crucial lies in the minimal effort required for baby boomers to invest.\n\nMore significantly, by offering products where the asset manager retains the management fee, the incentives for providing the product increase significantly. This means that sales teams at BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, Bitwise, VanEck, and other issuers will be fully engaged in attracting both internal and external clients. Other funds managed by these multi-trillion-dollar asset managers may also be encouraged to invest in Bitcoin's newly launched ETF.\n\nHistorically, the ETF industry has witnessed a concentration of assets among the top two issuers. For example, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) represent over 85% of the industry's assets under management. Additionally, the market leader State Street's GLD has an expense ratio of 0.4%, which is considerably higher than most competitors. This data underscores the importance of gaining an early advantage in terms of ETF holdings.\n\nBitcoin receives regulatory clearance and the spot ETF eases concerns for investment advisors\n\nRegarding regulation, there has never been a definitive statement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the legitimacy of Bitcoin, let alone from legislators. In fact, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Dec. 11 that five more Senators have agreed to cosponsor one of her bills aimed at cracking down on the illicit use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and terrorism financing. In this regard, the support of BlackRock and Fidelity legitimizes the asset class.\n\nRelated: Crypto users to reach almost one billion in 2024, analysts predict\n\nWhile the SEC's decision to limit spot Bitcoin ETFs to cash-only creation and redemption may not be the ideal tax solution for investors, it dismisses regulatory concerns, as every Bitcoin held by these funds must be acquired from intermediaries pre-approved by the SEC. Essentially, the approval of the spot ETF significantly reduces regulatory risk.\n\nThis difference also benefits investment advisers, as it spares potential investors from dealing with Bitcoin transactions. Investors themselves often prefer instruments that do not require specific tax regulations, making the ETF a much simpler option compared to direct cryptocurrency investment.\n\nThese changes may initially appear uneventful, with the impact of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval not necessarily occurring in the first few hours or days. However, when these five favorable trends gain full momentum, it\u2019s not likely that Bitcoin will trade below $100,000 again\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Some of the attendees at those meetings included representatives from BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, ARK Invest and 21 Shares.\n\nThe meetings also reportedly featured representatives of the exchanges that would potentially list the new products, including Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, as well as lawyers and issuers.\n\nRegulators reportedly told attendees at the meetings that any issuer that doesn\u2019t meet the Dec. 29 deadline will not be part of a first wave of potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early January.\n\nFox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett was among the first to report on the deadline. Terrett subsequently confirmed the date for final amendments to all S-1s by Dec. 29.\n\n\u201cThe SEC told issuers that applications that are fully finished and filed by Friday will be considered in the first wave,\u201d the journalist wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

AP agreement + cash creates = approval,\u201d Balchunas wrote on X. As of Dec. 22, none of the spot Bitcoin ETF filers had the AP agreement in place, while seven firms switched the redemption model strictly to cash, according to Balchunas.\n\nDespite multiple firms moving forward with last-minute updates for their spot Bitcoin ETF filers, Bloomberg analysts are still confident that the SEC will have approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs by Jan. 10.\n\nMagazine: SEC delays Ether ETFs, Binance settlement approved and another court loss for SBF: Hodler\u2019s Digest, Dec. 17\u201323"

        "title": "How To Invest In Bitcoin In 2024 - The College Investor",
        "content": "Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has rocketed in value from less than $1 per Bitcoin to a high of $69,000. And even when everyone thought bitcoin and crypto were dead, it rallied again in 2023. With such astronomical gains and rising concerns over the fiat banking system, it\u2019s no surprise that many investors still have their eyes on Bitcoin and other digital currencies in 2024. Whether you want to support Bitcoin\u2019s vision of decentralized finance, or simply are looking to diversify your portfolio with a powerful and promising asset, we\u2019re here to help you in your investment journey. Let\u2019s talk about 3 ways you can invest in Bitcoin right now, and how it's easier than ever before.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the first decentralized currency that operates without a central bank or single administrator, making it a peer-to-peer electronic currency system. The history of Bitcoin began with the publication of a white paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper outlined the design and implementation of a decentralized digital currency that would operate on a blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. The first Bitcoin transaction occurred on January 12, 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney, a computer programmer and one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin. Over time, more people began to adopt Bitcoin as a means of payment and investment, leading to its growth in popularity and value. In 2010, the first Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com, was launched, enabling users to trade Bitcoin for fiat currencies like the US dollar. In the same year, the first Bitcoin ATM was also introduced in Vancouver, Canada, making it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin has undergone several significant events, such as the 2011 hack of the Mt. Gox exchange, which resulted in the loss of approximately 850,000 bitcoins. Despite this setback, Bitcoin continued to grow, with more merchants accepting it as a means of payment. In 2013, the price of Bitcoin reached a high of $1,242, driven by increased interest from investors and the media. However, the price subsequently crashed, leading to a prolonged bear market that lasted until 2017. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced another price surge, reaching a high of nearly $20,000 in December of that year. This was driven by increased demand from investors and speculators, as well as the launch of Bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). Bitcoin reached it all-time high (as of this writing) in 2021, hitting $68,789. However, it has since fallen off significantly. But even near the end of 2023, it's back over $43,000.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has continued to experience volatility in its price, but it has also gained wider acceptance as a means of payment and investment. Several major companies, such as Tesla and Square, have invested in Bitcoin, and more merchants are accepting it as a means of payment. In fact, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has said, \"Bitcoin is a digital store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a payment system with low transaction fees.\" Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. It has gone from a digital currency with little value to a widely accepted means of payment and investment. Its history has been marked by significant events, both positive and negative, that have shaped its growth and adoption. However, despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience and has continued to attract interest from investors and the wider public.\n\nInvest In Bitcoin Through Cryptocurrency Exchanges Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms that allow users to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. These exchanges provide a convenient way for investors to purchase and store Bitcoin, and offer a range of trading features and tools to help users manage their investments. If you\u2019re just getting started in your investment journey, or simply don\u2019t have the time to delve into more intense investing methods, using an exchange may be best for you. It's an easy \"on ramp\" to start investing in crypto, as it works very similar to what you'll find at traditional brokerage firms like Fidelity. Here are 4 quick steps you can take to invest in Bitcoin through an exchange:\n\n1. Open an account at an exchange of your choosing The first step is to open an exchange. Your options will vary by country, and while every exchange supports Bitcoin, if you want to invest in other cryptocurrencies in the future, make sure they are offered on your exchange. You can see some of our top picks for best crypto exchanges here. Note: Many exchanges require you to submit some form of ID to comply with anti-money laundering laws.\n\n2. Deposit fiat currency Next, you need to deposit your \"fiat\" currency. Fiat means money like dollar bills, Pounds, Euros, etc. Most platforms let you start with as little as $10, letting you deposit through bank transfers, credit/debit cards, or electronic wallets such as PayPal.\n\n3. Search for BTC With your newly funded account, use your exchange\u2019s search feature to find \u201cBTC\u201d, the ticker symbol for Bitcoin. Most platforms also offer a variety of other cryptocurrencies to invest in, such as popular altcoins like Doge, Solana, Ethereum, and XRP.\n\n4. Invest Using the exchange\u2019s trading function, purchase your desired amount of Bitcoin. Consider strategies such as dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) \u2013 which means purchasing a set amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of price. Once your trade goes through, you\u2019re now a proud Bitcoin holder. Congratulations! Of course, exchanges aren\u2019t the only way to invest.\n\nBitcoin Investment Funds Bitcoin investment funds are a great way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without having to purchase and store it yourself. These funds are managed by professionals who invest in Bitcoin on behalf of their clients, with the goal of generating returns that outperform the overall market. It's important to note that these funds invest via \"contracts\" or \"futures\", so they price may not actually reflect the exact price of Bitcoin. Also, the movement of the fund may not directly correlate as well. Here's a comparison of BTC vs. GBTC (a fund) over the last 5 years.\n\n1. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Bitcoin ETFs are funds that are traded on exchanges like traditional stocks. These funds track the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with exposure to the cryptocurrency market. ETFs can be bought and sold easily, and their prices fluctuate throughout the trading day. Bitcoin ETFs can be attractive to investors already familiar with stock market investing and prefer to have a diversified portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs may be suitable for investors who are looking for a way to invest in Bitcoin that is regulated by financial authorities, as ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight. There are several ETFs on the marketplace: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) You can also short Bitcoin with ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI).\n\n2. Bitcoin Trusts And Mutual Funds These funds are managed by investment professionals who make decisions about which assets to invest in, and when to buy or sell them. Trusts, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Osprey Bitcoin Trust, and others hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's potential returns without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself. The trust's shares are traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, making them accessible to retail investors who may not have access to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBenefits Of Bitcoin Funds Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin fund can diversify an investor's portfolio, as the fund may invest in other assets in addition to Bitcoin.\n\nInvesting in a Bitcoin fund can diversify an investor's portfolio, as the fund may invest in other assets in addition to Bitcoin. Professional Management: Bitcoin funds are managed by experienced financial professionals with expertise in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin funds are managed by experienced financial professionals with expertise in cryptocurrency markets. Accessibility: Investing in a Bitcoin fund is typically easier and more convenient than purchasing and storing Bitcoin yourself.\n\nRisks Of Bitcoin Funds Volatility: Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and investing in a Bitcoin fund can expose investors to significant price fluctuations. Even with professional management, it\u2019s important to remember that there is always the risk of losing funds.\n\nBitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and investing in a Bitcoin fund can expose investors to significant price fluctuations. Even with professional management, it\u2019s important to remember that there is always the risk of losing funds. Fees: Bitcoin funds charge fees for management and administration, which can eat into returns. Overall, investment funds might be a good choice if you value a hands-off strategy and the assurance that your money is in professional hands. Given the unique nature of investment funds, it\u2019s always recommended to do as much research as possible before investing. However, if you prefer to maintain ownership of your assets (or just want to invest long-term without worrying about fees) then you may want to consider a third option: Self-custody.\n\nHow To Use And Invest In Bitcoin Via Self-Custody One major disadvantage to holding Bitcoin on an exchange or with an investment fund is that there is always the risk of dealing mismanagement by the custodian. And since exchanges often are not insured like banks, losses due to external factors may not always be recoverable. Just look at Celsius, BlockFi, and others. That's why you may have heard the phrase \"not your keys, not your crypto\". Basically, if you don't own your crypto via self-custody, you don't truly own your crypto. Crypto self-custody means you have complete control over your funds. Sending, receiving, and storing your Bitcoin and digital currencies are all done without any third-party involvement. In a sense, you are your own bank. Of course, it's important to note that self-custody requires a certain level of technical knowledge and responsibility, as there are risks involved in managing your own private keys. But if you\u2019re looking for maximum control and security over your investments, here are 4 steps to get you started on the path of self-custody.\n\n1. Get a wallet There are lots of Bitcoin wallets to choose from, including desktop, mobile, and hardware wallets. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of security, accessibility, and ease of use. So you'll want to research and compare options to find one that best fits your needs. We recommend that you get a hardware wallet for the most security. You can see some of our top picks of cryptocurrency wallets here.\n\n2. Setup your Bitcoin wallet Once you've chosen a wallet, you'll need to download and install it on your device or hardware. You'll also need to create a strong password and back up your wallet's seed phrase, a series of randomly-generated words used to recover your wallet in case of loss or damage. It\u2019s very important you store your seed phrase in a safe location. It\u2019s estimated that some 3 million BTC have been lost, in many cases due to users being unable to access them. NEVER SHARE YOUR SEED PHRASE And ideally, never type your seed phrase into a computer, and never take a picture of it.\n\n3. Purchase Bitcoin The annoying part is you cannot simply buy Bitcoin using a self-custody wallet. If you're mining Bitcoin, or receiving it as payment, you can use this directly. But, you still need an exchange if you're going to be using fiat currency. So, pick your favorite exchange above to make the initial purchase, and then you can transfer your Bitcoin. Once you\u2019ve set up your wallet, you\u2019ll be given a unique Bitcoin address (a long series of letters and numbers) or a QR code that links to the wallet. Using this, you can transfer Bitcoin from an exchange to your self custody wallet.\n\n4. Secure your Bitcoin After you've purchased your Bitcoin, you'll want to ensure that it\u2019s securely stored. Depending on your wallet, this may involve additional steps such as enabling two-factor authentication. For maximum security, we recommend a hardware wallet over software wallets. Also, try to avoid text message (SMS) two-factor authentication. This can be hacked easily. Instead, use an app-based authenticator like Authy.\n\n4 Different Bitcoin Investing Strategies Now that you know how to buy it logistically, what type of Bitcoin investing strategies are there? Here are the four major ways to invest in bitcoin strategically. 1. Buy And Hold The buy and hold strategy is the simplest and most popular strategy for investing in Bitcoin. The idea behind this strategy is to buy Bitcoin and hold it for the long term, with the expectation that its value will increase over time. This strategy is based on the assumption that Bitcoin will become more widely accepted as a means of payment and investment, leading to an increase in demand and value.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The buy and hold strategy is simple and easy to implement. The buy and hold strategy is not suitable for short-term investors or those looking for quick returns. It allows investors to benefit from long-term growth and appreciation in the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value can be volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations, which can lead to significant losses for investors.\n\n2. Dollar Cost Averaging The dollar-cost averaging strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money in Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price. For example, an investor may choose to invest $100 in Bitcoin every month, regardless of whether its price has gone up or down. There are new tools like the Soon App that can help with this.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The dollar-cost averaging strategy can help investors avoid the volatility and risk of trying to time the market. The dollar-cost averaging strategy may not be suitable for investors looking for quick returns or those who believe that Bitcoin's price is likely to increase significantly in the short term. It can also help investors build a position in Bitcoin over time, without having to make a large upfront investment. The strategy may also result in missed opportunities if Bitcoin's price suddenly spikes.\n\n3. Trading Strategy The trading strategy involves buying and selling Bitcoin based on its price movements. Traders will often use technical analysis to identify patterns and trends in Bitcoin's price, in order to make informed decisions about when to buy or sell.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The trading strategy can allow investors to take advantage of short-term price movements and generate quick returns. Trading requires a significant amount of skill and knowledge, and can be very time-consuming. It can also help investors manage risk by setting stop-loss orders or other risk management tools. It also involves a high level of risk, as Bitcoin's price can be unpredictable and subject to sudden fluctuations.\n\n4. Bitcoin Mining Strategy The mining strategy involves using computing power to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network and earn rewards in the form of newly minted Bitcoin. This strategy requires a significant investment in hardware and electricity, and is typically only viable for large-scale operations.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The mining strategy can provide investors with a steady stream of newly minted Bitcoin, which can be used for investment or other purposes. The mining strategy requires a significant upfront investment in hardware and electricity, which can be expensive and time-consuming. It can also help investors support the Bitcoin network and its decentralized architecture. The profitability of mining can be affected by factors such as Bitcoin's price, network difficulty, and the cost of electricity."

        "content": "\u201cThe bottom line is that demand for Bitcoin is permanent,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThere was liquidity \u2013 people were able to sell \u2013 through the various bear markets Bitcoin has already experienced, whereas it disappeared in other parts of the cryptocurrency market. Will demand grow? Until more professional investors own it in their portfolios, until other investors do, there is the scope for growth.\u201d\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence is also a positive development for Bitcoin, according to Morris. He says AI will soon be initiating transactions by itself, without human involvement, and when that happens \u201cthere will be no room for normal banks because there will have to be better technology \u2013 we\u2019ll need a form of money that\u2019s able to deal with computers\u201d.\n\nBitcoin is the obvious solution.\n\nMorris says the current cycle should see the price of Bitcoin averaging $100,000, compared with $30,000 over the previous cycle.\n\n\u201cBitcoin tends to do well in the year before a halving and in the year after one,\u201d he says.\n\nFalling interest rates should also be positive for the cryptocurrency because investors have less to lose in interest if they choose Bitcoin instead of cash savings.\n\nThe creation of \u201cexchange-traded funds\u201d or ETFs that can hold Bitcoin directly, is also expected soon after the objections of American regulators were overruled. This too suggests there is good reason to be bullish.\n\n\u201cBitcoin always comes back stronger,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThe bear market is over, the cycle has turned. Bitcoin is the king of crypto and is going to be a bigger part of portfolios.\u201d\n\nThe case against Bitcoin\n\nDuncan MacInnes can hardly be accused of being a dyed-in-the-wool Bitcoin sceptic. It was he who persuaded his colleagues at Ruffer, the investment manager, to invest 2pc of their portfolios in the digital coin in 2021, an investment that yielded a rapid profit of more than \u00a31bn, one of the most spectacular coups in the recent history of fund management.\n\nSo his belief now that Bitcoin\u2019s moment is in the past, and its absence from both his own personal portfolio and those run by Ruffer, are worthy of our attention.\n\n\u201cI was a Bitcoin zealot,\u201d he tells Questor. \u201cI have never believed in anything so much. We invested during the pandemic and it was the perfect asset for that moment. Trust in institutions was failing, interest rates were zero and everyone was at home [looking for investment opportunities on their computers].\u201d\n\nNow, 15 years after its invention, he says he is \u201cnot sure what Bitcoin is for\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not suitable as a payment tool, it has failed as a hedge against the recent bout of inflation and the context has changed so much,\u201d he says. \u201cMoney printing via quantitative easing has gone into reverse and the market is less obsessed with technology across the board.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cSo much money was poured into cryptocurrency by venture capitalists and so many intelligent people got involved yet it\u2019s hard to point to any concrete results of all that money and effort and now there are new things to be excited about such as AI.\n\n\u201cAt about the time Ruffer invested people were talking about a wall of institutional money going into Bitcoin, but it didn\u2019t happen. If a true Bitcoin ETF had been launched then, it would have attracted huge amounts of money. But now I don\u2019t think anyone cares, I don\u2019t think there is pent-up demand. And I think I can prove that.\u201d\n\nHe draws attention to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a quoted American investment fund that owns Bitcoin and whose managers were instrumental in overturning the refusal of American regulators to authorise Bitcoin ETFs. As a quoted fund Grayscale can, just like a British investment trust, trade at a premium or a discount to the value of its assets.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 Grayscale was trading at a premium of 20pc but that discount gave way to a double-digit discount. Why would you invest in an ETF and by doing so pay the full price for the Bitcoin it holds if you can buy it at a discount via Grayscale? That discount showed that there wasn\u2019t demand.\u201d\n\nAnother development that he expected to improve sentiment towards cryptocurrencies at the time Ruffer invested has also not come to pass, MacInnes says.\n\nIn a reference to the numerous frauds to have taken place at crypto exchanges, he says: \u201cPeople thought that the arrival of institutions such as ourselves as crypto investors would force out the bad actors but it didn\u2019t work out that way \u2013 we still saw good money going to back Sam Bankman-Fried [the convicted fraudster who ran the crypto exchange FTX]. That\u2019s a real problem.\u201d"

        "content": "United States-approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could end up dwarfing the entire $50 billion crypto-related ETF market today.\n\nAccording to new data from BitMEX research, the current global market for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) includes approximately 163 products totaling $50.6 billion in assets under management.\n\nNew products have been added to the list.\n\n\n\n163 crypto related ETPs have now been identifiedhttps://t.co/jbOPeNgxUg https://t.co/yooaO48iKR \u2014 BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) December 26, 2023\n\nThe list includes spot and futures funds, and typically track the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The largest ETP on the list is Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust \u2014 which is currently attempting to be converted into a spot ETF product.\n\nMarket commentators believe the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 widely pegged to be approved by the SEC as early as Jan. 10 \u2014 could eventually double the amount of money invested in crypto ETPs.\n\nOn Dec. 14, crypto investment fund Bitwise predicted that spot Bitcoin ETFs would be the most successful ETF product ever launched, expecting them to capture some $72 billion in assets under management within the next five years \u2014 more than doubling the current market.\n\nOffering a more sober outlook, global fund manager Van Eck estimated that roughly $2.4 billion would flow into a spot Bitcoin products in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhile a spot Bitcoin ETF has never been approved in the U.S., such a product is far from a brand-new development in a global context.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading lower on Tuesday after cooler-than-expected US inflation data boosted bets of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve next year.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 1.12% to around $1.65 trillion in the last 24 hours.At 11:48 a.m., BTC was trading 1.15% lower at $42,774, while Ethereum was down 2.2% at $2,234.\"Bitcoin is trading at the $43,000 mark, having recently tested the $42,600 zone where bullish activity was evident. A breach beyond the $43,600 level could propel BTC towards $44,300 and support now lies at the $42,600 level,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \"After making its 18-month high on December 8, BTC has continuously been consolidating in a rather tight range with both bulls and bears now waiting dormant for a breakout on either ends. While bears were hoping for a Christmas correction, no such major move was to be seen as BTC continues to honour the uptrend it has been maintaining for the whole of 2023.\"Altcoins, such as Solana and XRP rose 1% and 0.9%, respectively. However, BNB, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, Tron, and Shiba Inu declined by 1-3%.Solana has attracted significant investments over the past week due to its continued growth in the DeFi and NFT ecosystem, Edul said.Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said, Solana\u2019s impressive rally has extended with the token targeting $120 \u2013 a level not seen since April 2022. SOL, driven by a thriving ecosystem, is now the 4th largest crypto asset by market cap.The total volume in DeFi is currently $7.58 billion, 10.95% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $61.47 billion, which is 88.73% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.Bitcoin's dominance is currently 50.61%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 25.66% to $23.81 billion.Tech View by Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, UnocoinBitcoin's current technical landscape is intricate, marked by cautious anticipation among investors. The BTC/USD pivot point, crucial at $42,797, signifies potential price shifts. Resistance at $45,038, $46,704, and $48,945 is pivotal for Bitcoin's upward trajectory. Support at $41,162, $38,891, and $37,256 aims to mitigate potential declines.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44 indicates a bearish sentiment without reaching oversold territory, leaving room for a rebound. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) at -111.85 aligns with a bearish outlook.However, Bitcoin's position relative to the 50-day EMA ($43,313) adds complexity, suggesting a short-term bullish trend if sustained. The triple bottom breakout at $43,445 hints at potential bearish momentum but a breakthrough could signal a bullish reversal."
