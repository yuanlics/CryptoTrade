        "content": "Fidelity Investments, which has $11 trillion in assets under management, has renewed its push to launch a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) listed on the CBOE, according to a new CBOE filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nKey Takeaways Cboe has filed to list a new bitcoin spot ETF managed by Fidelity Investments.\n\nFidelity had previously had their Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust application rejected by the SEC.\n\nMany traditional financial institutions have recently entered the race to launch the first bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S. following an application from BlackRock earlier this month.\n\nFidelity Mirrors Traditional Finance's Push For Crypto\n\nFidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust was previously rejected by the SEC, but this new filing from Cboe indicates Fidelity is making another attempt at getting regulatory approval for their bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nThe move comes after BlackRock (BLK) filed an application for a spot ETF and follows in the footsteps of other traditional financial institutions such as Invesco (IVZ) and Wisdomtree (WT) that revived their previously rejected applications.\n\nMarket-watchers have taken note of these developments, viewing them as significant due to BlackRock's reputation and confidence in obtaining regulatory approval. Investors too, have taken the cue, driving bitcoin prices to fresh highs.\n\nThere have been dozens of attempts to launch a spot-bitcoin product in the past, but many have faced opposition from regulators citing market concerns and investor protection.\n\nOne of the reasons commentators have been bullish on the prospect of BlackRock's bitcoin spot ETF approval is that it includes a surveillance sharing agreement with an unnamed bitcoin exchange based in the U.S., and this sort of arrangement is also mentioned in Cboe's recent filing.\n\n\n\nOther issuers, which include Valkyrie, Bitwise, VanEck, and ARK Investment Management, remain hopeful of securing regulatory approval this time around. Notably, this isn't the only area of crypto where traditional financial powerhouses are getting involved, as a new crypto asset exchange backed by Charles Schwab (SCHW), Fidelity, and others also recently launched.\n\nThis new interest from traditional financial institutions has clearly breathed new life into the crypto market after the industry had been shaken by SEC lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase (COIN)."

        "content": "Asset management giant Fidelity Investments is again trying to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, according to a Thursday filing.\n\nThe move comes two weeks after BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, which has long been opposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOther firms appear to have taken BlackRock's filing as a sign that the SEC's stance could soon change. Since then, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco have taken the initial steps toward their own funds. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for changes to its proposed bitcoin fund Wednesday that brought it closer in line with BlackRock's application.\n\nThursday's filing is a proposed rule from the Cboe BZX Exchange to list the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, the name of Fidelity's previously proposed bitcoin ETF that was denied by the SEC. The exchange has made similar filings for other firms over the past two weeks.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected every spot bitcoin fund application on which it has made a decision. The commission is in a legal battle with Grayscale about its decision to block the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nOne of the SEC's key concerns about a spot bitcoin product is transparency in the market and the potential for manipulation. The BlackRock filing includes a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement that could alleviate those concerns. The subsequent filings have similar proposals.\n\nThe SEC has already allowed the creation of ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, including the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) that has more than $1 billion in assets. The first leveraged bitcoin futures fund hit the market Tuesday.\n\nThe new rush for ETFs appears to have buoyed prices for bitcoin. The digital currency was trading near $30,500 Thursday afternoon, up from below $26,000 prior to the BlackRock filing."

        "title": "What Is a Bitcoin Mixer? - Ledger",
        "content": "What Is a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin mixers are software or third-party services that mix up your Bitcoin funds with other users\u2019 funds to reduce the tracing of transactions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are two types of mixers: centralized mixers and decentralized mixers. Centralized mixers use a third party, while decentralized mixers use open-source protocols to mix transactions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Crypto mixers offer users anonymity which can be integral to those living under oppressive regimes, but it can also open the door for criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are many potential risks of using mixers, such as violating local laws, receiving wallet flags, platform bans and more.\n\nFirst introduced in 2009, Bitcoin allows users to transact and trust each other across borders without needing banks 24/7. If that seems unfamiliar to you, make sure to read the guide on what Bitcoin is. However, for the purposes of this article, it\u2019s important to understand that these benefits come with a trade-off.\n\nOne of the core concepts of what blockchain is offering \u2014 transparency \u2014 is not exactly privacy-friendly. To explain, the blockchain is freely available to everyone, and you can read every transaction on sites like block explorers. With this information and additional external data, you can link an arbitrary Bitcoin address to its owner. So, what do you do when you\u2019d prefer not to share this information?\n\nMost people will never need to hide their blockchain transactions. However, for those living under oppressive regimes and require the freedom of moving their assets where they like, tools to protect users\u2019 identities become imperative. But unfortunately, the very same tools that help such people survive also encourage bad actors.\n\nSpecifically, these tools are named crypto tumblers, or mixers and let you make anonymous transactions on the blockchain.\n\nBut what is a Bitcoin mixer exactly; how do they work, and are they even legal?\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nBitcoin mixers, also known as tumblers, are services that receive cryptocurrencies from users, pool them together, and then send the amounts to their corresponding recipient addresses. This is an effort to obfuscate the transaction trail.\n\nTo explain, if you\u2019re using a mixer, the mixer\u2019s address becomes the recipient of any outgoing transactions from your wallet instead of a specific Bitcoin address. Similarly, in the case of a recipient\u2019s address, the address is again that of the Bitcoin mixer. If you want to see this in action, here\u2019s how to read blockchain transactions.\n\nMixing funds hides the original sources, making it difficult for external observers to identify the specific senders or recipients.\n\nDepending on the mixer, service fees are generally quite low, ranging from 0.5% to 7% of the transaction.\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Mixer For?\n\nBitcoin mixers make crypto transactions harder to trace, thus preserving privacy and hiding the sender\u2019s identity. Essentially, they serve as a way to anonymize crypto transactions.\n\nSo why would you want to use a crypto mixer?\n\nFirstly, many people using mixers live in countries with oppressive regimes. Not every country gives its citizens the same rights, meaning outspoken journalists, members of opposition parties, or even normal civilians may be in danger for expressing opposing views or beliefs. If citizens of such countries use a transparent transaction on the blockchain, they could be putting themselves at risk.\n\nSecondly, whistleblowers and investigative journalists can also benefit from this tool. Using a crypto mixer means they can pay and get paid for information across borders, but without revealing their sources.\n\nOf course, \u2018anonymity\u2019 also encourages bad actors to exist. Scammers often want to hide their identities, and crypto mixers are their tools of choice.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin tumblers have a long history of money laundering and scams, with the first notable case in December 2013. Just four years after Bitcoin\u2019s launch, the mixer Bitcoin Fog was used to launder 96000 BTC from a marketplace. These incidents continued well into 2021, with Bitcoin Fog allegedly funneling over $1.3 million BTC. US authorities finally arrested the founder of this tumbler, Roman Sterlingov, in 2021.\n\nSince then, US authorities have sanctioned many high-profile mixers, namely Blender.io and Tornado Cash. Similarly, German authorities also took down the infamous Chipmixer, and seized over $46 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Do Crypto Mixers Work?\n\nCrypto mixers collect Bitcoin from their users, merge their transactions, and redistribute it.\n\nTo better understand this concept, let us take the example of a charity receiving donations anonymously. Instead of directly donating, multiple donors could pool their funds together and designate a third party to complete the actual transaction. As a result, the charity receives the donation without knowing the specific source.\n\nReplace this third party with a smart contract, and that\u2019s essentially the foundation of a Bitcoin mixer. Usually, mixers also incorporate a slight delay in sending the Bitcoin to the destination address to avoid further detection.\n\nBitcoin mixers are of two types: centralized mixers and decentralized mixers.\n\nCentralized Mixers vs. Decentralized Mixers\n\nCentralized mixers are operated by private third-party services that users trust to mix their Bitcoin, while decentralized mixers are peer-to-peer protocols with an automatic mixing process.\n\nUsing centralized mixers, users send their funds to wallet addresses owned by these mixers, pay a service fee and mention where they want to send it. Once the mixer receives these funds, they combine them with other users\u2019 funds in a pool and redistribute them. Good examples of centralized mixers include Yo!Mix and Mixtura.\n\nCentralized mixers, particularly, carry the additional risk of trusting a third party. You could potentially lose your funds if the network or the company shuts down. Since these mixers handle a large amount of money, they become attractive targets for hackers and pose risks of potential malicious intent from the company itself. Some centralized mixers might also save your info privately and tie you back to these transactions\u2014and that defeats their whole purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, decentralized mixers use an open-source protocol, such as CoinJoin, to create an automatic permissionless mixing process. Essentially, they bank on multiple users using the protocol. Then, they consolidate their funds to a single large transaction, and route different Bitcoins to the destination addresses. The more people that use a decentralized mixer, the more efficient they become. That\u2019s because an increased number of users reduces the odds of detection. A good example of a decentralized crypto mixer that uses CoinJoin includes JoinMarket.\n\nThe Wider Risks of Crypto Mixers\n\nWhile crypto mixers offer a degree of anonymity, it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not impossible to find out who sends and receives funds in this manner. Unfortunately, some crypto mixers aren\u2019t as anonymous as they claim, and some are subject to local laws and regulations.\n\nFor example, Law enforcement agencies (such as the FBI) have sophisticated tools to trace the origin of funds sent through crypto mixers. This is easier to discover on mixers with limited users, or when tracking large sums of value.\n\nIn the case of fewer people participating in the service, tracing funds is simple. Since it\u2019s less likely another user sent a similar amount of Bitcoin as yours, working out the source is entirely plausible. This can be particularly useful when trying to catch bad actors, but it also leaves people living under oppressive regimes vulnerable.\n\nFurther, some exchanges actively block these \u201cmixed\u201d tokens and coins due to security and compliance concerns. Thus, if using a crypto mixer, you might face similar issues across major exchanges, limiting how you can use crypto assets. So, while there are countless legitimate reasons to obfuscate your transactions, it\u2019s often simply not that easy.\n\nBitcoin Mixers: Are They Illegal?\n\nWhile Bitcoin mixers are not illegal everywhere, many countries do limit their use, or even ban them entirely. Plus, since these mixing services can lend themselves to money laundering, they often attract increased scrutiny from regulators. Regulatory authorities often view mixers with suspicion, as they can hinder law enforcement efforts to track and trace suspicious transactions.\n\nTo combat this, countries like the US have placed restrictions on crypto mixers since they deal with money transfers. The US financial law enforcement agency, FinCEN, requires all mixers to register under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nFurther, in 2022, the US placed sanctions on major crypto mixers like Tornado Cash and Blender.io. The US Treasury held that Tornado Cash had been used for laundering over 7 billion dollars since its creation. Similarly, Blender.io helped a North Korean hacker group launder money.\n\nThese sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from doing business with both these services and freeze any assets they may have in the United States.\n\nSince many countries handle crypto mixers differently, consult your local crypto laws before using them.\n\nCan I Use a Crypto Mixer?\n\nSo, crypto mixers offer a novel way to benefit from the security and accessibility of the blockchain, without the burden of revealing your identity. For those under oppressive regimes or with political difficulties, this may be the only option. However, if you decide to use a crypto or Bitcoin mixer, it\u2019s important to understand the risk involved. Before using any service that may obfuscate the origin of a specific set of funds, make sure you check your local laws and abide by them. You don\u2019t want to use a crypto mixer and pay the price for it later.\n\nIf you want to keep your anonymity in crypto though, using a crypto mixer can be an interesting option. Only you know if using a crypto mixer is right for you. Now you know about how they work, you can navigate the market and decide whether that\u2019s the right choice\u2014because that\u2019s the whole point of self-custody."

        "title": "Rural Arkansas 'crypto mines' prompt noise complaints from residents - KUAR",
        "content": "Last month, Gladys Anderson, who lives in the Bono community in Greenbrier, started hearing a loud, unbearable sound.\n\nA constant high-pitched hum, ranging from 60 to 70 decibels, is coming from a cryptocurrency mine built less than a half-mile away from her house.\n\n\u201cYou can hear it, especially at night,\u201d she said, gesturing at the corner of her house where the bedrooms are located.\n\nCrypto mines are large collections of computers built to harvest cryptocurrency, a completely digital form of money not reliant on any central authority. The computers in Greenbrier are surrounded by a tall, opaque orange fence and signs that say \u201cno trespassing.\u201d\n\nThe mines are loud because of the fans needed to keep their hardware cool. In Greenbrier they generally run 24/7, staying on even at night.\n\nAnderson says she hears the ringing fan noise in every part of her large house, from the outdoor pool to the garage, to the guest house where her mother lives. When she isn't home, she says the sound is still \"burned into her brain.\"\n\nCarol Goforth is a professor of law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and has been studying the rise of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThere's no coin behind Bitcoin,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s bits of data. There is nothing tangible, nothing physical. It's just alphanumeric sequences stored on computers.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to owning Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, Goforth says its value only comes from a belief in its worth by people who own it.\n\n\u201cIf I stop being willing to pay for it, it has no value.\u201d\n\nIn some sense that's true of any form of currency. Dollars and cents only have value because society has agreed to give money value. Crypto is entirely electronic, as are most transactions done with actual currency. But with dollars, you can buy almost everything. Goforth says with Bitcoin, you can buy very little and it can be difficult to exchange it for actual currency.\n\nA new state law, Act 851, opened the door for more crypto mines to be built in Arkansas. Rep. Rick McClure, R-Malvern, presented the bill in committee on April 3 and it was signed into law about a week later.\n\n\u201cAs long as a data center is operating within the zoning laws, they shouldn't be singled out if they are in compliance with the ordinances that are already there,\u201d McClure said in a legislative committee meeting.\n\nThe law prevents any kind of zoning or sound ordinance laws designed to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against crypto mines and data centers. No one spoke for or against the bill, and only two lawmakers voted against it.\n\nA company called Green Digital LLC is drafting plans to build a crypto mine in the small town of Vilonia. According to a city councilman, the site would mimic the one in Greenbrier. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to an administrator in Faulkner County, the mines in Greenbrier are owned by an LLC called New Rays. When asked for comment on this story, CEO Ethan Wang said journalists are \u201cfake news\u201d and voiced his disappointment in the coverage he has seen so far.\n\nAt a Vilonia city council meeting last week, an ordinance was passed to cap noise in the town at 60 decibels, about the sound of a conversation.\n\nMellissa Blackwell, who lives just outside the Vilonia city limits, voiced her concern about the potential health effects on humans and wildlife in the area.\n\n\u201cWhen living things are exposed to noise, it changes us,\u201d she said.\n\nCity Councilman Steven Craig said he was indifferent about the mine.\n\n\u201cI am open for any type of business coming to town, as long as you abide by zoning regulations. And that's where I see it might become an issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA big argument for the mines is that they create jobs. Craig said the mine will create at most five new positions, which will probably be outsourced from Little Rock.\n\n\u201cI am all for entrepreneurship and starting a business. If it creates one job, great. If it creates 100 jobs, even better,\" he said. \"Do I think those jobs are going to be coming from citizens within Vilonia? Probably not.\u201d\n\nIn addition to noise complaints, law professor Carol Goforth says crypto mines use too much energy and are bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mines consume on an annual basis about the total energy consumption Ukraine had before the war.\u201d\n\nBack in Greenbrier, Gladys Anderson says her family is struggling. Her son has autism and is nonverbal. She says he struggles to cope with the noise, but that it would be too much of an ordeal to move.\n\n\u201cEven if I had the funds to do that, my kids have buried pets here. We have planted baby trees,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd why should I have to move? I was here first, and I'm not disturbing anybody in the community.\u201d\n\nRepublican state Sen. Bryan King told Fayetteville station KUAF he\u2019s considering drafting legislation to stop crypto mining in Arkansas. The north Arkansas city of Harrison has already put its plans for a crypto mine on hold.\n\nIn Vilonia, members of the city\u2019s planning committee will meet Thursday to talk about the next steps of whether to approve plans for a new crypto mine."

        "title": "Can BlackRock finally break down the SEC's objection to a bitcoin ETF? - CTech",
        "content": "Earlier this month, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, with approximately $10 trillion under management, applied to launch an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) that tracks Bitcoin. If the request is approved, it will allow institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without actually purchasing it.\n\nOver the past six years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied such requests, even from large and well-known institutional players like Kathy Wood's technology-focused hedge fund firm Ark. Grayscale, a major player in the crypto market, even sued the SEC last October for refusing to approve a similar product. While it is still unclear whether BlackRock will receive the long-awaited approval, the mere possibility of institutional entities investing in the asset caused the price of bitcoin to increase by about 15% to a one-and-a-half-year high, surpassing $30,000. However, the current price is still about 53% lower than the currency's all-time high of over $65,000 in November 2021.\n\n1 View gallery Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO. ( Photo: AP )\n\nAccording to the application submitted to the SEC, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust fund will utilize the platform of the American trading exchange Coinbase and its Coinbase Custody services. If approved, the ETF is expected to be traded on the Nasdaq. BlackRock, whose founder and CEO Larry Fink once referred to bitcoin as an \"index for money laundering\" and claimed that the company's clients had no interest in the field, took a different approach in the summer of 2022. BlackRock established a connection with Coinbase to allow its private clients access to the crypto market, citing growing customer interest in the field in a letter to investors.\n\nBlackRock is an investment house that manages money for the general public worldwide. In Israel, operations are managed by Anath Levin, former deputy CEO of Bank Hapoalim and a senior executive at Clal Insurance and Migdal Insurance. BlackRock offers investors a wide variety of products, including many passive ones like ETFs. Additionally, it manages hedge funds, private equity funds, and debt funds.\n\nBlackRock has made its move at a time when the crypto market is trying to recover from months of distress. Last summer, several companies in the industry went bankrupt, leaving investors without access to their funds. Furthermore, BlackRock's ETF application comes after the SEC's recent enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase for various securities law violations and, in some cases, defrauding investors.\n\nInterestingly, the man who once mocked bitcoin, Larry Fink, has now become the darling of the community, or at least significant parts of it. Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, a long-time crypto investor, expressed that the launch of BlackRock's ETF \"will be the best thing that could happen to bitcoin.\"\n\nAn ETF on bitcoin would provide exposure to the currency without actual ownership. Instead of cumbersome purchases or using dubious platforms, investors would be able to buy shares that track the asset's price. For the past six years, the SEC has rejected requests to create such funds, except for those related to futures contracts. The SEC's rejections are based on various reasons, but a consistent and central concern is the potential for price manipulation on unsupervised platforms. The SEC has cited evidence of fake trading (wash trading) in the market and the ability of large players to manipulate bitcoin's price for personal gain. The lack of supervision and transparency in the crypto market makes it challenging for the SEC to monitor and detect fraud. Approving the requested ETF would raise concerns about investor protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackRock addresses the SEC's concerns through a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" between different exchanges, which is a first-of-its-kind effort in the crypto field. This, combined with BlackRock's positive track record of gaining SEC approval for similar products, leads some commentators to believe that BlackRock has a higher chance of success compared to previous applicants.\n\nBlackRock's move aligns with a trend of increasing institutional involvement in the crypto market. Last week, hedge fund Citadel, financial giant Fidelity, and investment bank Charles Schwab launched EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange targeting established players seeking distance from regulatory enforcement issues. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, EDX does not offer custodial services, meaning it does not hold cryptographic assets itself. Instead, it serves as a platform where parties agree on prices and close transactions. Compared to existing exchanges, which have been associated with frauds and scams, EDX aims to reduce risk by trading only four cryptocurrencies that the SEC has not classified as securities."

U.S. GDP grew faster than expected in the first quarter and initial jobless claims came in at less than expected. Also, asset manager Fidelity Investments on Thursday filed to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.05% to US$30,453 over the last 24 hours to 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 1.43% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.28% to US$1,853, but is down 1.4% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. Solana led the gains on a 12.35% jump and a 7.56% weekly gain. This despite the Thursday announcement from Cardinal, a Solana non-fungible token (NFT) protocol, that it will be winding down operations due to what it called a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nCardinal tweeted on Thursday that the team will disable new deposit instructions on July 19 and cease operations on features including staking and new NFT rentals.\n\nElsewhere, Fidelity has refiled an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the COBE exchange has proposed to list and trade shares of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. The SEC rejected a Bitcoin ETF application from Fidelity in 2021.\n\nFidelity\u2019s move follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential of digital assets and demand.\n\n\u201cTo this point, the lack of a spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,\u201d the Fidelity filing said.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday, investment management fund ARK Invest also filed an amendment to its April application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.24% to US$1.17 trillion, with trading volume dropping 12.22% to US$29.96 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nLong-term Azuki collectors sell out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

The index is down 1.79% for the week.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum dropped 19.79% to US$20.87 million over the past 24 hours, while volume on the Bitcoin network rose 357.82% to US$13.38 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 CryptoSlam\u2019s category of Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of one established collection \u2014 rose 7.22% to US$9.25 million, making it the most-sold collection in the past day.\n\nSolana-based SMB Barrel Raffle, which started public minting on Thursday, saw the second-largest daily volume of US$5.1 million.\n\nTrading volume of Azuki Elementals dropped 46.5% to US$2.95 million, and the original Azuki collection saw a 7.76% drop to US$2.79 million.\n\nWhile the new Azuki Elementals sold out its 20,000 NFTs within 15 minutes when it began minting on Tuesday, collectors were \u201cangry\u201d as the new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. That could potentially devalue the NFT collection as a whole, he said.\n\n\u201cTonight [on Thursday] the founder of Azuki, Zagabond, is meeting with the community to discuss the week\u2019s mint, and likely address concerns,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Nansen on Twitter on Thursday: \u201cAzuki and Beanz collectors that have held for over 1 year have been selling their NFTs post-Elementals mint.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, art auction house Sotheby\u2019s plans to launch a new generative art program, or work generated from algorithms. That will be in partnership with Art Blocks, which powers generative minting technology to brands and artists, according to a Wednesday statement shared with Forkast via email.\n\n\u201cThis will allow generative art long form collections to be minted right on Sotheby\u2019s own platform,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cGenerative art is really beginning to spread its wings following the sale of \u2018The Goose\u2019 \u2014 The Ringers #879 \u2014 for US$5.4 million (US$6.2 million with fees) on June 15.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s economy contracts for third month\n\nA steel factory oin Nantong, Jiangsu Province of China. Image: Getty Images\n\nAsia equity markets were mixed on the last day of the quarter as investors assessed fresh economic data from the U.S. and China.\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.01%, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.08%, and Nasdaq Futures added 0.19%.\n\nU.S. economic growth expanded faster than estimated in the first quarter, according to official data released Thursday. In the first quarter, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by an annualized rate of 2%, up from the previously estimated 1.3%.\n\nThe amount of initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped by 26,000 to 239,000 for the week ended June 24, the largest decrease since October 2021.\n\nThe robust economic showing in the U.S. wasn\u2019t repeated in China, where the country\u2019s manufacturing activity contracted in June for the third month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 49.0 for the month, compared to 48.8 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday that China was still on track to meet its 5% annual growth target.\n\nInvestors, however, still need to contend with more interest rate hikes this year in the world\u2019s biggest economy. U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the Fed may raise rates at the next two meetings and repeated that message at a central bank gathering in Portugal this week.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 86.8% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26. It predicts a 13.2% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "content": "With more mainstream popularity than ever, many new people are interested in acquiring some Bitcoin. But many of the crypto-curious still view buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange as an intimidating and opaque process. The technical aspects of holding Bitcoin\u2014such as crypto wallets, Bitcoin addresses and private keys\u2014are confusing to newcomers, and scare some investors away.\n\nAll of this has intensified the appeal of a Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Major financial institutions like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco have applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch ETFs.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 An ETF is an investment vehicle that is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset or index, rather than one company.\n\n\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f An ETF is a way for investors to get exposure to the value of its underlying asset, like gold or oil.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 ETFs trade on a traditional stock exchange, and their value should rise when the asset increases in price, and fall when it decreases.\n\nSEC Approves First Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nThe first ETF launched in 1993, and they became popular as a way for retail investors to invest in a basket of assets at once. If you wanted to invest in 500 of the largest companies in America at once, you could buy shares in a S&P 500 ETF.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF works in much the same way as any other ETF. Investors buy shares in the ETF through whatever brokerage they buy stocks, and can trade them the same way they'd trade shares in Apple or Tesla.\n\nThe 2x bitcoin ETF $BITX has become effective, scheduled to launch Tuesday. I was doubtful it would happen but looks like it\u2019s official. Could this be early sign of SEC lightening up? After $BITO launch I believe they made earlier 2x filers withdraw pic.twitter.com/XXxSt9xypu \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin, and should act in lockstep with Bitcoin's price swings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy the need for a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nSo, why wouldn\u2019t investors just buy Bitcoin?\n\nFor most regular retail investors, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general still look risky.\n\nBesides having unclear regulations around them, owning Bitcoin requires keeping a Bitcoin wallet and trusting crypto exchanges, which are still uncharted territory for people unfamiliar with the space and require a certain level of self-education.\n\nHolding Bitcoin places the burden of security squarely on you, making you responsible for keeping your own private keys safe (unless you want to entrust them to the exchange). This may mean buying a hardware wallet to protect purchased Bitcoin, or storing private keys in a secure manner. You\u2019d also have to work out how to file taxes for sales of Bitcoin that resulted in capital gains.\n\nHow To File Your Crypto Taxes In The U.S.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors need not worry about private keys, storage, or security. They own shares in the ETF just like their shares of stock, and can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to go through the hoops of purchasing and holding crypto.\n\nAnd to put it plainly, that is an extremely appealing proposition for many regular folks\u2014as well as sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nThat's why so many hedge funds and other investment firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Bitcoin ETFs. Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were first out of the gate with an application for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in 2013. In 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the Winklevoss brothers a patent for \u201cexchange-traded products.\" But the SEC still hasn't approved their ETF\u2014or any others.\n\nHow does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that buys and holds the actual Bitcoin; the price is pegged to the Bitcoin held in the fund. The firm lists the ETF on a traditional stock exchange, and you, the investor, trade the ETF just as you would any other stock. Bitcoin ETFs also offer new types of trading opportunities, including short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin.\n\nBut there are also some key differences between a Bitcoin ETF and other ETFs.\n\nFirst, some ETFs, like those that track the S&P 500, represent equity shares, so you get a cut of the dividends that any company in the ETF pay to their shareholders. When Tesla pays a dividend and you have shares in an ETF that includes Tesla, you get a (smaller) dividend. Bitcoin is decentralized, so that won't happen with a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSecond, just like with other ETFs, you have to pay fees to the company offering the ETF. But with a Bitcoin ETF, some portion of your fees would go to paying the custody and management fees for the purchase and storage of the Bitcoin that underlies the ETF.\n\nA brief history of Bitcoin ETF progress\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is expected to bring a new level of mainstream trustworthiness and acceptance to Bitcoin investing. In 2020 and 2021, big publicly traded companies including Square and Tesla bought Bitcoin as an investment for their balance sheets, which spurred new adoption\u2014but the cryptocurrency is still seen by many conservative investors as a risky bet or even a gimmick.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC would mean that institutional investors can more easily speculate on the price of Bitcoin. It would functionally bring Bitcoin to Wall Street, with the Bitcoin ETF traded through the same places as Tesla stock, bonds, gold, oil, or any other traditional assets.\n\nAnd it would likely be a huge boost to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nCannabis ETFs have become popular for many of the same reasons that Bitcoin ETFs have. Just like crypto, the marijuana industry is viewed as risky and uncertain by traditional investors who still want the opportunity to profit from it.\n\nBitcoin Price Stable Despite BitMEX Arrests and Trump's COVID Diagnosis"

        "content": "According to new research, fewer cybercriminals are turning to Bitcoin as their primary method of moving illicit funds, with bad actors opting to go back to fiat channels or choosing other cryptocurrencies.\n\nDigital asset compliance and risk management firm TRM Labs revealed that illicit finance volumes involving Bitcoin (BTC) had fallen significantly over the past seven years, according to its \u201cIllicit Crypto Ecosystem Report,\u201d released on June 28.\n\nTRM Labs said instead a new multichain era has led to a \u201cqualitative leap\u201d away from Bitcoin as a primary means of moving criminal proceeds. The firm also highlighted that cash and other forms of fiat-related finance remain the \u201cdefault\u201d means of criminal money movements.\n\n\u201cIndeed, cash and even older forms of finance such as hawala (transferring money without physically moving it) remain the default means by which illicit activity is financed and its proceeds are laundered.\u201d\n\nTRM Labs also noted that while illicit activity involving crypto has increased, \u201ccrypto did not invent these criminal forms.\"\n\nThe firm reported that around $2 billion in crypto was stolen through attacks on cross-chain bridges in 2022, but very little of that was Bitcoin.\n\nCharts showing the volume of Bitcoin used across various types of illicit activity. Source: TRM Labs\n\n\u201cThe multi-chain era has had a sweeping impact on the distribution of illicit crypto volume as a whole,\u201d it noted, adding that Bitcoin\u2019s share of illicit transactions plummeted from 97% in 2016 to just 19% in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, while two-thirds of the crypto hack volume was in Bitcoin back in 2016, that had fallen to just under 3% by 2022. The slack was taken up by Ethereum (68%) and BNB Smart Chain (19%), it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was also once the \u201cexclusive currency\u201d for terrorist financing back then as well, but by 2022 it had been \u201call but replaced\u201d by Tron, with 92%, TRM Labs claims.\n\nAdditionally, TRM Labs claims that there has been a 240% increase in the use of Tether (USDT) among the terror financing entities that it tracked in 2022.\n\nUse of USDT and BTC for terrorist financing. Source: TRM Labs\n\nThe latest illicit finance figures in crypto may be brighter news for Bitcoin, which in recent days looks to be back on the table for institutional adoption.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency saw at least $7.8 billion paid into Ponzi and pyramid schemes, as much as $1.5 billion was spent on darknet markets specializing in narcotics, and $3.7 billion was stolen through DeFi hacks and exploits in 2022, according to TRM Labs.\n\nRelated: North Korea and criminals are using DeFi services for money laundering\n\nEarlier this year, Cointelegraph reported that 2022 set a new record for illicit crypto transactions. The total cryptocurrency value received by illicit addresses topped $20 billion last year, according to analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: William Clemente III tips Bitcoin will hit six figures toward end of 2024"

        "content": "The $4.7 billion Bitcoin (BTC) monthly options expiry on June 30 might play a decisive role in determining whether the $30,000 price will consolidate as long-term support and open room for further bullish momentum.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin breaking yearly highs?\n\nMany analysts consider Bitcoin\u2019s recent breakout above $27,000 to be a bet on the multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, including those of BlackRock and ARK Invest.\n\nThe news also fueled expectations for Grayscale to be able to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n$31,000 caps Bitcoin price gains for now\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin bears will try to take advantage of macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds, including exchanges implementing mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.\n\nOn June 28, KuCoin announced an upcoming KYC system upgrade in a move to increase compliance with global Anti-Money Laundering regulations.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s increasing concern over the impact of miners\u2019 sell pressure, with the network hash rate reaching 400 exahashes per second. Analytics firm Glassnode noted that miners sent an all-time high percentage of their BTC revenue to exchanges over the past week, totaling $128 million. Curiously, the movement mimics spikes seen during the 2021 bull run as miners took profits.\n\nAdditionally, during the European Central Bank Forum on Central Banking in Portugal, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that most policymakers expect two more rate hikes this year. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, investors are pricing in 82% odds of a 25-basis-point interest rate increase on July 26.\n\nBitcoin 4-hour price movements during option expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin price last flirted with the $31,000 level on June 27, but the resistance proved stronger than anticipated. The subsequent correction to $30,000 supports the thesis of sideways trading in the short term as investors evaluate the impacts of additional interest rate increases by the Fed.\n\nSuch a restrictive scenario for the global economy might explain why some Bitcoin traders decided to take profits, which limited the price upside.\n\n$4.7 billion out of reach \u2014 bulls were too optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the June 30 options expiry is $4.7 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were expecting price levels of $32,000 or higher. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied 25.5% between June 15 and June 23, testing the $31,000 resistance.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 30. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $3.1 million in call (buy) open interest and the $1.7 million in put (sell) options.\n\nBut if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 30, only $630 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$30,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 30 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nBetween $28,000 and $29,000: 7,200 calls vs. 16,200 puts. Bears are in control, profiting $250 million.\n\n7,200 calls vs. 16,200 puts. Bears are in control, profiting $250 million. Between $29,000 and $30,000: 13,000 calls vs. 12,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n13,000 calls vs. 12,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $440 million.\n\n1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $440 million. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 3,300 calls vs. 800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $670 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls?\n\nConsequently, it will come down to whether BTC price bears are willing to risk exposure while a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval is being analyzed by the SEC.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to estimate the potential inflow or the timing of such an event, it paves the way for bulls to secure a $440 million profit by keeping Bitcoin price above $30,000 in the short term.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia as all top 10 cryptocurrencies traded higher after strong gains on Wall Street amid signs the U.S. economy is in stronger shape than expected. Additionally, more traditional financial institutions are venturing into the U.S. digital asset industry, with asset manager Fidelity reportedly preparing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application.\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.3% to US$30,606 over the last 24 hours to 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 8.51% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.63% to US$1,887 for a gain of 5.61% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Polygon leading the gains on a 3.26% jump and a 5.96% weekly gain.\n\nFidelity is close to filing an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., The Block news site reported on Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the matter. This follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential in digital assets.\n\nHowever, all the applications will need approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Fidelity\u2019s previous attempt to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. in 2021 was rejected. It did however launch the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Toronto, Canada, in December 2021. The ETF has risen 75% since the beginning of this year.\n\nInvestors are also reacting to reports HSBC, one of the world\u2019s top 10 banks, is reportedly offering Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs on its investment platform for bank customers in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC did not respond to requests seeking clarification on exactly when the products became available to clients as they were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in December. However, the development is seen as significant as the bank has traditionally been frosty toward cryptocurrencies, preventing clients from transferring funds from HSBC accounts directly to crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cAlthough these crypto ETFs [in Hong Kong] are based on CME futures and are not physically backed like many of the [exchange traded products] in Europe, this is certainly very positive news for investors in the region who want to get regulated exposure to price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at Europe-based ETC Group, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.21% to US$1.19 trillion, with trading volume dropping 8.08% to US$35.49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki Elementals NFTs take off\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.79% to 2,876.23 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.72% for the week.\n\nThe decline was mainly driven by the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, which fell 1.54%, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThis may reflect traders selling their existing assets to buy the new Azuki Elementals collection,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cIt also reflects a major sell-off in the main Azuki and Beanz collections, as traders had been buying those in order to have a shot at the [Elementals] presale [on Tuesday].\u201d\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum jumped 307% to US$67.19 million over the past 24 hours, while volume on the Bitcoin network fell 81.61% to US$1.56 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cAs expected, Azuki exploded and gave Ethereum its biggest day of sales volume of the year,\u201d Petscher said, adding that with wash trades removed, it should be the most sales since May 2022 when Otherdeeds NFTs were minted.\n\nNotably, CryptoSlam\u2019s top four collections by trading volume are all Azuki-related collections. The new Azuki Elemental Beans collection saw total transactions of about US$36.36 million with the new Azuki Elementals recording US$4.87 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that these big volume days may be healthy, but big mints also extract liquidity from the ecosystem,\u201d Petscher said Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cWill we see some big secondary sales that then flow back into existing projects or will this be another cycle of liquidity being extracted?\u201d\n\nAsia stocks mixed, China industrial profits sink\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang. Image: Getty Images\n\nAsia equity markets were mixed on Wednesday morning following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally mainly driven by rebounding home sales and strengthened consumer confidence.\n\nHowever, U.S. stock futures edged lower as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.04%, S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq Futures dropped 0.36%.\n\nIn China, profits at industrial firms sank 18.8% in the first five months of this year, on the back of a slowing post-Covid economic recovery, according to official data released Wednesday.\n\nPremier Li Qiang said at the so-called Summer Davos Forum on Tuesday in China that the country was still on track to hit its annual growth target of around 5%. \u201cGDP grew by 4.5% in the first quarter year-on-year, and is expected to expand faster in the second quarter than in the first,\u201d Li said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, South Korea\u2019s consumer sentiment index climbed in June to beat expectations and reach the highest since May last year.\n\nIn Australia inflation eased more than expected in May. Its monthly consumer price indicator rose 5.6% in the 12 months to May, the smallest increase since April 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed Wednesday\n\n\u201cWhile prices have kept rising for most goods and services, many increases were smaller than we have seen in recent months,\u201d Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at the ABS, said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nWhile the economic indicators out of the U.S. this week showed the economy is holding up despite inflation and higher interest rates, investors will hear more from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks at events in Europe. Last week he said there may be more rate increases this year in the U.S.\n\nPowell will speak at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on Wednesday and again on Thursday at the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Fourth Conference on Financial Stability in Madrid, Spain.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add South Korea data in equities section.)"

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 4.54% over the past seven days.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has benefitted from the U.S. banking confidence crisis earlier this year and the [Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s] lawsuits [against crypto exchanges] as well as the enthusiasm around the potential launch of a Bitcoin ETF,\u201d Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at London-based financial trading firm CPT Markets, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETF applications have supported investors\u2019 sentiment as institutional and retail investors show increasing interest in the market through such investment vehicles. If the SEC approves new applications, the market could record a surge in demand and in the number of buyers,\u201d Peleshok added.\n\nAccording to Matteo Greco, research analyst at digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International, it is the first time since February 2022 that Bitcoin is showing a positive delta on the year-on-year price metric. However, this alone does not confirm if the bear market is over.\n\n\u201cBut the combination of good news at the macroeconomic level and the news concerning BTC adoption of institutions gave the market a boost to head towards a good Q2, following an already convincing Q1 in 2023,\u201d Greco said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, dropped 1.30% to US$1,850 in 24 hours, but is up 2.10% on the week.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos fell on Wednesday afternoon trade with Solana leading losses.

Fidelity is reportedly applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., according to crypto news site The Block. This follows a series of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers earlier this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise.\n\nInvestor sentiment was further boosted by reports of banking giant HSBC offering Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs on its \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile application. These investment products were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last December.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to see more interest and demand in the digital assets space, but we would suggest that while ETFs are more convenient for many types of investors, that doesn\u2019t make them better,\u201d Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at AltTab Capital, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBTC ETFs, including those now in Hong Kong, are all futures ETFs that have historically lagged the pricing upside of just holding BTC and taken larger downswings,\u201d Silberberg pointed out.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dipped 1.03% to US$1.17 trillion, while market volume rose 4.76% to US$37.34 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nAzuki Elementals NFT disappoints\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

NFT sales volume on Solana rose 67.91% to US$2.73 million, while that on Bitcoin dropped 69.87% to US$1.51 million.\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s top four collections by trading volume are all Azuki-related collections. Azuki Elemental Beans collection clocked sales of US$36.59 million in 24 hours, while Azuki Elementals recorded sales of US$8.93 million.\n\nThe main Azuki collection rose 1.84% to US$7.87 million, and Beanz rose 2.10% to US$2.52 million in 24 hours.\n\nElementals, an Azuki spin-off consisting of 20,000 NFTs, transacted nearly US$8 million in secondary action in the past 24 hours. Combined with the primary sale, and Azuki\u2019s Beanz and Elemental Beanz sales, the Ethereum NFT ecosystem saw its best day in over one year, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cHowever, collectors of Elementals aren\u2019t just underwhelmed. They are angry. The collection\u2019s art looks nearly identical to the original Azuki collection, leading many to believe the project has just devalued the ecosystem. The mint itself was a borderline disaster as well, though the 15-minute sell-out brought in US$38 million for the team,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAzuki,\n\n\n\nIt's always both challenging & exciting opening up the gate to the Garden.\n\n\n\nThis time, we missed the mark.\n\n\n\nWe hear you \u2013 the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki. \u2014 Azuki (@Azuki) June 28, 2023\n\nHolders of Azuki NFTs were given a 10-minute presale mint, and the next 10 minutes opened up to Beanz holders. In the end, many Azuki holders were left stuck with a loading message and could not mint. Beanz holders were upset that very few were left for them, and no Elementals made it to public sale, Petscher said.\n\n\u201cThis was all but a worst case scenario for NFTs as it shows little has been learned over the past few years, and projects seem to be focused on profits first, and maybe exclusively,\u201d he added.\n\nAsian equities mixed; European bourses gain\n\nStock market display on the street. Image: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets showed mixed results on Wednesday, reacting to news that profits of industrial firms in China sank 18.8% year-on-year in the first five months of 2023, due to a slower-than-expected post-Covid recovery.\n\nAt the end of Asian trading hours on Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite remained unchanged while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.47%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 2.02%.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the world\u2019s second-largest economy is expected to cut its interest rates on one-year policy loans by 5 basis points to 2.6% in the last quarter of this year to boost economic growth.\n\nU.S. stock futures mostly dropped as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, as the S&P 500 futures dipped 0.09%, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.19%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.06%.\n\nInvestors are looking forward to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at events in Europe. Powell is set to speak at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on Wednesday and again on Thursday at the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Fourth Conference on Financial Stability in Madrid, Spain.\n\nLast week, Powell said there may be more interest rate increases this year in the U.S., which are currently between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\n\u201cU.S. equity investors today are being rewarded with a smaller return premium for bearing equity risk than at any time in recent memory, at a time when macroeconomic risks are high and central banks are in less supportive mood,\u201d Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research at Schroders, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. may have been the strongest performing market for much of the past 15 years, but our analysis of the equity risk premium suggests that it will struggle to repeat that feat. Long-term investors may be better served by allocating more to non-U.S. markets in the decade to come,\u201d Lamont added.\n\nEuropean equity markets strengthened on Wednesday, following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally on the back of rebounding home sales in the U.S. and strengthened consumer confidence.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 gained 0.68% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.88% during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nPhilip Lane, European Central Bank\u2019s Chief Economist, indicated on Wednesday that stock markets should not factor in interest rate cuts in the next two years.\n\nThe central bank has been increasing interest rates since last year, amounting to 400 basis points of raises so far, with market expectations of two more rate hikes later this year.\n\n(Update adds NFT and equity sections.)"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

This trend is driven not only by prominent athletes and politicians taking their pay in crypto, but also by ordinary people who want to hedge against all kinds of instability, according to goLance co-founder and CEO Michael Brooks.\n\nSeveral factors have triggered a surge in crypto salaries, including increasing acceptance as a legitimate payment method, growing education and new technological developments, Brooks said in an interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nThe economic conditions in various parts of the world have also influenced the surge in crypto payments, he said, adding:\n\n\u201cSome regions experiencing political instability, hyperinflation or restrictive financial systems have seen an uptick in cryptocurrency usage as an alternative means of conducting transactions.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, goLance made less than 5% of its payouts in crypto, which grew to almost 10% in 2022 and is expected to hit 17% in 2023, Brooks said. \u201cOf the goLance freelancers that choose to be paid in crypto, an average of 17.5% of payments is in crypto and 82.5% in fiat,\u201d the exec noted.\n\nDan Westgarth, chief operating officer at human resources and payroll platform Deel, said that many employees worldwide have started taking their wages in crypto in response to the political and economic instability that has fueled sharp fluctuations in local fiat currencies, making stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) more attractive:\n\n\u201cWe see that countries facing more political and currency turbulence continue to use crypto, particularly withdrawals in USDC to combat volatility.\u201d\n\nHe said that the Caribbean presents a use case for crypto salaries due to its dated banking systems, where extensive waiting periods, payment delays and banking withdrawal fees could be avoided with crypto.\n\nRelated: LATAM crypto holders flock to Bitget following Binance, Coinbase suit\n\nAmong the regions Deel supports for crypto payroll, Latin America has the largest share of withdrawals, accounting for 54% of crypto withdrawals on the platform between January and May of 2023.\n\nCrypto salaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 38% during the same period. The Asia-Pacific and non-aligned movement countries collectively accounted for less than 10% of all crypto withdrawals, Westgarth noted.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

        "title": "Reports of Fidelity's imminent Bitcoin spot ETF filing boosts crypto - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nFidelity: Close to filing its own Bitcoin ETF Forkast 500 NFT Index: Azuki disappoints Asset tokenization in Singapore: One step closer\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, There\u2019s a saying in gambling circles that the house always wins. It\u2019s not an unreasonable supposition, given the fact that if casino operators didn\u2019t bring in more cash than they paid out, they\u2019d be forced to shut up shop. Some in the crypto community might be applying that same saying to the bastions of traditional finance this week as Wall Street appears to be putting another move on cryptocurrencies in which the ultimate winner seems set to be itself. Fidelity, one of the world\u2019s biggest asset managers, is reportedly preparing to file an application to establish a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. That would be a big bet on crypto \u2014 or at least on the coin that started it all. Almost by definition, it would also be a bet against the hostility to crypto shown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the collapse of the FTX exchange last year. The regulator\u2019s apparent distaste for crypto has made casualties of many companies in the sector that have bet against it in recent times. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Genesis and Gemini have all been on the receiving end of enforcement action, and the commission has set its sights on cryptocurrencies. Traditional finance firms have also bet against the SEC and lost, although only in terms of commercial opportunities that have gone untapped rather than actual penalties, losses and business closures. As we note in this week\u2019s edition of The Current Forkast, Fidelity\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t the company\u2019s first. Indeed, the SEC has turned down every application for such a fund to date. But traditional finance sector players such as Fidelity and BlackRock, which lodged a spot Bitcoin ETF application a fortnight ago, are now showing increased confidence about their prospects of gaining the regulator\u2019s favor. Perhaps it\u2019s because they\u2019re buoyed by judicial skepticism about the SEC\u2019s reasoning in denying a spot Bitcoin ETF license to crypto asset manager Grayscale. Perhaps it\u2019s also because they sense the pendulum might have swung too far against crypto and that the regulator may be minded to offer the industry a concession in the form of a vanilla financial product. Overall, the house needs to win to keep the tables open. Yet the original question posed by crypto was: Who runs the house? Given that the SEC appears unilaterally to have made up its mind, it feels like high time others started asking that question once again. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast.News\n\n1. Bull run\n\nFidelity joins a list of financial institutions that in June submitted or updated their applications to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Image: Fidelity Investments/Canva\n\nCryptocurrencies are receiving a significant push as Fidelity Investments is reportedly nearing the filing of its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Block reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe move would not be Fidelity\u2019s first attempt to file for a Bitcoin-backed ETF. In March 2021, the Wall Street giant filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF named the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, which was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2022. But it launched the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Canada in December 2021, which has risen 75% since the beginning of this year.\n\nAccording to the Block, Fidelity\u2019s application will join the list of financial institutions that have recently submitted or updated their applications to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie and Bitwise.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is a publicly traded investment vehicle tracking Bitcoin price, which allows investors to have Bitcoin exposure without directly handling the underlying cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETF applications have supported investors\u2019 sentiment as institutional and retail investors could show increasing interest in the market through such investment vehicles,\u201d said Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at Belize-based financial brokerage CPT Markets, in email comments.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC approves new applications, the market could record a surge in demand and in the number of buyers,\u201d said Peleshok. \u201cDue to the SEC\u2019s legal stance over cryptocurrencies, the market could further concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest assets in the market.\u201d\n\nSince BlackRock filed for its Bitcoin ETF on June 15, Bitcoin is up by more than 22%, peaking at US$31,389 on June 23, the highest since June 2022. Bitcoin traded at US$30,433, at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The potential foray of Fidelity, globally recognized as the third largest asset manager, into the ETF domain hardly raises eyebrows among those tuned in to the vibrant buzz of Twitter\u2019s rumor universe. In the wake of the ETF application of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, industry watchers projected that Fidelity, the Bostonian investment giant with US$4.2 trillion in assets under management, would be the subsequent contender to lodge and apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This topic also fuelled speculation that Fidelity might put in a bid for Grayscale, the digital asset manager responsible for the US$13.5 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin fund. So far, there has been no substantial evidence for the buyout. Fidelity has taken a proactive stance in embracing Bitcoin and other digital assets, eclipsing many of its traditional finance contemporaries. The firm claims that its research on the asset class dates back to 2014. In 2018, the firm launched an institutional trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. A year later, in 2019, it expanded its venture into the Bitcoin mining business through Bitcoin technology firm Blockstream\u2019s institutional mining service. Last year, it even joined the lengthy list of firms whose Bitcoin ETF applications got rejected by the SEC. And last week, EDX Markets, a non-custodial crypto exchange backed by Fidelity and other Wall Street titans, went live. In addition, Fidelity has shown an assertive drive in obtaining indirect exposure to Bitcoin via Microstrategy, the preeminent corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Fidelity has secured its position as Microstrategy\u2019s third largest shareholder, possessing 6.7% of the stock, valued at over US$225 million. BlackRock follows as the fourth largest owner with 5.58%, approximating around US$185 million. Despite the entrance of these behemoth asset managers into the U.S. ETF race, the waiting list is long. ARK Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathy Wood claims that her firm is in position to launch the first spot-Bitcoin ETF in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\n2. Liquid dreams\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe NFT markets saw another week of decline, and again, Ethereum\u2019s NFT ecosystem is dragging the broader market down. The Forkast 500 NFT Index is down 1.32%, as Ethereum\u2019s decline of 1.51% stands in stark contrast to Solana, Polygon, and Cardano\u2019s gains in value of 1.7%, 1.23% and 5.75%, respectively.\n\nEthereum sales volume rose 318% on Thursday following Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint, which brought in US$38 million to the Azuki team in just 15 minutes.\n\nAzuki\u2019s floor price decreased 45% to 9 Ether following the Elementals mint, and the average sales price declined to US$23,000, down from US$39,000 the previous seven days.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s average sales price is up in the past seven days to US$79,214. However large BAYC holders like Machi Big Brother and Franklin have combined to sell over 60 Bored Apes, applying downward pressure on the collection.\n\nSolana\u2019s 98,917 transactions on June 25 were its single highest daily total of NFT transactions in over eight months. September 2022 was the last time the blockchain had this level of activity, when the Y00ts were still surging on Solana.\n\nSeven-day sales volume was up across several blockchains with Ethereum up 105%, Bitcoin 22%, Solana 24%, and Polygon 10%. Mythos Chain, BNB, and Flow were down 18%, 20% and 23%, respectively.\n\nDeGods is now the third most expensive PFP based on floor price following Azuki\u2019s falling prices. Azuki\u2019s cheapest NFTs are selling for as low as 8.5 ETH, while DeGods is nearly 1 ETH higher at 9.5 ETH.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? This year\u2019s biggest new NFT mint took place on Tuesday, as one of the top NFT projects, Azuki, delivered a new collection called Elementals. While some were hopeful the new collection would breathe life into the NFT markets, it instead drained liquidity from traders who sold assets across projects to afford the hefty 2 ETH mint price. The impact was visible on the Forkast 500 NFT Index even in the midst of Ethereum NFTs having its single highest day of sales volume this year with US$58 million. Azuki\u2019s Elementals did provide some lucky traders with rare Elementals NFTs that were flipped for over 30 ETH, but most secondary sales are taking place well below the collection\u2019s 2 ETH mint price. Instead of Azuki\u2019s Elementals helping the broader NFT ecosystem, it instead sucked liquidity from holders, and almost across the board, brought other collections\u2019 sales prices down with it. What went wrong with Azuki\u2019s mint is a familiar story, and shows that the NFT space may not be as mature as some would like to believe. Starting from the initial sale that left many Azuki and Beanz holders stuck on a loading page, and ultimately unable to mint, to the massively underwhelming art reveal that almost looks like duplicates of the main Azuki collection, NFT projects talk about innovation, yet time after time, fail to deliver it. For all the talk of innovation, we have witnessed few examples of it, and other than functioning as \u2018meme coins\u2019, traders shouldn\u2019t expect another NFT boom until we see actual innovation. If the Azuki team can turn around the current negative sentiment in their project and help foster the higher floor prices that their holders have come to expect, we may then see sales with profits that roll into existing collections floors. We\u2019ll be watching.\n\n3. Singapore calling\n\nMAS\u2019 move comes as Singapore seeks to utilize the power of blockchains in its financial system, while minimizing risks of crypto assets. Image: Fidelity Investments/Canva\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city state\u2019s central bank, has proposed a framework to design open and interoperable networks for digital assets, as the country seeks to harness the power of asset tokenization to improve its traditional financial services.\n\n\u201cThe real value in the digital asset ecosystem\u201d lies in the tokenization of real-world and financial assets through distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts, which could \u201cenhance the efficiency, accessibility, and affordability of financial services,\u201d MAS wrote in its report.\n\n\u201cUnless digital asset networks are interoperable, both with each other and with traditional financial market infrastructures, fragmentation would reduce the network benefits and can create frictions such as inaccessibility, increased liquidity requirements due to separation of liquidity pools, and pricing arbitrage,\u201d noted MAS.\n\nMAS\u2019 proposal \u2013 jointly developed with the Bank for International Settlements and other financial institutions \u2013 is part of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian initiatives announced in May 2022 to explore the adoption of asset tokenization and decentralized finance in the city state\u2019s financial industry.\n\nMAS also announced an expansion of Project Guardian to test the potential of asset tokenization across more financial asset classes, enlisting 11 financial institutions \u2014 including banking giants Citi, HSBC, DBS and Standard Chartered \u2014 to form the Project Guardian Industry Group to lead industry pilots in asset and wealth management, foreign exchange and fixed income.\n\nJapan Financial Services Agency, the first overseas financial regulator to join Project Guardian, will work with MAS on digital asset innovation while safeguarding against risks to financial stability and integrity.\n\nMAS\u2019 move comes as Singapore seeks to utilize the power of blockchains in its financial system, while minimizing risks of crypto assets. Last Thursday, The Asia-Pacific branch of technology firm Ripple Labs said it would start offering crypto-enabled digital payment services in Singapore after receiving in-principle approval from the MAS.\n\nAlso on Thursday, MAS released a whitepaper \u2013 jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund, Amazon, DBS Bank, and multiple other industry players.\u2013 for \u201cpurpose-bound\u201d money, detailing a technical overview of digital currencies designed for specific purposes."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s relative percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit 58%, its highest level since April 2021, according to a new report from Coin Metrics.\n\nWith a staggering $590 billion market capitalization, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency currently has further pushed back on Ethereum and smaller altcoins. The total market cap for the industry sits at $1.2 trillion according to Coingecko.\n\nThis comes amid news of heightened regulatory scrutiny by U.S. regulators\u2013who recently claimed a handful of cryptocurrencies were unregulated securities, causing several to shed billions off their market capitalizations.\n\nSEC Claims Solana, Polygon, Cardano Are Securities in Binance Lawsuit\n\nBitcoin has been leading a bullish rally over the past week, after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Wall Street colossus sparked Bitcoin\u2019s rise in crypto market dominance and triggered investors to buy the asset\u2014despite many previously denied ETF applications.\n\nThe price boost has also spilled over into other assets, such as Grayscales Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The so-called \u201cGBTC discount,\u201d which refers to the difference between the price of the shares and the net asset value (NAV) of the Bitcoin it holds, continues to drop, hitting a monthly low of -30%, according to YCharts.\n\nCoin Metrics, an open-source data analytics platform for public blockchains, reported Bitcoin\u2019s dominance steadily dropped during the crypto spring of 2021, slumping to its lowest level in January 2022. At the time it accounted for 37% of the global crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin Market Dominance Hits Lowest Level Since 2018\n\nThe report also showcased that Bitcoin\u2019s presence in the so-called CBMI 10\u2013Coin Metric\u2019s index for the top 10 cryptocurrencies\u2013has hit its highest point in 2 years, weighing in at 65%. The metric, however, excludes stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USDC.\n\nBitcoin is up year-to-date 85%, currently trading hands at $30,395 as per Coingecko data. The asset has outscored the majority of cryptocurrencies in 2023, with notable exceptions from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Lido Finance (LDO)."

        "content": "Volatility Shares has introduced the first ETF in the US providing leveraged exposure to bitcoin.\n\nThe 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX US) has been listed on Cboe BZX Exchange with an expense ratio of 1.85%.\n\nThe fund provides twice the daily performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index which tracks the value of cash-settled, front-month bitcoin futures linked to the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, an aggregate of bitcoin prices across multiple eligible cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe bitcoin futures contracts underlying the index are partially rolled into the following month on a daily basis.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has increased by roughly 85% year-to-date, from circa $16,500 at the end of 2022 to $30,600 on 29 June. This marks a notable turnaround for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency which lost nearly 65% of its market value last year amid gloomy macroeconomic conditions, rapidly rising interest rates, and a host of negative crypto industry-related events such as the Terra Luna crash and the implosion of FTX, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAnalysts have attributed the current rally to a general weakening of the US dollar, a cooling of inflation, and the Federal Reserve slowing and most recently halting their interest rate hikes. A banking crisis that saw three small- to mid-size US banks fail over a week in March also helped to shine a light on the crypto industry\u2019s potential advantages over the traditional financial sector.\n\nVolatility Shares\u2019 introduction of a leveraged bitcoin ETF in the US enables sophisticated investors to amplify returns from further increases in the price of bitcoin. Leveraged ETFs do come with significant risks, however, which is why they are generally not suitable for a retail audience. Specifically, these funds are not appropriate as buy-and-hold investments as they tend to decay in value if held for an extended period of time, potentially leading to large losses, especially in volatile but range-bound markets.\n\nThe launch of BITX marks another milestone in the crypto industry\u2019s march into the mainstream. The US market is already home to inverse bitcoin ETFs as well as several ETFs providing traditional, unleveraged exposure to bitcoin.\n\nAll of the above funds deliver their exposure to bitcoin by way of futures contracts. While many issuers have sought to launch directly replicating bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has consistently refused to greenlight these applications, citing concerns regarding validating the ownership of these funds\u2019 underlying tokens.\n\nMany analysts have noted, however, that the SEC\u2019s stance may be softening, leading many big-name institutions including BlackRock and Fidelity to suddenly throw their hat into the ring and file for their own spot bitcoin ETFs."

Source: Glassnode\n\nIt noted that there was currently an \u201cextremely high exchange interaction,\u201d from Bitcoin miners which had sent a record $128 million to exchanges over the past week. This is equivalent to 315% of their daily revenue, the analytics platform noted.\n\nThere have been several spikes in miner revenue sent to exchanges during the 2021 bull run as they took profits. There was also a capitulation inflow in late 2022 as markets hit their cycle bottom.\n\nHowever, this latest spike has dwarfed them all by a considerable margin.\n\nUsually, when miners send BTC profits to exchanges they do so in preparation to cash out to cover their expenses and take profits.\n\nThis past week would be a good time to do so since BTC hit its highest price of the year so far, touching $31,185 on June 24.\n\nAt the time, CryptoQuant co-founder and CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the sentiment, stating that the current price-to-earnings ratio was at an \u201cattractive price for miners to sell.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices are yet to be affected however, as the asset remains slightly above the $30,000 threshold at the time of publication.\n\nNevertheless, the current $31,000 price zone is a major resistance level for BTC, with markets failing to break it in mid-April and again in late June. If bulls can't break new ground future losses are expected, especially if miners start liquidating.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability, or hash price, has increased slightly over the last week due to the rise in BTC prices. It is currently $0.076 TH/s (terahashes per second) per day, according to HashrateIndex.\n\nRelated: Riot Platforms to add 33,000 Bitcoin miners ahead of 2024 halving\n\nDespite the price of Bitcoin increasing more than 88% year-to-date, miners are still facing some tough challenges. Profitability has slumped more than 30% since July last year and is down over 80% since the peak of the 2021 bull market.\n\nWhen combined with almost record hash rates of 377 EH/s and peak difficulty levels, Bitcoin miners are still facing an uphill battle.\n\nIncreasing hash rates and difficulty, combined with higher energy prices, have put downward pressure on mining profitability. This means that selling their hard-earned Bitcoin may prove an unpleasant necessity to cover expenses.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

If so ARK would need another crypto exchange to use,\u201d Balchunas continued on Twitter.\n\nBlackRock joined the long line of applicants on June 16, triggering a wave of similar initiatives on Wall Street, especially from previous applicants.

        "content": "While an approved BlackRock spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will funnel new institutional money to Bitcoin, it\u2019s going to be the retail investors who ultimately drive any significant price surges, according to Michael Shaulov, the CEO and co-founder of institutional custody platform Fireblocks.\n\nOn June 15, investment colossus BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, leading to other financial firms filing their own \u2014 along with Bitcoin's price reaching its highest levels in a year.\n\nHowever, while many are hopeful that institutional involvement in crypto will further rocket prices, Shaulov noted that this may not necessarily happen.\n\n\u201cWhen institutions come in to participate in the market and they\u2019re doing it in a quiet way, they\u2019re able to do it almost without moving the price,\u201d Shaulov told Cointelegraph during Australian Blockchain Week.\n\nMichael Shaulov speaking with Cointelegraph editor Felix Ng at Australian Blockchain Week.\n\nAccording to Shaulov, mid-2020 saw \u201dmassive inflows\u201d of institutional money, but prices didn\u2019t really appreciate until retail investors frenzied over crypto assets later in the year.\n\n\u201cEven though there were massive inflows, those institutions were sophisticated enough to acquire [BTC] slowly and use algorithms that won\u2019t drive up the market.\u201d\n\nInstead, \u201c50% increases [came] from retail [\u2026] because they\u2019re participating in a way that\u2019s less sophisticated and moves the price dramatically,\u201d he explained.\n\nThat being said, Shaulov noted that the \u201cphysics of Bitcoin\u201d \u2014 mainly its finite supply \u2014 mean that any mass buy-up of Bitcoin should end up moving the needle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll definitely be easier for some institutions that are currently not participating in the market to add Bitcoin to their allocation.\u201d\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nInterestingly, Shaulov, who founded Fireblocks in 2018, believes that the narrative surrounding Bitcoin is still \u201cplaying out\u201d for these institutions.\n\nShaulov said that today, there are numerous Bitcoin-based narratives still at play: Is it a hedge against inflation? Is it a public reserve currency? Is that a hedge against government financial misdealings?\n\nYou work for it.\n\n\n\nThey just print it and laugh about it.\n\n\n\nWhy would you be played like that?#Bitcoin fixes this. pic.twitter.com/omVxsB9zCV \u2014 Daniel Prince (@PrinceySOV) June 26, 2023\n\nShaulov said that personally, he believes Bitcoin is the \u201cultimate insurance asset.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fireblocks VP: Big names won\u2019t go back after discovering crypto payments\u2019 potential\n\n\u201cIt has all it has the properties [of something] for when everything gets worse.

The strategic collaboration between the Tether and the Georgian government will focus on building key infrastructure for a thriving startup ecosystem in Georgia.\n\nThe collaborative effort aims to attract international attention and investment toward the nascent decentralized space. The partnership aims to foster the growth of P2P technology at a state level and help build financial tools around it. Some of the key areas of development include education on Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain technology, building payment infrastructure for merchants, and developing a resilient, open and private P2P communication system.\n\nPaolo Ardoino (CTO, Tether) and Irakli Nadareishvili (Deputy Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development) signing the MOU for the collaboration between Tether and the Government of Georgia to develop Blockchain, #Bitcoin and Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/g3LayZxDPX \u2014 Tether (@Tether_to) June 28, 2023\n\nTether said the partnership with the Georgian government would also look at creating and implementing a strong, autonomous financial and communication system. This entails encouraging the adoption of P2P technology-based digital payment and communication systems, as well as improving existing infrastructure to ensure its robustness and dependability in supporting blockchain-based solutions. The collaboration intends to bring changes to public administration and the business sector.\n\nGeorgia will create a special fund for local startups to help develop blockchain technologies and position Georgia as a country with an attractive ecosystem for tech startups. Irakli Nadareishvili, Deputy Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, said the collaborative effort \u201cwill contribute to the development of local blockchain technologies in the country, as well as the introduction of companies operating in this sector in Georgia.\u201d\n\nRelated: Peer-to-peer crypto exchanges struggle to navigate shifting legal landscape\n\nTether\u2019s collaborative effort in Georgia is not its first. Over the years, many crypto companies have worked closely with governments to advance the nascent technology. In most cases, collaborations translate into a better understanding of the tech by governments, eventually leading to positive regulation.\n\nEl Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, had Bitfinex as its key exchange technology partner and granted the country\u2019s first digital asset license to the exchange. Similarly, crypto exchange Binance signed an MoU with Kazakhstan in May 2022 and received compliance approval from the government a year later.\n\nTether didn\u2019t respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s requests for comments by publication.\n\nMagazine: Cryptocurrency trading addiction: What to look out for and how it is treated"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) correlation with the Nasdaq sank to 3% in June, according to data from Kaiko \u2013 indicating diverging sentiment between cryptocurrencies and tech stocks.\n\nThe price-performance for the leading cryptocurrency in June was between $24,800 and $31,360, opening the month at $27,200.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF filing on June 15 was a bullish catalyst, reversing the prior downtrend to a new year-to-date high of $31,440 some eight days later.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow band between $29,860 and $31,030 \u2013 falling 3% since its YTD high on June 23.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has been in a continuous uptrend since the start of the year \u2013 reaching a YTD high of $15,230 on June 16. Since Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date high on June 23, the Nasdaq has risen 0.7%.\n\nOn a 30-day basis, the Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation started the year at 60% and slipped to 22% by March, indicating a decrease in the similarity of price movements between the two. This period of change consolidated somewhat, with the correlation struggling to rise above 45%.\n\nThe Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation has continued to move lower throughout the year, dropping sharply to 3% this week from over 20% in May.\n\nData research firm Ecoinometrics published a chart of Bitcoin-Nasdaq range movements from the start of the year to June 24. It showed a similar trend between the two until April, after which a \u201cnice decoupling\u201d occurred.\n\nEcoinometrics further commented that the Nasdaq\u2019s performance is disconnected from the broader macroeconomic landscape \u2013 implying an uptrend reversal is on the cards.\n\n\u201cBut this bear market rally for stocks cannot escape the bleak macro picture forever.\u201c\n\nMentioned in this article"

Discover SCENE\n\nDeep down, I know that Candy Crush Saga isn\u2019t a particularly clever or inventive puzzle game\u2014but nearly a decade after first savoring its specific brand of freemium dopamine hit, I still can\u2019t help but get lost in its mindless, color-matching glow from time to time. And now there\u2019s a version that pays you cryptocurrency for playing it.\n\nGranted, Sweet Bitcoin isn\u2019t an official Candy Crush Saga game, and it\u2019s not created by mobile giant King. Like so many iOS and Android games, it\u2019s a pretty convincing knockoff that matches the feel and flow of the juggernaut franchise. In this case, however, Bling Financial\u2019s copycat game nails the basics while rewarding you with bits of Bitcoin or Ethereum along the way.\n\nSweet Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fuss with the classic formula. Here, you\u2019re still trying to match three or more like-colored candies on a grid, with the aim of completing some basic objective\u2014clearing X number of this candy, or spreading a bubble-gum sheen across the whole board by making matches\u2014within a limited number of moves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin on iPhone. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling\u2019s facsimile packs in hundreds of levels, and from the few dozen I played, Sweet Bitcoin amiably recreates the real deal. In fact, it feels less prone to serious difficulty spikes\u2014a trademark feature of Candy Crush that\u2019s tied to its freemium model, thus potentially nudging players to spend real money to buy more in-game lives instead of waiting to play again.\n\nSweet Bitcoin is a free-to-play game too, but it\u2019s anchored around full-screen video ads that you\u2019re forced to watch after each and every level you play. The downside, of course, is that you have to pause to watch obnoxious ads for scammy-looking games, some of which promise to pay you hundreds of dollars a day for playing them. That\u2019s surely not legit.\n\nI know that because Sweet Bitcoin itself pays you crypto for playing, and it doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of payout. In fact, my earnings tallied up to around $0.05 per hour worth of Bitcoin. After about two hours of playing, I had a dime\u2019s worth of BTC sent to Coinbase.\n\nIt\u2019s not much, but that's pretty much par for the course for games like this. It varies by game and developer, but in my experience, you\u2019ll typically only earn a few cents per hour worth of crypto. With Bling games, you\u2019re rewarded with \u201cBling points\u201d that can be converted into BTC or ETH and cashed out, but the end result is the same: free crypto for playing amusing mobile games.\n\nThe repetitive and overlong ads quickly turn tiresome, however, plus the amount of points you earn per level appears to diminish over time. After a few hours, I was ready to flee back to the safety of one of the handful of official Candy Crush incarnations for my next fix.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, Sweet Bitcoin served up the most fun I\u2019ve had playing any of these crypto-earning mobile games to date. What it lacks in originality it makes up for with\u2026 well, free crypto for playing a solid imitation of an addictive mobile game. If you can put up with the ads, that is."

BULT\u2019s IP Portfolio will be integrated into all Bullet ATMs making it the first licensed Bitcoin ATM network of kiosks in North America. Bitcoin ATMs have experienced significant growth in the United States, driven by the increasing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. According to the website CoinATM Radar, there were nearly 31,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and nearly 2,800 Bitcoin ATMs in Canada as of the time of this release. BULT intends to license its IP Portfolio to other Bitcoin ATM operators and manufacturers in North America.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be one of the few publicly traded Bitcoin ATM companies with our anticipated roll out of our Bullet ATMs,\u201d commented Simon Rubin, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cBitcoin is a rapidly growing asset class, and we believe that our Bullet ATMs will provide a convenient and easy way for people to get involved. We believe that the Atlanta Georgia metropolitan area is a great market for Bullet ATMs. The city has a large and growing diverse population who are more likely to be interested in Bitcoin. We are confident that our Bullet ATMs will be well-received by the local community.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ATMs allow users to conveniently buy and sell Bitcoin for cash using a free-standing kiosk similar in size to a traditional ATM machine. The process is simple and secure, and users can typically complete a transaction in minutes. These automated machines allow individuals to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash, providing a seamless bridge between traditional fiat currency and the world of digital assets. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, the future of Bitcoin ATMs in the United States appears promising.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin ATMs are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a convenient way for people to access the Bitcoin market. As more people recognize the potential of Bitcoin and seek to participate in the Bitcoin market, the need for accessible on-ramps becomes crucial without relying on online brokers or exchanges. BULT\u2019s CEO, Simon Rubin, concluded: \u201cBullet ATMs are a reasonable alternative to online exchanges and the accessibility makes Bullet ATMs an attractive option for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to the space.\u201d\n\nAbout Bullet Blockchain\n\nHeadquartered in Reno, Nevada, Bullet Blockchain Inc. \u2013 common stock is publicly traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol (BULT) \u2013 the owner and licensor of two Bitcoin ATM patents, is a diversified software development and SaaS company, specializing in blockchain technologies and Web 3.0.

        "title": "Fidelity Joins Spot-Bitcoin ETF Race With Fresh SEC Filing - FA Mag",
        "content": "June 29, 2023\n\nFidelity Investments is the latest financial services heavyweight to throw its name into the race to offer the first US exchange-traded fund investing directly in Bitcoin.\n\nThe Boston-based asset manager, which has about $11 trillion in assets under administration and has tens of millions of customers, re-filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, according to a document submitted Thursday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Similar to previous US spot Bitcoin ETF filings in the past few weeks, the updated application says that Fidelity expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a US cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest high-profile traditional-finance firm to join the race after BlackRock Inc. made a splash with its June 15 application for a spot ETF, which opened the floodgates for others to try their hand at it, as well. For crypto fans, it\u2019s been a significant string of developments given BlackRock\u2019s reputation on Wall Street, and the view by some market-watchers that the asset manager wouldn\u2019t be making an attempt were it not confident it could get regulatory approval.\n\nThere have been about 30 tries for a spot-Bitcoin product, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. But applications have faced opposition by regulators, who have in the past cited market concerns and a lack of investor protections, among other things. Fidelity originally filed for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in 2021, which was denied by the SEC in January 2022, according to a Fidelity spokesperson.\n\nEven so, BlackRock\u2019s move spurred a number of similar filings from other issuers, including by Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management has said that it believes it could be first in line to get any potential regulatory approval. ARK had in April, in conjunction with crypto-issuer 21Shares, re-filed its application for one.\n\nFans of digital assets are excited about the prospect of crypto potentially becoming more easily accessible to everyday investors, and the wave of filings has been a boon for token prices. Bitcoin jumped back above $30,000 in June and is trading at its highest levels in about a year. The token on Thursday traded around $30,500. That\u2019s still less than half the record of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\nTo be sure, this isn\u2019t the first hype-cycle over a potential launch. Crypto fans, who have been yearning for a spot-Bitcoin ETF for years, have been through periods of excitement before, only for regulators to ultimately rebuff all attempts.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s filing was credited by observers for helping to push the price of Bitcoin to a one-year high last week, the market reaction to the Fidelity refiling was fairly muted. Bitcoin was up about 1.5% to $30,500 as of 2:25 p.m. in New York, though off the highest level of the day.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Maloney.\n\nThis article was provided by Bloomberg News."

        "content": "Risk bellwethers\n\nMr Bishop, who worked as a managing director at Gresham Partners and head of fixed income at Aberdeen Standard Investments before founding crypto advisory group NotCentralised, said BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin gambit shows it was not worried by the SEC\u2019s track record of dismissing applications to offer the digital assets to retail investors.\n\nHe added the $US10 trillion asset manager\u2019s application potentially fired the starting gun on a land grab among competing banks and asset managers to market and sell bitcoin to retail and institutional clients.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s regulatory filing shows it wants to offer its bitcoin fund on the Nasdaq exchange, with custody provided by SEC lawsuit target Coinbase, and Bank of New York Mellon.\n\n\u201cAll the cryptocurrencies have become progressively more correlated with broader risk assets. That\u2019s one downside I see of institutional involvement if a manager of BlackRock\u2019s scale, balance sheet, or funds under management is treating this as another investible asset class,\u201d Mr Bishop said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe think of bitcoin as digital gold and ethereum as digital oil. Bitcoin is not programmable like ethereum, but it\u2019s exceptionally good at doing its job, which is value transfer in a hyper, hyper-secure way. But that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe institutional adoption of bitcoin widens its divergence from its original conception as a decentralised, apolitical cryptocurrency first adopted in a counter-culture world, where value could be transferred free from political or commercial control, Mr Bishop added. \u201cA lot of the decentralised maxis will be appalled by this [BlackRock\u2019s] involvement, and we have conversations often with some early adopters, but it\u2019s hypocritical to say this technology is the best in the world, and then to decry the involvement of these institutions. You can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessional investors, asset managers and traders remain uncertain how to value bitcoin or predict its future direction. Some claim it is a Ponzi scheme as it has no intrinsic value, while others like Ms Wood boast their analysis shows it could reach $US1 million by 2030.\n\nMr Bishop said the correlation between bitcoin and other risk assets will be strengthened if BlackRock and other traditional finance powerhouses launch ETFs.\n\n\u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t offer an equity ownership stake and when you buy bitcoin you\u2019re not exposing yourself to any one operating or business model, or margin stream,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one potential downside [from institutional promotion] that it gets cemented into a bucket of other digital risk assets.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Boom Continues in Texas as State Shatters Energy Records - WhoWhatWhy",
        "content": "The Texas Lege\u2019s failure to restrain incentivized energy-demanding bitcoin mining in Texas means the industry will continue to expand alongside record-setting grid strain.\n\nListen To This Story\n\nThis story by Paul Krantz was originally published by Deceleration and is part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.\n\n\u2022\n\nAll is not well in rural Corsicana, Texas. The city and surrounding county have fallen into a state of disrepair, according to local resident Jackie Sawicky.\n\n\u201cOur roads are terrible, this week we were having brownouts, and as of this minute, my water is out,\u201d Sawicky told Deceleration. \u201cOur infrastructure is absolutely on the brink of failure \u2026 and what are they doing? They\u2019re going to bring in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin mine.\u201d\n\nA recent report from the American Society of Civil Engineers supports Sawicky\u2019s observations, grading Texas overall with barely passing marks for the state of its roadways, wastewater systems, and levees and dams.\n\nConcerned about social and environmental impacts, Sawicky founded the Texas Coalition Against Bitcoin Mining and launched an online petition warning about noise pollution, rising water and energy costs, and more. At the time of this writing, it has garnered 1,180 signatures from residents opposing what is expected to be the state\u2019s largest bitcoin mine to date.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the increase in environmental temperature in the immediate vicinity of the factory-that-produces-nothing,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nFaced with escalating extreme weather due to climate change, Texas needs to upgrade infrastructure and transition away from fossil fuel use. The urgency of this need was felt keenly in 2021 when winter storm Uri cut power to millions across Texas for days on end and claimed hundreds of lives. Yet efforts intended to make the state more energy efficient withered during the last session of the Texas Legislature as lobbyists for environmental and traditional energy interests spent much of the session playing defense against bills seeking to kill renewable power and directing billions of dollars of tax revenue toward new, unnecessary gas-fueled power plants (See: \u201cGarbage In, Garbage Out\u201d).\n\nAs the state struggles to keep up with the energy demands driven by rapid population growth and rising temperatures, bitcoin mining continues to add further demand to the system, encouraged along by elected Republican leadership.\n\nPower Use\n\nAccording to a report by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state\u2019s electric grid manager, crypto mining consumed more than 3,300 Gigawatt/hours of Texas grid energy in 2022, more than double the amount used 2021.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s total energy consumption in Texas is only increasing. Further mining projects amounting to 39 gigawatts in demand are proposed by 2027, with at least 2.5 gigawatts already approved and 6 gigawatts more that have met planning requirements.\n\nThe daily energy demand for all of Texas is currently about 80 gigawatts.\n\nIf only the bitcoin projects that have already met planning requirements are approved, mining for digital currencies could increase energy demand on the grid by 10 percent within four years.\n\nA statement released by the grid manager said, \u201cERCOT will not allow the interconnection of load that would be expected to result in any violation of reliability criteria.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to other energy-intensive industries, none of these projects offer tangible value to most Texas residents.\n\nRiot Platforms (formerly Riot Blockchain), is the company planning to bring an industrial bitcoin mine to Corsicana, potentially \u201cthe first one gigawatt load ever approved by ERCOT.\u201d Riot already operates a 450-megawatt facility near Rockdale, Texas, reportedly the largest single bitcoin mine in North America. One megawatt of electricity powers about 200 Texas homes during periods of peak demand, according to ERCOT. So Riot\u2019s new gigawatt plant, at peak capacity, could consume as much power as 200,000 Texas homes.\n\nRiot failed to respond to requests for comment from Deceleration.\n\nTo \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin, computers solve complex math equations (up to trillions per second) to identify a series of numbers that validates the next block on the blockchain. A miner is rewarded for solving the block with bitcoin currency. Due to the ever-increasing difficulty of solving these equations, the amount of energy required to power the network has exploded to exorbitant levels.\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) monitors bitcoin\u2019s global electricity demand. At time of writing, it estimates that the global bitcoin network is using 144 terra-watt hours (TWh) annually. To put that number in perspective, gold mining is estimated to use 131 TWh worldwide and data centers were estimated to use 200 TWh as of 2018. The CBECI\u2019s estimates that the bitcoin network currently pollutes more than the country of Austria, about 71.5 million tons of CO2 per year.\n\nThe New York Times found that the two bitcoin mines in Rockdale consume more energy than all of the homes in a 40-mile radius.\n\nBitcoin advocates highlight projects powered by renewable energy, such as one of Marathon Digital Holding\u2019s mines near McCamey, Texas, which draws power from a wind farm. But many mining projects draw electricity directly from the grid, a mix of power sources that averages out to include roughly 60 percent of electrons derived from combusting coal and gas; still others are directly attached to fossil fuel power plants. Before constructing the mine in McCamey, Marathon cut a deal with a coal plant that was due to close and kept it operating for months longer.\n\nBeside energy, water is also a crucial resource for crypto mining. It\u2019s needed to cool the computers, and in a hot Texas summer that can amount to millions of gallons per day. Navarro Mills Lake, which is to be the primary source for Riot\u2019s planned facility, was in stage one drought this January and stressed in recent years.\n\n\u201cLast year, a record number of cattle ranchers had to sell their herds early because the drought was so bad that it was spiking the cost of hay and they couldn\u2019t afford to feed their cattle,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\nCorsicana residents will also be subjected to the unending drone of thousands of mining computers buzzing. The sound of one mine built in a rural town has been described as \u201ca small jet that never leaves.\u201d\n\n\u2018Freedom Money\u2019\n\nPierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, told members of the Texas Senate Committee on Business and Commerce that bitcoin brings jobs to Texas, and called bitcoin \u201cfreedom money.\u201d\n\nLee Bratcher, president of the bitcoin lobbying group Texas Blockchain Council, said in the same hearing that bitcoin miners in Texas employ around 2,000 ongoing employees, and have employed around 20,000 contractors. Out of nearly 15 million workers in Texas, those are not big numbers. Once bitcoin mining centers are built, they require a very slim workforce to maintain. Bratcher also declined to comment for this article.\n\nERCOT classifies bitcoin mines as \u201clarge flexible loads,\u201d because they draw a lot of power and are able to power down or reduce their energy use quickly. Bigger bitcoin mines typically have a curtailment clause in their energy contracts with ERCOT, meaning they agree to power down during moments of emergency energy demand.\n\nBitcoin miners have a business incentive to power down when demand spikes and energy prices go up, but by participating in \u201cresponsive reserve service\u201d with ERCOT, miners collect energy credits for energy they don\u2019t use.\n\nRiot, for instance, reported $9.5 million in energy credits from the state last July for powering down during a heatwave, and a total of $27.3 million in energy credit payouts that year, according to a recent earnings report.\n\nRecently, the proposed Texas Senate Bill 1751, sponsored by state senators Kolkhorst, Campbell, and Nichols aimed to stop bitcoin miners from gaining ERCOT energy credits. The bill passed the Senate, but failed to make it to the voting floor of the House.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors said it was not a punitive measure, but meant to eliminate unnecessary incentives for a rapidly growing industry. Bitcoin miners celebrated the death of what they called the \u201canti-mining\u201d bill when they learned it would not make it to the Governor\u2019s desk.\n\nCan Bitcoin Be Tamed?\n\nThe too often ignored reality of mitigating climate change is that humankind needs to reduce energy and resource use overall. To merely swap today\u2019s fossil power for a renewable grid would lead to further constraints and environmentally devastating impacts. The challenge is in maintaining good living standards while reducing energy demand. Doing so requires rethinking virtually every aspect of society, including \u201clow-energy housing, widespread public transport, and diets low in animal-based foods,\u201d one recent assessment found. It\u2019s safe to say that bitcoin\u2019s terawatts don\u2019t fit within the proposed framework.\n\nEven for those who believe in the importance of alternatives to fiat currency, there are options besides bitcoin with a significantly lower energy impact. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, cut network greenhouse gas emissions 99 percent last year by switching from a proof-of-work algorithm to proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake is an alternative model for maintaining a cryptocurrency that doesn\u2019t require mining.\n\nTake a bird's-eye view of our #Bitcoin mining operations in McCamey, TX. This is one of the four quadrants that make up the site. In total, there are over 60,000 miners at the site, working together to secure the Bitcoin network. pic.twitter.com/jIUZrRCbYv \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) April 25, 2023\n\nEnergy and water commitments now being captured by bitcoin could edge out alternative projects more capable of helping Texas navigate the energy transition, like green hydrogen fuel production, in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cElectrolyzers \u2026 store energy in the form of hydrogen that can then be used for other applications, such as transport, industrial uses, or more simply to reuse it for power plants,\u201d Olivier Beaufils, Market Lead for ERCOT at Aurora Energy Research, told Deceleration.\n\n\u201cA lot of these hydrogen projects are still in early stages,\u201d Beaufils said, noting that competition with other users hasn\u2019t manifested yet. \u201cNow three to five years ahead, that might be a different story.\u201d\n\nCharlie Schumacher, Marathon\u2019s corporate communications VP, said that bitcoin miners help rural renewables stay profitable and \u201csoak up\u201d electricity that may not reach users otherwise. But Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the advocacy organization Public Citizen, contends that bitcoin mining is not a viable solution to transmission issues.\n\n\u201cYou may have a glut of wind energy over here that, within a couple of years, ERCOT sees and invests in transmission that brings more of it to people where it\u2019s needed,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cBut if you mine bitcoin, ERCOT will never see that constraint, and is never going to make the investment.\u201d\n\nMolly White, who has a Harvard University fellowship to research crypto and publishes a blog called Web3 is Going Just Great, cautions against taking pro-bitcoin claims at face value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners\u2019 claims are pretty nakedly self-serving,\u201d White told Deceleration. She added that the more computers mine bitcoin, the more difficult mining becomes, increasing power use for the network overall. \u201cSo even [miners] using so-called waste energy from renewables are still contributing to the overall energy footprint of Bitcoin \u2026 much of which is not renewable.\u201d\n\nHow ERCOT and political leaders prioritize these projects will have a tremendous impact on the state\u2019s energy grid.\n\nBut for now, a pro-bitcoin lobby has gained influence in Texas. Governor Gregory Abbott has previously hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor\u2019s mansion, and Senator Ted Cruz has openly supported the currency. Also, former interim president and CEO of ERCOT, Brad Jones, became the first member of Riot\u2019s advisory board this year.\n\nTexas\u2019s 88th legislative session confirmed that the state\u2019s bitcoin mining industry will continue to be propped up by incentives. Three bills that passed are being celebrated by bitcoin miners, including HB 591 which will introduce tax incentives for powering crypto mining with flared gas.\n\nIn adding further tax incentives, and failing to cut existing ones, the state legislature appears to have sent a clear signal that Texas is open for bitcoin business, and the expanding peak energy demands that it entails.\n\nWhile bitcoin miners continue to profit from access to cheap energy and tax breaks, residents of communities across Texas will continue to experience increasing energy bills and the continued risk of power outages in yet another summer of record-breaking energy demands.\n\n\u201cWhen I go grocery shopping, I ask people, \u2018Have you heard about the bitcoin mine?\u2019\u201d said Jackie Sawicky. \u201cI have talked to hundreds of people in Corsicana and Navarro County, and I can count on both hands the people who have shown positive favor.\u201d\n\nFor the residents of Corsicana, it looks like a very noisy, thirsty, and power-hungry neighbor is coming to town."

After a rough start in June, Bitcoin (BTC) is on the up again, thanks to BlackRock and other large financial companies. BlackRock has applied to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe latest institutional interest has caused a positive ripple effect for many cryptocurrencies like Pepe (PEPE). There are also suggestions of \u2018whales\u2019 buying significant chunks of the token, another contributor to the rally.\n\nAmong these crypto contenders, Millionaire Game (MG) emerges as a potential \u2018dark horse,\u2019 offering an opportunity for investors to turn their dreams into reality.\n\nWhat is MG\u2019s Unique Selling Point?\n\nUnlike many meme coins focused purely on viral appeal, Millionaire Game (MG) token seriously aims to generate millionaire-level wealth for investors. The project aims to \u201cmint\u201d a new crypto millionaire each month\n\nOnce this happens, a random lucky draw handled by smart contracts will decide the winner. The more tokens one holds, the higher their chance of getting selected.\n\nWhen is Millionaire Game (MG) Officially Launching?\n\nMillionaire Game (MG) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, offering tokens at a discounted price of $0.0047. The Millionaire Game team aims to hold its first official token draw once the project achieves a $40 million market capitalization.\n\nThis means that investors participating in the current presale stand to gain substantially once the presale goal is reached and MG token value increases. The presale also presents an opportunity for potential investors to get involved before MG token prices potentially surge upon launch.\n\nRelated Reading: Game for creating new millionaires?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) vs. Millionaire Game (MG)\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular coin, it\u2019s also the most expensive. With BTC\u2019s market cap being north of 600 billion, any 2x gain would require significant market structure adjustments.\n\nIn contrast, Millionaire Game (MG) tokens offer a much more financially accessible entry point for potential investors and higher potential returns. This lower barrier to entry, coupled with MG\u2019s clear use case of creating a new millionaire each month, positions the project for potentially higher price appreciation.\n\nPepe (PEPE) vs Millionaire Game (MG)\n\nWhile Pepe started as a meme coin, its developers aim to introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) utilities over time. Meanwhile, Millionaire Game (MG) tokens are already integrated into DeFi applications like its staking pools that offer various rewards, including chances to win Millionaire Game\u2019s coveted prize.\n\nHowever, Millionaire Game\u2019s core differentiator and value proposition is its clear mission to create real-world crypto millionaires from relatively small MG token investments.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Presale Information\n\nWebsite: https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
