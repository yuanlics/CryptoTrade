        "content": "When we hear that \u201cBitcoin is too risky,\u201d as citizens of the U.S. and as holders of dollars we must remember that this simple statement comes from a position of substantial privilege, specifically \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d First termed by French Finance Minister Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in the 1960s, exorbitant privilege refers to the unique benefits that the U.S. enjoys due to the widespread use of the dollar in international trade, finance and as a global reserve currency. Some of the benefits from the global ubiquity and near-insatiable demand for dollars are the U.S. government\u2019s ability to print dollars with minimal consequence and to borrow at lower interest rates than other countries, many with checkered financial pasts (like Argentina). Global reserve status also simplifies monetary policy decisions for the U.S., as the Federal Reserve is the de facto global central bank, setting the tone for other central banks to follow similar rate policies to defend their exchange rates. Or, as John Connally, President Richard Nixon's Treasury Secretary, bluntly put it to a group of European finance ministers: \u201cThe dollar is our currency, but it's your problem.\u201d"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies rose Wednesday as investors continued to grapple with the market's summer doldrums and looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 2% to $26,517.09. The cryptocurrency has been hovering around the $26,000 level since breaking below it suddenly late last week and posted its worst week since May. Ether added more than 3% to trade at $1,684.20.\n\nBinance coin , the third-largest crypto asset by market cap excluding stablecoins, gained 4%. Tokens tied to ethereum competitors were up as well \u2014 Solana's coin jumped 6%, while Cardano's gained 5.5% and Polygon's rose 4%.\n\nThe crypto market move higher coincided with gains in the major stock averages. Crypto assets spiked more sharply around noon ET, though it's unclear what exactly could have caused the sharp move.\n\n\"You're probably going to see some wild moves up and down as bitcoin tries to march back to $30,000,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. \"Add in summer trading volumes, and you have a recipe for day-to-day volatility. Bitcoin prices have been more resilient today on hopes for lower rates, and a few hours of stable trading could have been enough to bring buyers back in.\"\n\nThe market has also been concerned in recent weeks that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could deliver a more hawkish speech about rate hikes this week at the central bank's meeting in Jackson Hole, which some say could be manifesting now in a sell-the-rumor, buy-the-news moment.\n\nCrypto has been suffering since the spring from low liquidity and thin trading volumes, which has exacerbated moves on both the upside and the downside. This has been especially true throughout the seasonally sleepy month of August.\n\n\"The correlation between equity indices and bitcoin has declined to near zero in 2023,\" said Sam Callahan, lead analyst at Swan Bitcoin. \"Bitcoin's price appears to be bouncing after a sharp sell off last week that was exacerbated by over $2.7 billion worth of liquidations of leveraged positions.\""

While the notion of Bitcoin and its ecosystem is exciting, there is one event that has played a big role in defining its ecology - the Bitcoin halving. We explore the subtleties of the halving event, studying its historical context and throwing light on its impact on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, also known as the \"halvening,\" is a crucial event incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol's fabric. Halvings happen every four years and they reduce the rewards given to miners for validating transactions and protecting the Bitcoin network. The phrase \"halving\" refers to how these benefits are halved during this occurrence.\n\nThe History of Halving\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, initially suggested the concept of Bitcoin halving in the cryptocurrency's whitepaper. The first halving took place in 2012 when the block reward was decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per Bitcoin block. Post halving, other successive halving occurred in 2016 (lowering prizes to 12.5 BTC) and 2020 (dropping rewards to 6.25 BTC). Each halving is scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks mined.\n\nThe Purpose of Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe fundamental goal of Bitcoin halving \u2013 similarly to how it happens with many other crypto halvings \u2013 is to keep Bitcoin scarce and to limit its issuance pace, meaning Bitcoin price will likely be affected by it. Bitcoin's rate of production lowers when the rewards for miners are reduced, making it a deflationary digital asset, and thus limiting Bitcoin inflation. This scarcity mechanism is based on the notion that as supply gets more constrained, demand may rise, affecting the value of each Bitcoin unit.\n\nWhy Miners Get Rewards?\n\nMiners are essential to the Bitcoin network because they validate and add transactions to the blockchain. They are compensated for their efforts with newly created Bitcoins as well as transaction fees paid by users. These payouts encourage miners to invest in costly hardware, devote computational power, and safeguard the network.\n\nWhat Will Happen if Bitcoin Miners Drop?\n\nThe fall in payouts caused by halving occurrences can provide difficulties for miners. Miners must optimize their processes to be lucrative when there are fewer Bitcoins to mine. If a large number of miners abandon the network owing to lower payouts, the network's security may be jeopardized. However, historical data shows that the network adapts to these changes and that miners continue to participate.\n\nWhen is the Next BTC Halving Event?\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, at the time of writing. The next Bitcoin halving dates are expected to occur around this year 2024, with subsequent halving occurring roughly every four years. The cryptocurrency community is looking forward to this event since it is expected to have a significant impact on Bitcoin's value and the market as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin halving events are much more than just watershed moments in the history of a cryptocurrency. They exemplify scarcity, technology, and economics. The regulated drop in rewards affects not only miners but also the broader Bitcoin economy. As Bitcoin evolves, these halving events will become increasingly important for anyone interested in the digital currency space.\n\nFAQs\n\nWill BTC halving increase Bitcoins price?\n\nWhile historical patterns indicate that Bitcoin halving events have been linked to price increases, the relationship between halving and price is complex and influenced by a variety of factors. By looking at a Bitcoin halving chart one might try to understand BTC's expected price movements.\n\nHow many Bitcoin halvings are left?\n\nThere have already been three halvings, with a fourth set to occur around 2024. The block rewards will then become exceedingly minimal.\n\nWhat date is the next Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe precise timing of the next Bitcoin halving is determined by the block production rate and mining speed. It is expected to happen around 2024, based on past trends.\n\nWhat Happens If Bitcoins Run Out?\n\nA total of 21 million Bitcoins will be in circulation. Once all have been mined, miners will only get transaction fees as incentives, significantly altering the network's incentive structure.\n\nDo other cryptocurrencies also undergo halving?\n\nYes, halving events occur in a number of other cryptocurrencies, particularly ones based on the Proof of Work consensus process. Litecoin, for example, employs a halving method similar to that of Bitcoin.\n\nHow often Halving Occurs?\n\nBitcoin halving events occur every four years, or when 210,000 blocks are mined. This assures a gradual decrease in supply over time which is why many BTC enthusiasts almost seem to have a Bitcoin halving countdown."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell Wednesday morning in Asia to trade below US$26,000. Ether also dropped to near the US$1,600 support level as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers. The Forkast 500 NFT index declined, while a former manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea received jail time for insider trading. U.S. stock futures edged higher after Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday. S&P Global Ratings joined the Moody\u2019s ratings agency in downgrading a number of U.S. banks.\n\nNew Bitcoin support level at US$25,000?\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.71% in the last 24 hours to US$25,946.61 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong and lost 11.05% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been trading around the US$26,000 mark this week following a near 10% slide last Friday. But it reached a 24-hour low of US$25,520.73 on early Wednesday morning.\n\nAfter the previous week\u2019s nosedive, some crypto analysts are predicting further losses. Social media commentator Ali Martinez put the token\u2019s new key support level at US$25,400. Keith Alan, co-founder of analytics firm Material Indicators, put it as low as US$25,000. Both Martinez and Alan said losing the key support level could drive the token to a new low in the US$20,000 range.\n\n\u201cBitcoin prices falling below a US$25,000 support level could be considered a bearish indicator, from a technical perspective, as it may signal a general uptrend reversal,\u201d Wade Guenther, partner at U.S.-based asset management firm Wilshire Phoenix, said in an emailed comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest the token\u2019s price could be oversold.\n\n\u201cThe 50-day moving average (MA) has begun to sharply diverge towards the 200-day MA. Generally, it could be considered a bearish signal if the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA,\u201d added Guenther.\n\nOn the regulatory front, investors await a much-anticipated verdict in the lawsuit between Grayscale Investments and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale has applied for permission from the regulator to convert its Bitcoin trust product (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the decision was delayed twice last week.\n\nThat delay added to the delays of other Bitcoin applications. On Aug. 11 the SEC delayed its decision on the ETF application submitted by Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest.\n\nElsewhere, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Balancer reported Tuesday that it had detected a vulnerability affecting several of its liquidity pools.\n\nBalancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools.\n\n\n\nEmergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk.\n\n\n\nUsers are advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately.https://t.co/PDzX32gqeS pic.twitter.com/F1f649Wz3L \u2014 Balancer (@Balancer) August 22, 2023\n\nThe company said it has introduced \u201cemergency mitigation procedures\u201d to secure user assets. An update on early Wednesday showed 1.4% of the total value locked (TVL) on Balancer was still at risk. That would amount to US$9.19 million, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether posted losses. It fell 2.20% to US$1,631.18 for a 10.75% decline over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. The exceptions included Tron\u2019s TRX, which logged a gain of 0.20%. Solana\u2019s SOL token led the losers, dropping 3.35% to US$20.54 and 13.78% for the week.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB token also posted losses. It dropped to a 14-month low of US$204.40 on early Wednesday evening after a Wall Street Journal report said the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange helped Russian entities move money abroad after Russia invaded Ukraine \u2014 a violation of international sanctions. The company denied the claim, saying it follows global sanction rules on Russia.\n\nThe report could prove damaging given Binance\u2019s mounting regulatory challenges. The SEC sued the company in June for alleged securities violations.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization creeped closer to the psychologically important US$1 trillion level, dropping 1.46% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 8.88% to US$31.95 billion.\n\nEx-OpenSea exec sentenced to jail for insider trading\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.59% in the past 24 hours to 2,300.54 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 7.08% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Polygon index remained flat.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 21.95% in the past 24 hours to US$15.22 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana and Polygon blockchains logged increases, while Bitcoin and Cardano volumes dropped, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nWith the average NFT sales price at US$36.11 \u2014 down over 50% from the start of July \u2014 NFT sellers posted a net loss of US$2.14 million in Tuesday\u2019s trading.\n\n\u201c(We are seeing) a continued loss of value across blockchains,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, said in a YouTube video posted Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTotal transactions and average sales price (on Monday) both almost a mirror image of Sunday, so you can see we are kind of stagnant right now,\u201d\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It rose 83.68% in the past 24 hours to US$3.01 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nNathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea, was sentenced by a U.S. district court to three months in jail Tuesday for insider trading. He was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in May for using confidential information about the platform to profit from NFT trades.\n\nChastain\u2019s case was the first-ever insider-trading case in the U.S. to involve digital assets. The former OpenSea executive bought and sold NFTs he knew would feature on OpenSea\u2019s homepage and would, as a result, rise in price. The court found that he made over US$57,000 in profit from the trades.\n\nOpenSea itself is under fire for its announcement last week that it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. The platform will still charge a 2.5% marketplace fee for all transactions.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s decision received widespread criticism. Mark Cuban \u2014 a U.S. entrepreneur and investor in OpenSea \u2014 said the move is a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that \u201cdiminished trust in the platform and hurts the (NFT) industry.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of hit NFT collection BAYC, said it would gradually wind down its presence on the OpenSea marketplace following the announcement. Given the significance of BAYC to the overall NFT market, that could spell bad news for OpenSea.\n\n\u201cYuga\u2019s 30-day volume is 80% the size of OpenSea\u2019s. This is the leverage that IP has over NFT Marketplaces,\u201d Trevor Owens, chief executive officer at NFT intelligence platform Ninjalerts, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nYuga's 30d volume is 80% the size of OpenSea's\n\n\n\nThis is the leverage that IP has over NFT Marketplaces\n\n\n\nThe NFT Marketplaces are dead without the most important IP\n\n\n\nWill this lead to walled garden marketplaces by IP owners? That's much more complicated, so I'm not sure.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FHdWG99q07 \u2014 trevor.btc (@TO) August 19, 2023\n\nElsewhere, Web3 social media application Friend.tech renamed its \u201cshares\u201d to \u201ckeys\u201d on Tuesday. Some analysts said the platform \u2014 which allows users to buy and trade the so-called \u201ckeys\u201d to unlock gated Telegram-like chat rooms and other privileges \u2014 acted to avoid potential legal problems amid a spate of lawsuits brought by the SEC against digital asset firms.\n\nThe switch from \u201cshares\u201d to \u201ckeys\u201d was \u201cprobably to get around being called a security,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe question of whether digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs are securities is the source of much of the legal debate surrounding the industry.\n\nS&P joins Moody\u2019s in downgrading US banks\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed at the end of regular session trading Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging losses and the Nasdaq Composite edging higher.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.\n\nU.S. bank shares dropped Tuesday after financial intelligence corporation S&P Global downgraded the credit ratings of five U.S. banks on Monday citing \u201ctough operating conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile many measures of asset quality still look benign, higher rates are pressuring borrowers,\u201d S&P wrote in a report viewed by Bloomberg. \u201cBanks with material exposures to commercial real estate, especially in office loans, could see some of the greatest strains.\u201d\n\nThe news followed a similar downgrade on ten banks by ratings firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service two weeks earlier.\n\nDespite concerns in the banking sector, U.S. stock futures rose as investors await Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earning release on Wednesday. Analysts expect the AI chipmaker\u2019s revenue to surpass its own forecast from three months ago. The company\u2019s shares hit an all-time high of US$481.87 on Tuesday, but ended the day 2.77% down for the day.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give the opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed-held annual summit will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policy.\n\nJuly\u2019s strong U.S. economic data indicated that \u201cthe reacceleration scenario has come onto the table in a way that it really wasn\u2019t three or four months ago,\u201d Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin told Reuters Tuesday. That could influence the Fed\u2019s thinking on interest rates, he added.\n\nPowell \u201cis unlikely to give direction on September, but he is likely to hint at elevated rates for longer to ensure that inflation has come down,\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate is now between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 15% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, down from 15.5% on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s technology giant Baidu Inc. reported larger-than-expected annual revenue growth of 15% in its second-quarter earnings report released Tuesday. That figure is the company\u2019s largest recorded increase in more than a year. The corporation is building itself into a leader in A.I. technology and introduced its latest generative A.I. model \u2014 Ernie 3.5 \u2014 in June 2023.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI and large language models hold immense transformative power in numerous industries, presenting a significant market opportunity for us,\u201d Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu, said in a Tuesday press release.\n\n\u201cBy adopting an AI-native mindset, we are reinventing our products and offerings for innovative experiences, and to support various enterprises to capture this opportunity,\u201d Li added.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Based on preliminary unaudited results, Bitcoin Depot announced that it expects consolidated revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, to range between $196 million and $198 million, a 17% to 18% improvement compared to $168 million in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIn April, Jacksons Food Stores announced Bitcoin Depot was assuming a contract with the retailer. The agreement allows the crypto ATM company to install 80 Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) throughout the c-store\u2019s network, according to a company press release.\n\n\"This partnership with Jacksons Food Stores, one of the larger convenience store chains in the U.S., further exemplifies Bitcoin Depot\u2019s leading market position and its ability to partner with key retailers in the convenience store industry that are looking for a reliable partner,\u201d Brandon Mintz, CEO and founder of Bitcoin Depot, said at the time.\n\nIn March, the BTM company partnered with GetGo Caf\u00e9+Market, with 270 locations across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, to install 125 devices in stores.\n\n\u201cCrypto ATMs require a very small footprint in terms of square footage and offer huge benefits. They attract paying customers, increasing potential revenue for any type of business willing to host them,\u201d said Scott Buchanon, COO of Bitcoin Depot.\n\nIn March, NACS Daily reported that overall the number of ATMs is shrinking. The number of machines in the U.S. peaked in 2019 at 470,000 but has since fallen to 451,500, according to research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nTo learn more about cryptocurrency, read \u201cDo You Crypto?\u201d from the October 2022 issue of NACS Magazine."

        "title": "A $4,000 Investment in Bitcoin 10 Years Ago Would've Made You a Millionaire Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the past decade, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index have risen 166% and 270%, respectively. Those are solid gains, to be fair, but they don't hold a candle to the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's (BTC -0.44%) value has skyrocketed 4,830% in the past 10 years, translating to an annualized return of 74% per year. This means that a relatively small $4,000 investment 10 years ago would've made you a millionaire today.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how Bitcoin became one of the best financial assets to have owned, as well as what's in store.\n\nBecoming a legitimate financial asset\n\nAfter the first transaction was processed in 2009, Bitcoin was just an interesting niche computer program that software developers were drawn to. This \"internet money,\" which built upon previous technological breakthroughs, allowed two people anywhere in the world to instantly transfer value to each other without the need for an intermediary. This wasn't possible before.\n\nWhat's interesting about Bitcoin's rise was that it was first mainly driven by retail adoption, which isn't surprising, because its tiny early market value didn't provide the liquidity necessary for larger pools of capital. This is different from other financial assets, which usually start with institutional interest, with those who are closer to the actual market- and deal-making, like in equity markets or real estate, only reaching the average investor as development progresses.\n\nAfter nearly 15 years in existence, Bitcoin is slowly becoming a legitimate financial asset, if it isn't there already. Its current market cap of more than $500 billion is similar to major corporations like Visa and Eli Lilly. There are lots of businesses building financial infrastructure and tools to support Bitcoin and make it easier to access. It has the attention of regulatory agencies and politicians. And huge asset managers want in on the action with recent applications to create spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the path of Bitcoin's monster return certainly hasn't been a smooth ride. That's because like other cryptocurrencies, it's extremely volatile. Bitcoin has seen its price crash by 30% or more numerous times. The volatility has decreased as the asset has gotten more valuable, but it still trades like a growth tech stock, something investors just have to deal with if they want to own it.\n\nWhere's Bitcoin headed?\n\nIt's probably true that the next 10 years likely won't result in the same gains that Bitcoin registered in the past decade. If it did generate an annualized return of 74% between now and August 2033, Bitcoin's market cap would total a whopping $125 trillion, with the price of a single coin being greater than $6 million. While the strongest believers would be happy with this outcome, I think it's best to temper expectations.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Bitcoin makes for a poor investment today. I believe it can still beat the stock market over the long term. As I noted above, there's much greater institutional interest. With higher demand coming from huge amounts of capital, coupled with Bitcoin's fixed supply cap, the price is poised to rise. And I think that regulatory clarity will prove to be a positive factor because it will bring in investors who might've been hesitant to own Bitcoin.\n\nThe most realistic outcome I see playing out is that Bitcoin simply becomes a more popular store of value among not only individual and institutional investors, but also corporations and even governments. My confidence stems from the fact that in its entire existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked, not to mention that it's weathered multiple price drawdowns only to come roaring back. As a result, I don't see it going away anytime soon. In fact, I'd be surprised if its value isn't much higher 10 years from now."

        "content": "You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player\n\nIt's shaken up the financial industry and inspired legions of devotees. But Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, requiring powerful computers to run for days on end, solving complex mathematical problems in order to keep the Bitcoin system running. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have found the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is roughly equivalent to that of countries like Sweden, Norway, and Pakistan.\n\nAnd while Bitcoin bashers have labelled the digital currency a climate villain, one novel strategy being looked at is using crypto mining as a form of energy storage by converting stranded renewable energy into Bitcoin. Wind and solar energy can be unpredictable, with supply often exceeding immediate demand. As a result, grid-connected renewable energy sources often have to pause operations if they're producing too much energy, energy which can't be stored.\n\nOthers are not as convinced. Regulators in Sweden said even if Bitcoin could run on renewable energy, the country needs those energy sources for essential services. But Bitcoiners contend wind and solar farms are often located in remote locations, and electricity does not transmit efficiently over long distances. Bitcoin mines, however, can be located close to renewable projects.\n\nBitcoin mines could also tap into the wind, solar, and battery projects that are ready to produce energy but are still waiting to be connected to power grids. That's 1,300 gigawatts in the United States alone. Bitcoin is already being used to offset excess energy produced by several global fossil-fuel energy producers. US-based ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas into Bitcoin miners in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the United States, while Exxon has agreed to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted to mobile Bitcoin mines. TEPCO, Japan's biggest electric power company, is the first major player to send excess renewable energy into Bitcoin mining.\n\nCrypto miners also stand to benefit from arrangements like these, as pressure to lower their energy consumption grows. In 2022, New York State imposed a moratorium on fossil fuel-powered Bitcoin mines, and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on digital assets poses fresh challenges to the industry. Last year, President Biden also signed an executive order on digital assets and said the United States must take strong steps to reduce the risks they create when it comes to climate change and pollution. Another reason why major crypto miners are keen to find greener energy sources for their operations and lower their carbon footprint."

        "title": "How to put words into a Bitcoin address? Here's how vanity addresses work - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered whether a Bitcoin (BTC) address \u2014 or a string of 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters \u2014 can happen to have human-readable words instead of random letters?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the Lightning Network, which allows you to create a fancy BTC address that looks like an email or a web domain. But there\u2019s also a way of creating Bitcoin addresses containing human-readable words on the original Bitcoin blockchain. Such addresses are known as vanity Bitcoin addresses.\n\nWhat is a vanity Bitcoin address?\n\nA vanity Bitcoin address is a personalized BTC address that contains a specific pattern or word in a part of its total 26-35 character string of letters and numbers. Unlike a usual Bitcoin address \u2014 which is made of random characters \u2014 a vanity Bitcoin address allows users to customize their addresses or even send a specific message just within the address.\n\nThe term \u201cvanity address\u201d comes from the plain meaning of the word \u201cvanity,\u201d which is used to express inflated pride in oneself or one\u2019s appearance. In line with the direct meaning, vanity addresses are used by those who want to stand out and give their wallet address a unique identity.\n\nVanity Bitcoin addresses became popular a few years after the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto launched the cryptocurrency back in 2009. The first vanity address generator, called \u201cVanityGen,\u201d was released as an open-source platform on GitHub in 2012. One of the first references to vanity addresses on Bitcointalk.org \u2014 a major crypto forum created by Nakamoto \u2014 goes back to 2013.\n\nAccording to Trezor\u2019s Bitcoin analyst Josef Tetek, Nakamoto didn\u2019t use vanity addresses: \u201cHe disappeared from the public before vanity addresses became popular,\u201d Tetek told Cointelegraph, referring to Nakamoto\u2019s vanishing in 2011.\n\nBesides the Bitcoin blockchain, vanity addresses are also available on other networks, including the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin vanity addresses, which allow users to choose among 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters, Ethereum vanity addresses only feature hexadecimal numbers, as Ether (ETH) addresses can only include letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d and numbers zero through nine.\n\nAccording to the ETH Optimism vanity address generator, creating an Ethereum vanity address starting with \u201c0xFad69\u201d would take up to five minutes.\n\nHow to create a Bitcoin vanity address?\n\nThere are two ways of creating a vanity BTC address: manually and using specialized vanity address generator services. The first method relies on software and requires some computing power and coding skills to run programs to find Bitcoin addresses starting with a specific word combination.\n\nMany Bitcoin experts like Trezor\u2019s Tetek agree that the first method is the most secure way of creating a vanity Bitcoin address, as this method allows users to keep their seed phrase private. Being the only owner of a private key or a seed phrase enables the user to be the sole holder of the funds associated with the address.\n\nThe manual method requires installing vanity address-generating software like VanityGen, which is available on the cloud-based software website GitHub. Running such software requires certain computing power specs, with larger sequences of symbols demanding more time to create a vanity address.\n\nVarious sources estimate that generating a vanity address containing a five-symbol word takes about one hour using a regular personal computer, while larger sequences like seven symbols could take up to three months. More sophisticated setups involving powerful graphic cards or even application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips can significantly reduce the time needed to generate a vanity address.\n\nThe second method of creating a vanity address is more straightforward but less secure as it relies on delegating the address search to third-party services, also known as \u201cvanity address miners.\u201d\n\nReliance on Bitcoin vanity services is associated with major risks, as miners can potentially take over the address and its assets at any time. That is because such miners are the first to receive the private key before passing it to the customer. The private key is generated at the moment of creating a Bitcoin address and cannot be changed afterward.\n\nThe vanity generation service is often offered via websites like Vanitygen.net, allowing users to simply order a certain desired word or sequence to be searched with computing power bought online. Such services often allow users to order a sequence of letters up to eight symbols. Once generated, the private key for the vanity address is sent to the customer\u2019s email in exchange for the agreed price.\n\nFor example, generating a Bitcoin vanity address starting with \u201c1Satoshi\u2026\u201d would cost around 0.0217 BTC, worth around $600 at the time of writing. Larger sequences like \u201c1Nakamoto\u2026\u201d would require at least 0.11 BTC, or as much as $3,250.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all letters and numbers can be included in a vanity Bitcoin address, just like a normal BTC address. Some letters, like the uppercase letter for \u201cO,\u201d the uppercase letter for \u201cI,\u201d the lowercase letter for \u201cL,\u201d and the number \u201c0,\u201d are excluded from the set of 26\u201335 alphanumeric characters available in all Bitcoin addresses. The exclusions aim to help users avoid confusion when sending funds on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe risks of using a Bitcoin vanity address\n\nA decision on whether or not to use a Bitcoin vanity address ultimately depends on the reasons for having such an address in the first place, taking into account all possible risks. Some cryptocurrency exchanges like BitMEX have experimented with vanity addresses using the native Segregated Witness (SegWit) address format Bech32 with the \u201cbc1qmex\u2026\u201d prefix.\n\nA spokesperson for BitMEX told Cointelegraph that most vanity addresses are used for marketing or considered \u201ca bit of fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin vanity addresses were quite popular on BitcoinTalk circa 2011, when many solicited donations to their personal vanity address, for example, 1Name,\u201d the BitMEX\u2019s representative noted, adding:\n\n\u201cIn the days before structured proof of reserves systems, the exchange-wide use of vanity addresses gave a way for users to informally sum up the reserves of an exchange.\u201d\n\nThe firm also attempted to use vanity addresses to make it harder for attackers to scam users since BitMEX only gave vanity addresses to users. However, one should not rely on vanity addresses as a security mechanism, as more advanced attackers could manage to copy the vanity address format, the representative noted.\n\nBitMEX\u2019s spokesperson says vanity addresses are best suited for advanced users: \u201cThe main weakness for individual users is reduced privacy. In general, we would advise users not to reuse addresses at all,\u201d adding that newer BitMEX customer addresses no longer feature a vanity prefix.\n\nTrezor\u2019s Bitcoin expert Tetek strongly advised against using vanity addresses because such addresses \u2014 even if generated in a secure manner \u2014 promote address reuse, which is a bad practice in terms of privacy. He said:\n\n\u201cIf a Bitcoin address is used more than once, other people can easily track the receiving and spending habits of a person. It is, therefore, also easier to identify the owner of the address.\u201d\n\nBesides privacy and asset safety risks, vanity BTC addresses are also associated with security vulnerabilities. In 2022, hackers managed to steal $3.3 million in crypto through a vulnerability in Ethereum vanity address-generating tool Profanity. Additionally, in March 2023, attackers also used hacked vanity addresses to steal $500,000 worth of tokens from layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin vanity addresses\n\nDespite Bitcoin vanity addresses becoming much less popular since 2011, there is no evidence that such addresses have not been used in recent years.\n\nOne report recently described the use of a Bitcoin vanity address containing swearing words apparently directed toward Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. The address has transacted a total of 0.29 BTC ($7,595) in 67 transactions between 2018 and 2020, turning its balance to zero.\n\nOne of its last recorded transactions included a 0.0004 BTC ($10) transaction to the public Bitcoin address of famous Bitcoin critic Warren Buffet, who was given a BTC address and a gift from Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nMoreover, challenges and considerations persist. For instance, the security risks linked to vanity address generators must be addressed, prompting the development of more secure and user-friendly tools. Vanity address creation could become more streamlined and available to a wider audience, not just those with coding expertise, as blockchain systems develop and incorporate new features.\n\nHowever, the privacy issues raised by the reuse of addresses will remain a crucial consideration. Therefore, users who want personalized addresses must balance the advantages of uniqueness against possible privacy breaches.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to understand that Bitcoin vanity addresses are quite risky and expensive, such addresses apparently unlock some new and maybe weird use cases of the cryptocurrency. With that in mind, it\u2019s up to Bitcoin users whether the future of Bitcoin vanity addresses is bright or not.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "A Chinese government official has been sentenced to life in prison for illegitimate business operations related to running a 2.4 billion Chinese yuan ($329 million) Bitcoin (BTC) mining enterprise and for unrelated charges of corruption.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Hangzhou City sentenced Xiao Yi, a former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference Party Group and vice chairman, to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power on Aug. 22.\n\nThe corruption charges stem from non-crypto-related activities of bribery from 2008 to 2021. The abuse of power charges, dating from 2017 to 2021, stem from providing financial and electricity subsidies to Jiumu Group Genesis Technology, a firm based in the city of Fuzhou that at one point operated more than 160,000 Bitcoin mining machines.\n\nProsecutors say that Yi \u201ccovered up\u201d the mining operation by instructing relevant departments to fabricate statistical reports and adjust the classification of electricity consumption. From 2017 to 2020, Jiumu\u2019s electricity consumption accounted for 10% of Fuzhou\u2019s total electricity consumption. \u201cYi pleaded guilty and repented, actively returned the stolen funds, and all the bribes and their profits have been seized,\u201d wrote the ruling magistrate of the Hangzhou People\u2019s Court.\n\nCurrently, China bans all forms of cryptocurrency transactions, exchange operations and fiat-to-crypto onboarding but has stopped short of prohibiting outright ownership. In an Aug. 3 decision, a Chinese court ruled that a $10 million Bitcoin lending contract was invalid based on the country\u2019s Bitcoin ban with no possibility of legal debt recovery. On Aug. 14, a Chinese national was sentenced to nine months in prison for helping an acquaintance purchase Tether (USDT), profiting $20 from the transaction.\n\nFormer Chinese government official Xiao Yi awaits sentencing.

        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Bitcoin 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There could be some overlap between the properties of cryptocurrency and stocks, but certain differences are stark and persistent. Among them is volatility, as even Bitcoin (BTC -0.43%), the cryptocurrency with the biggest market cap, is prone to sharp and sudden drawdowns.\n\nCryptocurrency is supposed to be the people's money, and I'd hate to see anyone take an unnecessary loss from trading Bitcoin. So, if you're reeling from recent events in the crypto-sphere, I offer you a quick dose of perspective on the power of doing absolutely nothing. For example, a $100 Bitcoin investment five years ago would be worth $370 today.\n\nBitcoin's brutal battery\n\nAfter resting comfortably at $29,000 for a solid month, Bitcoin took a breathtaking drop to $26,000 the other day. That's a 10% cliff dive in just a few days. But unlike investors in the realm of stocks, Bitcoin traders can't cite an earnings report or a disappointing product launch as a cause for the drop.\n\nAsking why it happened is a natural response, but it might only lead to frustration in this instance. The general consensus seems to be that the Bitcoin sell-off was prompted by the one-two punch of hawkish-sounding statements from a Federal Reserve Board meeting (\"... most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\") followed by a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's SpaceX had sold its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe financial press needs something to talk about during a slow, low-volume summer for stocks, and the Bitcoin rout provided ample fodder for commentators.\n\nStay small, and just HODL\n\nSo, all of a sudden, folks are worried about SpaceX's crypto holdings (or lack thereof). In their panic, they apparently forgot that financial behemoth BlackRock is working on getting approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nNow, that's newsworthy. BlackRock's clout is considerable, its pockets are incredibly deep, and a spot Bitcoin ETF would truly be a game changer. BlackRock's crypto involvement matters much more than SpaceX's trades. It may even, perhaps, be more essential than the Fed's economic outlook, which can change from one meeting to the next.\n\nIf these considerations aren't helping you sleep at night, feel free to take a glance at Bitcoin's history of drawdowns. If you're going to HODL (hold on for dear life) with calm and confidence, you'll need to make volatility your friend (or at least a roommate you can live with).\n\nAfter all, Bitcoin has had multiple drawdowns of 30% or more. I can't make any guarantees about the most recent pullback from around $69,000, but previous crashes invariably resolved with new Bitcoin bull markets.\n\nIn addition to learning one's history, it certainly helps to maintain small positions with cryptocurrency. Thus, a mere $100 stake in Bitcoin five years ago, when it was trading at around $7,000, would have resulted in an immediate 50% crash as the digital coin fell to $3,500 in early 2019. But then, turning a $100 investment into $50 shouldn't be too painful for most investors.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and with Bitcoin's price gyrating wildly but landing near $26,000 from the starting point of $7,000, that $100 investment would now be worth approximately $370. That's an impressive return on one's capital, just for having sat on one's hands for half a decade. It's true that you could have cashed in your Bitcoin position for $980 at the very peak in October 2021, but that's an unrealistic target and almost everyone missed it. Patient ownership over the long term beats quick-draw day trading almost every time.\n\nUltimately, the events concerning SpaceX, the Fed, and even BlackRock shouldn't be of life-changing consequence to investors who are willing to stay small and extend their time frame.\n\nAnd just remember that a dose of perspective is an effective sleep aid for headline-harried HODLers when Bitcoin bends and buckles."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF Approval: Potential Impact on Mainstream Adoption - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The financial world is buzzing with excitement as regulators evaluate whether to approve a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This potential watershed moment has spurred widespread debate regarding the consequences for Bitcoin's mainstream adoption and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\n\nAn ETF could act as a link between traditional finance and the digital asset area, possibly changing the investment and adoption environment. We explore the subtleties of Bitcoin ETF approval and considers the potential implications on the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nA Game-Changer in the Bitcoin ETF Landscape\n\nAn ETF is a financial vehicle that tracks the price of an underlying asset, giving investors exposure to it without directly owning it. A Bitcoin ETF, like a standard stock, would allow investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin's price swings through their existing brokerage accounts.\n\nFor several years, the concept of a Bitcoin ETF has been a hot topic, with various proposals presented to regulatory authorities. A Bitcoin ETF might offer institutional and ordinary investors a regulated and familiar entry point into the bitcoin market, thereby lowering entry barriers and enhancing accessibility.\n\nWall Street's Pursuit of Bitcoin ETF: Transforming Investment Landscape\n\nThe allure of a Bitcoin ETF is captivating Bitcoin investors as Wall Street's giants vie for regulatory approval. Amidst Bitcoin's price stagnation, major financial players like BlackRock and others are seeking to introduce a Bitcoin ETF, aiming to revolutionize accessibility and sentiment around the cryptocurrency.\n\nBlackRock's recent filing to launch the \"Black Bitcoin Trust\" ETF underscores this transformative trend. As other industry titans like Fidelity and Ark join the race, the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF holds promise as a mainstream investment avenue, echoing the democratization impact seen with gold ETFs.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF, allowing indirect ownership via ETF shares, is a concept gaining momentum. While not entirely new, its potential to reshape how Wall Street approaches Bitcoin is significant. Currently, American investors have Futures ETFs, but a spot ETF would entail asset managers holding Bitcoin equivalent to the ETF's value, potentially sparking institutional demand.\n\nHowever, regulatory hurdles loom. The SEC's prior concerns about market manipulation and surveillance sharing have led to ETF application rejections. Notably, BlackRock and others are working to address these apprehensions through partnerships and agreements.\n\nShould a Bitcoin spot ETF gain approval, the implications are substantial. Institutional investors may find this a safer entry point, potentially triggering increased Bitcoin demand. Coupled with the prospect of integrating Bitcoin into retirement portfolios, this could foster notable market cap growth.\n\nA Potential Paradigm Shift\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a watershed point in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector. The possible impact of such permission is varied, and it could have an impact on a variety of factors of popular adoption:\n\nEase of Access and Familiarity: The establishment of a Bitcoin ETF could open doors for investors who are apprehensive to participate directly in the cryptocurrency market. ETFs could bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset universe by providing exposure through familiar investment mechanisms. This could entice a broader range of investors, including individuals who have been hesitant to invest due to perceived difficulties or uncertainties. Institutional Participation: Institutional investors have been examining the cryptocurrency industry with caution, looking for legislative clarity and well-established frameworks. A Bitcoin ETF might provide the regulatory control and legitimacy that institutions are looking for, potentially leading to increased institutional engagement in the market. This injection of institutional funding may help to stabilize Bitcoin's price and drive overall market growth. Market Maturity: The approval of a Bitcoin ETF could indicate that the cryptocurrency market has reached a certain level of maturity. Regulatory acceptance would establish Bitcoin as an investable asset class, perhaps drawing more sophisticated investors and increasing media interest. This process of maturing may result in more sophisticated trading techniques, stronger market infrastructure, and enhanced investor protection. Increased Public knowledge and Education: The creation of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to more public knowledge and education regarding cryptocurrencies. As ETFs become more widely discussed and covered in mainstream financial media, more people may become interested in Bitcoin and its underlying technology. This increased awareness may pique the public's attention and pique their curiosity.\n\nConclusion: A Watershed Moment with Far-Reaching Consequences\n\nFinally, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF has the potential to reshape the bitcoin environment and boost mainstream adoption. A Bitcoin ETF might improve accessibility, encourage institutional interest, contribute to market maturation, and raise public awareness in addition to functioning as a handy investment instrument. The road to regulatory approval is an important step toward combining digital assets with traditional finance.\n\nHowever, it is critical to recognize that regulatory concerns and potential problems persist. The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility and regulatory uncertainty, and the licensing of a Bitcoin ETF would not be without scrutiny and controversy. The potential benefits must be balanced against the potential risks and the requirement for strong investor protection.\n\nOne thing is certain as the financial world awaits regulatory decisions: the possible approval of a Bitcoin ETF has the ability to transform attitudes, narratives, and investing strategies in the cryptocurrency industry. The repercussions of this decision will echo across the financial ecosystem for years to come, whether as a springboard for greater adoption or as a stimulus for regulatory conversation."

Let\u2019s look closely at several reports analyzing the relationship between Bitcoin and various asset types.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historic correlations vary across timeframes\n\nA report published in October 2022 by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute arrived at several key conclusions regarding Bitcoin\u2019s correlations with traditional financial assets, including:\n\nThe extreme volatility of the Bitcoin market means that long-term correlations are stronger than short-term correlations.\n\nThe \u201cpositive linkage between Bitcoin and risk assets increases during extreme shocks,\u201d such as during COVID-19.\n\nBitcoin can be positively correlated with risk assets and negatively correlated with the U.S. dollar.\n\nBitcoin can serve as a hedge against the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhile some of these points can be countered with newer price data over the last nine to 10 months, such as a major drop in volatility, insight can still be gained from examining them. In addition, other researchers have gone deeper into the relationship of specific assets to Bitcoin during set timeframes.\n\nCrypto-specific stocks\n\nA few crypto-related equities have been more correlated to Bitcoin than any other assets on the market. The 90-day correlation coefficient for BTC/MSTR, BTC/COIN, and BTC/RIOT have all remained near 1 for the last several months. The symbols \u201cBTC/xxxx\u201d indicate the correlation coefficient for each asset as measured against Bitcoin.\n\nFor MicroStrategy (MSTR), the coefficient has fallen no lower than 0.68 since September 2022. The coefficient for Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell to roughly 0.75 in June 2023, while Coinbase (COIN) trended near 0 for a time during May and June.\n\nCOIN, ROIT and MSTR year-to-date chart with 90-day correlation coefficients compared to BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nAll of these stocks have outperformed Bitcoin so far this year while also showing greater volatility. Investors may use these assets as proxies for Bitcoin, which can\u2019t be bought through a brokerage account.\n\nOne reason these three stocks are so closely correlated to Bitcoin has to do with the balance sheet of their respective companies. They all have a substantial amount of Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAs the table below shows, MicroStrategy has the most holdings of any public company, with 152,333 Bitcoin; Coinbase is fourth, with 10,766 Bitcoin; and Riot is eighth, with 7,094 Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin holdings by public companies. Source: CoinGecko\n\nPrecious metals\n\nWhen it comes to correlation with commodities and precious metals, silver beats gold in mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price moves since 2019.\n\nA November 2022 report by Jordan Doyle and Urav Soni of the CFA Institute titled \u201cHow do cryptocurrencies correlate with traditional asset classes?\u201d shed some light on Bitcoin\u2019s most-correlated assets.\n\nCrypto and commodities correlation heat map. Source: CFA Institute\n\nSilver has been the commodity most closely-correlated to Bitcoin from October 2019 to October 2022, with a correlation coefficient of 0.26, according to the report. Gold\u2019s correlation, by comparison, was just 0.15, perhaps due to silver\u2019s greater volatility.\n\nThe report notes:\n\nSilver has the highest correlation, peaking at 0.26 for silver and bitcoin. Bitcoin, the so-called 'digital gold,' exhibits only weak correlation with the precious metal.\n\nPassive and active equity funds and bonds\n\nWhen speaking of stocks as a whole and their correlation to Bitcoin, looking at an index or exchange-traded fund would be the most common way to make a comparison. This provides an overview of the asset class in general rather than zeroing in on one specific stock, which may have any number of factors affecting it.\n\nAs might be expected, growth funds tend to be more correlated with cryptocurrencies, presumably due to their more speculative nature. Notably:\n\n\u201cGrowth funds exhibit a stronger correlation to cryptocurrencies than value funds. The correlation coefficient between small-cap growth funds and bitcoin, for instance, is 0.41, compared to 0.35 for small-cap value funds and bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCrypto, equity funds and bonds correlation heat map. Source: CFA Institute\n\nIn other words, crypto markets as a whole are \u201cweakly sensitive to interest rate dynamics\u201d that were at least partially responsible for a broad drawdown in equities throughout 2022.\n\nFinally, Bonds bear little to no relationship with Bitcoin. Passive bond funds showed a correlation of just 0.11, while active bond funds were just two basis points higher at 0.13. All data points are for the timeframe of October 2019 to October 2022.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlations are not a crystal ball\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s large price swings, all correlations can change at a moment\u2019s notice. Still, the data used here provides an accurate picture of the assets most closely correlated to Bitcoin in the recent past.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and correlations: examining the relationship between btc, gold, and the nasdaq\n\nCrypto-specific stocks will likely continue having a strong correlation due to their Bitcoin holdings, while the correlation with commodities and equity funds could quickly change course going forward.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin 'supercomputer' and BTC DeFi coming soon - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Earlier this year, Ordinals \u2014 a unique inscription on the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, called a Satoshi \u2014 emerged as a controversial new development. Dismissed by some as spam and embraced by others as a way to bring BRC-20 tokens and NFTs to Bitcoin, the technology stimulated a flurry of developments.\n\nNow there is excitement around \u201crecursive inscriptions,\u201d which is a very confusing yet potentially much more powerful development. Recursive Inscriptions essentially promise to allow more complex functionality to be built on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, akin to smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nSome believe recursive inscriptions could see Ordinals develop from NFTs and \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d to underpin a full-blown DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin very soon. Others are confident it will enable Bitcoin to take on decentralized storage provider IFPS. One person Magazine spoke to believes it will eventually lead to an interconnected supercomputer being built on-chain.\n\n\n\nDanny Yang, a Stanford PhD, creator of OCM Dimensions and Bitcoiner since 2013, says recursive inscriptions unlock the next evolution of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t believe it when it\u2019s presented to them now. It\u2019s not going to operate exactly like Uniswap, but other high-value digital assets will emerge on Bitcoin. That\u2019s what Ordinals and recursive inscriptions will evolve into. They will become a new form of programmable assets and code.\u201d\n\nThese tech developments \u2014 while at a very early and speculative stage \u2014 are making Bitcoin interesting again. A Bitcoin maxi friend complained to me that I never write about Bitcoin. In truth, there\u2019s been very little new to write about until recently.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty true,\u201d Yang agrees.\n\n85% of on-chain bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours are ordinals related\n\n\n\nEIGHTY FIVE PERCENT\n\n\n\nthe main usecase of the bitcoin chain is ORDINALS pic.twitter.com/PCZt4if5jf \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 20, 2023\n\nRecursive support switched on in June\n\nYang has worked on recursive inscriptions since February in the form of Bitcoin generative NFT collections OCM Dimensions and OCM Genesis. He inscribed both of those innovative collections on Bitcoin in February (along with compression and 3D programming libraries) before anyone understood the significance of what he had done.\n\nYet OCM Dimensions was only publicly launched on June 15, the day that recursive inscription support was turned on for Ordinals.com. Yang explains to Magazine:\n\n\u201cYou have to show something before people start listening, and finally, after months of beating the drums about the significance of recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin, people are starting to get it after we showed what was possible with OCM Dimensions \u2014 the first 3D, high resolution, animated and interactive work on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFor now, the smart contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain is the home of more developer activity than anywhere else, and it dominates the DeFi sector. Until this year, the idea of building a genuine smart contract \u2014 the self-executing code used as building blocks for programmable money ecosystems \u2014 was not possible on Bitcoin.\n\nBut some now say Ordinals and recursive inscriptions could see a DeFi ecosystem emerge on Bitcoin fairly soon. It\u2019s not going to be easy, though.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a big deal. I\u2019ve been building on Bitcoin for over ten years, and Ordinals is the most significant development in recent years. Don\u2019t get distracted by the monkey JPEGs talk, and do learn why the Ordinals Protocol is important. \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 danny huuep (@huuep) June 20, 2023\n\nWhat are Ordinals and recursive inscriptions?\n\nOrdinals allow you to uniquely identify a satoshi or a sat. A satoshi is 100 millionth of a Bitcoin. Identifying a fractionalized part of a Bitcoin means creating NFTs on Bitcoin or creating a provenance certificate on-chain is now possible. The idea of NFTs on Bitcoin, the most decentralized OG chain, is tantalizing for some.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions are difficult to understand but have heaps of potential. (Pexels)\n\nIn January 2023, developer Casey Rodarmor released the Ordinals protocol, creating Bitcoin NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rodarmor found an unintended loophole in the taproot scripts that command lines of Bitcoin code.\n\nThe Ordinals\u2019 protocol creator argues that such NFTs are now \u201ccomplete,\u201d as the token and related images are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain rather than side chains or using off-chain storage systems like most Ethereum NFTs. Digital artifacts on Bitcoin are truly immutable.\n\n\u201cNow you can own the actual art, not just a contract that points at a piece of art stored on centralized databases,\u201d says Carlo Fox, an \u201cOrdinals OG\u201d since February who created the Nakamoto Whales series. NFTs, as we know them on Ethereum and on other chains, are more like digital ownership certificates than actual on-chain art, and Ordinals change that.\n\n\u201cI got super excited for Ordinals for a few reasons: for one, we now can create and own on-chain art that is truly immutable. When you understand the ramifications of this, it\u2019s huge. Half the time, NFTs as we know them are stored on AWS, centralized, and controlled by creators who can turn your art into pictures of turds at any time.\u201d\n\nOrdinals allow you to store any type of data on the most decentralized blockchain, and no one can modify it. \u201cOrdinal artifacts may be most likely of any on-chain data to exist 2,000 years from now. That\u2019s meaningful, and I think it is particularly relevant when in the context of important works of art, literature and science. I believe that Ordinals will become the premiere destination for the most coveted and important on-chain art. It\u2019s akin to carving a statue out of gold,\u201d says Fox.\n\nSo the business case for high-value NFTs minted on Bitcoin makes sense. Using the new tech to create cool 3D art for OCM Dimensions helped Yang\u2019s company Metagood sell the idea of launching tokens on Bitcoin Ordinals to Asprey Studios and the Italian car company Bugatti recently.\n\nBut OG Ordinals could only hold 4MB of data, and that is one reason why recursive inscriptions have emerged.\n\nFox launched the Nakamoto Whales Ordinals collection: (Twitter)\n\nRecursive inscriptions = Bitcoin cloud computing\n\nAt its most basic recursive inscriptions let you record stuff associated with a particular Bitcoin and enable smart contract-type functionality \u2014 Yang says they could have been called programmable inscriptions. By interlinking data through a series of calls (a contract for a sell order, for example), it\u2019s possible to extract that data to run more complex processes anchored on Bitcoin blocks.\n\nThis enables recursive inscriptions to function like a distributed data repository, like putting AWS cloud on Bitcoin.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions 101\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nA recursive inscription calls data from prior inscriptions. Could be an image or some script which massively saves data/fees\n\n\n\nBrandon Marshall (@marshallmixing) tweeted about his website that uses recursive inscriptions\n\n\n\nSounds complicated? Nah,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/K3j3sBYNrK \u2014 Doggfather (@DoggfatherCrew) June 13, 2023\n\nComposability \u2014 getting disparate projects and protocols to work together seamlessly \u2014 is an important part of crypto and one of the main reasons behind the exponential growth of the Ethereum DApp ecosystem.\n\nRecursive inscriptions mean that even the most complex data sets, like video files and audio files, could now technically be hosted on Bitcoin. With a one-time cost to inscribe, data could be hosted forever on the most immutable and decentralized network in the world.\n\nRecursive Inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements. (Pexels)\n\nInscriptions are like data legos, enabling data to be taken from somewhere else and built upon. In computer science, that\u2019s where the phrase recursive comes from, as recursive inscriptions are a mechanism that extracts data from existing inscriptions and utilizes that data within new inscriptions.\n\nRecursion is a fully on-chain process that uses scripts to combine various other on-chain data sources. These can include image layers, audio, code or other data sources. Individual scripts of code merge these layers together through recursion.\n\nRecursive inscriptions use data inscribed elsewhere on new inscriptions, cutting down on storage requirements.\n\nFox uses the example of PFP art. Instead of uploading thousands of unique images (which can be prohibitively expensive), you can upload 200 and use scripts to combine them via the fully on-chain recursion process. The possibilities this offers are only just being explored.\n\nThis is powerful because recursive inscriptions enable new types of applications that were not possible before it. Applications like on-chain AI couldn\u2019t be done on the base layer of Ethereum, but NewBitcoinCity builder Punk 3700 believes they could now be done on Bitcoin. He\u2019s been playing around with \u201cPerceptrons,\u201d an early on-chain AI experiment on Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nHe explains that \u201cit wasn\u2019t possible to store the AI neural net models on-chain together with the artworks. So we split the AI models into different inscriptions and compose them at runtime.\u201d\n\nInscriptions an important development for human freedom?\n\nOne of the most fascinating elements of recursive inscriptions is that once the data is on the blockchain once, you can simply refer to it again and again, vastly cutting down storage costs and block space utilization.\n\n\u201cInscriptions are now reusable,\u201d explains Punk 3700, \u201cYou can inscribe a very large code library like p5.js once, and other developers can reference that p5.js library at run time without inscribing it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is super exciting because we start seeing a community-driven public infrastructure being built out.\u201d This means more complex inscriptions are being created at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\u201cEssentially, any type of data can be an inscription. The most rudimentary use case combines multiple data sources together, and every piece of it can live on-chain. On-chain data might be able to communicate with each other, and data could be realized over time.\u201d\n\nFox explains further: \u201cThe best way to think of it is anything you can do locally on a computer and have all little pieces live together in different files and work together.\u201d\n\nHe gives examples like \u201copen-source libraries, all on-chain,\u201d meaning important research papers on Bitcoin, with citations on recursions on-chain, meaning major discoveries can be published on Bitcoin blocks for time immemorial. Javascript packages can be inscribed on Bitcoin. Essentially, a tiny internet that\u2019s developed to live on Bitcoin can\u2019t be taken down, building and building until one day it has created \u201can interconnected supercomputer living on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe public hasn\u2019t grasped the significance of these developments, says Fox.\n\nWhat if you could play games that couldn't be shut down, run exactly as programmed without fraud or interference & could live far beyond our lifetimes?\n\n\n\nSay GM to the era of Decentralized Games (dgames) on #Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\u2192 https://t.co/5zV6MpFHd1\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/wYytBISiEV \u2014 3700 | New Bitcoin City (@punk3700) June 23, 2023\n\nLet\u2019s start with DeFi and AWS first\n\nLong before the supercomputer cranks up, we\u2019re likely to see Bitcoin DeFi and the chain emerge as a data storage competitor.\n\nToby Lewis co-founded OrdinalsBot, which automates inscriptions to help expedite development on Ordinals. He thinks that, for now, competing with the Web3 data storage provider IPFS is the best use case for recursive inscriptions. In the short term, both high-end and low-end NFTs can now be more affordably held on-chain.\n\n\u201cThe end point of storing data onto Bitcoin will get people excited. That\u2019s because Bitcoin has better name recognition than IPFS [\u2026] Bitcoin becomes the ultimate store of truth.\u201d\n\nDecentralized data storage on Bitcoin could disrupt NFT culture by allowing images, text files and audio files to be stored directly with tokens.\n\nOrdinals timeline (Ordinals Bot)\n\nLewis also thinks DeFi on Bitcoin is just becoming a realistic prospect now and that Bitcoin-native DeFi products are inevitable, even if they will be rudimentary for a while.\n\nThere is likely a large segment of users who will want to build and do something on Bitcoin, especially if the end state is a multichain ecosystem, posits Lewis. That is, use Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain as the layer-1 base, and use Ordinals and recursive inscriptions to connect to other applications.\n\nImagine we could split up parts of Bitcoin Core, load just an executable frontend, and the program \"calls\" the code it needs from other Inscriptions.\n\n\n\nYou're now running Bitcoin ON Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe can theoretically do this with a lot of different programs. \u2014 OrdinalHub \u25c9 (@ordinalhub) June 12, 2023\n\nDEXs and automated market makers are starting to emerge. Lewis notes that Bitcoin can link up to other layer-2 applications as another way for smart contracts to emerge on Bitcoin.\n\nThis is the kind of DeFi that Punk 3700 has been building on Bitcoin. He launched a new protocol called Trustless Computer that enables writing smart contracts and building DApps on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum and Bitcoin have a baby, that\u2019s Trustless Computer.\u201d\n\nOne of the first DeFi protocols it deployed was a Uniswap fork.\n\n\u201cNow that you could write smart contracts on Bitcoin, it turned out that building an AMM DEX was very simple. It took us just a couple of days.\u201d A month after deploying Uniswap on Bitcoin, Punk 3700 connected it to Ethereum layer-2 network Optimism and says it can trade with two-second latency and low transaction fees.\n\n\u201cWe now have a scalable infrastructure for DeFi to thrive on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin maximalists aren\u2019t going to like the use of Ethereum protocols in conjunction with Bitcoin, but Punk 3700 says it\u2019s the future.\n\n\u201cThis is the power of having a general-purpose programming language (Solidity) and a general-purpose virtual machine on Bitcoin. Developers can build any kinds of applications they want for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now no longer just a currency. It is becoming a DApp store.\u201d\n\n\u26a1 NOS: Scaling for Bitcoin \u26a1\n\n\n\n* 2-second block time\n\n* Super fast\n\n* Low cost\n\n* Smart contracts supported\n\n\n\nThe NOS testnet is live.\n\n\n\nSpecs: https://t.co/GFZb0865Oz\n\n\n\nCode samples: Building a decentralized Discord https://t.co/8ZKvl8JsBI\n\n\n\nExplorer: https://t.co/Ax0IjKrQOj\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/NJODoVrA4S \u2014 3700 | New Bitcoin City (@punk3700) June 1, 2023\n\nNew generation of Bitcoin maxis?\n\nAt present, these use cases for recursive inscriptions and smart contracts on Bitcoin are highly speculative, and many Bitcoiners would no doubt argue abstracting it away on layer 2s means it\u2019s no longer really Bitcoin at all.\n\nBut Leonidas, the founder of Ordinals marketplace Ord.io, is very excited about the new Web3 experiments on the Bitcoin layer 1 as well. He believes that \u201cthe release of the Ordinals protocol earlier this year ended a long period of stagnation\u201d for the chain. He\u2019s seeing a whole new wave of developers flood into the Bitcoin ecosystem, who are \u201ceager to build everything from NFT marketplaces to DeFi protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people will be pleasantly surprised with how much you can actually do on Bitcoin layer 1,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe issue was never that Bitcoin as a technology wasn\u2019t capable of handling Web3 use cases; it\u2019s that a culture of toxic maximalism had driven the most talented developers to other ecosystems where they would be celebrated for their innovations rather than harassed.\u201d\n\nLeonidas firmly believes that through Ordinals, Bitcoin has \u201centered a new era where developers rather than idealists will dictate its future,\u201d and he is optimistic that Bitcoin\u2019s brightest days lay ahead."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BNB, the native token of Binance, has been trading near its yearly low since reports emerged last week about the termination of the partnership between the cryptocurrency exchange and its U.K. payments partner.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nBitcoin and Ether fall along with all top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin traded at US$26,088 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after falling to a two-month low of US$25,409 last Friday.\n\nEther inched down 0.11% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,665 and was down 9.57% during the past week.\n\nAccording to Phillip Lord, president of the crypto payment app Oobit, the crypto market needs more clarity on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications to start gaining momentum.\n\nThe SEC delayed a decision on approving the spot Bitcoin ETF application of Ark Investment Management on Aug. 11, following a 21-day public consultation, a week before the agency announced that it will delay its decision on the pending Bitcoin ETF applications to 2024. The agency has accepted a total of six spot Bitcoin ETFs for review.\n\n\u201cThe upward momentum will be reinvigorated once the fog of the [Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s] saga will be dispersed,\u201d wrote Lord.\n\nBNB fell 2.17% over the past 24 hours to US$208 on Tuesday, close to its yearly low of US$207 registered on Monday.\n\nBinance has reportedly placed euro withdrawal limits in Europe on Sunday, due to mounting issues with its payments partners. Binance announced in June that it will change its euro banking partner, Paysafe Payment Solutions, from Sept. 25. On Aug. 17, London-based payment processor Checkout.com ended its partnership with the exchange due to concerns over money laundering and compliance. Binance contested these reasons, suggesting they might pursue legal recourse.\n\nBinance isn\u2019t the only exchange facing hurdles. CoinDCX from India announced layoffs of approximately 70 employees, about 12% of its workforce.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.17% to US$1.05 trillion while trading volume increased 22.14% to US$28.02 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s optional royalties sink Forkast 500 to new bottom\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.61% to 2,315.99 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and declined 6.77% during the week. The index hit a new all-time low of 2,313.63 points on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is finding new lows, but also new highs at the same time. The Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects a tremendous loss of value this year which has accelerated this week following OpenSea\u2019s announcement that they\u2019re moving away from forced royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose for a second consecutive day, up 27.42% to US$10.26 million, boosted by the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), that rose 190% to US$3.46 million. Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales also rose 49.18% to US$648,285, but DeGods sales fell 17.35% to US$418,395 according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cA perfect example of losses sellers are realizing is Bored Ape #8585 which sold yesterday for US$255,000 at a US$750,000 loss. It last sold one year ago for 777 ETH or just over US$1 million,\u201d said Petscher, adding that we\u2019re in a period of NFTs shaking out.\n\nDraftKings, a Polygon-based NFT project, fell to become the fourth-largest collection across all chains after its 24-hour sales fell 56.21% to US$3.46 million. Polygon\u2019s 24-hour sales fell 45.50% to US$7.96 million, but the Forkast POL NFT Composite inched up 0.03%, as the only Forkast Labs index in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise, Hang Seng starts recovery\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posting gains.\n\nThe Hang Seng climbed 0.94% on Tuesday, escaping its near nine-month low hit on Monday, mainly boosted by gains in the tech sector.\n\nThe annual inflation rate in Hong Kong edged lower to 1.8% in July, from 1.9% in the previous months, beating market expectations of 2%. The falling inflation failed to lift investor sentiment.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures also rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all increasing. The Nasdaq was boosted by an 8.47% surge in Nvidia share prices that rose to US$469, after HSBC raised its price target to US$780, ahead of the chip maker\u2019s earnings report tomorrow.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating Tuesday\u2019s earnings reports from BHP Group, Lowe\u2019s Companies, Medtronic and Baidu.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks at the central bank\u2019s annual symposium on Friday, for signs of the Fed\u2019s future monetary decisions.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019"

        "content": "North Korean cybercriminals may be planning to cash out more than $40 million in bitcoin after recently stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency, according to an FBI announcement issued on Tuesday.\n\nThe bureau said it tracked large volumes of bitcoin that were recently stolen in several high-profile cryptocurrency heists carried out by the North Korean state-sponsored cybercrime organization known as Lazarus Group, as well as APT38, a hacking collective also associated with Pyongyang.\n\n\"The FBI believes the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] may attempt to cash out the bitcoin worth more than $40 million dollars,\" the announcement said. The FBI also provided six bitcoin addresses where the funds were being held, according to its investigation.\n\nThe news comes amid growing concerns over North Korean cyber threats targeting financial institutions. Lazarus Group is estimated to have stolen over $1.75 billion in cryptocurrency, according to a report published by the blockchain data platform Chainanalysis, and many of those thefts have targeted banks and cryptocurrency firms.\n\nTom Kellermann, senior vice president of cyber strategy at the cybersecurity firm Contrast Security, told Nextgov/FCW that North Korea \"has been pillaging crypto exchanges for the past two years.\"\n\n\"Their nuclear missile program is funded by the proceeds of cybercrime,\" he added. \"The regime has benefitted from tech transfer from their Russian comrades and as a result they have dramatically improved their cybercrime capabilities.\"\n\nNorth Korean cybercrime groups have been responsible for several major heists this summer, the FBI said, including the $100 million theft of virtual currency from the decentralized crypto wallet called Atomic Wallet in June, to the $60 million hack from the crypto payment provider Alphapo that same month.\n\nNorth Korean cyber groups were also responsible for stealing $37 million from currency exchange service CoinsPaid in June.\n\nThe FBI encouraged private sector firms to examine all blockchain data associated with the addresses connected to the stolen cryptocurrency \"and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses.\""

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEight Republican candidates are gearing up to take the debate stage tonight as the early 2024 presidential election cycle reaches a pivotal point.\n\nFormer President and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2014who owns some Ethereum and has his own NFT collection\u2014will be notably absent, electing to skip the chit-chat in lieu of a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Twitter.\n\nTrump also used Twitter in 2019 to say that \u201che\u2019s not a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d favoring the U.S. dollar. But other presidential hopefuls have also weighed in. Where do the candidates stand?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has expressed support for Bitcoin since his first official day as a candidate. During his campaign\u2019s kickoff alongside Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk, DeSantis told the billionaire that Bitcoin will probably be killed off if President Joe Biden is reelected.\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis also said. \u201cThe only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has critiqued central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as well. He once called the technology a \u201cmassive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority\u201d and moved to prevent a digital dollar from ever entering the Sunshine State.\n\nCBDCs are similar to stablecoins, as both are tokens pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the greenback. But instead of being issued on public networks by private companies, CBDCs are maintained by their respective governments or central banks.\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nWhile Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. established himself as a pro-Bitcoin Biden alternative in May at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy was also a speaker with plenty to say about crypto\u2019s largest coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThomas Jefferson, he would\u2019ve been mining for Bitcoin today, I have little doubt about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an American embodiment. It\u2019s who we are as people.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Ramaswamy said that Bitcoin is not a security, lambasted the Federal Reserve for trying to play \u201cfinancial god,\u201d criticized CBDCs, and skewered the Biden\u2019s administration proposed 30% excise tax on crypto mining.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of his campaign is to reform the U.S. central bank, Ramaswamy said. He implored conference-goers to get him to the debate stage by donating Bitcoin to his campaign, and to make 2024 a \u201creferendum on sound money in the United States.\u201d\n\nRamaswamy told the crypto news site CoinDesk in May that he\u2019s the only candidate with enough knowledge to talk about Bitcoin intelligently. He also accused DeSantis of adopting many aspects of his pro-Bitcoin and anti-CBDC stance.\n\nEarlier this week, Ramaswamy got a thumbs up from Elon Musk, who called him \"a very promising candidate.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott has established himself as supportive of crypto regulation. He\u2019s a member of the Senate\u2019s Financial Innovation Caucus, which discusses issues like digital assets, stablecoins, and CBDCs.\n\nScott was also a co-sponsor of the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, a bill that ultimately failed last year but sought to define digital assets as an investment and modify existing rules surrounding accredited investors.\n\nAt a Senate Banking Committee hearing devoted to digital assets in February, he called out Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler for his decision not to attend, contrasting it with a plethora of TV interviews Gensler has done.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also asked whether the SEC was \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d for failing to take action against FTX before it was too late, leading to the collapse of the exchange last November.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know why no action was taken prior to the collapse of FTX, and how millions of dollars of American\u2019s hard-earned money just vanished into nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum hasn\u2019t been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin on the campaign trail, but he\u2019s given the crypto sector a tip of the hat within the past year. Commenting on the construction of a data center in North Dakota last year, he noted the state\u2019s emergence as a hub for crypto mining.\n\n\u201cThis major investment in North Dakota will further cement our state\u2019s growing reputation as a hub for data centers and cryptocurrency mining,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are well-positioned to support data centers and other energy-intensive industries.\u201d\n\nCould be a supporter, but it\u2019s hard to tell\n\nThere were several candidates set to take the stage on Wednesday who do not appear to have issued public comments about cryptocurrency or Bitcoin. They are former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nMiami\u2019s pro-crypto Mayor Francis Suarez acknowledged on Wednesday that he did not qualify for the upcoming debate, after he erroneously claimed he did a week before, per ABC Action News.\n\nDuring an interview with the crypto news site The Block, Suarez said he would potentially take his salary in Bitcoin as president, something he already does as Miami\u2019s mayor. Additionally, the candidate accepts Bitcoin transactions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for a president to encourage generational innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cI do support alternative assets like crypto, and I think they\u2019re very good for a country like the U.S.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) this summer completed its longest-ever period of negative year-over-year returns, wrote Dan Morehead, founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital.\n\nIt won't last, he argued.\n\n\"Our view is that we've seen enough,\" Morehead wrote. \"There's just so long markets can be down.\"\n\n#Bitcoin recently experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months.\n\n\n\nThe longest period prior was just under a year.\n\n\n\nOur view is that we\u2019ve seen enough \u2013 there\u2019s just so long markets can be down.\n\n\n\nMore: https://t.co/REfxkTp9CJ pic.twitter.com/UCEMMcznAM \u2014 Dan Morehead (@dan_pantera) August 23, 2023\n\nAs of June 12, Morehead said, the price of bitcoin had been negative on a year-over-year basis for 15 consecutive months (starting Feb. 8, 2022). Prior to this, the longest period had been less than a year (Nov. 14, 2014, to Oct. 31, 2015), he continued.\n\nIt's notable that bitcoin is, as of Wednesday, up more than 20% year-over-year, even after last week's tumble from the near-$30,000 level.\n\nAs for possible positive catalysts for a market surely in need of one, Morehead notes that July's positive court ruling on the XRP token for Ripple Labs still stands, as do \"endorsements\" from BlackRock, Fidelity and other asset managers in the form of their spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAnd don't forget about the upcoming April 2024 halving at which the BTC block reward for mining fresh blocks will be cut in half. Morehead isn't buying the efficient market hypothesis that the halving is so widely known that the its effect has already been reflected in pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If the demand for bitcoins stays constant and the supply of new bitcoins is cut in half, this will force the price up,\" said Morehead. His models suggest bitcoin bottomed for good late last year, should hit around $35,500 by the April 2024 halving and nearly $150,000 by late 2025.\n\nBitcoin retakes $26,000 level on Wednesday as rates plunge\n\nWeak economic data out of Europe early Wednesday sent previously surging interest rates sharply lower, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. all lower by 12 to 20 basis points.\n\nU.S. stock indexes are higher, led by the Nasdaq Composite's 1.5% advance. The S&P 500 is ahead by 1%.\n\nBitcoin is up 2% to $26,400, roughly inline with the gain for the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell takes center stage\n\nThe week's main economic event takes place on Friday morning, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will deliver the keynote speech at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nWhile the Jackson Hole speech in the past has occasionally been a forum for important policy announcements, the betting this time around is that Powell delivers a status quo message \u2013 that the Fed remains focused on containing inflation and will be data dependent going forward on decisions about whether to further tighten monetary policy.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Regulatory Shifts: How Recent Government Actions Impact Bitcoin - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, legislative events have a huge impact on the trajectory of digital assets such as Bitcoin. Governments around the world have been negotiating the complex environment of crypto legislation in recent times, affecting both the market and its participants. These legislative reforms have generated debate about Bitcoin's future and wider acceptance. We dive into current government moves that have impacted the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the Regulatory Environment\n\nBecause of the unique and borderless character of cryptocurrencies, governments have struggled to categorize and regulate them. Recent actions by many countries demonstrate the diverse approaches being pursued. Regulatory frameworks are being developed to strike a balance between innovation and investor protection and financial stability.\n\nThe Chinese Government's Cryptocurrency Crackdown\n\nChina, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, struck the market a huge hit by imposing stringent regulations on crypto activity. The country's crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading has resulted in a huge shift in the global mining scene. While this caused short-term difficulties, it drove mining businesses to relocate to more favorable areas, diversifying hash power distribution.\n\nEl Salvador Continues to Play Out its Risky Bitcoin Move\n\nTwo years ago, El Salvador proclaimed Bitcoin legal tender in a ground-breaking step that prompted both enthusiasm and trepidation. The Central American country's audacious move heralded a new era in the integration of cryptocurrency into established financial systems. This judgment has significant ramifications for cross-border payments, remittances, and financial inclusion, shedding light on Bitcoin's possibilities beyond speculative speculation.\n\nEurope's Changing Position\n\nEurope has approached cryptocurrency legislation in a varied manner. The European Union imposed Anti-Money Laundering (AML) restrictions on cryptocurrency platforms, demanding more stringent consumer verification procedures. Moreover, the Digital Euro project seems to be inevitable at this point.\n\nFurthermore, some governments, such as Switzerland, have embraced cryptocurrencies by giving legislative certainty and encouraging innovation, whilst others are wary due to worries about consumer protection and market integrity.\n\nThe United States: A Juggling Act\n\nIn the United States, regulatory debates have veered between cautious monitoring and encouraging innovation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to debate whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, while other regulatory agencies focus on anti-money laundering and consumer protection concerns. Regulation clarity may create a more stable climate for institutional investors to enter the market.\n\nThe Effects of Bitcoin Market Dynamics\n\nThe development of the regulatory landscape has sent waves across the Bitcoin market dynamics. Price movements frequently correlate with regulatory news, emphasizing the interaction between government actions and investor sentiment. As observed in the aftermath of large announcements, regulatory uncertainty can contribute to increased volatility.\n\nHowever, when regulatory systems improve, they may be able to minimize some of the dramatic price swings by instilling stability and legitimacy. With clearer laws, institutional investors, who are frequently wary of uncertainty, may find a more tempting entry point into the market.\n\nBalancing Innovation and Security\n\nWhile some claim that strict restrictions inhibit innovation, others say that precise guidelines can help crypto players live in a more secure and transparent environment. Finding the correct balance between protecting investors and promoting innovation is a challenge that governments must address.\n\nBitcoin's Long-Term Implications\n\nThe influence of regulatory changes on Bitcoin's future is multifaceted. Clearer laws may boost Bitcoin's legitimacy as a legitimate asset class, luring mainstream investors. Furthermore, regulatory compliance may open the way for Bitcoin-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be approved.\n\nExcessive regulation, on the other hand, has the potential to hinder innovation and drive some participants to more liberal countries. To ensure that the essence of decentralization and financial inclusivity that cryptocurrencies promise is not hampered, a delicate balance must be maintained.\n\nA Countermeasure Against Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nThe rise of CBDCs has spurred discussions about individual financial autonomy and privacy. In contrast, Bitcoin emerges as an appealing solution for those seeking to evade the implications of CBDCs. BTC's decentralized nature and robust security features present a compelling alternative.\n\nBTC's decentralized blockchain infrastructure stands in contrast to the centralized control of CBDCs. This decentralization empowers users to transact without intermediaries, preserving financial privacy and autonomy. Additionally, BTC's security track record, rooted in its decentralized architecture, makes it a reliable choice compared to the potential vulnerabilities of centralized CBDC systems.\n\nGlobal accessibility is another advantage of BTC. While CBDCs might struggle with cross-border transactions and interoperability, Bitcoin's borderless nature ensures seamless international transactions, enabling financial inclusion on a global scale.\n\nWhile the decision hinges on individual preferences, Bitcoin provides a powerful option for maintaining financial control and independence in an evolving digital landscape.\n\nExperiencing the Unknown\n\nThe regulatory landscape will undoubtedly shift as the bitcoin market evolves. Governments must adjust their frameworks to the rapid pace of technology changes while protecting their financial systems. Interactions between governments, blockchain technology, and decentralized financial networks are unknown territory, with implications for the future of finance.\n\nFinally, the importance of recent government moves on Bitcoin cannot be overstated. The problems of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial institutions are highlighted by regulatory developments ranging from outright bans to creative acceptances. Bitcoin's future is at the crossroads of these regulatory decisions, which must strike a balance between innovation, security, and investor protection. The crypto community is keeping a careful eye on how governments continue to clarify their stance, expecting how these regulatory moves will ultimately shape the route forward for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem."

        "title": "BlackRock has more to lose from a BTC price crash pre-Bitcoin ETF - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Numerous theories emerge whenever the price of Bitcoin takes a sudden and steep dive. The usual suspects include government regulations, the possibility of exchanges manipulating prices, Bitcoin (BTC) whales manipulating prices, overleveraged traders and some conspiracies involving Tether (USDT).\n\nSEC kicks Bitcoin ETF can down the road\n\nBetween Aug. 15 and Aug. 18, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a significant 12% decline. This occurrence followed a familiar pattern, prompting a variety of reasons put forth by analysts and experts.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of transparency among exchanges, verifying whether a specific entity influenced the price movement remains a challenging task.\n\nOn Aug. 11, Ceni, a co-founder of Ceni Capital, made a prediction that turned out to be partially accurate. Ceni predicted a Bitcoin price lower than $29,000, anticipating the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would postpone its decision regarding the ARK Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSEC Delays Decision on Ark Invest\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application, Calls For Public Input-8 week delay for BlackRock to manipulate the market. 29k should break soon cheap stats for holders and institutional investors. pic.twitter.com/pcBhOho0Ax \u2014 CENI\u2b1b\ufe0f(,) (@ceni0718) August 11, 2023\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the prediction didn\u2019t specify the timing of this event or the exact support level. As a result, the statistical foundation for this hypothesis becomes less certain.\n\nNonetheless, Ceni has pointed to BlackRock as a potential instigator of Bitcoin\u2019s crash, a claim that warrants thorough investigation.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF is not a short-term deal for BlackRock\n\nThe idea that BlackRock might benefit from a lower Bitcoin price before launching a spot Bitcoin ETF is not as straightforward as it may seem. While the concept of a lower Bitcoin price leading to increased profitability upon ETF launch might be intuitive, there are several reasons why this might not align with BlackRock's broader interests.\n\nFirst and foremost, BlackRock has built a reputation as a respected financial institution based on its commitment to market stability and investor confidence. A sudden and substantial drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value could undermine the overall credibility of the cryptocurrency market, something BlackRock would aim to avoid. The priority of maintaining the market\u2019s legitimacy might outweigh any immediate gains resulting from a low Bitcoin price.\n\nSecondly, obtaining regulatory approval plays a critical role in launching any financial product, especially within the cryptocurrency domain. The SEC meticulously assesses the potential for market manipulation and safeguards for investor protection. Engaging in activities that could be construed as price manipulation could jeopardize BlackRock's chances of securing the necessary regulatory approvals for its ETF offering.\n\nLastly, instilling investor confidence is of paramount importance when introducing any investment product, particularly a novel one like a Bitcoin ETF. A sharp Bitcoin price drop could erode trust among investors, not only in the asset class itself but also in the ETF.\n\nTherefore, BlackRock's interest likely lies in launching the ETF during a period of positive sentiment, where investors feel confident about the potential for future gains.\n\nIf not BlackRock, who's to blame for the BTC price drop?\n\nThe next possibility often considered when trying to explain a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price is the idea that the government will regulate the cryptocurrency sector. The motivation to regulate would be driven by a desire to reduce demand to make the U.S. dollar stronger.\n\nUsually, these theories suggest that steps would be taken to control stablecoins and exchanges that are located outside the United States. Market analyst Joe Kerr talked about this on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nTinfoil hat time:\n\n\n\nSell Government Bitcoin to Coinbase to suppress price.\n\n\n\nGet Binance to defend BNB by selling their Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nDrain Binance\u2019s cheap Bitcoin and sell it to coinbase.\n\n\n\nBinance goes broke & Coinbase has the majority of exchange Bitcoin (SSA req achieved).\n\n\n\nApprove\u2026 \u2014 Joe Kerr\u26a1 (@Boomstick44) August 18, 2023\n\nWhile this theory is interesting, there are challenges and factors that make it seem less likely. First, it\u2019s possible to somewhat track government wallets, but analysts should remember that governments usually have only a small part of all the Bitcoin, so their influence on the whole market is limited.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators are underwater on 88% of their BTC bags \u2014 Research\n\nBetting against the BNB price and other nonsense\n\nNext, the idea of betting against the price of BNB (BNB) might not be as simple as it sounds. To bet against BNB, traders would need to borrow it, but they can\u2019t do that on platforms that follow regulations.\n\nMoreover, by checking Binance's transparency page, a person can see in real-time whether the exchange's Bitcoin wallets are getting smaller compared to other exchanges.\n\nBitcoin balance on exchanges (total), in BTC. Source: Glassnode, @jimmyvs24\n\nThis could suggest unusual things like the improper use of customer money or financial problems. Actual data from these observations is more important than just guessing, as it gives insight into how well the exchange is doing.\n\nUltimately, most of these theories make assumptions and simplify things, ignoring how complex cryptocurrency markets, exchanges and regulations are.\n\nThe real results could be very different from what\u2019s suggested, so while the public might never know the truth for sure, a person can at least dismiss such theories as BlackRock crashing Bitcoin before a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Down 9% in the Past 5 Days, Is Now the Right Time to Buy Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC -0.51%) crashed 65% in 2022, investors are surrounding it with a renewed sense of optimism. The price of the top cryptocurrency has soared 56% in 2023, almost double the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nBut as of Aug. 17, Bitcoin's price has dropped about 9% -- and even more at some points. Perhaps there's some bearish sentiment starting to take hold.\n\nShould investors take advantage of the dip and buy Bitcoin right now? Or is it best to wait until there's more clarity about the near term? Let's take a closer look at the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nNotable headwinds\n\nSpaceX, the private aerospace company founded and run by Elon Musk, sold all of its Bitcoin holdings during the first three months of 2023. This was after the business wrote down the value of that investment by $373 million in the last two years.\n\nSpaceX has owned Bitcoin since mid-2021, so maybe the move was simply to take the loss, minimize the distraction that it might have caused, and instead focus on the core business of developing rockets and spacecraft.\n\nBitcoin's market cap is about $500 billion now, so the amount that SpaceX sold was tiny in the grand scheme of things. But it's not hard to believe that when news of the sale broke, it could have spurred other investors to do the same. That's because some parts of the investment community follow anything that Musk says or does very closely. So, when his company ditched its Bitcoin holdings, it's certainly possible that others followed suit.\n\nMusk isn't new to moving in and out of Bitcoin. In early 2021, Tesla bought a sizable $1.5 billion stake in the crypto and said it would accept it as payment for its popular electric cars.\n\nJust a few months after, Tesla decided that it wouldn't accept Bitcoin as payment due to climate concerns -- something that Musk, a brilliant tech mogul, should have known about before buying the digital asset in the first place. And in July 2022, it was reported that Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin position.\n\nBesides Musk's company potentially having an impact on Bitcoin, economic concerns could be at the top of investors' minds. Although the Federal Reserve does expect to cut interest rates sometime in 2024, rates also could be kept higher for longer.\n\nSpecifically, officials believe it will be awhile before the federal funds rate gets back to where it was before the pandemic, between 2% and 3%. Higher rates are generally a headwind for risky financial assets. Just look at what happened to tech stocks and the crypto market last year.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe near-term picture for Bitcoin is a bit unclear. Macroeconomic issues -- like where interest rates and inflation are headed, as well as how the economy is holding up -- will always be things to pay attention to. The price will continue to be volatile, which isn't surprising to anyone. And developments around regulatory updates probably will affect price action, too.\n\nBut I don't think the long-term story for Bitcoin has changed. The central thesis for owning the digital asset is that it could become a viable alternative to gold as a store of value, especially as the world continues becoming more digital and the internet grows in importance.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin possesses some characteristics that make it more attractive than gold, in my opinion. It is easy to transact in, and there are various financial services that allow users to buy things with it. And compared to gold, Bitcoin is more divisible and portable. These traits will likely be valued highly.\n\nAfter such a strong start to the year, Bitcoin appears to be taking a breather. Investors who are still bullish should take advantage of the recent dip."

        "content": "The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has flagged six Bitcoin (BTC) wallets linked to North Korean state-backed hacking group Lazarus. The six wallets contain 1,580 BTC worth $40 million believed to be hoarded from various cryptocurrency hacks over the past year.\n\nThe FBI in its investigation found that Lazarus Group moved approximately 1,580 BTC linked with several crypto exploits. These funds are currently sitting in the following Bitcoin addresses:\n\n3LU8wRu4ZnXP4UM8Yo6kkTiGHM9BubgyiG\n\n39idqitN9tYNmq3wYanwg3MitFB5TZCjWu\n\n3AAUBbKJorvNhEUFhKnep9YTwmZECxE4Nk\n\n3PjNaSeP8GzLjGeu51JR19Q2Lu8W2Te9oc\n\n3NbdrezMzAVVfXv5MTQJn4hWqKhYCTCJoB\n\n34VXKa5upLWVYMXmgid6bFM4BaQXHxSUoL\n\nThe FBI warned crypto companies that the movement of funds linked to the infamous North Korean hacking group could be a sign that they are looking to sell. The federal investigation agency advised crypto companies to keep an eye out for the six BTC wallets and use blockchain data to keep track of any movement of funds.\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses.\u201d\n\nThe North Korean hacking group has been actively involved in multiple crypto-linked exploits over the years, stealing billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. A recent report from TRM Labs suggests that the North Korean hackers have stolen nearly $2 billion in crypto since 2018. The group was most active in 2022, having stolen nearly $1 billion worth of crypto assets last year alone.\n\n2022 saw some of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits, and Lazarus Group was identified as the mastermind behind Harmony\u2019s Horizon bridge and Sky Mavis\u2019 $625-million hack on Ethereum-linked sidechain Ronin Bridge last year.\n\nRelated: \u2018Nobody is holding them back\u2019 \u2014 North Korean cyber-attack threat rises\n\nAlthough crypto-linked exploits due to code vulnerabilities in platforms and protocols have increased due to the sophistication in methods used by these hackers, blockchain technology still makes it problematic for exploiters to launder or move their ill-gotten gains due to the public ledger that makes it possible to track the movement of funds.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies like the FBI, along with crypto companies, have worked together on several occasions in the past to freeze funds linked to such exploits. Earlier in February this year, Huobi and Binance froze $1.4 million worth of crypto assets linked to North Korea. Similarly, $63 million worth of assets linked to the Harmony Bridge hack was also frozen by crypto exchanges.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "title": "Scrap solution: Burning tires to mine bitcoin - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists",
        "content": "Photo by Zachary Keimig on Unsplash\n\nA bitcoin mine located at a waste coal power plant in Pennsylvania wants to add a new fuel to its power generation mix: scrap tires.\n\nStronghold Digital Mining describes itself as an \u201cenvironmentally beneficial\u201d bitcoin miner. But during a virtual press conference on Monday, Russell Zerbo, an advocate at Clean Air Council, said the facility, Panther Creek, had received at least seven air quality violations since it was acquired by the cryptocurrency mining company in 2021.\n\nThe press conference brought together representatives of local and national environmental organizations, including Earthjustice and PennFuture, along with residents of Carbon County\u2014where the plant is located\u2014to ask the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to reject Stronghold\u2019s permit application for this new fuel source.\n\nTires are a significant waste problem: The United States generates some 300 million scrap tires every year. According to the EPA, burning scrap tires is better than dumping them in a landfill, but not as beneficial as finding ways to reuse or recycle them. In a landfill, the flammable materials that tires are made of can pose a risk of uncontrolled tire fires. Abandoned tires can also become breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquitoes.\n\nAnother problem is that the burning of tires releases a number of air pollutants. In addition to the usual pollutants and greenhouse gases associated with burning fossil fuels\u2014such as carbon oxides, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides\u2014burning tires can also release polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), along with other hazardous air pollutants and metals. Many PAHs are carcinogenic, but as the environmental organizations protesting Stronghold\u2019s application point out, Panther Creek does not monitor releases of these pollutants.\n\nStronghold is hardly the first company to think of burning tires to mine cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Vice News reported that the company Standard American Mining had partnered with PRTI, a tire \u201cthermal demanufacturing\u201d company based in North Carolina. Both the websites for Standard American Mining and the company that apparently acquired them are now nonoperational, but PRTI was still burning tires to mine cryptocurrency as recently as 2021.\n\nMel Magazine reported on another company in Texas, XcelPlus International Inc., which claimed it could convert all kinds of waste and garbage, including tires, and convert it to fuel to mine bitcoin. That company\u2019s website is now also defunct, but an archived snapshot shows the company boasted that this would net them carbon credits, tax credits, and waste disposal fees.\n\nAs I previously reported for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the history of bitcoin mining has been a race to find the cheapest energy available. Increasingly, miners have resorted to acquiring the means of power production themselves. Some have purchased retired power plants, others have installed generators at gas wells, mining bitcoin at the source. Tire-derived fuels are cheaper than other fossil fuels, so the trend of bitcoin miners chasing cheap energy continues.\n\nEven though recycling scrap tires is considered superior, this can also come with risks. Artificial turf made in part from recycled tires can release acutely toxic levels of metals like copper and zinc into stormwater, which if it flows into streams or other bodies of water, can be toxic to aquatic life. Home gardeners have even been warned to not use tires as cheap raised beds because they contain aluminum, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and sulfur, which can be released into the water and soil as the tires break down.\n\nEven if there are few good options for disposing of scrap tires, environmental advocates have asked Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to consider the use to which the energy produced at Panther Creek is being put. Electricity generation powers homes and businesses, and until the transition to renewable energy is complete, burning fossil fuels could arguably be necessary, to a certain degree. But using it to mine cryptocurrency is of little to no use for the residents of Carbon County.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is a completely useless private product that provides absolutely no benefit to residents currently impacted by Panther Creek\u2019s incineration of waste coal,\u201d Zerbo said. He argued that as such, the plant should be permitted as a solid waste incinerator, which would be subject to more air pollution monitoring requirements than a power plant.\n\nLinda Christman, a resident of Carbon County and president of the local environmental group Save Carbon County, pointed out that Carbon County is among the poorest counties in the state of Pennsylvania, making this an environmental justice issue. She said that 36 percent of the population within a mile of Panther Creek are living under the federal poverty level. \u201cThat may lead companies like Panther Creek to think that they can get away with anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say, \u2018no.\u2019\u201d"

        "content": "Shares of bitcoin miners are, not surprisingly, highly correlated to spot bitcoin prices. With that trait in mind, it\u2019s expected that these stocks ebb and flow with the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nFor the stocks and exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) , those correlations are double-edged swords. They\u2019re great when Bitcoin is rising and dangerous when the token slumps.\n\nThose dangers were on display during the crypto winter of 2022. It appears some crypto miners, including some SATO holdings, learned a valuable lesson and working to diversify their revenue streams. Alone, that\u2019s a positive. But when considering where some SATO member firms are turning to broaden sales avenues, the allure increases. They\u2019re turning to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMining-to-AI Transition Makes Sense\n\nExperienced investors know that bitcoin mining is a technology-intensive industry, requiring expensive, sophisticated semiconductors and high-level computing power. Because SATO holdings already possess those wares, the transition to the AI realm is practical and smooth.\n\nAdditionally, both bitcoin mining and AI require language learning models, meaning the former industry has synergies with the latter. In fact, a recent report by JPMorgan indicates that some miners have recently been selling crypto holdings to speed up AI entries.\n\n\u201cWith the rapid growth of AI, the increased demand for HPC is now opening a new and perhaps more profitable avenue for utilizing GPUs previously used for Ethereum mining,\u201d according to the bank.\n\n\u201cHPC\u201d means high-performance computing \u2013 a staple of both crypto mining and AI. Currently, some bitcoin and ethereum miners are testing established HPC capabilities to see if they\u2019re AI-ready. Importantly, initial testing is revealing profitability \u2013 something that\u2019s often evasive in the crypto mining space.\n\n\u201cIn these beta tests, miners are reporting high profitability per unit of power consumption, much above the profitability from bitcoin mining. With bitcoin miners having already secured more than 100MW of long-term contracts with their power grids, if the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,\u201d added JPMorgan.\n\nMiners\u2019 ability to find new sources of revenue is important for another reason. The 2024 bitcoin halving is expected to make the mining process of the largest digital currency costlier and less rewarding. That could be all the impetus some SATO constituents need to forge further into AI.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNodal Power has secured a substantial $13 million funding round to continue converting methane gas produced by landfills into electricity, which is then dispatched to local electricity grids as renewable power.\n\nNot all of that energy will be sold, however. Some of it will be used directly by the firm to secure the blockchain through clean Bitcoin mining.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is a secondary tool we use when grid economics aren't as favorable,\u201d said Matthew Jones, Nodal Power\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, told Decrypt. \u201cWe currently only do Bitcoin mining in our data centers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMethane, a potent greenhouse gas resulting from organic matter decomposition in landfills, largely contributes to global warming. That\u2019s because research suggests that it is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\n\nNodal Power captures and repurposes this leaked methane gas by combusting it in a generator to produce power. This reduces carbon emissions when compared to simply flaring off the methane, making a profit from an otherwise wasted resource while keeping the atmosphere cleaner.\n\nCurrently, Nodal Power operates two mining data centers in the US, with plans for a third in early 2024. The first and largest site, located in the \u201csouthwest US,\u201d primarily exports electricity to the local power utility, while the second site, situated in the \u201cmountainous western region,\u201d powers 500 miners for 40 petahashes per second (PH/s) of capacity.\n\nThe third site, backed by the $13 million funding, will mirror the second site in terms of power, mining capacity, and location.\n\n\u201cProbably noteworthy that our largest facility is the smallest Bitcoin deployment because a majority of the time we dispatch the electricity to the grid instead of using it ourselves,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIncreasing awareness of how much of a climate hazard landfills are, and that power generation is the best use in most caseshttps://t.co/TICnOf3IyB ... problem is 75% of landfills can't sell to the grid so must use that power onsite If only we had a user of that power onsite \u2014 Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) August 22, 2023\n\nWhile most of that power is then sold to the grid like a \u201ctraditional power plant,\u201d practical considerations force 75% of landfills to use that methane on site, according to Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital. Batten\u2019s $400 million fund invests in companies that intend to use landfill gas to mine Bitcoin.\n\nA recent KPMG report suggested that the volume of flared methane in the U.S. and Canada could potentially power the entire Bitcoin network."

        "title": "Bitcoin 4 Year Cycle Explained: What Can Traders Expect? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "In the realm of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the undisputed king. Intricately tied to its reign is a unique phenomenon known as the \u201cBitcoin 4 year cycle.\u201d This cyclic event holds significant sway over Bitcoin\u2019s price movement and can influence trading decisions.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we delve into the mechanics of this cycle, covering everything you need to know. Moreover, we will examine what traders can anticipate from it.\n\nNavigating the Bitcoin landscape\n\nBTC, a decentralized digital currency, operates on a technology called blockchain. This network involves \u201cnodes\u201d or computers running Bitcoin\u2019s software that validate transactions.\n\nEach transaction is individually approved and added to the existing blockchain, a public ledger. A subset of these nodes are \u201cminers,\u201d who participate in the validation process, also known as \u201cBitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nUnveiling the BTC mining process\n\nBitcoin mining is a crucial aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s operation. Miners, using their computational power, solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. The Bitcoin network employs a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW).\n\nMiners compete to solve the problem first, and the winner is rewarded with BTC. This reward system forms the crux of the Bitcoin 4 year cycle.\n\nIf you\u2019re a crypto enthusiast, don\u2019t miss out on the latest details on Shibarium.\n\nThe Bitcoin 4 year cycle explained\n\nThe Bitcoin 4 year cycle refers to a recurring pattern of price fluctuations that Bitcoin experiences approximately every 4 years. This cyclical pattern is intrinsically linked to the process of Bitcoin halving, a built-in feature of Bitcoin\u2019s code that halves the mining reward every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years.\n\nThe first halving occurred in 2012, reducing the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoins. Subsequent halvings in 2016 and 2020 further reduced the reward to 12.5 and then 6.25 bitcoins, respectively. The next anticipated halving is in 2024 when the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoins.\n\nDissecting the phases of the Bitcoin 4 year cycle\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what this cycle has historically looked like:\n\nPhase 1: Halving event\n\nThis is where it starts. The halving mechanism is designed to slow the rate of new Bitcoin creation over time, ultimately capping the supply at 21 million.\n\nPhase 2: Bull phase\n\nSometime after the halving (often several months), the reduced supply of new BTC entering the market starts to have a noticeable effect. Coupled with increasing demand, the price of BTC begins to rise.\n\nThis initiates a bullish phase where the price increases significantly. Media attention, fear of missing out (FOMO) from retail investors, and institutional interest can amplify this effect.\n\nPhase 3: Parabolic peak\n\nAfter a period of strong growth, the price increase often becomes parabolic. Historically, this has led to a sharp and unsustainable price spike, marking the peak of the bull market.\n\nPhase 4: Bear phase\n\nFollowing the peak, there\u2019s typically a significant correction. Prices can drop dramatically from their highs, leading to a bearish phase that can last for months or even years.\n\nThe decline often shakes out speculators and is marked by reduced media attention, pessimism, and often a focus on technology and infrastructure growth rather than just price.\n\nPhase 5: Accumulation phase\n\nAs the bear market bottoms out, a quieter accumulation phase often begins. During this time, long-term believers in the technology (often called \u201chodlers\u201d) and savvy investors accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices, setting the stage for the next cycle.\n\nPhase 6: Pre-halving anticipation\n\nAs the next halving event approaches, there\u2019s often renewed interest and speculation about its potential effects on the price. This can sometimes lead to a pre-halving rally. Then, the cycle repeats with the next halving.\n\nWhat can traders expect from the Bitcoin 4 year cycle?\n\n1. Increased publicity and awareness\n\nHalving events tend to attract media attention, which can lead to increased public interest in Bitcoin. New traders and investors may enter the space, potentially leading to higher trading volumes and volatility.\n\n2. Speculative activity\n\nAs with any significant event in the crypto world, speculation can run rampant. Traders might try to anticipate the price movement before the halving and react quickly to any changes afterward. This speculative activity can introduce volatility in the market.\n\n3. Shift in network security\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t increase in tandem with the halving, and mining becomes less profitable, some miners might shut down their operations. This can lead to a temporary decrease in the network\u2019s hash rate (the total computational power used to mine and process Bitcoin transactions).\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjustment mechanism would eventually make mining easier, inviting miners back into the network and restoring security.\n\n4. New investment opportunities\n\nThe halving could create new investment opportunities in Bitcoin mining and other related businesses. Traders should be aware of these opportunities and do their research before investing.\n\n5. Long-term valuation thesis\n\nThe reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s issuance rate can make the asset more scarce over time, potentially supporting a long-term valuation thesis. Investors who believe in Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition might see the halving as a confirmation of its decreasing inflation rate.\n\n6. Sentiment analysis\n\nGiven the attention and discussions around halving events, traders might also monitor sentiment in the market. Positive sentiment could potentially bolster bullish movements, while negative sentiment might have the opposite effect.\n\nStrategies for profiting from the Bitcoin 4 year cycle\n\nLong-term holding (HODLing)\n\nBuy and hold : The simplest strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin at what you believe is a low point in the cycle (often during the accumulation phase or the bear market) and holding it through the entire cycle.\n\n: The simplest strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin at what you believe is a low point in the cycle (often during the accumulation phase or the bear market) and holding it through the entire cycle. Dollar-cost averaging: Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, you can spread out your purchases over time. This reduces the impact of volatility and can lead to a better average entry price over time.\n\nSwing trading\n\nBuy the dip : During the bull phase, there can be significant corrections (or dips). Some traders aim to buy during these dips and sell on recoveries.\n\n: During the bull phase, there can be significant corrections (or dips). Some traders aim to buy during these dips and sell on recoveries. Sell the peak: If you believe the market is approaching a parabolic peak or is overextended, you might decide to sell a portion or all of your holdings. Knowing Technical price analysis, how to trace Bitcoin address and On-chain movements can help you make informed swing trades.\n\nFutures and options trading\n\nExperienced traders can use derivatives like futures and options to hedge their holdings or profit from price movements. However, these instruments can be risky and are not recommended for beginners.\n\nDay trading\n\nDay trading entails purchasing and offloading Bitcoin daily to capitalize on brief price shifts. Moreover, day traders use technical analysis and market news to identify profitable trading opportunities.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin 4 year cycle can be a powerful tool for traders and investors. By aligning your trading strategies with the phases of the cycle, you can potentially profit from Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and trading it carries significant risks. Always do your own research and consider seeking professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency bitcoin's price tumbles again, but fans say it's a buying opportunity ahead of next 'halving' - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "But Nick Bishop, a professional bond trader turned founder of crypto consultancy NotCentralised, says the halving will not necessarily mean a surge in bitcoin price in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe former investment banking head at Gresham Partners adds that evidence suggests some professional crypto traders try to front-run hype around the halving by selling to less sophisticated investors in the months before the anticipated event.\n\nIndeed, historical bitcoin price charts around the time of the last three supply halvings \u2013 in November 2012, July 2016 and May 2020 \u2013 suggest investors tend to take profits by selling as excitement builds ahead of halving events.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants to act like a price sage, I would respectfully point out we\u2019ve only had three data points from past halvings so far,\u201d Bishop says.\n\n\u201cHowever, what we can say from those three instances is bitcoin prices peaked about 12 to 15 months before the halving event. Then, between three and six months after a halving event, the price has recovered to the prior peak that occurred 12 to 15 months before the halving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRisk proxy\n\nBishop says arguably a bigger driver of bitcoin\u2019s price is its increasing correlation to other risk assets such as equities in traditional finance. That is, as big institutions such as BlackRock get involved, the bitcoin price is more likely to track traditional assets such as shares.\n\nOnline data shows a large proportion of the 19.5 million bitcoins in circulation are locked in cold storage or have not moved for more than six months, which suggests they\u2019re owned by long-term holders \u2013 \u201chodlers\u201d in crypto slang \u2013 with little interest in selling.\n\nAs a consequence, large institutional adopters in traditional finance such as Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investments or the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock may be left scrambling to buy a relatively small free float of bitcoins estimated at between 2 million to 5 million.\n\n\u201cThe more institutional interest we get, the more they\u2019re chasing a somewhat constrained supply,\u201d Bishop says.\n\n\u201cSo, in a simplistic sense, if bitcoin demand stays the same then a halving means a higher price. But you\u2019ve got all these real-world market interactions, the macro uncertainty, and the fact cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to risk assets. And as more institutions lean into bitcoin products like ETFs that will increase.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe halving of the bitcoin awarded for verifying transactions occurs each time 210,000 separate blocks in its blockchain are mined, which is roughly every four years based on the 10-minute average time it takes the network\u2019s hash rate (total computer power) to mine a single block.\n\nAccording to Caroline Bowler, the chief executive of Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, a smooth halving event should support the bitcoin price over the long term.\n\n\u201cI run BTC Markets, so I have to be bullish bitcoin,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe halving is indicative of the fact bitcoin is a young technology and does what it says it will do, which is the expectation in the market. But if we saw problems, there would be immediate downward pressure on the price.\u201d\n\nThe appeal of get-rich-quick and the public\u2019s increasing cynicism around central banks\u2019 money printing to support government spending has helped bitcoin\u2019s price to rise more than 200 times in value over the past 10 years since August 2013.\n\nStill, its future as a decentralised, apolitical and slightly crazy experiment in human psychology remains uncertain."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA contentious debate stirred last week after a report surfaced showing Bitcoin Ordinal sales volumes had dropped 97% from May to August.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report indicated \u201cdeclining interest\u201d in the wider NFT space, with trading volume for unique active wallets on Ethereum and Polygon dropping by 22% and 60%, respectively.\n\nFigures for Ordinals were purportedly far more pronounced, however.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are Bitcoin\u2019s version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They are digital artifacts inscribed onto individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPer DappRadar, unique active wallets for Ordinals also fell from their June peak of 85,316 to just 6,708 as of August 14, marking a whopping 92% drop.\n\nAs expected, these numbers led some to speculate that Ordinals are dead, landing hefty pushback from some in the Ordinals community.\n\nBitcoin entrepreneur and head of the Bitcoin Frontier Fund Trevor Owens fought the FUD with a lengthy Twitter post claiming DappRadar\u2019s report had been a \u201chit piece\u201d with \u201chighly inaccurate\u201d information.\n\nHe told Decrypt that he would \u201chave liked to find some value\u201d in the report, but \u201cwhen the data is wrong it\u2019s difficult to find anything redeeming,\u201d claiming there are \u201cclear indexing errors in their tech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinals, apples and oranges\n\nSeveral other on-chain data providers offered different figures than those published by DappRadar.\n\nFor example, Crypto Slam, a multi-chain NFT data provider, has sales volumes for May sitting at $195 million, a far cry from the $452 million reported by DappRadar.\n\nA Dune Analytics dashboard puts Ordinals sales volumes for May at roughly $154 million, closer in line with Crypto Slam\u2019s figures.\n\nJuly volumes on Crypto Slam were $65 million, while DappRadar\u2019s report showed $35 million. Although the Dune dashboard clocks $50 million, the percentage drops, again, line up with Crypto Slam rather than DappRadar.\n\nCross-referencing between Crypto Slam and Dune Analytics, both indicate a May to July drop of 67% and 69% in sales volume, respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s still quite a brutal fall, but it showcases a vast difference from DappRadar\u2019s 92% figure.\n\nBeyond these figures, what raised the most red flags for Ordinals fans was comparing entire months to just two weeks in August. For Owens, \u201cthe calculation that determined the 97% [drop] was based on 14 days in August and 31 days in May\u201d was the most egregious bit of the report.\n\nSeveral other prominent Bitcoin Ordinal fans echoed the sentiment, including Doggfather, the pseudonymous creator of the Frens Protocol, an Ordinals-based social graph on Bitcoin. He told Decrypt that \u201cthe most obvious error of the reporting was comparing full months to August\u2019s fifteen days.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJake Gallen, head of NFT and Strategy at Emblem, a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains, also told Decrypt the numbers aren\u2019t entirely right. \u201cThey included BRC-20 transaction volume data in some areas but not others,\u201d he explained, adding that \u201cvolume is down but there are also tens of thousands of transactions per day.\u201d\n\n'Ordinals an odd beast', says DappRadar\n\nSenior Communications Manager for DappRadar, Robert Hoogendoorn told Decrypt \u201cOrdinals are an odd beast,\u201d which require a \u201cunique methodology.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t label the current discussion as a controversy, and that they \u201caim to be open and transparent about how we track things.\u201d\n\nHoogendoorn shared a prepared statement from DappRadar that countered the \"strong criticism from Ordinals community members questioning the credibility of our data and analysis.\"\n\n\"Our team members are experienced Web3 analysts and reporters\u201d and \"the data published is accurate,\" reads the statement.\n\nAlthough DappRadar acknowledged \u201cpotential discrepancies,\u201d due to BRC-20 swaps made through marketplaces, the team explained that \"we\u2019re mainly focusing on NFTs [and] Inscriptions. Unlike other platforms that track transactions not visible on the block explorer and which remain unconfirmed, we\u2019ve chosen to exclude such data.\"\n\nThat said, neither Hoogendoorn nor DappRadar addressed the concerns regarding reporting on numbers for an incomplete month for August.\n\n\"What\u2019s more, DappRadar tracks trades on marketplaces such as Unisat and Ordinals Wallets, markets that peaked earlier this year and were perhaps not covered by competitors,\" the statement continues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of which numbers users turn to, though, the reality is still pretty bleak for Ordinals. But that's true for much of the industry.\n\nAccording to Isabel Foxen Duke, former communications director for the Ordinals protocol, the market \u201cis down after a hype cycle,\u201d but she told Decrypt \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take seriously the idea that Ordinals are going away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorical inscriptions will always have value to collectors at a certain price,\u201d she concluded."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai: The sudden sell-off in major cryptocurrencies over the past few days has rattled Indian crypto investors, with Bitcoin seeing its most significant weekly drop since the November 2022 FTX crash In the past week, Bitcoin declined 11.5%, hitting $26,023.3, according to CoinGecko's data as of 5.30 pm on Monday. Similarly, significant alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum fell 9.7%, Ripple lost 16.9%, Solana crashed 13.3%, and memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu declined nearly 16%.The broader market was already in a bear phase, but Bitcoin faced an 8% plunge on August 18 as Elon Musk's SpaceX reportedly divested its Bitcoin holdings, akin to Tesla.SpaceX had accumulated $373 million in Bitcoin during 2021-2022.\"Bitcoin's fall below $26,000 last week was the biggest decline for BTC in almost over a year,\" said Siddhartha Gupta, SVP, business and strategic alliances, CoinDCX.Simultaneously, investor concerns were heightened by the US Federal Reserve's July minutes suggesting possible interest rate hikes. Moreover, large Bitcoin holders selling off their investments in the futures market and China's second-largest property developer, China Evergrande, filing for US bankruptcy, added to the uncertainty to the economic landscape.\"Market sentiments changed very quickly after the Tesla news and then there was a bunch of negative news which just kept adding to the prevailing uncertainty. It looks like bearish sentiment will remain until there is more regulatory clarity,\" said Vishal Gupta, a Noida-based crypto investor.Many Indian cryptocurrency investors have halted their investments following a 30% tax on crypto earnings enforced by the government. Nonetheless, a minority continues to retain their holdings, though sudden market downturns are compounding the prevailing pessimism.\"Due to unfriendly policies of the government, I have sold most of all the crypto I held. It's not looking good for crypto or any risk asset that is non-productive, does not produce cash flow. Rising interest rates will hit speculative assets the hardest,\" said Ashwin Nadar, an avid Mumbai-based crypto tracker.Dhruvil Shah-SVP of technology, Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said the regulatory uncertainty dampens the enthusiasm within the digital asset community and results in a liquidity crunch in the market.\"The second half of 2023 has been a phase of price correction across digital assets, including Bitcoin. The short-term outlook for BTC looks bearish as BTC can correct even further into the 20-25k range in the short term. We can expect some green shoots by the end of September or the beginning of October this year,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India's second longest-running digital asset exchange.Despite the prevailing circumstances, a modest level of trading persisted on Indian crypto exchanges throughout the past week."

        "content": "88.3% of BTC\u2019s short-term holder supply was being held at an unrealized loss following last week\u2019s decline in value.\n\nBTC\u2019s price is at risk of further decline should short-term holders intensify coin distribution.\n\nLast week\u2019s deleveraging event in the Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] futures markets caused the king coin to record its most significant single-day sell-off of the year. As investors count their losses, short-term holders may face a gloomy future as 88.3% of short-term holder supply was being held in an unrealized loss, Glassnode found in a new report.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nShort-term holders were the most exposed\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, a large percentage of BTC\u2019s supply previously held in profit fell sharply last week. This suggested that a sizeable number of investors that bought the leading cryptocurrency at high prices were plunged into losses.\n\nGlassnode opined that this was due to a \u201ctop heavy market.\u201d This refers to a market situation where many investors buy BTC at a price that is close to or above the current price. This means these investors would be in an unrealized loss position if the coin\u2019s value fell.\n\nNoting that this behavior was common among BTC\u2019s short-term holders, Glassnode found that:\n\n\u201cSharp upticks in STH Supply in Loss tend to follow \u2018top heavy markets\u2019 such as May 2021, Dec 2021, and again this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit,\u201d Glassnode added.\n\nFurther, Glassnode assessed the Profit or Loss Bias (dominance) of STH volumes flowing into exchanges and found the profit dominance of STH volumes flowing into exchanges has been on a consistent decline since BTC\u2019s value began its uptrend in January.\n\nThis is because many investors that comprise the STH cohort of BTC holders have continued to buy the coin at \u201can increasingly elevated cost basis.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nWith last week not being any different:\n\n\u201cWe saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19.8k. This suggests that the STH cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings and increasingly price sensitive.\u201d\n\nThis tells us that the current BTC market is becoming more top-heavy. With STHs prone to more losses because they keep buying at the top, BTC\u2019s price might struggle to grow in the meantime.\n\nPointing out that last week\u2019s price fall was \u201cone to keep a close eye on,\u201d Glassnode found that loss momentum and dominance amongst BTC short-term holders have surged. When this happened in May and December 2021, it was followed by \u201cmore violent downtrends\u201d in BTC\u2019s value."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nWith more than 50% of the global cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has long kept its position as the unchallenged leader in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For years, its supremacy was unstoppable, but recent developments point to a potential change in the environment. This essay explores the fascinating history of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, its changing volatility, and the rise of hopeful altcoins like Elonator (ETOR) and Solana that may one day overthrow it.\n\n<< Click Here To Learn More About Elonator Presale >>\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s Dominance Coming To An End?\n\nBitcoin, also known as digital gold, is considered the pioneer of cryptocurrencies. Since its inception, it has led the crypto revolution, captivating both investors and enthusiasts. Throughout its journey, it has experienced exhilarating price spikes and heartbreaking crashes, driven by volatility that has been both its hallmark and a deterrent. There is, however, a turning of the tide. As Bitcoin moves more into mainstream financial markets, its volatility is declining. Bitcoin\u2019s price swings may be waning despite its appeal to institutional investors.\n\nAll other cryptocurrencies, many of which go above and beyond what the original cryptocurrency had to offer, were modeled after the first-ever cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. In what cryptocurrency analysts refer to as an \u201caltcoin season,\u201d altcoins have recently outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin; but, if the strong signal of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is confirmed, this outperformance might abruptly halt, causing further collapse. At times, altcoins will start to outperform Bitcoin for a considerable amount of time during what crypto analysts have nicknamed the \u201caltcoin season.\u201d Altcoins have been soaring since the beginning of 2020, helping to lift Bitcoin from regional lows. In recent weeks, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has fallen from highs of about 72% to as low as 64% due to the rise in altcoins and a lagging Bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, an indicator of its value relative to other altcoins on the market, has collapsed, indicating that altcoins will soon suffer a death blow. It remains to be seen if this means Bitcoin price will surge past $10,000, leaving altcoins in the dust, or if the two crypto classes will fall together, with altcoins dropping even harder, which might lead to an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nEverything You Need To Know About Solana\n\nSolana is a blockchain that strongly resembles Ethereum; in fact, many people regularly refer to it as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d Like Ethereum, the SOL currency may be purchased on most key exchanges. The true value of the token is found in transactions on the Solana network, which provides unique advantages. The blockchain of Solana makes use of the proof-of-history consensus algorithm. The bulk of early cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Litecoin, determine the blocks in their chains using a proof-of-work algorithm. The next block is selected by miners using the proof of work consensus technique.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the cryptocurrency space, Solana is progressing in solving some of its drawbacks. Solana touts itself as a competitive alternative for those looking for utility and efficiency, with blazing-fast transaction speeds and much cheaper fees than Bitcoin. These events provide a compelling narrative for cryptocurrency fans interested in the market\u2019s future structure and the potential evolution of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. Bitcoin\u2019s declining volatility offers possibilities for more cautious institutions and investors who may have been turned off by its wild price swings.\n\nSimultaneously, the rise of altcoins like Elonator and Solana introduces exciting opportunities for those willing to embrace innovation and explore the uncharted territories of the crypto space. The era of Bitcoin\u2019s unchallenged dominance may be coming to an end, and astute investors are taking notice.\n\nElonator Offers Best Investment Experience\n\nThe Elonator token was designed with a special blend of comedy, cultural significance, and promising investment opportunities. It seeks to write a new chapter in the history of digital assets. With this innovative strategy, the token can significantly advance the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies in addition to acting as a speculative instrument. Elonator is dedicated to generating genuine value for our neighborhood by upholding openness and accessibility, allowing anybody to examine and validate our deeds. Anyone having ETOR contract address may readily trace transaction flows through the Ethereum blockchain explorer because Elonator is developed on the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology, immutability and transparency, tremendously aid in building confidence. In addition to promoting consensus on accepted norms, these elements also promote social engagement and boost transactional efficiency quickly for the best possible economic outcomes. At Elonator, strong security ranks above transparency and trust as a high priority. An impartial, reputable auditor will conduct a thorough audit of our protocol\u2019s smart contracts to further guarantee the platform\u2019s reliability and security.\n\n<< Buy Into The Elonator Presale >>\n\nWith That In Mind \u2013 Is Bitcoin\u2019s Dominance Coming To An End?\n\nThe only thing that is consistent in the world of cryptocurrency is change. Despite being unchallenged for years, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is now facing obstacles from within its own ecosystem. The narrative is expanding from a narrow focus on Bitcoin to a wider examination of possibilities as altcoins gain traction. Investors stand at a fork in the road as the bitcoin market enters a new phase. A clear image of the industry\u2019s future is painted by the declining volatility of Bitcoin, the introduction of altcoin opportunities like Elonator, and the scaling advancements of Solana. The moment to think about diversifying one\u2019s portfolio with these cutting-edge options may be now for individuals willing to ride the tides of change. Opportunities abound as the crypto landscape changes and diversifies. Accept change, investigate your options, and think about investing in the Elonator presale, which has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFor All Things Elonator, Including Its Presale:\n\nPresale: https://buy.elonator.com/\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://elonator.com\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/ElonatorCoin\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElonatorCoin"

        "title": "What to expect from Bitcoin in the future? - Times of Malta",
        "content": "The future of Bitcoin is hard to predict because of its prominence as the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin has been gaining wider acceptance as a form of digital currency and a store of value. As more companies, institutions, and individuals adopt it, the demand and utility of Bitcoins are likely to increase. Governments around the world have been developing regulations for cryptocurrencies. The regulatory environment could shape Bitcoin's future by either fostering its growth or imposing restrictions that might affect its popularity and usage.\n\nWill Bitcoin gain momentum and rise in 2023?\n\nThe question everybody would like the answer to: will Bitcoin rise in value? The Bitcoin price has seen a remarkable turnaround in the first half of 2023, surging by 55%, possibly signaling the end of the crypto winter. However, the cryptocurrency's price momentum has recently stalled, leaving traders uncertain about its future trajectory. In January 2023, BTC began its turnaround, gaining an impressive 83% by April 10th, reaching a high of $31,035. This milestone also marked a breakthrough above a crucial resistance level at $30,000, albeit briefly. Since April, Bitcoin has been trading sideways and downward, fluctuating between support at $27,000 and resistance at $30,000. The coin experienced consecutive lower lows, with occasional breaks below the support level.\n\nAt the start of the year, 2023 seemed like a potential breakout year for Bitcoin prices, with its 83% growth in just four months attracting investors seeking an inflation-proof asset similar to gold, given the continued high inflation. However, Bitcoin's momentum waned due to cooling inflation and higher interest rates, prompting investors to shift from holding BTC to holding treasury bills. Moreover, increased regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market spooked many institutional investors, leading to reductions in their digital asset holdings.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin's Fear and Greed Index stands at 44, reflecting fear in the market, a significant change from a month ago when it indicated greed at an index of 66. This index considers various factors such as volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment and search trends. The negative news surrounding Bitcoins has manifested in its price action, with the coin struggling to maintain a break above the key $30,000 resistance level and instead trending downward, repeatedly testing support at $27,000. For more information, everything you need to know about bitcoin can be found here.\n\nCan the Bitcoin price reach $100,000 by 2023?\n\nBitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally of over 80% since the beginning of the year, surpassing many other major assets and delivering substantial returns to those who bought during dips. For Bitcoin to achieve this magical milestone, it would need to show an upside of 270%, reaching the level of $100,000 from its current value. Considering the BTC price chart, potential support levels are identified at $25,175, $21,525, and $18,650. While Bitcoin's slide may temporarily pause around the $25,175 level, this weak support is unlikely to hold in the long term. The $21,525 support appears to be more robust and could potentially serve as a stable price point for Bitcoins. In a worst-case scenario for Bitcoin investors, the coin might test its support at $18,650 or even revisit its 2022 low of $15,760.\n\nCan the Bitcoin orice reach $1,000,000 by 2025?\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts often have ambitious and sometimes seemingly impossible predictions for the cryptocurrency. Following this recent mini-bull run, discussions have emerged suggesting that BTC could potentially reach a level of $1 million by the year 2025. This hypothetical figure of $1 million has been echoed by several prominent figures in the crypto space. For that to happen, the world would have to experience a hyperinflation, which would weaken the value of the dollar, leading people to turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against currency depreciation. Some crypto experts believe that while it can reach $1 million in the coming years, they find it unlikely to happen so soon, such as in 2023 or within 90 days. Others suggest that such an extreme prediction might take around 10 years to materialize, if at all. As with any speculation regarding Bitcoin's future price, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable, and multiple factors can influence its value over time.\n\nOr, will we see a Bitcoin crash in 2023?\n\nWhile some investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future, there is another group of investors, corporates, and large institutions who hold a contrasting view and firmly believe that Bitcoins might face a decline in the near future. They perceive the recent rally as a \"bull trap\" rather than a genuine \"bull run.\" Experts argue that the backdrop of rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy may hinder Bitcoin's sharp rebound in the near future. In such uncertain markets, investors may be less inclined to invest in or buy risky assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, some long-term BTC holders might choose to sell their positions, leading to additional downward pressure on the markets.\n\nWhat is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin?\n\nOn the bearish side of the Bitcoin argument, there are investors who firmly believe that digital currencies, including Bitcoin, are fundamentally worthless. It's important to note that this worst-case scenario is pessimistic, just as the best-case scenario is overly optimistic. The likelihood of these doom-and-gloom factors materializing is slim, just as the chances of all the pieces aligning perfectly for a Bitcoin utopia are improbable. As with any investment, especially one as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin, it's crucial to be aware of potential risks.\n\nThose holding this viewpoint expect the Bitcoin token to eventually lose all of its value, and this could happen in several ways:\n\nGlobal government ban\n\nGovernments worldwide unite against Bitcoin transactions, leading to its effective reduction in value to $0.00. If the digital coin becomes inaccessible for usage, trading, or ownership, it would lose all worth.\n\nMade obsolete by a new, better technology\n\nA new digital currency with superior technology could emerge, rendering Bitcoin mining obsolete overnight. The introduction of a more advanced solution offering tighter security, faster transactions, enhanced privacy protections or even lower energy consumption could deal a significant blow to Bitcoin's value.\n\nCatastrophic technical error\n\nA major flaw in Bitcoin's underlying technology could be discovered, compromising the network's security. For instance, if the transaction system is found to be vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers, it could severely impact investor trust, leading to a sharp price drop.\n\nEnvironmental impact \u2013 Bitcoin's massive energy consumption\n\nContinued rise in Bitcoin's energy consumption may draw increased criticism and potential regulatory restrictions due to environmental concerns. This could result in a loss of market trust and value for Bitcoin mining.\n\nA more realistic scenario for Bitcoin\n\nThe outlook for the Bitcoin network, taking a more practical and realistic approach, acknowledges the speculative nature of previous utopian and dystopian reviews. It recognizes that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, will experience both positive and negative developments in the coming years. While the potential for reshaping global financial markets is evident, the path forward is expected to be challenging and unpredictable.\n\nThe following are the key points in this middle-road perspective:\n\nRegulation uncertainty\n\nGovernments worldwide will continue to grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a tug-of-war between acceptance and restrictions. This regulatory uncertainty may cause periods of extreme market volatility as the industry responds to regulatory news.\n\nIncreased usage over time\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to see increased adoption by businesses and consumers, but the process will be gradual. Some entities may remain hesitant due to concerns about volatility, transaction costs, and regulatory issues. However, the overall trend toward greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies is expected to persist.\n\nMany competing cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin will face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies that offer various advantages, such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees and improved privacy features. While Bitcoin remains the dominant player, its long-term position is not guaranteed, and rival cryptocurrencies may challenge its prominence.\n\nTechnical improvements in Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin network will likely undergo further enhancements, although these improvements may be gradual and subject to controversy. Implementing changes to the Bitcoin protocol requires consensus among miners and node operators, making major upgrades challenging to achieve. For instance, the shift from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake validation, like Ethereum did, raises questions about Bitcoin's maximum coin cap and potential vulnerabilities to competitors.\n\nContinued high Bitcoin volatility\n\nBitcoin's price is expected to remain volatile, with significant price swings being a norm rather than an exception. As the market matures, this volatility may decrease, but in the meantime, expect roller-coaster fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nVarious perspectives and forecasts about the Bitcoin network abound, ranging from bullish to bearish. The future direction of Bitcoin remains uncertain and can only be determined with the passage of time. Notably, Bitcoin has earned a reputation for its ability to bounce back from challenges. Despite long-standing predictions of an impending burst in the Bitcoin bubble by seasoned experts over the last decade, the cryptocurrency continues to be highly regarded and has proven instrumental in generating significant wealth for many investors.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has entered into a slump after a prolonged accumulation. After a boring sideways price action in the past few months, the biggest cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash last week. BTC price dipped below the key psychological level of $25,000 on some exchanges before stabilising around $26,000.\n\nAfter a 0.24% drop on Monday, the pioneering digital asset extended its loss by another 0.11% on Tuesday. At press time, the token is changing hands at $26,095 just before the start of the New York session. Technical analysis reveals that the bears are in business after a change in market structure.\n\nBTC Dominance Drops To 49%\n\nThe sideways movement of BTC to USD sucked the air out of most altcoins. This resulted in an increase in BTC dominance which is now up 17% since the start of 2023. However, due to an intense sell-off last week, the dominance of the top cryptocurrency fell to 49%. This translated into a weekly loss of 2.45%.\n\nThe following chart reveals the correction in Bitcoin dominance, which shows the BTC\u2019s share in the total crypto market capitalization. However, despite the decreasing dominance, altcoins have failed to catch a bid. It shows that the capital has moved to stablecoins instead of other altcoins. A 9% increase in the USDT dominance last week is proof of this thesis.\n\nBitcoin Price Falls Below 200 MA\n\nA look at the following Bitcoin price chart on a weekly timeframe reveals that the price has broken below the 200 MA. This key moving average is a major line in the sand for many mid-term holders and swing traders. A breakdown below this level has validated the bearish thesis putting more downside on the cards.\n\nThe 200 moving average on the weekly chart currently lies at $27,500. If the bears fail to break above this level soon, the next stop could be the 50 MA which lies at $23,800. This would mean a potential 8% downside from here. The only silver lining for the bulls is that the price has still not made a lower low on the weekly timeframe. A weekly closure below $24,770 could be the final nail in the bulls\u2019 coffin.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Flips Bearish On Daily Chart\n\nThe daily chart analysis gives an even more bearish outlook than the weekly chart. BTC price has also dropped below 200 MA on the daily timeframe. This has flipped the Bitcoin price prediction bearish on the daily chart. It shows that the bulls have totally lost the momentum that was gained after the biggest asset manager, Blackrock, filed for a spot BTC ETF in June 2023.\n\nMy biggest fear is an acceptance back in the $25,100-17,600 trading range. BTC to USD broke out of this trading range in March 2023. In case of a bounce from current levels, the most critical will be the retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "September is well-known as a negative month for Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price performance, having only shown monthly gains in September 2015 and 2016. For all other years, the coming month was marked as historically favorable for the \u2018bears\u2019, instead of the \u2018bulls\u2019.\n\nHistorical data retrieved by Finbold from Coinglass shows Bitcoin\u2019s price performance in September for each year since 2013:\n\n2013: -1.76%\n\n2014: -19.01%\n\n2015: +2.35%\n\n2016: +6.04%\n\n2017: -7.44%\n\n2018: -5.58%\n\n2019: -13.38%\n\n2020: -7.51%\n\n2021: -7.03%\n\n2022: -3.12%\n\nBitcoin Monthly returns (%) from 2013 to 2023. Source: Coinglass\n\nNow, the market is trying to figure out what to expect for 2023\u2019s September, considering that BTC had close to two years of a \u2018bear market\u2019, and positive expectations for a coming \u2018bull market\u2019 are growing as the Bitcoin halving approaches for 2024.\n\nHow will Bitcoin perform in September 2023?\n\nInterestingly, the only two years that September was a positive month for Bitcoin, were low-volume years of price consolidation for the leading cryptocurrency, also following two negative months for BTC in August.\n\nAlthough interesting, there are no patterns in \u2018price consolidation years with losing Augusts, equals to September gains\u2019. 2014 was also a year with low volatility when Bitcoin showed losses of -17.55% in August and was the worst year for September\u2019s BTC, with a -19% red 1-month candlestick.\n\nSomething similar happened in 2019, as for a price consolidation year, with a negative August for Bitcoin, followed by the second worst year for September\u2019s BTC, registering losses of over 13%.\n\nWith a lack of historical patterns, most price predictions using this inconclusive data are highly speculative, presenting a high risk for decision-making. Investors must understand all other factors that worked to determine BTC\u2019s results for each month in each different year.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is consolidating at $26,045 (+0.37%) by press time, with a 24-hour volume lower than 3% of BTC\u2019s market cap, with a $12 billion exchanging volume out of a $506 billion market capitalization. Marking a period of extremely low liquidity for all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the time of publication, August is a losing month for Bitcoin, with around 11% in losses.\n\nThe price-performance for the leading digital asset in both August and September will depend on further developments related to Bitcoin, as well as the general sentiment on the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin News: The $3 Billion Wallet Is From Gemini, Not BlackRock - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Bitcoin community spread a news story that a mysterious $3 billion BTC wallet, labeled as the cryptocurrency\u2019s third-largest hodler, belongs to Gemini instead of BlackRock.\n\nSo BlackRock still does not own any Bitcoin?\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details together.\n\nBitcoin News: $3 billion crypto-wallet is not BlackRock\u2019s, but Gemini\u2019s\n\nYesterday\u2019s Bitcoin news covered a mysterious crypto-wallet worth more than $3 billion that possibly could have belonged to the US investment company BlackRock.\n\nThe address in question reportedly began accumulating Bitcoin for the first time on 8 March 2023, becoming the cryptocurrency\u2019s 3rd largest hodler in just a few months, coming to own a whopping 118,300 BTC equivalent to $3.09 billion.\n\nThe rumors of alleged connection with the world\u2019s largest hedge fund began to surface in the late evening of Monday, 21 August after several Twitter profiles had begun to suspect Larry Fink\u2019s hand.\n\nThis unknown address has accumulated over $3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin in the last 3 months.\n\n\n\nThe prime suspect?\n\n\n\nThe first major transaction of 3400 BTC occurred on May 16th 2023. Almost exactly 1 month later on June 15th 2023, BlackRock filed for it's spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/TdFuUkELuH \u2014 DivXMaN (@crypto_div) August 21, 2023\n\nThe strangest thing about this affair is indeed the timing with which the owner of the address allegedly began to heavily accumulate its holdings, since the largest transaction that took place was on 16 May, just a month before BlackRock\u2019s application for a Bitcoin spot ETF to the SEC.\n\nAs many as 3,400 BTC were in fact bought on that date, suggesting that the giant hedge fund had loaded up its positions before the market pumped due to the news regarding its entry into the industry.\n\nAs we are well aware, since mid-June the crypto market has charged one of the most important rallies of all 2023, with the premier cryptocurrency rising 15.65% during the week that the first application for a spot ETF in the United States was announced.\n\nMost likely Larry Fink and his partners bought Bitcoin before the market exploded to the upside, as advanced smart money in the financial world usually does.\n\nHowever, in reality, it seems that BlackRock had nothing to do with the $3 billion wallet and that the real holders are the famous Winklevoss twins with their cryptocurrency exchange Gemini.\n\nRegardless, BlackRock may still have bought the cryptocurrency secretly by diligently hiding its cryptographic footprints so as not to arouse suspicion and being able to move freely.\n\nLatest news says the 118,300 Bitcoin wallet belongs to Gemini and not Blackrock\n\nThe latest news from the crypto world indicates that the 118,300 Bitcoin wallet belongs to cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and not to hedge fund BlackRock.\n\nIt was the \u201cWu Blockchain\u201d Twitter profile that first mentioned the connection with the Winklevoss twins, which pointed out that some transfers from the US exchange platform dated 3 months ago had as their recipient the very address that now shares a $3 billion balance sheet.\n\nGemini has transferred bitcoins to the new address bc1q\u2026.59v2 in the past 3 months. It currently holds 118,000 bitcoins, or about 3.08 billion U.S. dollars. It is currently the third largest bitcoin holder. The first and second largest Bitcoin addresses are Binance Cold Wallet\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 22, 2023\n\nIt is often the case that for reasons of security or \u201clogistical convenience\u201d cryptocurrency exchanges periodically send their funds to new addresses, causing the countervalue of the latter to grow quickly.\n\nThe Bitcoin that the famous address has \u201caccumulated\u201d as of March 2023 are simply the assets of the exchange\u2019s users, among which you might be one if you are a Gemini customer.\n\nThe image below shows the performance of a cold wallet of the Winklevosses that from May 2023 onwards has completely emptied all its reserves reaching zero in the last days of June.\n\nThe transfers are all directed to the address \u201cbc1ql4,\u201d incorrectly attributed to the giant BlackRock.\n\nAs if that were not enough to create confusion among the community in this story, we can see how on-chain tracking firm Nansen labeled the $3 billion Bitcoin wallet under Robinhood\u2019s ownership.\n\nAccording to Nansen, the massive cryptocurrency holding would be under the domain of the US broker as \u201cJump Trading Custody\u201c\n\nIn reality, the transactions on the blockchain clearly show how Gemini is the real owner of the mysterious wallet.\n\nWe hope that Tyler or Cameron Winklevoss will clarify once and for all who is the third largest Bitcoin holder in the world.\n\nBTC balance sheet of exchange wallets\n\nAfter debunking the news of BlackRock\u2019s alleged hand in the $3 billion wallet and clarifying Gemini\u2019s true ownership, we can now devote a brief discussion to the topic of Bitcoin balance sheets of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSince 2014, major crypto exchange platforms have been accumulating positions in Bitcoin, becoming one of the largest aggregate entities in terms of cryptocurrency supply.\n\nIndeed, in March 2020, a period related to the dump of the markets at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Bitmex, Coinbase, Gemini, Deribit, Kraken, and Kucoin reached the incredible aggregate sum of 3.2 million Bitcoin equivalent to 15.23% of the max supply of the digital gold.\n\nFrom that point on (classified as ATH of the exchanges\u2019 balance sheet) the numbers began to decline periodically to the current 2.28 million BTC.\n\nAs the 2020-2021 bull market bore fruit by raising crypto asset prices, exchanges decreased their share from HODLers, likely sold to the market for FIAT or stablecoins.\n\nTruth be told, even after the bullish market ended, this metric has continued to see the holdings of exchanges shrink in a trend that still has not stopped and appears to want to continue.\n\nFrom November 2021 onward, the ATH month for Bitcoin, about 500,000 coins have evaporated from exchange wallets.\n\nMost likely this wealth has ended up in the hands of individual holders who jealously guard their coins on personal wallets without risking handing over their private keys to third-party entities."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining difficulty reaches all-time high of 55 trillion hashes - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 6.17% on August 22, reaching an all-time high of 55.62 trillion hashes, as the Bitcoin Network hashrate continues to rise despite past increases in the difficulty adjustment. And different than some might believe, this is usually not good for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nDifficulty adjustment on Bitcoin mining is a protocol feature created by Satoshi Nakamoto that serves to keep an average interval of 10 minutes between every new block that is discovered by Bitcoin miners, filled with transactions, and then added to the blockchain. This adjustment directly impacts mining profitability, as increased difficulty also means increased costs for the activity.\n\nWith a sustained increase in mining difficulty over time, Bitcoin miners are working \u2018underwater\u2019, as the average cost to mine one single BTC has been superior to the average price of 1 BTC in the spot market year-over-year since August 2022. The Bitcoin Network now registers a hashrate of 446.6 EH/s (exahashes per second), with a mining difficulty of 55,621,444,139,429 hashes to find a block. Data was retrieved by Finbold from the mempool.space network explorer on August 23.\n\nHashrate and Difficulty chart. Source: Mempool.space\n\nWhy is increasing mining difficulty bad for Bitcoin?\n\nThe Bitcoin mining activity is a high-cost business model. That requires a physical structure, specialized equipment (known as ASICs), high consumption of energy, and specialized know-how.\n\nBitcoin miners \u2018mine\u2019 in the expectation of discovering the next block with the block subsidy of 6.25 BTC (~$162,500), which is then used to pay for the costs (usually in US dollars), and collect the profit (being in BTC or USD, according to miners choice). For every 210,000 blocks discovered, the block subsidy is halved (cut by half), in an event called \u2018Bitcoin Halving\u2019.\n\nWith an increased difficulty, the work needed to receive the same reward also increases \u2014 as so do the costs, and the risks of the activity. Miners work more to receive the same payment, which is also directly affected by Bitcoin\u2019s price in the spot market.\n\nThe higher the costs, also the higher the amount of newly circulating BTC that miners must sell in order to cover these costs. The more Bitcoin is sold in the market, the more the price can be negatively affected by this extra supply, if demand remains the same (or lower).\n\nCreating a vicious cycle because, with lower prices, miners\u2019 rewards in USD get even lower.\n\nThe Hashprice Index, by Luxor Mining, illustrates the effects of a growing hashrate and mining difficulty adjustment \u2014 measuring the expected receiving amount per calculated hashrate. This index is also heavily affected by the Bitcoin halving, every four years.\n\nHashprice Index in BTC/TH/DAY. Source: Luxor\n\nBad for Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization\n\nBesides the possible negative consequences for Bitcon\u2019s price \u2014 which are usually short-term consequences \u2014 the described events could cause many Bitcoin miners to be forced to close their businesses.\n\nUsually, small or medium miners are the mostly affected entities, as big miners can use different hedging strategies, have healthier structures, and have easier access to cheaper capital (as in loans or private funding).\n\nMedium and small #Bitcoin miners are at risk: \u201cIt is not profitable anymore\u201d\n\n\n\nThe constant increase in #BTC mining difficulty raises questions about the profitability of the business \u2014 I talked with some miners for insights regarding the activity.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\u2193 [1/>25++] pic.twitter.com/3WitWIW1na \u2014 Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) June 18, 2023\n\nTherefore, as small and medium miners could be forced to close, there are fewer entities capable of keep working and growing their businesses, which could cause an effect of increased centralization over time, in a sort of economy of scale dynamics.\n\nHowever, what is expected by most Bitcoin advocates is that this could cause the network hashrate to decrease, also decreasing the mining difficulty, and allowing small and medium miners to get back to business.\n\nAlthough historical data shows otherwise, with both hashrate and difficulty adjustments growing over time, while bigger mining pools continue to earn a bigger share of block rewards, as seen in this comparison between the percentage of blocks each pool has mined in both a 3-year and 1-year time frames.\n\nMining pool shares of discovered blocks. Source: Mempool.space\n\nAs per the image, the two biggest mining pools (Foundry USA and AntPool) are growing their dominance for hashrate, block discovery, and collected rewards over time.\n\nConsidering that Foundry USA went from 16.58% to 29.52% of the total, and AntPool went from 16.03% to 20.48% of network dominance, for a period of three years and one year, respectively.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value perception is directly connected to the security of the system, which is also directly connected to the decentralization of the network. A decreasing decentralization could possibly impact the market\u2019s value perception over the leading cryptocurrency."
