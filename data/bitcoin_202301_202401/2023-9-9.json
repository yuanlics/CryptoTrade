        "title": "How Much of All Money Is in Bitcoin? - Investopedia",
        "content": "How Much Is Bitcoin Worth?\n\nOn Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth approximately $25,758. There were more than 19.48 million bitcoins circulating, giving it a total value of over $500 billion. This is much less than in 2021, when its value reached more than $64,000\u2014giving it a total value of about $1.2 trillion at the time.\n\nKey Takeaways One bitcoin was worth $25,758 as of Sep. 10, 2023.\n\nAll the bitcoins in the world were worth over $500 billion.\n\nThe combined value of bitcoin was equivalent to just 0.11% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin was worth only about 3.4% of the world's gold supply.\n\nAll cryptocurrencies combined accounted for about 0.23% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin and the Money Supply\n\nTo get a sense of how much of the world's money is in bitcoins, we must determine the total amount of money. As it turns out, this is not the easiest question to answer. Such a calculation might take into account dozens of categories of wealth, including banknotes, precious metals, money market accounts, and debt. Luckily, Credit Suisse has already done the work\u2014the bank calculated total global wealth to be $454.4 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nThat leaves Bitcoin at about 0.11% of the estimated total value of wealth globally.\n\nMarket capitalization is considered a controversial metric, especially when applied to cryptocurrencies. Although it's a convenient way to assess the total value of an asset, it is highly subject to manipulation.\n\nBitcoin vs. Gold\n\nHow does Bitcoin compare to gold? After all, some people still consider gold to be the safest of safe haven assets. It is certainly the standard to which other currencies must be compared. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that about 244,000 tons of gold had been mined as of Sep. 10, 2023. There are 32,000 ounces of gold in one ton, and the price of gold per ounce was about $1,919.08 as of the market close on Sep. 8, 2023. So, the total value of all gold can be estimated as:\n\n( 244,000 tons of gold x 32,000 ounces per ton ) x $1,919.08 per ounce = $14.98 trillion.\n\nIn total, the value of all Bitcoin was about 3.4% of the value of all above-ground gold reserves.\n\nOther Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin is the largest and best-known cryptocurrency in the global economy. However, it is far from the only one. If we combine Bitcoin with Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, and all other significant cryptocurrencies, the total value comes to roughly $1.04 trillion (as of Sep. 10, 2023). That was about 0.23% of the value of all money.\n\nWarning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, illiquid, and vulnerable to slippage and price manipulation. Before investing, make sure you understand the risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nWhat Percentage of all Money Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin's percentage of all money is much lower than you might expect. On Sep. 10, 2023, the value of all bitcoins was 0.11% of all money.\n\nWhat Is the Total Value of all Bitcoins? The combined value of all bitcoins on Sep. 10, 2023 was about $504 billion.\n\nFor How Much Does Bitcoin Sell? On Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth about $25,758.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, one of the thousands of new digital or virtual currencies available globally. It can be used as a store of value, a way to exchange value, or as a speculative investment. Its value changes daily, sometimes tens of dollars or more. It is a volatile asset that changes its market capitalization and percentage of total money almost daily.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t even been approved in the US, and yet already some see them as an existential threat to the futures-based funds that came before them.\n\nBlackRock Inc. leads a group of firms awaiting word from regulators on their filings to launch what would be the first US ETFs linked to the spot price of the largest cryptocurrency. Grayscale Investments is also in the mix after scoring a legal victory in its quest to convert its $16 billion Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund. Proponents are optimistic that the heft of the issuers involved and Grayscale\u2019s recent court win may finally tilt the odds in favor of these funds being approved."

        "content": "There was red ink across the crypto market Monday morning in Asia as Bitcoin dipped below the resistance level of US$26,000. Ether also fell to near the US$16,000 mark after a hack on the X account of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers with a 24-hour slide of over 6%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX could soon get the greenlight to liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings, adding to selling pressure in the market. U.S. stock futures traded higher after Wall Street logged weekly losses Friday. Investors now look ahead to the release of more U.S. inflation data later in the week for clues on upcoming interest rate policy.\n\nLatest FTX news depresses crypto market\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.25% in the last 24 hours to US$25,831.97 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. It lost 0.53% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly traded above US$26,000 last Friday. But it soon lost that support level and remained range bound over the weekend at around US$25,900.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 1.12% to US$1,616.79, and dropped 1.18% over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked Sunday, leading to losses totalling around US$691,000 for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nButerin\u2019s father confirmed in a tweet Sunday that his son had been hacked and was restoring his X account. The alleged scam post has now been removed from the account. Buterin himself is yet to comment on the hack.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana led the losers, falling 6.17% to US$18.25 for a weekly loss of 6.80%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday, a Wall Street Journal report predicted a September pause in the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle. The report \u201cprobably had many investors re-thinking their valuations \u2014 not just for crypto but for risk assets in general,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nThe market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept.13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet Saturday from blockchain analysts Whale Alert.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTENTIALLY BIG SELLING NEXT WEEK\n\n\n\nCrypto exchange FTX will likely get approval to liquidate its assets 13th of September.\n\n\n\nThey had $3.4b worth of crypto in April.\n\nCurrent proposed plan is to sell up to $200m worth of crypto every week. \u2014 Whale (@WhaleChart) September 9, 2023\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. Part of the bankruptcy plan set up for the firm allows for the sale of up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which can be extended to US$200 million under certain circumstances.\n\nCrypto analysts suggest the news could weigh on the market after gains earlier in the summer. Blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock tweeted Sunday that \u201cdespite positive news about Visa and a potential spot ETH ETF, FTX\u2019s impending US$3 billion liquidation could be dictating market movement.\u201d\n\nThe selling pressure from FTX will cause altcoins to underperform Bitcoin throughout the remainder of the year, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Sunday LinkedIn post.\n\nThe potential selling of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings could hit Solana particularly hard, according to Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets. The token \u201cforms a substantial portion of these assets, with an estimated value of approximately $685 million. This impending event has heightened the sense of uncertainty among SOL investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 where the token\u2019s short-term, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) moves below its long-term, 200-day SMA. That could signal a coming slide in Bitcoin prices, Lucas said.\n\nAs of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, Bitcoin\u2019s 50-day SMA sat at US$27,658.19, with a 200-day SMA of US$27,608.57. Following the previous Bitcoin death cross on Jan.14, 2022, the token\u2019s price dropped over 10% within seven days.\n\n\u201cThe looming question that occupies the minds of market participants pertains to whether Bitcoin will chart a similar course in response to this bearish technical pattern or has the market already priced in this event?\u201d Lucas said.\n\n\u201cThis uncertainty is exacerbated by the forthcoming release of U.S. inflation figures, with technical indicators currently signalling the potential for further downside,\u201d she added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.74% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 50.61% to US$20.25 billion.\n\nInvestors await key US inflation data as China slump slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged up as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes closed moderately higher on Friday but logged weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the winners on Friday with a 0.22% uptick, but ended the week 0.86% lower.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1.38% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 also posted a 0.19% loss.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland last Friday.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that the CPI print could come in higher than expected (with) the price of oil pushing higher,\u201d Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of U.S.-based investment advisory firm Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, said in the report.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem where ultimately the Fed may be pushed into a corner, and while they might take a pause because of the lag effect, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re done,\u201d said Blancato.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of reducing the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Fed raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level since early 2001.\n\nThe U.S. CPI data on Wednesday is unlikely to affect Fed thinking ahead of its September meeting, Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Monday. But it could influence future rate decisions, beginning November, he said.\n\nTwo items lead the week ahead for the global #economy and #markets:\n\nAn @ECB meeting where I put the probability of a 25 basis point hike at 55% (yes, it\u2019s that close); and\n\nThe US CPI #inflation print which is unlikely to alter in any significant way the high expectation that\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September 10, 2023\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September. It gives a 53.5% chance for another pause in November, down from 57.4% last Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s CPI index posted a slim annual increase of 0.1% in August. The increase has eased deflationary pressure on Beijing slightly\n\n\u201cMany data we\u2019re seeing now shows that the economy\u2019s slump may be slowing in the coming months,\u201d Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., told Bloomberg. Yeung also noted a slowdown in China\u2019s export slump in August. But he said the slowdowns should not be read as a sign of long-term recovery just yet.\n\n\u201cIt will be more of a stabilization instead of a complete rebound,\u201d Yeung said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Alexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\n\nLISBON, PORTUGAL \u2014 Matadors and bitcoin maximalists are regulars at Campo Pequeno, a neo-Moorish bullring in the northernmost reaches of the Portuguese capital city. The two aren't all that different. Both are typically defiant and stubborn, engaged in a seemingly hopeless battle that pits man against beast, where the goal isn't just survival but total domination. Each fights against the status quo \u2014 one against the laws of nature, the other against the financial establishment. In the case of the maxis, these rebels don cryptographic code instead of capes, pinning their revolution on the decentralized ledger technology they believe will change the world as we know it. Every month, bitcoin's biggest fans in Lisbon \u2014 an eclectic bunch of mostly expat digital nomads \u2014 descend on this 19th century arena to sip Licor Beir\u00e3o, talk shop and extol the virtues of a world run on bitcoin. The storied venue is also a fitting metaphor for the bull run that many of these bitcoiners hold out hope for during crypto winter, the name given to the period of prolonged, depressed pricing in digital assets that can last for years.\n\nSoftware engineer Lorenzo Primiterra has been living mostly in Lisbon for the past two years. CNBC\n\nSoftware engineer Lorenzo Primiterra has been going to the gatherings since they began. He's a Peter Pan-type with black chipped nail polish and small black hoop earrings complimenting the tattoo on his right inner forearm that reads, in all caps, 'WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN?\" Primiterra hails from Italy but has spent two of his last seven years on the road in Portugal. Sitting at a picnic table adjacent to the 10,000-person capacity arena, he tells CNBC that the inaugural bitcoin gathering took place in this same venue in spring 2022, the weekend after the collapse of Terra Luna \u2014 a popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project that imploded overnight, erasing half a trillion dollars from the sector's market cap in the process. \"A lot of people got burned in that,\" Primiterra said of the stablecoin's failure. \"I guess a lot of people became bitcoiners from that event. They understood the importance of self custody of bitcoin, bitcoin on bitcoin blockchain, not on other chains.\" The cascade of crypto bankruptcies, failed tokens and the revelation that some of the titans of the industry were running allegedly criminal enterprises laid bare to many that bitcoin is king. But Lisbon as a city remains largely blockchain agnostic. Every night of the week, there is some sort of industry gathering \u2014 recurring events like Web3 Wednesdays and Crypto Fridays at The Block, a popular clubhouse where industry enthusiasts can rent out co-working space. The city also plays host to major industry conferences like Web Summit and NearCon. \"I remember, two years ago, there was supposed to be an ethereum event here, and then solana organized another event and then they said, 'Well, let's do a blockchain week,' and then it became a blockchain month,\" said Primiterra. \"I went to the other blockchain events during the bull market, because every blockchain was offering drinks, and I'm like, 'Why not?'\" he said.\n\nAerial view shot of the April 25th Bridge and the Tagus River at sunset, Almada, Lisboa Region, Portugal Simonskafar | E+ | Getty Images\n\nCrypto investment firm Greenfield recently named Lisbon the most important crypto hub on the planet, outranking New York, Berlin and Singapore. In the recently released State of European Crypto Report, researchers point to its \"profound DeFi scene\" and the country's tax breaks as two big reasons for its top status. Even as the government looks to roll back aggressive incentives for foreigners, the tax regime is still a lot more favorable than elsewhere on the continent \u2014 especially as the collective crypto market cap is nearly 60% off its all-time high. Add perks like the newly launched digital nomad visa and the fact that the city offers lower prices than other Western European hubs, and Lisbon has all the fixings of an ideal expatriate enclave for tech enthusiasts looking to save cash while they talk code. This is a big part of why Primiterra, who has been in roughly 50 countries in seven years, is staying put in Portugal. He bought an apartment during the pandemic in an up-and-coming neighborhood outside the main city center \u2014 and has no plans to uproot anytime soon. Another big draw? A community of like-minded people. \"I like tech in general, so even if I know that a project is terribly coded tech wise \u2014 I'm like, 'OK, tell me how you plan to solve that double-spend problem,'\" he said. \"I can listen to it, I can counter-argue some of the stuff.\" \"I have friends in the ethereum community, and it's totally fine for me,\" added Primiterra, though he noted that one of his big side projects of the moment is looking to launch a co-working space dedicated to bitcoin.\n\nSunrise over Lisbon, Portugal Alexander Spatari | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThe San Francisco of Europe\n\nA walk through Portugal's capital feels eerily similar to a stroll in San Francisco. Both boast a cityscape defined by steep streets and sudden vistas; hilly terrain sloping down to beaches dotted by kite surfers and sailboats; red, dual-towered suspension bridges marking the edge of the city bounds; and brightly colored old-fashioned trams snaking through narrow streets. The two coastal cities are also honey pots for techies. Jemson Chan is a software tester from Singapore who has been living in Portugal for nine months. Chan is currently working for a company that is not crypto related, but he says his passion firmly lies in bitcoin and decentralized tech. \"I came to Lisbon for the quality of life, the number of tech startups and the very burgeoning tech scene,\" said Chan.\n\nJemson Chan is a software tester from Singapore who has been living in Portugal for nine months. CNBC\n\nGuy Young, the CEO and founder of crypto startup Ethena Labs, says the ambience drew him to Lisbon, calling it one of those ideal cities that strikes a good balance between picturesque architecture, a rich history, top-notch restaurants, great weather \u2014 and a solid community of crypto people. Young's anecdotal take on the Iberian Peninsula reflects a common sentiment. In 2022, Portugal ranked sixth on the Global Peace Index, and it tops the list of best countries for expats. The number of foreign residents in Portugal has been on the rise for seven straight years, increasing by more than 40% in the past decade. It also helps that there are clear ground rules on crypto in Europe, thanks to a law known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA. While the guidelines aren't Portugal-specific, the comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets makes it easier to navigate operating a crypto business or investing in virtual tokens in the eurozone. Chan, who has a side hustle hosting his own educational podcast on bitcoin called Orange Pill Uncensored, says Portugal is a far more hospitable backdrop than the U.S. with its regulation-by-enforcement tactics deployed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Ever since the FTX collapse and the current ongoing attacks by especially the U.S. government on centralized exchanges, there have been efforts from the grassroots level to create more decentralized platforms that deal with the on- and off-ramps to fiat,\" added Chan, pointing to decentralized marketplaces like Pocket Bitcoin, RoboSats, Bisque and Peach that allow users to buy and sell bitcoin. Primiterra used to spend his days working to measure global internet censorship as part of his work with a sub-project of the dark web browser, Tor. But nowadays, he volunteers his coding skills to Bitcoin Map, an open-source tool that lets you search for merchants that accept bitcoin anywhere in the world. Lisbon may be crypto-friendly, but businesses don't appear to be all that interested in accepting bitcoin as a form of currency. Primiterra says the list includes a handful of merchants including a ramen place and a dentist.\n\nSeb True is a full-stack engineer who made the move to Lisbon over the summer. CNBC\n\nSeb True is a full-stack engineer who made the move to Lisbon over the summer. The British national initially traveled to Portugal on what was meant to be a short trip to make a presentation at the monthly bitcoin gathering. Soon after his arrival, he was hooked and committed to a three-month sublet. True quit his full-time job so he could focus on traveling the world and teaching people about bitcoin from the perspective of sound money and the philosophy of libertarianism. He has dubbed his educational modules The Bitcoin Student, and he's looking to expand the brand by capitalizing on his engineering background. Lisbon has been a relief for True, who previously ran underground workshops in Egypt where bitcoin is illegal. \"Apparently they throw people in jail for talking about it and just working on it or doing anything with it,\" he said. \"That's actually the first place I started giving presentations on bitcoin.\" He says he knew the risks but ultimately ignored warnings about his safety, because he felt the population could greatly benefit from learning more about decentralized virtual money that existed outside the reach of governments or central banks. \"It's a country that has experienced over 50% inflation just this year, people are suffering, they don't understand why and they don't know who to blame,\" continued True. \"Their view was, 'Oh, bitcoin, someone controls that, too, surely, so it's not going to be any better,'\" he said, adding that it didn't take long to \"orange pill\" them, a phrase used by bitcoiners to describe the process of indoctrinating someone in the ways of bitcoin. True has now shifted his focus to Portugal, describing Lisbon, in particular, as the ideal base to grow his enterprise. \"The people here that I'm meeting are doing things, actually creating content, they're active about making a difference, and they are interested in collaborating,\" True told CNBC. \"I've already had people contacting me asking to make content for me or for my project, not for any money, not for any fame ... but just because they're passionate, because they believe in the mission,\" continued True. \"They believe in the idea, and that's really what's made me think, 'Wow, I should really stay here. This is where the community clearly is.'\"\n\nLisbon's skyline, showing the city's Ponte 25 de Abril spanning the river Tagus. Stephen Knowles Photography | Moment | Getty Images\n\nTax breaks on bitcoin\n\nBefore making the move from Asia to Europe, Chan pored over tax law in the European Union, narrowing down the ideal jurisdiction to either Switzerland or Portugal. \"If you know anything about Switzerland, it's a millionaires' and billionaires' paradise,\" said Chan. \"Looking at me, I don't think I've achieved that level of success yet, so I chose the poor man's Switzerland.\" The tax perks in Portugal are certainly a big draw. The resident-non-habitual (NHR) status is a fiscal regime that in some cases grants expats living in Portugal total exemption from paying taxes on their income for a period of up to 10 years. In addition, unlike the U.S., which treats virtual currency as property, taxing it in a manner similar to stocks or real property, Portugal views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. That distinction is a game-changer with respect to taxes. Up until the end of 2022, capital gains resulting from crypto transactions, such as cashing out and crypto-to-crypto trades, were not subject to personal income taxes. The government has since added more caveats to its crypto tax breaks, including a requirement that an investor hold a digital asset for more than a year before selling in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale. This means that gains from buying or selling cryptocurrency, as with other fiat currencies, are not taxed if the trader holds on to their coins for at least 12 months. Meanwhile, profits made on crypto held for less than a year is taxed at a rate of 28%. \"This makes Portugal a really attractive place for crypto users to live,\" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. The only exception to the country's generous crypto scheme relates to companies registered in Portugal that deal in crypto. These businesses face some taxes under certain circumstances, like if they earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal.\n\nCyclists photographed in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2018. Kamisoka | Istock Unreleased | Getty Images\n\nExpats tell CNBC the process of establishing residency is relatively smooth. It doesn't require owning any property, and unlike other crypto tax havens, such as Puerto Rico, foreigners aren't required to spend a certain number of days in the country. Citizens of the European Union have the right to permanent residence in Portugal, and for non-EU citizens, it offers expats a few paths to residency, including the golden visa and the D7 Visa (also known as the retirement visa or passive income visa), both of which tend to attract wealthy foreigners. The Portuguese golden visa is given to those who buy property, or invest a certain amount of money in the country. There are also steps that involve getting a tax identification number, opening a bank account and formally applying for residency. Companies such as Plan B Passport streamline the application process for expats. Plan B CEO Katie Ananina tells CNBC the company has helped hundreds of people from countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada obtain a second passport in one of seven countries, including Portugal. Plan B works in tandem with each government's residence- or citizenship-by-investment programs. One drawback to Lisbon's burgeoning popularity: As more crypto fans flood the city, some of the longtime natives are complaining about rising prices, similar to other tech hubs around the world. \"There's been quite a sort of influx of foreigners that have come in recently,\" says Ethena's Young. \"And there's been a bit of pushback around property prices, what's going on with sort of the prices in some of the restaurants and stuff like that. But as a foreigner who's come here, I have no complaints.\"\n\n'It's just paradise'\n\nWout Deley \u2014 who has been researching cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology since 2013 \u2014 was working as an international sales manager for a galvanization company in Ghent, Belgium, when he decided to sell his house, invest in tokens and hit the road. After a few months traveling through Europe during the early days of the Covid pandemic, he ultimately settled in Portugal. Deley invested two-thirds of the house-sale proceeds in cryptocurrency and then lived off the final third. \"At any given time, I have maybe \u2014 at a maximum \u2014 10,000 euros ($11,450) in my bank account,\" said Deley. \"All the rest is always in crypto.\" For Deley, establishing residency in Portugal was a no-brainer. \"Cryptocurrencies in Belgium are massively taxed, and I was looking at seven figures of profit,\" said Deley, who said that he would have faced a tax obligation of close to 40% had he remained in Belgium. \"You want to double your profit? Just move to Portugal,\" he said.\n\nPra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio is a popular tourist destination in Lisbon's city center. Imazins | Image Bank Film | Getty Images\n\nDeley lives in Lagos in the southwest tip of Portugal. He says that he found a villa available as a long-term rental which was \"very cheap\" and that was enough to establish residency. The living is easy in Portugal, according to Deley, who says the southern coastline of the Algarve offers the perks of Los Angeles \u2014 a warm climate and great surf \u2014 but without the traffic jams. And there is a solid social scene. \"It's full of expats. It's just paradise,\" continued Deley. He says that he knows of at least three bitcoin billionaires who live nearby \u2014 plus another 12 people at least, mostly from the U.K., who are moving to Portugal in the next few months for the crypto tax benefits. Deley doesn't speak Portuguese, but he says that's not a problem because everyone speaks English. He is also surrounded by a lot of like-minded crypto investors. \"Everyone has cryptocurrency here. Everyone knows bitcoin. Everyone has it,\" he said. Deley says the crypto investor migration is good for Portugal, too. \"They have a huge brain drain. Younger people are leaving. So they're trying to be more open to people with capital, digital nomads,\" said Deley. Meanwhile, Didi Taihuttu of the 'Bitcoin Family' wants to disrupt the typical expat experience in Portugal by building a crypto village. The family is currently shopping for real estate. They've narrowed their options down to three different plots of land, one as big as 250,000 acres, in the Algarve. The plan is to run the community in a decentralized fashion, in which the land is divvied up by the square meter and sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in order to signify ownership. Taihuttu also wants to mine for bitcoin with solar and wind power and then use the heat produced by the rigs to warm houses in the winter, in a sort of closed-loop system. The working plan, for now, is to use a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to govern the community. DAOs run on blockchain technology. \"We want to build a decentralized lifestyle, which is the future,\" he said. In the meantime, the Taihuttus found an abandoned inn and are retrofitting it to be the first web3 hotel in the Algarve that is financed and owned by the community."

        "title": "TON, XLM, XMR, and MKR could attract buyers if Bitcoin rises above $26,500 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a narrow range this week and is on target to form the third consecutive Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. The cryptocurrency markets did not receive any support from the United States equities markets, which ended the week on a negative note. The S&P 500 Index dropped 1.3% while the Nasdaq closed down 1.9%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weakness has dragged several altcoins lower, with many testing multi-week lows. This indicates that the broader crypto market is in a firm bear grip. Negative markets make it difficult for buyers to identify short-term bullish trades as rallies hardly sustain. However, it could be a good time for long-term investors to build a portfolio.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAccording to a recent Amberdata report, 24% of asset management firms are appointing senior executives dedicated to the implementation of digital strategies. Down the line, 13% more firms plan to adopt a digital assets strategy. This indicates \u201cseriousness about implementation as well as senior management buy-in,\u201d the report added.\n\nCould Bitcoin break out to the upside, boosting buying interest in altcoins? Let\u2019s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are showing promise in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the $26,000 level for the past few days, indicating a tussle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping moving averages indicate advantage to bears but the positive divergence on the relative strength index suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The indicators are not giving a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nTherefore, it is better to wait for the price to either sustain above $26,500 or dive below $24,800 before placing large bets.\n\nIf bulls overcome the obstacle at $26,500, the BTC/USDT pair could soar to the overhead resistance at $28,143. On the other hand, a fall below $24,800 could clear the path for a collapse to $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been trading near the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating a lack of interest from both the bulls and the bears. This tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and may lead to a range expansion within the next few days.\n\nOn the upside, a rally above $26,500 will indicate that the advantage has tilted in favor of the buyers. That may start an up-move to $27,600 and eventually to $28,143.\n\nAlternatively, if the price breaks below $25,300, the selling could pick up and the pair may retest the Aug. 17 intraday low of $25,166.\n\nToncoin price analysis\n\nToncoin (TON) has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average ($1.69). In an uptrend, a correction to the 20-day EMA usually offers a low-risk entry opportunity.\n\nTON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is likely to act as a strong support. If the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The TON/USDT pair could first rise to $1.89 and thereafter attempt a rally to $2.07.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are bailing out of their positions. That could open the doors for a possible drop to $1.53 and next to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.45).\n\nTON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sink the price below the immediate support at $1.72, but the bulls have held their ground. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory increases the risk of a downside breakdown.\n\nIf the $1.72 support cracks, the pair could skid to $1.66 and later nosedive to the strong support at $1.53. Contrarily, if bulls propel the price above the moving averages, it will suggest the start of a stronger recovery to $1.90 and subsequently to $2.\n\nStellar price analysis\n\nStellar (XLM) has staged a smart recovery in the past few days, indicating that the buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe XLM/USDT pair broke above the 20-day EMA ($0.12) on Sept. 4, and the bulls thwarted attempts by the bears to yank the price back below it on Sept. 5 and 6. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into support.\n\nThe price has reached the 50-day SMA ($0.13), which is behaving as a roadblock. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls are not rushing to the exit. If the price breaks above the 50-day SMA, the pair could soar to $0.15 and later to $0.17.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA.\n\nXLM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to halt the recovery at the overhead resistance at $0.13 but the bulls have not given up much ground. The rebound off the 20-EMA shows that lower levels continue to attract buyers. If the price maintains above the overhead resistance, the pair could start an up-move to $0.15.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly drag the price below the 20-EMA. That could accelerate selling and tug the price to the 50-SMA.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Pepe price will continue to fall in September\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) has held the uptrend line support for the past few days, indicating buying at lower levels. The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($143), which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The XMR/USDT pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($151), where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If this obstacle is cleared, the pair could surge to $160.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to protect the 20-day EMA and pull the price below the uptrend line. If they manage to do that, several stops may be hit. That could sink the pair to $130.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action on the four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nIf the price slips below the 50-SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support line of the triangle. Contrarily, if the price rises above the 20-EMA, the pair could reach the resistance line. A break above or below the triangle could signal the start of a trending move.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) has been stuck between the moving averages, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the price has been trading above the downtrend line.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,119) is moving up gradually but the RSI near the midpoint suggests a lack of bullish momentum. Buyers will have to propel and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($1,157) to signal the start of an up-move to $1,227.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price re-enters the downtrend line. The MKR/USDT pair could then slump to the strong support at $980. This level is likely to witness strong buying by the bulls.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price has been oscillating between $1,083 and $1,170 for some time. The flattish moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate a slight advantage to the sellers.\n\nOn the downside, the important support to watch out for is $1,102 and then $1,083. Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may then rally to $1,170.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "ChatGPT breaks down 9 factors that can end Bitcoin as we know it - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Proponents of Bitcoin (BTC) argue that its decentralized nature offers protection against threats encountered by traditional financial systems. Nevertheless, like any other financial or investment product, Bitcoin is not immune to various threats that could potentially affect its existence.\n\nIn this context, Finbold sought insights from the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT developed by OpenAI to understand the factors that could potentially bring about the end of Bitcoin as we know it. We posed the question, \u2018What can end Bitcoin as we know it?\u2019 to the most advanced ChatGPT-4 premium AI version. Through this analysis, it became apparent that the pioneering cryptocurrency faces a spectrum of challenges, both external and internal, which are highlighted below:\n\n#1. Technical vulnerabilities\n\nThe tool suggested that one of the most discussed vulnerabilities is the dreaded 51% attack. If a single entity gains control of over 50% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s computational power, it could potentially wreak havoc. Such an entity could double-spend coins or halt transactions. ChatGPT acknowledged that although this type of attack is expensive and unlikely to be financially practical, stating that at the moment, it remains a theoretical threat.\n\nAnother technical vulnerability is quantum computing. ChatGPT states that if quantum computers become powerful enough, they could break Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic security measures. It is worth noting that the crypto community has since identified this risk with plans to quell it.\n\n#2. Regulatory and legal challenges\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature has made it an attractive option for those looking to circumvent traditional financial systems. However, this very characteristic puts it in the crosshairs of governments worldwide. As per ChatGPT, regulatory crackdowns and bans on Bitcoin could significantly impact its adoption and drive users toward other digital assets or traditional currencies. In general, regulatory uncertainty is a constant shadow that the cryptocurrency world must navigate, making it a persistent concern for the future of Bitcoin.\n\n#3. Economic factors\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value and adoption have been intricately tied to economic factors for years. Therefore, ChatGPT pointed out that a significant loss of confidence in Bitcoin due to major financial losses, large-scale fraud, or other scandals could lead to reduced adoption and value. At the same time, it cited threats such as a newer cryptocurrency or technology emerging with vastly superior features, which might overshadow Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage.\n\n#4. Environmental concerns\n\nThe viability of Bitcoin has been questioned over the cryptocurrency\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Against this backdrop, the AI tool pointed out that critics argue that its energy consumption is unsustainable and harmful to the planet. Therefore, if concerns about its energy consumption continue to grow, there may be a substantial shift towards more eco-friendly cryptocurrencies or consensus mechanisms, potentially eroding Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. As the world becomes increasingly conscious of environmental issues, Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint remains a point of contention. However, it is worth noting that major miners are trying to turn to renewable energy sources for Bitcoin mining.\n\n#5. Scaling issues\n\nChatGPT acknowledged that Bitcoin has faced persistent challenges in terms of transaction speed and costs, especially during heightened demand. While initiatives such as the Lightning Network have been introduced to tackle these issues, the risk of an inadequate scaling solution could potentially hinder Bitcoin\u2019s ability to achieve wider adoption. The ongoing challenge of scaling is a critical issue that the Bitcoin community must continue to tackle to uphold its status as a viable digital currency.\n\n#6. Internal conflicts\n\nInternal disputes within the Bitcoin community have sporadically arisen, particularly concerning its development trajectory. ChatGPT warns that should these disagreements escalate, they have the potential to result in additional forks, similar to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split, which could ultimately erode the community\u2019s cohesion. The tool notes that sustaining a unified vision for Bitcoin\u2019s future is imperative for its enduring success in the long run.\n\n#7. Catastrophic events\n\nThe AI tool suggests that the Bitcoin network is not immune to global disruptions. Natural disasters, widespread infrastructure failures, or global-scale cyber-attacks could disrupt the Bitcoin network, causing temporary or long-term damage. The resilience of the Bitcoin network in the face of unforeseen events remains an ongoing concern.\n\n#8. Mass Adoption of CBDCs\n\nGovernments such as the United States and China are actively exploring the potential of digital currencies, which could lead to the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as potential substitutes for cryptocurrencies. In this case, ChatGPT opines that if prominent nations successfully deploy and endorse their CBDCs, these could present a more secure and regulated option compared to Bitcoin for everyday transactions, potentially diminishing Bitcoin\u2019s attractiveness. The advent of CBDCs poses a notable competitive challenge to Bitcoin.\n\n#9. Loss of key infrastructure\n\nIt is worth noting that the cryptocurrency ecosystem relies heavily on exchanges and wallet providers. Therefore, ChatGPT suggested that if a major exchange or wallet provider collapses or faces severe security issues, it could undermine confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and impact Bitcoin. Therefore, safeguarding the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency world is essential to maintaining trust and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin has withstood numerous challenges and has a resilient community of users and developers, it remains vulnerable to various internal and external factors. Staying abreast of these potential threats and actively addressing them will be crucial for the continued success and relevance of Bitcoin as a global digital currency."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the weekend with slightly higher prices than seven days ago.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency currently trades for $25,815, which is an increase of about 0.6% over the week, while its closest runner-up grew 0.8% to change hands at $1,630.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany other leading cryptocurrencies have also posted similar small gains. There are no substantial changes to the price of any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from last weekend, except Stellar (XLM).\n\nXLM holders saw their stash grow 10% over the week, and the token now trades for $0.124846. The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, \u201cSomething cool is dropping in 10 days.\u201d\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that \u201cprivate providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, \u201cwould pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\u2014recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies\u2014voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20\u2019s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a \u201ccomprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn\u2019t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies \u201csafeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets\u201d to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Recording its second hottest summer on record, the state\u2019s local grid\u2014which supplies power to 25 million Texans, roughly 90% of the state\u2014was forced to implement emergency measures.\n\nThese measures meant Bitcoin miners needed to curtail their energy consumption, generating millions of dollars in revenue to some mining companies due to how their power purchase agreements with the utility function.\n\nCruz added that while Bitcoin mining itself creates a lot of value, in times of dire weather conditions, these machines can be shut off \u201cin seconds.\u201d He said that this can \u201cfree up energy for hospitals and to heat people\u2019s homes,\u201d staunchly defending the industry.\n\nHe went on to tweet: \u201cTexas is a hub for jobs, innovation, and freedom,\u201d concluding that the state is \u201ca natural oasis for Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz is very on point with Bitcoin,\u201d said Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Satoshi Act Fund, a non-profit that advocates for positive policymaking with regards to Bitcoin mining.\n\nPorter told Decrypt that although he doesn\u2019t always agree with Cruz, nor do many of his pro-Bitcoin circle on the left, they \u201clike his stance on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA Texas senator since 2013, Cruz has announced he will be running for senatorial re-election next year.\n\nPoliticians from both sides of the U.S. aisle have been slowly warming up to Bitcoin and digital assets.\n\nSeveral Republican presidential hopefuls have openly endorsed some form of cryptocurrency, whether through legislative processes or by calling out SEC chairman Gary Gensler. These include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nDemocrats might be a bit leery when it comes to openly expressing support for crypto, but there are some notable backers. One example is the Senator from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand, who co-sponsored a bill with Republican Senator Cynthis Lummis that would establish clear-cut crypto regulations.\n\nPorter explained that he is \u201cexcited to see the number of pro-BTC presidential candidates because it shows just how much the space has grown.\u201d\n\nThe policy advocate told Decrypt that \u201csmart politicians have noticed that Bitcoin is a winning issue,\u201d concluding that these politicians \u201ccan attract a new type of voter and donor by aligning with Bitcoin and ensuring the USA leads on this technology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are staunch detractors in Washington D.C., however. Notably, Senator Elizabeth Warren leads the charge, along with Senator Brad Sherman from California, both Democrats. Republican Senator Roger Marshall has also been tagged as a member of the \u201cAnti-Crypto Army,\u201d calling it a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is moving to seize millions of dollars in Bitcoin that a teenage hacker had stolen from crypto executives four years ago. Prosecutors are also making sure they recover the sports car he bought with the stolen Bitcoin back, too.\n\nLast week, a federal judge signed off on an order demanding that Ahmad Wagaafe Hared turn over $5.2 million in Bitcoin that he stole back in 2016, according to a report in The San Francisco Standard. The Bitcoin and the car were stolen as part of a SIM-swapping scheme hatched by Hared and two co-conspirators between 2016 and 2018.\n\nSIM-swapping is when a hacker deceives a cell phone carrier into handing over control of a target\u2019s cell phone by pretending to be the phone\u2019s owner. The tactic is a classic social engineering tactic used by hackers to get access to personal data to steal from their targets\u2014or to bypass text-message based second-factor authentication measures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Harred\u2014then 18 and living in Tucson, Arizona\u2014worked in concert with named co-conspirator Matthew Gene Ditman of Nevada to trick customer support representatives of cell phone providers into disclosing details about the SIM cards assigned to the accounts of cryptocurrency executives in northern California.\n\nThough the executives are not unnamed, the region is home to Silicon Valley and an entire ecosystem of cryptocurrency companies and start-ups alike. Coinbase, the biggest exchange in the United States, once counted San Francisco as its home, but has since moved to being an entirely remote company.\n\nHarred was already a known denizen of the so-called darknet, where he went by the username \u2018winblo,\u2019 according to independent cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs. Using this identity, Harred was said to be \"extremely active\" and \"revered\" on an online marketplace where highly prized social media accounts were sold to buyers.\n\nWith some of these stolen funds, Harred purchased a BMW i8 that Krebs reported had a cost of approximately $150,000 at the time. Prosecutors said in their indictment that the two called some of their victims after seizing control of their accounts in a bid to further extort them.\n\nThe scheme came to an end in 2019 after an investigation by the FBI identified Harred and Ditman and arrested the two. The pair have yet to be sentenced.\n\nAD\n\nAD"
