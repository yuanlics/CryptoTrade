        "title": "Bitcoin Has a Regulation Problem - Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "Regulation is among the key factors that affect the bitcoin price. The cryptocurrency\u2019s rise has been arrested every time a government has cracked the policy whip, with countries taking varying approaches to bitcoin regulation.\n\nFor example, in November 2019, bitcoin sank to an all-time low when China accelerated a crackdown on cryptocurrency businesses, mirroring what happened when South Korea also made a move to regulate cryptocurrency trading back in 2017.\n\nConversely, whenever a regulatory \"victory\" emerges, prices surge temporarily. For instance, in October 2023, after years of Bitcoin Spot ETF denials from regulators, rumors of a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval caused a nearly $2,000 price spike and drop within a few hours.\n\nBy their very nature, cryptocurrencies are freewheeling, not beholden to country borders or specific agencies within a government. But this nature presents a problem to policymakers used to dealing with clear-cut definitions for assets. Here are two unresolved questions relating to Bitcoin regulation.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin regulation can vary on both the national and local levels, depending on the country or geographical area.\n\nIn the U.S., the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, while the CFTC considers it a commodity.\n\nMany cryptocurrency companies have avoided securities laws or requirements by offering utility or transactional tokens instead of security tokens.\n\n\n\nWho Should Regulate Cryptocurrencies?\n\nNothing is more symptomatic of confusion about cryptocurrencies than their classification by U.S. regulatory agencies and updates with former President Donald Trump's tax reform law. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) treats bitcoin as a commodity, while the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats it as property.\n\nThere is also a disparity in state and federal responses to cryptocurrency. While states have moved with alacrity and formulated rules for initial coin offerings (ICOSs) and smart contracts, federal responses are generally fueled by interpreting existing laws compared to how the cryptocurrencies are being used. For example, cryptocurrency startups in New York are required to obtain a BitLicense, which has stringent requirements regarding disclosures, before an ICO. Similarly, Arizona recognizes smart contracts. But as of November 2023, Congress hadn't enacted any legislation to guide regulators, although there have been several attempts.\n\nHow Should Cryptocurrencies Be Regulated?\n\nThe unique characteristics and global portability of cryptocurrencies present another problem for regulators.\n\nFor example, there are broadly four different types of tokens being traded on exchanges\u2014transactional, utility, security, and governance tokens. As their name indicates, utility tokens serve an underlying purpose on a platform. For example, Augur, which is a betting platform that uses the Ethereum blockchain\u2014its token, REP, is used on the blockchain as a stake (the bet). Such tokens are not subject to the SEC\u2019s rules unless they are used as a security. On the other hand, security tokens represent equity or a share in a company and automatically fall under SEC purview. Governance tokens allow holders specific rights on a blockchain, and transactional tokens are designed to only be used in financial transactions.\n\nNot surprisingly, several tokens have circumvented existing regulations by declaring themselves utility tokens. Such startups have been publicly rebuked, but that has not stopped tokens with questionable business models from being listed on exchanges outside their native countries.\n\nIn response, international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have called for an international discussion and cooperation among regulators as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned. The EU, which has been welcoming of the cryptocurrency revolution, may possess an advantage over other territories because it controls a 28-member bloc. In June 2023, the EU Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation entered into force. MiCA defines cryptocurrency assets and which types are enforceable by regulators. This legislation answers how cryptocurrency should be regulated in the EU, but the U.S. and other countries are still working on solutions. Some countries have placed outright or partial bans on cryptocurrencies.\n\nCreating Regulations for Cryptocurrencies\n\nOn his Twitter page, the former head of blockchain practice at law firm Cooley, Marco Santori, called bitcoin a \"legal platypus,\u201d one that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into established asset categories. However, the platypus may not be such a big problem for taxation or purposes within the United States.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are actually no different than cash, stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments\u2014they can represent the same things. In the U.S., regulations already exist that can apply to how an investor, business, or consumer treats them. Creating definitions and applying them to these virtual assets for regulatory purposes, as is already being worked on, might be all that is needed.\n\nRegulators Could Look to Asia for Guidance\n\nSome countries, notably in Asia, are pointers in ways to deal with cryptocurrencies. The clearest indication of future policy for the region regarding regulation may come from Japan, which officially recognized cryptocurrencies as property in its Payments and Services Act and developed a framework in 2017.\n\nNote that El Salvador became the first country (in June 2021) in the world to accept bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nStartups planning an ICO are also required to obtain a license that establishes a minimum set of requirements and disclosures for the offering. Finally, exchanges are also subject to capital requirements, strict IT compliance checks, and regulations about KYC (Know Your Customer). To achieve these changes, Japan amended its Payment Service Act. To be sure, the task is much easier in Japan since the country has only one agency, the Financial Services Agency, to operationalize the changes.\n\nSouth Korea has plans to tax any cryptocurrency profits of more than 2.5 million South Korean won at 20%, a measure which is scheduled to be placed into effect in 2025.\n\nWho Regulates Bitcoin Futures? In the U.S., bitcoin futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n\n\nWhy Are Wealthy Investors for Regulation for Bitcoin? Sophisticated investors generally support regulation because they want the protection provided by regulatory bodies and transparency.\n\n\n\nWhat Is U.S. Regulation on Bitcoin? Despite engagement by many federal and state regulators in the U.S., there has been little formal rule-making on cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin regulations vary around the globe if they exist at all. But one thing remains certain\u2014developed countries with financial services regulators are likely to develop regulations on cryptocurrency activities to protect the interests of both consumers and governments and to combat illegal activity.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

There are also victims outside of the Pacific Northwest, according to the BBB.\n\nThe company - Bitcoin Bonus - has a site that said it's based in Oregon, but the BBB said the business isn't registered with the state. Consumers have reported the company also goes by \"Bitcoin Mining.\"\n\nConsumers have reported to the BBB that they received emails and text messages regarding an accumulated Bitcoin balance that they need to withdraw, but to do so, they are required to pay transaction fees. After paying the fees and receiving confirmation, the BBB said Bitcoin Bonus fails to deliver any Bitcoin transfer and stops responding.\n\nThe BBB said multiple consumers do not recall having an account with Bitcoin Bonus but opt to pay a fee to retrieve their purported funds. Reports outline how the business then goes on to withdraw the same amount multiple times, with the average loss being $70 per person, according to the BBB.\n\n\"If something seems too good to be true, it probably is,\" said Logan Hickle, PR and communications manager for BBB Great West + Pacific.\n\nThe BBB said this alleged fraudulent activity not only causes financial losses for consumers but also creates instability in the crypto market.\n\nBBB recommendation:\n\nConsumers do their research before investing in any cryptocurrency\n\nFind a trustworthy financial professional by checking at FINRA Broker Check and BBB\n\nLook for contact information when engaging with a company online and verify it works\n\nConsumers should also be aware of emails or text messages that promise a large amount of money without risk. The larger the return, the higher the risk\n\nConsumers should never provide personal or financial information to an unknown source\n\nTrack your investments; to receive Bitcoin funds, consumers must have a Bitcoin address from their cryptocurrency exchange or a self-custodial wallet"

        "content": "Potential spot bitcoin ETF approval excitement is building in the crypto ecosystem, but Arthur Hayes isn\u2019t convinced such an event is good for bitcoin, or for the people who use it.\n\nThe crypto OG and Maelstrom Fund founder says institutional interest in bitcoin could \u201cherald a situation that we might not actually like in the end.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Blockworks on the On the Margin podcast (Spotify/Apple), Hayes posits a hypothetical scenario: \u201cLet\u2019s say Larry Fink and his [traditional finance] ilk come in and hoover up a large percentage of the freely traded bitcoin [BTC] in circulation.\u201d\n\nThe same institutional entities could launch bitcoin mining ETFs, he says, adding that \u201cBlackRock is the largest shareholder of some of the largest mining operations.\u201d\n\nAsset managers like BlackRock are effectively \u201cagents of the state,\u201d Hayes cautions. \u201cThey act on what the state tells them to do.\u201d\n\nHayes argues that if the state needs its citizens to \u201csit in the fiat banking system\u201d in order to tax them via inflation to pay back ever-growing debts, it makes sense for institutional entities \u2014 who are, by nature, compliant with the state \u2014 to hold money in an ETF vehicle.\n\nIn such a system, Hayes argues, \u201cYou can\u2019t actually use the bitcoin. It\u2019s a financial asset. It\u2019s not the actual bitcoin itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had some fiat, you bought this derivative,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe asset manager went and bought some bitcoin and they put it in a custodian and it sits there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the BlackRock ETF gets too big,\u201d he warns, \u201cit could actually kill bitcoin because it\u2019s just a bunch of immovable bitcoin that\u2019s just sitting there.\u201d\n\nTrading a sugar high today for calamity tomorrow?\n\nAdditionally, Hayes warns that the same entities could increase their grip on the network\u2019s consensus mechanics by holding a large percentage of miners.\n\nCertain upgrades that might be required to ensure bitcoin remains a \u201crock solid cryptographically hard monetary asset\u201d \u2014 particularly regarding encryption and privacy \u2014 are not necessarily aligned with traditional finance institutions, he says.\n\nRead more: DeFi is facing a \u2018full frontal assault\u2019 from regulators\n\n\u201cSo would they support that?\u201d he asks. \u201cOpen question.

        "title": "Biggest Reasons to Bet on Bitcoin\u2019s Rise - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is a topic of debate and speculation in the financial world. Bitcoin has continually demonstrated endurance and growth since its creation, despite its well-known price volatility and occasional setbacks.\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin's allure stems from its scarcity and cyclical halving events. It is a deflationary digital asset with a predefined supply cap of 21 million Bitcoins. This scarcity distinguishes it from ordinary fiat currencies, which central banks can produce at will. The occurrence of Bitcoin halving events every four years slows the production of new Bitcoins. Historical data shows that these halvings are frequently followed by significant price increases as the reduced supply collides with continuing demand.\n\nBTC: Inflation and Diversification\n\nAnother important part of Bitcoin's attractiveness is its capacity as an inflation hedge. Many people regard Bitcoin, often known as \"digital gold,\" as a store of value analogous to precious metals. During times of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, investors seek safe havens to protect their assets. With its decentralized architecture and restricted supply, Bitcoin appears as an appealing option for both individual and institutional investors seeking to protect their assets from the corrosive consequences of inflation.\n\nPortfolio diversification is a popular technique, and Bitcoin has established itself as an asset class with negligible correlation to traditional financial markets. Because of this lack of correlation, Bitcoin's price moves are frequently independent of stock markets, bonds, and other traditional investments. As a result, Bitcoin can be a valuable component of a well-diversified portfolio, thereby lowering total risk.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nOn BTC\u2019s liquidity and \u201cdigital gold\u201d claims\n\nBitcoin's liquidity and accessibility have improved dramatically over the years. Investors now have easier access to buying, selling, and trading Bitcoin thanks to the emergence of cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms. Furthermore, the growing acceptance of Bitcoin by conventional financial institutions, including several investment funds, adds to its credibility and accessibility to a wider audience.\n\nThe increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" has aided its adoption by institutional investors and enterprises. Some major corporations have even designated a portion of their corporate coffers to Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against currency depreciation. This institutional acceptance not only verifies Bitcoin's status, but it also injects significant wealth into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBTC\u2019s underlying blockchain tech and other factors to consider\n\nAnother component that contributes to Bitcoin's value proposition is its underlying technology, blockchain. Blockchain technology provides transparency, security, and immutability, making it appealing for purposes other than bitcoin. This adaptability has fueled the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts, reinforcing Bitcoin's position as a basic component in the larger blockchain ecosystem.\n\nGeopolitical concerns also contribute to Bitcoin's popularity. Bitcoin provides an alternate means of protecting wealth and performing cross-border transactions in nations afflicted by economic insecurity, capital controls, or hyperinflation. Citizens in such places frequently turn to cryptocurrencies as a lifeline for asset protection and international trade.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem's constant development and innovation are critical factors enabling its continued growth. Developers are always working to improve the network's scalability, security, and functionality. This dedication to growth guarantees that Bitcoin remains relevant and responsive to changing market demands.\n\nFurthermore, as a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin transcends territorial boundaries. It operates independently of any single government or central authority, making it resistant to censorship and resistant to meddling. This characteristic appeals to persons who desire financial independence and autonomy.\n\nBitcoin's Role in Achieving Financial Inclusion\n\nDigital technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the financial industry, enabling fintech and big tech companies to compete with traditional banks and broaden the scope of financial services. Amid this transformative landscape, digital currencies, and, in particular, Bitcoin has emerged as a force for achieving greater financial inclusion.\n\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain network, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This decentralized nature makes BTC available to individuals in regions lacking traditional financial infrastructure. With a smartphone and internet access, people worldwide can participate in the Bitcoin economy, potentially bridging the financial inclusion gap.\n\nIn fact, traditional financial services often involve high fees and transaction costs, limiting their appeal to low-income individuals. Bitcoin's peer-to-peer nature, on the other hand, reduces these costs significantly, making it an affordable alternative for remittances, payments, and cross-border transactions, especially in regions where fees can be prohibitively high.\n\nBitcoin also allows users to have full control over their finances, promoting self-reliance and independence. This can be particularly empowering for those who may not have access to traditional banking services. BTC holders have the ability to send and receive funds without the need for intermediaries, offering financial freedom to the unbanked and underbanked.\n\nMoreover, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital payments played a crucial role in helping people cope with social distancing and lockdowns. Bitcoin's decentralized nature ensured that it remained accessible when centralized systems faced disruptions. This resilience underlines Bitcoin's potential to provide financial services in even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nBTC also facilitates cross-border financial interactions with ease. This can be particularly transformative for people in remote or underprivileged regions, as it enables access to a global economy, offering new opportunities for trade and commerce.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin offers a degree of financial privacy while maintaining a transparent public ledger. This can be appealing for individuals who value anonymity and security in their financial transactions. Enhanced security and privacy can encourage participation among those who are wary of traditional banking systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is critical to recognize that, while Bitcoin has enormous growth potential and has received a lot of attention, it is still a speculative asset with inherent risks. Price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and vulnerability to market sentiment are all aspects to consider.\n\nBitcoin's enduring appeal and growth potential are supported by a number of factors, including its limited supply, role as an inflation hedge, diversification benefits, liquidity, institutional adoption, technological advancements, and use in geopolitically challenging environments. As Bitcoin matures and evolves, it will almost certainly remain a topic of conversation in the financial sector, both for its distinctive characteristics and its potential to influence the future of finance. Nonetheless, investors must be aware of the risks connected with Bitcoin's volatile nature and regulatory uncertainties."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin if You Don't Think It Has an Economic Moat? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -3.66%) is, by far, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, currently accounting for more than 55% of the total market capitalization of the entire crypto market. For individual and institutional investors, Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency added to a portfolio, and for good reason. Between 2011 and 2021, Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in the world -- it wasn't even close.\n\nJudging by that type of market-beating performance, you might assume Bitcoin shares a characteristic of all top-performing companies: an economic moat. In the investment world, an economic moat describes a sustainable competitive advantage that allows a company to outperform its rivals for long periods. The problem is that Bitcoin's economic moat appears to be eroding, not widening.\n\nDifferent types of economic moats\n\nAccording to investors such as Warren Buffett, there are several types of economic moats, and each acts as a source of long-term competitive advantage. The most common moats are those provided by intangible assets, such as a popular brand. The stronger the brand, the more it encourages customer loyalty and enables a company to charge premium prices for its products. Companies in this category include Nike and Starbucks.\n\nAnother common type of economic moat is created by network effects. Basically, the more people who use a product or service, the more valuable it becomes to every member of the network. These are most commonly found in the tech industry and include social networks and telecom networks. Think of your favorite social network: Every time a new friend, colleague, or family member joins, it becomes more valuable to you.\n\nOther types of economic moats include high switching costs (it's just too costly or cumbersome to make the switch to a competitor), low cost structures, and economies of scale that make it impossible for a new competitor to enter the marketplace. As a general rule of thumb, the wider the economic moat, the more valuable a company becomes.\n\nDoes Bitcoin have an economic moat?\n\nBased on the above, just about the only economic moat Bitcoin might have is a recognizable brand. If you ask anyone in the world to name a cryptocurrency, it's a near certainty they will name Bitcoin. It has been the market leader since its creation in 2009, and the original Bitcoin white paper is arguably one of the most influential pieces of intellectual property that has ever been created (similar to the original formula for Coca-Cola).\n\nHowever, plenty of high-profile investors consider Bitcoin worthless. For them, Bitcoin is synonymous with financial speculation and black market intrigue. Warren Buffett has famously said he wouldn't pay $25 to own all the Bitcoin in the world. His colleague Charlie Munger has called it worthless \"rat poison.\" So, before you start saying Bitcoin's brand is a source of competitive advantage, keep this in mind.\n\nMoreover, consider switching costs. There are plenty of other options you can use for payments beyond just Bitcoin (including other cryptocurrencies). So, if your favorite e-commerce shop no longer accepts Bitcoin, there's not a lot of pain to switch. At the same time, enterprises are not using Bitcoin to replace pieces of their corporate infrastructure, so there's no risk of them having to rip up their whole IT infrastructure if they have to migrate to another blockchain.\n\nAnd things become far dicier still when you think about cost structures. Bitcoin is a proof-of-work blockchain that requires energy-intensive mining. The newest blockchains are proof-of-stake and are generally acknowledged to be 99.99% more energy efficient. This makes them faster, cheaper to use, and more efficient. Bitcoin can still process only a handful of transactions per second compared to hundreds and even thousands of transactions per second for other blockchains.\n\nCan you analyze cryptocurrencies like companies?\n\nOf course, I'll admit that applying economic moat analysis to a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin may be unfair. After all, cryptocurrencies are not companies. And they are completely decentralized, meaning no CEO or corporate headquarters is making all the decisions.\n\nHowever, I do think economic moat analysis is one way of sorting through the literally thousands of cryptocurrencies that exist today. Only a handful are built for the long haul, and those are cryptocurrencies with some type of sustainable competitive advantage that makes them attractive to users and investors.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin had a vast economic moat because it was literally the only cryptocurrency on the planet. Now, however, Bitcoin's economic moat seems to be eroding. This is a common phenomenon in the stock market, as formerly top-performing companies fade into the background after losing their primary source of competitive advantage.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I still think Bitcoin is a fantastic long-term investment. But I think the record-beating returns it once delivered to investors could fade over the long run as other cryptocurrencies catch up."

        "title": "6 Questions for Lugui Tillier about Bitcoin and the future of crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Lugui Tillier is the commercial director for Lumx Studios, one of the top cryptocurrency firms in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 a city with a burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nBut for Tillier \u2014 who holds dual citizenship between Belgium and Brazil \u2014 cryptocurrency is more than a job. It was a passion sparked by a friend, and it evolved into his first full-time crypto job with Lumx in 2021.\n\n1) How did you get into crypto?\n\nI was very fortunate because Alexandre Vasarhelyi, the stepfather of one of my closest friends, was the one who co-founded the first crypto fund here in Brazil in 2017 \u2014 BLP Crypto. Before that, he was always talking to me about crypto and blockchain, telling me it was the future and that I should learn more about it. So around 2019, I finally listened to him and deep-dived into Bitcoin. But until then, it had been nothing more than a secondary interest to me. I graduated in marketing from ESPM, one of the leading marketing universities in LATAM, and in 2021, when I saw in blockchain the expression of the connection between brands and people through NFTs and the Metaverse, I pivoted my entire life to crypto and began working at Lumx where I have had the pleasure of integrating Web3 solutions into companies such as Nestl\u00e9, Ab InBev, META, BTG Pactual, among others.\n\n2) Tell us about Lumx and what you do for them.\n\nWe are a blockchain abstraction solution for big enterprises. We help anyone who wants to integrate blockchain into their business, or companies that want to deploy projects or experiment on blockchain. We developed our own solution for account abstraction, payments, decentralized identity (DID), and smart contracts. Now, big companies can mostly focus only on their own applications \u2014 not on hiring blockchain engineers or learning about blockchain technology and infrastructure, which is still complex. So we enable those big companies to work and test safely. I am the commercial director here at Lumx, so I am always in touch with the directors of the largest companies in LATAM who wish to integrate Web3 into their businesses. It\u2019s still a very consultative sale, but companies are learning very quickly, especially the banks.\n\n3) Do you invest in crypto yourself? What do you take the most interest in right now?\n\nLugui Tillier at the Savvy Brain Academy in Tanzania, a school he began donating to in 2017 using Bitcoin. Source: Lugui Tillier\n\nI\u2019m investing a lot in layer 2s. (I like Polygon, Arbitrum, and ZK solutions \u2014 such as ZK-Sync and Linea.) In the last cycle, we saw a lot of projects start on Ethereum, and that was unsustainable. We were paying $50 (or more) per transaction. There were days that we had gas wars, and people were paying almost six Ethereum per transaction.\n\nI still don\u2019t know if there was just a lack of knowledge that you could build stuff on a layer 2 among new projects and companies at the time. But people wanted to have exposure to Ethereum, so stuff that should have been happening on layer 2s was happening on Ethereum.\n\nLiquidity is flowing to layer 2s now, so layer 2s are more prepared for the next wave.\n\nI also really like Bitcoin Ordinals and Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB). We\u2019re having an explosion of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) being built on Bitcoin, the biggest blockchain in the world. Being able to express art and culture in a 100% on-chain way via Ordinals \u2014 it\u2019s really amazing. That\u2019s why I really like Ordinals.\n\nI believe that Ordinals will perhaps capture the most of this new culture and way of expressing everything on Bitcoin. Ordinals help to express the core values of Bitcoin in a much more friendly way than Bitcoin, which is too technical or harsh for some people.\n\n4) Where do you see Bitcoin and Ethereum in 10 years?\n\nI think I see Bitcoin and Ethereum as the main consensus platforms in the world. This is curious, because nowadays it\u2019s rare to see Bitcoin as a platform. We already see Ethereum as a platform where you have other applications and layers to build around it. Because of the advancements of some protocols \u2014 like Taproot Assets and Ordinals \u2014 I see Bitcoin venturing into a new era.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nBesides being a currency to pay for stuff, or a store of value, you will be able to store other currencies and assets on it. Bitcoin is moving from an era where it\u2019s been an asset to an era where it will be a platform for storing and trading other assets.\n\n5) What is the main hurdle to mass adoption of blockchain technology?\n\nLugui Tillier (second from right) in 2022 speaking at NFC Brasil, one of the main Web3 events in Latin America, where he shared his experience of working with traditional companies in Web3. Source: Lugui Tillier\n\nEven though we have made significant progress, blockchain is still composed of complex infrastructure. It\u2019s complicated not just for end-users, but also for traditional companies that want to work with it. I often joke that you only realize how complex MetaMask is when you try to teach your father how to use it \u2014 hence the importance of the emerging abstraction solutions.\n\nWhile these solutions may slightly compromise decentralization, they preserve a blockchain\u2019s programmability and automation and significantly lower the barrier to entry. This is crucial because now we have a second option. People can stay 100% decentralized if they prefer it, but for those who do not, they have the option of adopting a \u201csemi-decentralized\u201d model, which is the missing link to mainstream adoption.\n\n6) What do you do in your free time?\n\nI really like to study philosophy, especially stoicism. Everyone who works or lives in this crypto world is exposed to a lot of volatility, and they\u2019re used to a lot of dopamine and incentives. The mantra of stoicism is to cultivate indifference to stuff that you are not able to control. When you master this, you are able to live in peace in this crazy crypto world. So it\u2019s one of my favorite subjects \u2014 not only for my personal life, but also for my professional life."

        "content": "To be sure, there is still significant uncertainty around ultimate approval, not to mention the AUM that spot ETF products may garner, and the resulting impact on price. And whether due to relatively subdued sentiment compared to the bull markets of yesteryear, the run-up in price in anticipation of an approval or portended by the lackluster debut of ether futures ETFs, it's entirely possible and perhaps probable that short-term inflows will disappoint."
