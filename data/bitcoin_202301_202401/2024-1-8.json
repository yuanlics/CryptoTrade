        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nBitcoin initially jumped as high as $47,901, its highest level since March 2022, according to Coin Metrics, before dropping to as low as $44,816.94. It was last trading lower by more than 1% at $46,162.79.\n\nThe SEC later deleted the post and said its account on X was compromised and it had not approved the ETFs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell during late afternoon trading Tuesday following a false social media post from the X account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that stated the agency had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds for trading.\n\n\"The sell-off is showing a rattled market,\" said Michael Rinko, research analyst at Delphi Digital. \"This kind of high-volume boomerang event probably spooked some people and led to people taking some risk off the table, but the initial market reaction is encouraging.\"\n\nInvestors had expected an update from the SEC as soon as tomorrow, with some hoping the decision would come earlier. Wednesday marks the deadline for the SEC to either approve or deny the Ark 21Shares spot bitcoin ETF application. It is widely believed that the agency will approve several at once.\n\nBitcoin had traded below the $47,000 level for much of Tuesday, after crossing it one day prior for the first time since April 2022, as updated SEC filings from potential bitcoin ETF issuers bolstered investors' confidence that an approval is inevitable.\n\nSome investors say the day one effect of an approval has been overestimated and that it could be a sell-the-news event.

        "title": "Multi-level deep Q-networks for Bitcoin trading strategies | Scientific Reports - Nature.com",
        "content": "This section presents the learning algorithm employed to develop an effective trading strategy by leveraging the processed datasets. A more comprehensive understanding of the proposed model is provided in the three subsections. The proposed M-DQN consists of three independent DQN-based models: Trade-DQN, Predictive-DQN, and Main-DQN. The subsections respectively cover the theoretical background of RL and DQN, a summary of the results from the Trade-DQN and Predictive-DQN models, and the design methodology of the proposed Main-DQN model.\n\nBackground\u2014RL and DQN\n\nAs mentioned above, because the proposed M-DQN is based on the RL and DQN structures, the basic concepts are introduced prior to describing the method in detail.\n\nReinforcement learning\n\nReinforcement learning is a machine-learning paradigm in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment51. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward by discovering an optimal policy that maps states to actions. The agent performs actions based on its current state, and the environment responds by providing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This process is iterative and continues until the agent has acquired a sufficient understanding of the environment to ensure that the given task is well performed.\n\nThe foundation of RL lies in the MDP framework, which comprises a tuple (\\(S, A, P, R, \\gamma\\)), where S denotes the set of states; A represents the set of actions; P is the state-transition probability function; R is the reward function; and \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor with \\(0\\le \\gamma \\le 1\\). This indicates the agent\u2019s preference for present over future rewards. When \\(\\gamma\\) is closer to zero, the agent prioritizes immediate rewards, whereas a \\(\\gamma\\) value of approximately one suggests that the agent values future rewards almost as much as immediate rewards.\n\nThe agent\u2019s objective is to learn an optimal policy \\(\\pi\\) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, which is known as the value function, for each state. The value function V(s) is defined as the expected cumulative reward starting from state s and following policy \\(\\pi\\). Similarly, the action-value function Q(s, a) represents the expected cumulative reward starting from state s, taking action a, and following policy \\(\\pi\\).\n\nA popular method for solving RL problems is Q-learning, which is a model-free, value-based method that directly estimates the optimal action-value function52. Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy regardless of the agent\u2019s current policy. In Q-learning, the agent updates its action-value function using the Bellman equation, which expresses the optimal value of a state-action pair as the immediate reward plus the discounted future value of the next state-action pair. The agent iteratively updates the Q values using this equation until the optimal Q values converge.\n\nDeep Q-network\n\nBuilding upon the foundations of Q-learning, DQN is an extension that combines reinforcement learning with deep learning techniques15. It uses a deep neural network as an approximator to estimate the action-value function Q(s, a). DQN addresses the main challenges of traditional Q-learning, such as learning stability. Moreover, by employing deep learning, DQN can handle high-dimensional state spaces, such as those encountered in image-based tasks or large-scale problems53.\n\nTo ensure stable learning, DQN incorporates two essential techniques: experience replay and target networks. Experience replay is a mechanism that stores an agent\u2019s experiences (i.e., state transitions and rewards) in a replay buffer54. During training, the agent samples random minibatches of experiences from the buffer to update the Q values. This process helps break the correlation between consecutive experiences, thereby reducing the variance of updates and leading to more stable learning.\n\nComplementing experience replay, target networks address the issue of moving targets in the Q-value update equation. In DQN, a separate neural network called the target network is used to compute the target Q-values for the Bellman update. The target network has the same architecture as the main Q-network. However, its parameters are updated less frequently, by periodically copying weights from the main network. This technique mitigates the issue of nonstationary targets and improves learning stability.\n\nIn summary, RL and DQN provide a robust and scalable framework for learning optimal policies in complex environments with large state spaces. By leveraging deep learning techniques, DQN effectively tackles the challenges of scalability and stability in traditional Q-learning. In the context of this study, the DQN framework was applied to develop an enhanced trading strategy that incorporates both Bitcoin historical price data and Twitter sentiment data.\n\nPreprocessing DQN\n\nAs described previously, the proposed M-DQN consists of two parts: (1) Preprocessing DQN and (2) Main Trading DQN. Preprocessing DQN is a DQN that preprocesses the input data of Main DQN using the original data. For this purpose, two different types of DQN: trade-DQN with Bitcoin price data and predictive-DQN with Bitcoin price and tweet sentiment data, were constructed to deal with different datasets. A detailed explanation of the preprocessing DQN is provided below.\n\nTrade-DQN with Bitcoin price data\n\nIn the Trade-DQN model, the agent attempts to maximize short-term profits in the Bitcoin market, learning from features related to market conditions, relationships between historical Bitcoin prices, and agent\u2019s current financial position. Over time, the agent learns how to make optimal investment decisions\u2014buy, sell, or hold Bitcoin.\n\nThe agent interacts with its environment, which is defined as an hourly Bitcoin market. That is, the agent observes the environment and receives hourly Bitcoin price data as a state, chooses an action based on the policies learned during training, and obtains a reward for the actions taken. In this study, the state, action, and reward are denoted by \\(s_t\\), \\(a_t\\), and \\(r_t\\), respectively for all DQN models at time t.\n\nIn the Trade-DQN step, the state is defined as \\(s_t:=AP_t\\), where \\(AP_t\\) is the actual Bitcoin price at time t. The Bitcoin price is considered up to the second decimal place and used as a discrete value. The action of the agent is \\(a_t \\in \\{buy, hold, sell\\}\\) i.e.,, the agent can perform three types of actions: buy, hold, and sell Bitcoins, as shown in Fig. 3. Reward \\(r_t\\) is designed to encourage the agent to make profitable trades and discourage unprofitable or indecisive actions. If the agent chooses to \u201chold,\u201d it gets zero feedback from the environment (\\(r_t=0\\)). However, if the \u201chold\u201d action is repeated consistently several times (more precisely twenty times), the agent is punished with a negative reward (\\(r_t=-1\\) if the number of consecutive \u201chold\u201d actions \\(m \\ge 20\\)). After each \u201csell\u201d action, an agent gets a reward from the environment, negative or positive. The reward value depends on the profitability of the selling action. This is calculated by subtracting the selling price, denoted by \\(P_{sell}\\) from the last purchasing price, denoted by \\(P_{buy}\\), whereby the reward is \\(r_t=P_{sell}-P_{buy}\\). If the agent continuously chooses the \u201cbuy\u201d action and the number becomes higher than the limit (in this case 20), the agent receives a negative reward (\\(r_t=-1\\)). This is to prevent the market from making many sequential purchases and improve the agent\u2019s performance.\n\nThe DQN model consists of four multilayer models designed to suggest one of three possible actions: buy, sell, or hold a position. The first layer has 64 hidden units; the second layer has 32; the third layer has eight neurons; and the last layer contains three units, corresponding to the number of possible actions. The activation function uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) in the first three hidden layers and a linear function in the last layer. The mean square error (MSE) is used as the error function. The final results of all the four models are used to assess the confidence indicators for each of the three available outcomes.\n\nPredictive-DQN with Bitcoin price and tweet sentiment data\n\nIn Predictive-DQN, Bitcoin-related tweets are utilized to extract sentiments, thereby separating them into positive (compound score between 0 and 1), neutral (score of 0), and negative (score between 0 and \u2212 1) categories as described above. In leveraging these sentiment scores and employing the DQN algorithm, the objective is to construct a model capable of predicting future Bitcoin prices. Hence, in this model, the state \\(s_t\\) is defined by the pair \\(s_t:=[AP_t, TS_t]\\), where \\(TS_t\\) is the Twitter sentiment score at time t. Because up to the second decimal place is considered for \\(AP_t\\) and \\(TS_t\\), the state space is discrete. Based on this state, the action of the agent is defined as a number between \\(a_t \\in \\{-100, -99, \\ldots ,0, \\ldots ,99,100\\}\\), representing the future prediction of the price as the change from its current value in terms of percentage (Fig. 4). The comparative difference reward (CDR) function designed in our previous work41 was adapted as the reward function. This is a unique reward function designed to provide more nuanced feedback to the model based on the accuracy of its predictions. The CDR function considers the rate of change in the actual Bitcoin price and introduces the concept of a zero-reward value, which was defined in41, as follows:\n\nDefinition 1\n\n41 Let \\(\\alpha = (AP_{t} - AP_{t-1})/AP_{t-1}\\) where \\(AP_t\\) is the actual price of Bitcoin at time t, and \\(AP_{t-1}>0\\) i.e.,the rate of change in the actual price. Let \\(PP_t\\) be the predicted price at time t and let \\(l=AP_t - PP_{t-1}(1+\\alpha )>0\\). This point is referred to as zero-value reward (\\(ZR_t\\)) at time t where the difference from \\(AP_t\\) is l.\n\nThe reward value is then computed based on whether the predicted price (\\(PP_t\\)) is higher or lower than the actual price (\\(AP_t\\)). Therefore, two ZRs exist, as shown in Fig. 5. The former case is denoted by \\(ZR_t ^1\\) and the latter case by \\(ZR_t ^2\\). If \\(PP_t\\) is smaller than \\(AP_t\\), the agent receives a negative reward (\\(PP_t < ZR_t ^1\\)) or a positive reward if \\(PP_t\\) is between \\(ZR_t ^1\\) and \\(AP_t\\). Mathematically, the reward value is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} r_t =\\frac{PP_t-ZR_{t}^{1}}{AP_t-ZR_{t}^{1}} *100\\% \\end{aligned}$$ (1)\n\nIf \\(PP_t\\) is higher than \\(AP_t\\), the reward is positive if \\(PP_t\\) is between \\(AP_t\\) and \\(ZR_t ^2\\), and the reward is negative if \\(PP_t\\) is higher than \\(ZR_t ^2\\). In this case, the equation for calculating the reward value is:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} {r_t} =\\frac{PP_t-ZR_{t}^{2}}{AP_t-ZR_{t}^{2}}*100\\% \\end{aligned}$$ (2)\n\nIn both cases, the reward increases when the predicted price approaches the actual price. The CDR function provides a more detailed feedback to the model, allowing it to better adjust its predictions over time.\n\nThe Predictive-DRL model comprises five multilayer models designed to output any number between \u2212 100 and 100 with up to two decimal-point precision. As previously mentioned, this number represents the percentage change from the actual price. The first layer serves as the input layer and has two neurons that reflect the two features of the Bitcoin price: the actual price and sentiment scores. The three subsequent layers, referred to as the dense layers, contain 64 hidden units each. The final output layer comprises 20,001 units. These units correspond to the number of possible actions, accounting for all possible numbers between \u2212 100 and 100 with up to two-decimal point precision. The ReLU function serves as an activation function for the first three hidden layers, whereas the output layer uses a linear function. MSE was adopted as the error metric.\n\nTo summarize, the results from the Predictive-DQN model were positive, achieving 86.13% accuracy and drawing attention to the effects of Bitcoin-related tweets on Bitcoin futures price changes. Therefore, in this study, to develop an efficient Bitcoin trading strategy, a unique dataset was proposed to include market decisions and market prediction information for Bitcoin.\n\nMain trade recommendation DQN with integrated data\n\nFigure 6 Proposed M-DQN model. In Preprocessing DQN: Trade-DQN receives Bitcoin price data as input, and generates initial trade decisions as output \\(x_1\\); Predictive-DQN receives Bitcoin price data along with Tweet sentiment score as input and generates predicted change in percentage as output \\(x_2\\). In Trade Decision DQN: Main-DQN utilizes the two preprocessed outputs [\\(x_1,x_2\\)] as input, thereby generating the final trade decision as output. Full size image\n\nIn the main DQN, for the final trade, the output data of the aforementioned two Preprocessing DQNs are used for learning. Therefore, the performance of the proposed Main-DQN model is based on the output results from Trade-DQN, which provide trade recommendations, and Predictive-DQN, which offer futures price predictions. Before providing a detailed explanation of the Main-DQN model, the process of leveraging these outputs is described.\n\nData integration\n\nFirst, two different types of output data are merged into one. Combining these datasets allows us to develop a more comprehensive trading strategy that leverages the strengths of both data sources.\n\nLarge-scale timespans were considered for both datasets. As there was a slight difference in the time periods covered by each, to maintain data integrity and consistency, we identified overlapping periods between the two datasets. Furthermore, to satisfy the research objective of uncovering correlations between variables within these datasets, it is crucial that the data originate from a consistent timeframe. This alignment guarantees that genuine relationships are not distorted by variations over time. The overlapping time periods in the datasets were identified as spanning from October 1, 2014 to November 14, 2018, comprising 1505 days. This overlapping period enabled us to effectively combine the datasets and ensure the integrity of the analysis.\n\nNext, the two datasets were merged into a single dataset by aligning trading recommendations and futures price predictions based on their respective timestamps. For each hour within the overlapping period, the corresponding trading recommendations and futures price predictions were placed in the same row. This approach facilitates the seamless integration of data, allowing a more effective examination of the relationship between trading recommendations and futures price predictions.\n\nGiven that the objective was to develop an hourly trading strategy, the total number of hours within the experimental period were calculated by multiplying the number of days (1505) by 24 h. This resulted in 36,120 h of data, which formed the basis of our dataset. Therefore, the final dataset comprised 36,120 rows, with each row representing an hour within the experimental period. Each row contained trading recommendations and futures price predictions for a specific hour. This integrated dataset enabled us to explore the synergistic potential of combining Bitcoin historical price data with Twitter sentiment analysis, ultimately aiming to enhance our trading strategy and improve its performance in the volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nModeling the main DQN\n\nAfter obtaining the integrated dataset, the DQN-based Bitcoin trading model (Main-DQN) was built. Similar to the preprocessing models, the proposed DQN model, which acts as an agent, interacts with the environment represented by the Bitcoin market. The MDP elements of state, action, and reward are defined as follows:\n\nState Space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) A state represents the current situation in the market, which is crucial for making informed decisions. In our study, each row of the prepared dataset describes hourly data of historical price and Twitter sentiment and is considered a state \\(s_t:=[x_1, x_2] \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) at time t . Specifically, each state is a two-dimensional array, where the first element \\(x_1\\) can be either \u2212 1, 0, or 1, indicating a sell, hold, or buy recommendation, respectively, and the second element \\(x_2\\) is a number between \u2212 100 and 100, representing the predicted futures price change percentage based on Twitter sentiment, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\nAction Space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) An action represents the decision made by the agent at a particular state. In our trading task, the action of the agent \\(a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) at time t is defined as the final decision on trading, which can represent one of three options: buy a Bitcoin from the market, hold, or sell. The agent learns how to choose the most suitable action based on the state information and experience, aiming to maximize the expected cumulative reward.\n\nReward Function r For the trading task, the three important aspects considered for effective trading are: gaining high profits, keeping risk at a low level, and maintaining active trading, based on which the proposed reward function evaluates the agent\u2019s decision and guides the learning process. As mentioned earlier, achieving high returns is one of the components of an effective trading strategy. In this study, the agent\u2019s performance is assessed in terms of gains through profit and loss (PnL) calculations after each decision. It is important to note that transaction fees, which are charges incurred by traders when conducting buy or sell actions in the market, play a role in determining the PnL. These fees vary depending on the trading platform; however, they typically range between 0.1 and 1.5% of the trade value55. For the purpose of this study, a constant 1.5% transaction fee rate was assumed. Despite the transaction fee, a PnL can only be generated when a trade has both purchasing and selling prices. Therefore, when the agent decides to buy or hold, it receives zero reward, and as soon as it decides to sell, the selling price is subtracted from the sum of the buying price of Bitcoin and all transaction fees. If the resulting value is positive, the agent receives an equivalent positive reward. If the value is negative, the agent receives a penalty equal to the negative value. Thus, the reward function considers both the profit potential and transaction costs involved in trading. To define the reward function mathematically, the following notation is introduced: \\(P_k^{buy}\\) and \\(P_k^{sell}\\) represent the buying and selling price values of the Bitcoin for a given order k (i.e., the 1st Bitcoin, 2nd Bitcoin, and so forth), whereas \\(c_k^{buy}\\) and \\(c_k^{sell}\\) refer to the transaction fees incurred during the purchase and sale of the kth Bitcoin, respectively. Under these terms, the PnL for each Bitcoin transaction can be computed as: $$\\begin{aligned} {PnL_k} =P_k^{sell} - P_k^{buy} - c_k^{buy} - c_k^{sell}. \\end{aligned}$$ (3) This formula specifies a comprehensive method for quantifying the net profit (or loss) obtained from the kth Bitcoin transaction, after considering the transaction fees. This way, the reward value at time-step t is equal to the value of \\(PnL_k\\) (\\(r_t=PnL_k\\)). In describing the reward function, the second critical factor for an effective trading strategy is to maintain a low risk level. In this work, risk level is described as the percentage of the investment that the model is allowed to risk. After each decision made by the agent, the amount of investment is calculated, and if it is below a certain threshold, the agent receives a penalty. By contrast, if the investment is above the threshold, the agent receives zero reward. More precisely, \\(I_{current}\\) is defined to represent the current value of the investment, which is determined at each time-step t after purchasing Bitcoin. This value is computed by deducting all relevant expenses (\\(P_k^{buy}\\) and \\(c_k^{buy}\\)) from the initial investment amount, \\(I_{Initial}\\). The threshold, denoted by \\(\\alpha\\), represents the maximum permissible part of the investment that the agent is allowed to risk. The final factor for an efficient trading strategy is to maintain active trading, which refers to buying or selling Bitcoins in the market rather than simply holding them. Encouraging the agent to engage in active trading is essential for capitalizing on market opportunities and adapting to changing market conditions. To promote active trading, a threshold is established and monitored to determine the number of active trades at the time of reaching or exceeding this threshold. Let m be the sum of all the number of purchases and sells and \\(\\omega\\) be the threshold for active trades. In this scenario, the agent receives a negative reward only when the number of active trades (m) exceeds the threshold, \\(r_t = -1,\\) if \\(m > \\omega\\). Then, the reward \\(r_t\\) can be computed depending on the action \\(a_t\\) by: $$\\begin{aligned} {r_t=} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} -1, \\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m>\\omega ~ or~ a_t = buy~ with~ I_{current} < \\alpha \\\\ 0,\\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m \\le \\omega , ~ a_t = buy~ with~ I_{current} \\ge \\alpha ~ or~ a_t = hold\\\\ PnL_k,\\quad \\quad if \\quad \\quad m \\le \\omega , ~ a_t = sell,\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned}$$ (4) In the equation above, when the action is buy or sell, m becomes \\(m+1\\). This formula provides a way to measure the instantaneous reward obtained at each time step, given the current state of the investment, the cost of the transaction, and the predefined risk threshold. To determine the optimal threshold, three different risk levels are considered, whereby the agent is trained separately for each level: 30% (low), 55% (medium), and 80% (high)56. The performance of the agent under these different risk levels is analyzed and reported in \u201cExperiment and results\u201d section. Furthermore, as the Bitcoin market operates 24/7 and our dataset reported hourly, the maximum number of possible active trades was 24 per day. To explore the optimal number of trades for the proposed model, we defined three different thresholds: up to 8, 16, and 24 active trades per day. By testing these thresholds, a better understanding can be acquired on how the agent\u2019s trading activity impacts performance. The results of the experiments conducted with these thresholds are presented in \u201cExperiment and results\u201d section, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed trading strategy under various levels of trading activity.\n\nIn incorporating these factors into the reward function, the goal is to create an agent capable of making effective trading decisions that balance risk, profitability, and trading activity, ultimately for an optimal trading strategy. The key components and layers of the architecture used in our trading strategy are outlined, explaining the role of each layer in extracting meaningful information from the input data and estimating the action-value function Q(s, a). The model architecture begins with an input layer that has two neurons which capture the relevant information in the data, necessary for making trading decisions. These neurons represent market actions (\u2212 1, 0, or 1) and the price prediction score (ranging from \u2212 100 to 100).\n\nThe DQN model contains three fully connected dense layers, each containing 64 neurons. These layers aim to capture the complex relationships between the input features and actions. Increasing the number of neurons and layers allows the model to learn more complex patterns, at the expense of increased computational cost and risk of overfitting. Each dense layer utilizes a ReLU activation function to prevent vanishing gradient issues during training. The choice of the activation function is critical, as it introduces nonlinearity into the model, enabling the learning of intricate patterns.\n\nThe output layer of the model comprises three neurons corresponding to the three possible actions: buy, sell, or hold. These neurons represent the Q-values for each action, given the current state, and help the model produce a probability distribution for the actions to guide the decision-making process. To minimize the difference between the predicted and target Q-values, the model uses the MSE loss function. This choice of the loss function dictates model learning from errors and parameter updates. The Adam optimizer was employed in this model because it strikes a balance between fast convergence and stability during training."

        "content": "For 15 minutes, the cryptocurrency industry was euphoric.\n\nAt 4:11 p.m. on Tuesday, the official X account of the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that regulators had approved a new investment product tracking the price of Bitcoin, an apparent victory for embattled crypto supporters. Coinbase, a giant crypto exchange, posted a celebratory banner. Crypto executives hailed it as a historic day for the industry. Bitcoin\u2019s price spiked.\n\nThen at 4:26 p.m., Gary Gensler, the chair of the S.E.C., posted that the agency\u2019s account had been compromised, resulting in an \u201cunauthorized tweet.\u201d An S.E.C. spokeswoman confirmed the hack in an emailed statement.\n\nThe security breach was the latest twist in the crypto industry\u2019s yearslong pursuit of an investment vehicle known as an exchange traded fund tied to the price of Bitcoin. Since the fall, crypto enthusiasts have counted down the days until a Jan. 10 deadline for the S.E.C. to decide whether to allow a Bitcoin E.T.F. Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged more than 60 percent in recent months, driven by the rising optimism that an approval was imminent.\n\nAn announcement was widely expected this week, with major financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity poised to roll out the Bitcoin products. On social media, speculation has raged about the exact timing of an approval, inspiring memes about once-obscure S.E.C. procedures and propelling E.T.F. analysts to online stardom."

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we will publish many (but not all) of the forecasts a few days afterward online. Here\u2019s the latest\u2026\n\nIf you think stocks have been on a tear, just look at the market for cryptocurrency, where prices soared at dizzying rates last year. What\u2019s behind this rally, and can it continue?\n\nStart with Bitcoin. It\u2019s up 69% recently, thanks to a rally that began in early October. After tumbling in 2022, the best-known digital token doubled last year. Less familiar Bitcoin alternatives rose even more. Shares in one crypto company, Coinbase Global (COIN), shot up a staggering 391% in 2023.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Financial regulators are due to decide whether to allow several Bitcoin ETFs, exchange-traded funds, that would give investors much easier access to Bitcoin via their brokerages. BlackRock, Fidelity, Wisdom Tree and Invesco are some of the sponsors hoping to launch such ETFs.\n\nThe supply of new Bitcoin is also due to slow thanks to an upcoming \u201chalving.\u201d Every four years, the algorithm that governs Bitcoin (BTC/USD) cuts the amount \u201cminers\u201d get paid to unlock new coins by half. The energy-intensive computing power miners need to solve the increasingly complex computing problems that unlock new Bitcoin could become too costly. Previous halvings led to big jumps in the currency\u2019s price.\n\nThere\u2019s also hope that cryptocurrency is shaking off its sketchy image. The frauds perpetrated by one-time crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried showed the ugly side of crypto as a potential medium for ripping off na\u00efve investors. His recent prosecution, plus other legal actions against bad actors in the industry, could renew public trust.\n\nClearly, more people are buying and selling various digital coins. The number of accounts that can receive crypto has doubled over the past two years, to 15 million. And more investors with deep pockets are getting involved. Venture capital flowing into the market hit $11 billion last year and is expected to increase in 2024.\n\nAnd yet, there are plenty of reasons to be wary. Cryptocurrency is famous for booms and busts. Prices peaked in 2021, crashed in 2022, and soared again in 2023 but haven\u2019t regained their former tops. Plenty of money has been lost on that wild ride.\n\nMost crypto is still used for speculation, not as a medium of exchange, which was its original purpose. Few people buy things with crypto, and few businesses accept it as a payment option. For most users, it\u2019s more like digital gold, a new asset that offers an alternative to traditional investments and the hope of getting rich fast.\n\nYet, scams still abound, and regulation remains patchy at best. In the U.S., crypto is generally regulated under existing regulations for other products and commodities. There is no overarching, crypto-specific set of rules to create a level playing field and give investors the confidence that they truly understand how the market works.\n\nThis forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what\u2019s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF expected for Wednesday\u2014but some fret about being \u2018rugged\u2019 by SEC - Fortune",
        "content": "So much drama. On Friday, the crypto world was abuzz about an unfounded rumor that the Securities and Exchange Commission chose that day to approve long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs. That didn\u2019t happen, so the buzz shifted to what did: the filing of an 11-page letter by an outfit called Better Markets, which has ties to anti-crypto scourge Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The letter warned the SEC that it would be a \u201cgrave if not historic mistake\u201d to approve Bitcoin ETFs, and that doing so would put a U.S. stamp of approval on \u201ca market thoroughly contaminated with fraud and manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe letter\u2019s 11th-hour filing\u2014only days before the SEC is obliged to take a vote on a pending Bitcoin ETF petition\u2014and the fact it came from allies of Gensler and Warren led some crypto watchers to fear the approval process would be derailed yet again. \u201cIt\u2019d be so utterly fitting for crypto in general if Gary manages to figure out a way to rug everyone,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted dryly. (The term \u201crug\u201d is common crypto parlance for pulling a sudden trick or scam).\n\nDespite a flurry of worried tweets about the letter, it\u2019s unlikely the Better Markets missive is part of a last-minute plot to help the crypto-hating Gensler sandbag the Bitcoin ETF applications one more time. This is not least because the group\u2019s letter, on closer inspection, appears to be little more than a rewarmed version of an earlier document from this summer. The evidence for this is that the group\u2019s initial filing contained the wrong date and that Better Markets did not even bother to provide an up-to-date list of companies seeking a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe upshot is that the popular thesis about how and when the SEC will issue an approval is probably correct. That thesis holds that, after the agency got smacked down in court, it will use this Wednesday, Jan. 10\u2014when it is obliged to supply an answer to one of the applications\u2014to approve a batch of filings at once so as not to give any one would-be Bitcoin ETF issuer a head start.\n\nWhile imminent approval seems like a sure thing, that doesn\u2019t mean the end of the drama. There are still two big questions for which no one has a clear answer. The first is which firm will grab the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2014BlackRock, Grayscale, or someone else\u2014and the second is what an SEC approval for ETFs will mean for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe bear case, which is getting the most play, is that any price pop from the SEC\u2019s approval is already baked in and that Bitcoin will drop once investors \u201csell the news.\u201d The bull case is more subtle but also compelling. It involves the idea of \u201cmodel portfolios,\u201d which\u2014as an ETF expert tells Axios\u2014involves finance titans like BlackRock building off-the-shelf investment portfolios that are simply cut-and-pasted by many institutions. If those model portfolios will soon include Bitcoin, well, you get the idea. Do you have a strong reason to believe the bull or bear case for Bitcoin ETFs will prevail? If so, let me know.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase is reportedly acquiring a holding company in Europe in order to obtain a license to offer derivatives, which make up 75% of all crypto trading, in the EU.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s official social media account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a notice on Tuesday evening falsely claiming it had approved listings for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which has since been deleted. Moments later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a post on his own account that the agency\u2019s account was \u201ccompromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted.\u201d\n\nThe SEC followed up with a post reiterating Gensler\u2019s statement. A spokesperson for the SEC also confirmed to CNBC that an \u201cunknown party\u201d had accessed its account.\n\nLate Tuesday night, an unsigned post sent from the @Safety account said, \u201cBased on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems. but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\u201d\n\nLast week, a report from Bleeping Computer highlighted how hackers are increasingly targeting government or business profiles on X to promote crypto scams and phishing sites. Access to these accounts, which are identifiable by their gold (for business) and gray (for government profiles) checkmarks, are even up for sale on the dark web, according to a report from the cyberintelligence company CloudSEK.\n\nMandiant, the cybersecurity firm owned by Google, was just one of the high-profile accounts that had fallen victim to hackers, as its account was hijacked last week to advertise a crypto scam that drained users\u2019 wallets. The blockchain security firm CertiK also had its account taken over earlier this week to post crypto phishing links.\n\nThe post from @Safety does not indicate X will adjust its security policies in light of these recent incidents.\n\nThe illegitimate post sent from the SEC\u2019s account said, \u201cToday the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities. The approved Bitcoin ETFs will be subject to ongoing surveillance and compliance measures to ensure continued investor protection.\u201d It included an image of Gensler next to the quote, but it was clearly missing any link to the SEC\u2019s website that would normally accompany this kind of news.\n\nScreenshot by Emma Roth / The Verge\n\nWhoever compromised the SEC\u2019s account also began liking posts from crypto-focused accounts that expressed excitement about the SEC\u2019s false approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Even though the SEC\u2019s fake post was only live for a matter of minutes, it still managed to trigger a steep spike in the price of Bitcoin that brought it from around $46,746 to $47,863. That price has since sunk to $45,633 at this time of writing, according to data from CoinDesk, though it\u2019s since risen to $46,173.\n\nCan you tell when the SEC\u2019s fake announcement went out? Screenshot by Emma Roth / The Verge\n\nExchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are bundles of assets that work sort of like mutual funds, with shares of the ETFs trading on exchanges as stocks do. A Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for investors to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to hold Bitcoin directly. That also lets them avoid setting up their own cryptocurrency wallets and so on. The SEC has previously rejected all attempts at a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nUpdate January 9th, 7:15PM ET: Added new information from the SEC and an updated Bitcoin price."

Later, a spokesperson for the regulatory agency sent out the following statement: \u201cThe SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET. That unauthorized access has been terminated. The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct.\u201d\n\nX said in a post that it investigated the incident. It said the SEC\u2019s account was compromised because of an \u201cunidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\u201d X noted the SEC did not have two-factor authentication enabled on its account \u2013 a layer of security that could prevent some kinds of unauthorized access.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting (and largely expecting) the SEC to finally approve the launch of bitcoin ETFs, which would make bitcoin investing more accessible to Main Street investors, without requiring them to own the digital asset directly. More than a dozen investment companies \u2014 including household names like Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton \u2014 have applied to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded products for retail investors.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, notoriously volatile, didn\u2019t seem to go too wild in response to the false alarm. At 5:15 pm on Tuesday evening it was trading around $45,660 after very briefly spiking to nearly $48,000 around 4:15 pm, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. While the price has risen considerably in the past year, it\u2019s still far below its all-time high of more than $68,000 hit in 2021.\n\nSome had a good sense of humor about the false messaging, with one person posting \u201cspot bitcoin ETFs were approved for 0.07 scarmuccis [sic]\u201d - referring, of course, to the extremely short tenure of White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, who served for less than a week in the Trump administration."

The unauthorized tweet regarding bitcoin ETFs was not made by the SEC or its staff,\" an SEC spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe false social media post said the SEC had approved bitcoin ETFs for trading. The price of bitcoin briefly spiked after the initial post, but then quickly slid below $46,000.\n\nIn a later statement Tuesday evening, an SEC spokesperson told CNBC that the agency determined that there had been unauthorized access to the regulator's X account \"by an unknown party\" for a brief period just after 4 p.m. ET.\n\n\"The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct,\" this spokesperson said.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision on bitcoin ETFs this week after opposing them for years. More than a dozen asset managers have filed applications to create such a fund, including many that filed updated registration statements Tuesday morning.\n\nThe price of the largest cryptocurrency has been climbing in recent months, in part because of growing optimism that the so-called spot bitcoin ETFs would be approved. Funds that track the price of bitcoin futures already trade on exchanges in the U.S.\n\nCrypto advocates contend that the launch of the spot bitcoin funds could bring a new type of investor into digital assets. ETFs are an instrument that financial advisors use regularly. The idea is that advisors and investors who have been spooked by the intricacies around custody of bitcoin would be more willing and able to buy crypto in an ETF wrapper.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has been a vocal opponent of crypto during his tenure, and the commission has brought legal action against several major crypto exchanges. Gensler had used social media earlier in the week to urge investors to use caution when buying products tied to crypto.\n\nLast year, the SEC lost a court case against crypto asset manager Grayscale, which wants to convert an over-the-counter trust holding bitcoin into an ETF. The SEC declined to appeal that ruling, fueling speculation that the regulator would soon approve bitcoin ETFs.\n\n-CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed reporting.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said that the SEC had approved bitcoin ETFs for trading. The story has been updated to reflect that a false social media post was made.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

The unauthorized tweet regarding Bitcoin ETFs was not made by the SEC or its staff.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets have been awaiting news of the agency approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would give U.S. investors the ability to trade the popular cryptocurrency in the form of shares on major exchanges. While all signs pointed to an approval coming at the close of markets on Wednesday, a surprise post from the official SEC account seemed to announce the green light.\n\nThe episode represents a boondoggle for a saga that has plagued the agency, which long fought the approval of the investment vehicle, citing the potential for market manipulation. After a landmark victory in August by crypto firm Grayscale, one of the prospective issuers for the Bitcoin ETF, in a lawsuit against the agency, the SEC began to reconsider the applications, which now included major players including BlackRock.\n\nEven after Gensler\u2019s retraction, the SEC is likely to approve the applications as soon as Wednesday, when it is required to issue a decision for one of the prospective issuers, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK.\n\nTwitter blew up with speculation over whether the errant tweet was the result of a scheduling error or a hack. Evidence seemed to point to the latter, with the SEC account still displaying recent \u201clikes\u201d of posts from crypto degen accounts like \u201cSatoshi can\u2019t believe his aim,\u201d referencing the enigmatic founder of Bitcoin. The SEC account also appeared to tweet out \u201c$BTC\u201d and delete it right before its fake approval post.\n\nOthers pointed out the irony that the long-dreaded market manipulation seemed to come from the SEC itself, or at least its cybersecurity practices. \u201cI expect @SECGov Enforcement to send the SEC\u2019s Social Media and Cybersecurity teams a Wells Notice any minute,\u201d wrote Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss, who is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the agency.\n\nThe initial X post claiming the ETFs had been approved was deleted about 25 minutes after it went up."

The SEC appeared to have regained control of its account shortly after Gensler's statement on the hack.\n\nThis isn't the first time there has been phoney information about the future of bitcoin.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nPrices of cryptocurrencies swung sharply on Tuesday after a false post on the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s official X account claimed the regulator had approved the first-ever US spot bitcoin exchange traded funds.\n\nThe fake post declared just after 4pm Washington time that the SEC \u201cgrants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges\u201d. It was picked up immediately on social media, business news websites and Bloomberg TV.\n\nJust over 10 minutes later, the SEC chair poured cold water on the announcement. Gary Gensler posted on his personal account on X: \u201cThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nAn SEC spokeswoman said the original post \u201cwas not made by the SEC or its staff\u201d. By 5pm SEC staff had regained control of the X account and the false post had been deleted.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct,\u201d the SEC said, attributing the unauthorised access to \u201can unknown party.\u201d\n\nIn a post from an official account late Tuesday, X said its initial investigation indicated \u201cthe compromise was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\n\n\u201cWe can also confirm that the account did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised,\u201d the post stated, referring to an added layer of cyber security beyond a password. \u201cWe encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security.\u201d\n\nBitcoin rallied immediately after the post, for a 1.5 per cent gain on the day, but swiftly reversed on confirmation that the news was fake and the price slid as much as 3.4 per cent.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts are on tenterhooks as the SEC is expected to decide later this week whether to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, in what would be a watershed moment for the digital asset.\n\nAt least 11 asset managers have applications pending before the SEC to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. The SEC faces a deadline of Wednesday to approve some of the applications.\n\nAlthough the watchdog has previously resisted such products, it now has less room for manoeuvre. A federal appeals court last year ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of an application filed by Grayscale to convert its $29bn bitcoin trust into such an ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\nSo far this year, the volatile cryptocurrency has gained about 7 per cent on hopes the SEC would grant approval.\n\nSeveral applicants have said they received feedback from commission staff indicating that approval was possible this week.\n\nThe applicants range from large asset managers BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton to smaller firms such as Ark Investment Management and Bitwise. Earlier this week, the firms disclosed fees for their prospective products, with several of the hopefuls either substantially cutting their fees or agreeing to waive them altogether shortly after inception.\n\nThe SEC has long argued that spot bitcoin ETFs cannot guarantee the same level of protection to investors as traditional investment products. Gensler on Monday posted a short thread on X outlining potential drawbacks to investing in cryptocurrency products, noting that issuers \u201cmay not be complying (with) applicable law\u201d and that crypto investments \u201ccan be exceptionally risky (and) are often volatile\u201d.\n\nETFs hold assets like mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks and usually enjoy preferential tax treatment in the US. Each of the pending ETFs are meant to invest solely in bitcoin, an evolution over previous products that invest in cryptocurrency futures or companies involved in the crypto industry.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy"

        "title": "Why the New Bitcoin ETF May Not Have the Impact the Market Is Assuming - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This week, the SEC is expected to give their decision on a proposed spot bitcoin ETF and, according to some analysts, approval is just about guaranteed. Crypto traders have believed that for some time, resulting in big gains in BTC/USD in the last couple of months of last year taking bitcoin (BTC) up to around $45k. That has had one interesting effect: The people who said, once again, that BTC was going to zero earlier last year when it had dropped to around $20k have disappeared for some reason, just as they have every time it has jumped.\n\nYou would think after being so wrong so many times, these bears would have learned that BTC is here to stay, but it seems not. Ironically, now that the permabears are in hiding, this might actually be a good time to be at least somewhat bearish.\n\nIt is not that a spot ETF won\u2019t have a positive impact on demand for bitcoin. It obviously will, given that the fund will have to own the asset to back it, but the massive gains in BTC/USD that we have seen look overdone, and a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d pattern shortly after the approval is announced this week is starting to look very likely. It is funny how a reversal in direction in any market for any reason can be an \u201cEmperor has no clothes!\u201d moment for traders and investors, so if a post-announcement drop does come, it could easily prompt a rethink about the beliefs underpinning the run up.\n\nThe problem is that the doubling in BTC/USD rests largely on one major, but possibly flawed assumption: that it will result in a big increase in institutional investment in bitcoin. However, there are reasons to doubt that.\n\nFirst, unlike when I first started writing about bitcoin in 2014, ownership of crypto is now not a fringe thing limited only to a few computer nerds and some like me who just found the idea of a trustless, peer to peer, currency a fascinating concept. Nor is it still something that requires jumping through some pretty daunting, and to be honest, shady hoops to achieve these days. Accessible wallets and exchanges are commonplace, making bitcoin no more difficult to own and trade than other, more conventional currencies.\n\nMajor U.S. institutions have therefore been involved in trading and owning crypto for a few years now, leaving no reason why an ETF will prompt a huge jump in institutional ownership. That is especially true given the other factor that seems to be being overlooked.\n\nOne of the things that I have observed in my forty years or so in and around markets is that every institutional trader understands the cumulative negative impact of fees on an investment. They are happy to charge them to retail investors like you and me, but will go out of their way to avoid paying them themselves. So, even though Grayscale announced that they were reducing their proposed annual management fee on the fund to 1.5% from 2%, that is still a significant convenience charge for institutions that could set up their own bitcoin trading and storage account without that much more fuss.\n\nNone of this means that BTC/USD won\u2019t greet the news with a pop, assuming the SEC does what everyone expects and approves the ETF this week. It almost certainly will pop, but the question is how long that bullish sentiment will last. If profit taking prompts a post-news dip before long, that could easily turn into a significant correction as the assumptions behind the 100% or so gains in BTC start to be questioned.\n\nThen there is the fact that crypto has become such a polarizing thing in the investment world. It is a love it or hate it thing. Those that love it almost certainly already own it, and those that hate it probably never will. It seems unlikely that there is a big pool of money controlled by people without an opinion that will suddenly be invested in crypto just because there is a spot ETF available.\n\nThere is one other thing worth saying here, though. If there is a drop in BTC/USD on a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact\u201d effect following the news this week, it will set up an opportunity for longer-term investors, as the second thing that has been driving recent buying will have a positive impact. Bitcoin\u2019s original white paper created regular \u201chalving\u201d events, where mining becomes exponentially more difficult at certain points, restricting supply. We have seen in the past that those events do give the price of bitcoin a sustained boost, and one is expected in April of this year.\n\nI am not a hater who sees every move up in bitcoin as a movement led by a confederacy of dunces, but nor am I a fanatical libertarian anarchist who believes in it as a way of challenging the very idea of government. I don\u2019t believe that the asset is inevitably headed to a million dollars, nor do I believe it is worthless and headed to zero. I am just an everyday trader and investor who believes that the democratization of money is potentially a good thing, and for whom the potential to make money is paramount. That allows me to see that bitcoin is probably overvalued at current levels and take a bearish view over the next few weeks, but still see the long-term bullish influences that will see it recover to at least these levels, or probably even higher, by the middle of the year.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The criminal complaint that was filed rests on an affidavit by a special agent of the IRS who found probable cause to believe that one of the crypto operations that Burton was involved in was an \u201cunlicensed money transmitting business.\u201d Burton is accused, in short, of illegal transfer of currency \u2014 but the broader accusations in the legal filing paint a picture of a pyramid scheme operated by several people, including Burton. (Burton did not respond to requests for comment through social media or his public defender.)\n\nThe statement describes Burton\u2019s role in advising people to invest in HyperVerse (previously called \u201cHyperfund\u201d), a purported decentralized finance crypto investment platform established in 2020, alongside two other HyperVerse promoters unnamed in the document (\u201cIndividual 1\u201d and \u201cIndividual 2\u201d). The IRS special agent alleges that this entity made \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations to investors and potential investors.\u201d Touted as the \u201cworld\u2019s most sustainable passive rewards program,\u201d HyperVerse sold investor \u201cmemberships\u201d that promised double or triple returns \u2014 up to one-percent daily \u201crewards,\u201d paid for in part using \u201clarge-scale crypto mining operations.\u201d But it had no mining capability, and, according to the charging document, the investors \u201cwere paid with funds collected from more recent investors.\u201d The fund collapsed in mid-2023, costing consumers approximately $1.3 billion. (Last week, a Guardian investigation found that its CEO, Steven Reece Lewis, \u201cdoes not appear to exist,\u201d though HyperVerse\u2019s founders gave no comment for the story.) Editor\u2019s picks\n\nNeither Burton nor the Southern District of Florida Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, which is currently representing him, responded to requests for comment from Rolling Stone, and no others have been arrested in connection with HyperVerse to date. The fund was created by Zijing \u201cRyan\u201d Xu of China and Xue \u201cSam\u201d Lee of Australia, two other crypto entrepreneurs whose Blockchain Global crypto exchange platform ACX.io imploded in 2019, with creditors still owed around $50 million. Blockchain Global itself collapsed in 2021 and entered voluntary administration.\n\nHyperVerse was run as what various financial regulators around the world warned was a potential pyramid scheme, and that\u2019s what seems to be presented in the charging documents: members invested money that was converted into \u201cHyperUnits,\u201d or HU, that could then be withdrawn and converted into Tether, a so-called \u201cstablecoin\u201d that was established in 2014, whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar and can easily be converted to fiat currency. Investors were also encouraged to reinvest what they made and refer new customers for commission fees. According to the charging statement, Burton, on at least several occasions, paid \u201crewards\u201d to investors out of his own HyperVerse account.\n\nAccording to the IRS investigator who wrote Burton\u2019s charging document, \u201cbeginning in at least July 2021 HyperFund began blocking investors\u2019 ability to convert HU to cryptocurrency.\u201d Yet Burton continued to accept checks and wire transfers from customers through early 2022, the affidavit states, and took in $5,833,562 in these transactions, even though HU was by then effectively worthless. Burton, the filing says, also instructed Individual 1 to ask customers for wire transfers or checks with the inaccurate memo line \u201cConsultation/Training\u201d to avoid scrutiny from banks. Furthermore, the entities he used to conduct these transactions failed to register a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required by the U.S. Treasury, per the IRS agent. Related\n\nAfter Burton\u2019s initial court appearance, the government moved to reseal his criminal complaint, possibly indicating that other defendants are to be charged in connection with HyperVerse.\n\nBurton has cut a flashy figure in the crypto world, wearing crypto-themed clothes and jewelry, buying designer cars with Bitcoin, throwing yacht parties, apparently commissioning his own rap anthem, and earning shoutouts for his business acumen by the likes of Rick Ross, who in 2022 said Burton was \u201cgetting real money\u201d compared to \u201cfake-rich\u201d crypto hustlers. This high life has extended to hobnobbing with other celebrities, including Jamie Foxx and music mogul Breyon Precott. In recent years, the likes of Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Tom Brady, Jimmy Fallon, Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, Kim Kardashian, and Floyd Mayweather have all faced lawsuits and SEC charges for their roles in promoting crypto, in some cases allegedly failing to disclose that they were paid to do so. Most of those suits have already been settled, while Kardashian paid an SEC fine of about $1.3 million in 2022. Burton\u2019s most famous supporters, however, do not appear to have directly endorsed his HyperVerse venture.\n\nIn addition to his consulting services, investment tutorials, and event appearances, Burton\u2019s website also advertises an AI-powered crypto trading platform. Yet another link plugged on Burton\u2019s Instagram profile redirects to a cannabis lifestyle site called Cannaglobe. Burton appears to be the name behind the Cannaglobe product \u201cRyz,\u201d a \u201csexual enhancer breath refresher\u201d that costs $99.99.\n\nIn a November 2021 interview on the popular morning radio show The Breakfast Club, Burton said he\u2019d discovered crypto investing in 2017 and had been passionate about it ever since. Asked by host Angela Yee why people might suspect a crypto opportunity of being a \u201cscam,\u201d Burton replied that not every investment he\u2019s made has been \u201con the up and up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these deals I\u2019ve made money, some of these deals I failed miserably,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I\u2019m doing so well now, it\u2019s because I know exactly what to look for.\u201d He also acknowledged that USI Tech, one of the first crypto platforms he promoted, was a Ponzi scheme \u2014 it collapsed in April 2018, with tens of millions of dollars vanished \u2014 claiming that he didn\u2019t recognize it as such because he was still new to the field.\n\n\u201cI always tell everyone, make sure you have a coach, instructions, direction before you go there and do it, because you can lose everything you made, or earned in life, in crypto,\u201d Burton said."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that a post on from the agency\u2019s account on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, announcing that the regulator had approved the trading of exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin was \u201cunauthorized,\u201d and that the agency\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised.\u201d\n\nThe initial announcement brought a brief moment of joy to cryptocurrency investors, who had driven up the price of bitcoin in recent months in anticipation of the approval of a bitcoin ETF. The ETF would provide a a way to invest in bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency outright on a crypto exchange such as Binance or Coinbase.\n\nBut soon after the initial post on X appeared, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said on his personal account that the SEC\u2019s Twitter account was compromised.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,\u201d he said.\n\nThe price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to hear $48,000 after the unauthorized post hit, and then dropped to around $45,200 after the SEC\u2019s denial. It\u2019s was trading close to $45,670 at 5;15 p.m. ET.\n\nIt was unclear how the SEC\u2019s social media accounts were compromised.

        "content": "It was the moment that the crypto world had been waiting for. Then it wasn't.\n\nThe price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to nearly $48,000 Tuesday afternoon after the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to announce on X, formerly Twitter, that the regulator had granted approval for the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe SEC had been expected this week to rule on whether as many as 14 different money managers would be allowed to issue the ETFs, which would allow everyday investors to get exposure to bitcoin without having to own it.\n\nFifteen minutes later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler declared that message to be both \"unauthorized\" and inaccurate. In his own message on X, Gensler said the SEC's account on that platform had been \"compromised\" and that \"an unauthorized tweet was posted.\"\n\n\"The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,\" he added.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency fell back to $45,500, losing $63 billion in market value over just a matter of minutes.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said shortly after the incident that the unauthorized public message on X \"was not made by the SEC or its staff.\"\n\nThe agency offered more explanation hours later, saying in a statement that it determined there had been unauthorized access on the agency's @SECGov X account \"by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET\" and that the unauthorized access \"has been terminated.\"\n\n\"The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct.\"\n\nThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024\n\nThe communications mishap was the latest drama in a market frenzy surrounding the potential approval of these ETFs, which could expand widespread acceptance of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency and make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation surrounding these products helped push the price of bitcoin up more than 150% in 2023. The cryptocurrency rallied again to start 2024 as investors became more optimistic the applications would be approved.\n\nThree of these applicants told Yahoo Finance earlier Tuesday they expect the SEC to approve their applications sometime Wednesday and that trading could begin as early as Thursday based on that timing.\n\nOne of these potential issuers said it was in contact with the SEC following Tuesday\u2019s message mishap and it still expects to be declared effective around roughly 5 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nOne longtime crypto backer, Anthony Scaramucci, pushed back on Gensler's explanation of the Tuesday communications mishap.\n\n\"I think Gensler is lying,\" he said on X. \"I bet an employee screwed up and jumped the gun and he is blaming it on X.\"\n\nI think Gensler is lying.

Given that all ETFs track bitcoin, the fees they charge could help investors set them apart.\n\nBitwise is followed by VanEck, and ARK Invest's 21Shares with planned 0.25% ETF expense fees, and BlackRock is set to charge 0.30%. BlackRock added fuel to a rally in bitcoin last year after it submitted its bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC has until Wednesday to decide on the first spot bitcoin ETF application, and a Bloomberg ETF analyst said the chance of rejection by the regulator has fallen to just 5%.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts are hopeful that a Bitcoin spot ETF will lead to an increase in institutional and retail investor adoption. Investment bank Standard Chartered Monday said in a research note that it expects investment flows of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024 alone once an ETF is approved.\n\nETF providers are hungry for potential investment inflows and have heated up the fee arms race with waiver periods. Bitwise said it would waive fees for new spot bitcoin ETFs for the first $1 billion invested for its fund's first six months, while BlackRock set a waiver period of 12 months or the first $5 billion invested. The 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, released in partnership with ARK Invest, said its waiver would be for six months, or the first $1 billion invested in its bitcoin ETF, with a fee of 0.25% after."

        "content": "Everyone in the crypto world has Wednesday circled on their calendar: It\u2019s the day the SEC is expected to finally approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, a vehicle that will let U.S. investors for the first time trade the popular cryptocurrency in the form of shares on a major exchange.\n\nSteven McClurg is the cofounder and chief investment officer of Valkyrie, a crypto native asset manager that is one of a dozen-odd prospective issuers vying to sell Bitcoin ETF shares after the SEC gives the green light. Unlike other players from traditional finance vying for an early market advantage, including BlackRock and Fidelity, Valkyrie hopes its digital asset bona fides will give it an edge for investors. The firm already has two crypto ETFs: one that invests in public Bitcoin mining companies and another that invests in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts. And in a nod to the prodigious world of crypto memes, Valkyrie chose BRRR as the ticker name for its spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014a reference to the sound of the Federal Reserve \u201cmoney printer.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, McClurg stopped by the Fortune office to talk about his opinions on the SEC, the advantages of cash versus in-kind redemption models for ETFs, and the battle over fees. A veteran of TradFi himself, McClurg offers a unique perspective as someone straddling the line between Wall Street and crypto \u201cdegens.\u201d\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a fever pitch with Bitcoin ETF approval. How optimistic are you feeling?\n\nMy first couple of years in college, I was a theater minor. The best way I can think about it is Waiting for Godot. That\u2019s how I felt for the first three years of this, but now it\u2019s come to fruition. It\u2019s almost surreal.\n\nIn the last six weeks, we\u2019ve put massive amounts of work into it. There are a lot more hurdles in this ETF than most other ones that we\u2019ve had to get through. We got the word that something was going to happen right before Christmas break. The communication was very simple: The SEC had a lot of papers to review. If you want to make sure that you\u2019re in that first batch to be reviewed, make sure to have everything in by the end of the month.\n\nSo the whole team has been working through that break and last weekend. The filing today is a massive, massive milestone. And we got it done. So we\u2019re just very excited and proud of the work.\n\nAt what point did you become optimistic that the SEC was going to approve the ETF?\n\nBack in October, we got the very first comments on our ETF filing after three years. Things were moving. We didn\u2019t have an idea of what the timing would be, but we knew that they were getting ready.\n\nWhat\u2019s your understanding of the next steps? There has been reporting about a potential commission vote, even though there isn\u2019t one scheduled.\n\nWe\u2019re just in a slight holding pattern. I\u2019m in the camp where I believe that sometime after the market closes on Wednesday, the ETFs will go effective, meaning they trade on Thursday. That doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s going to happen, but that\u2019s what I believe is going to happen.\n\nI\u2019m not aware of any type of commission vote, and I\u2019ve never heard of an ETF that needed a commission vote. There have been a lot of people who have spread that rumor, but we have no understanding of any type of commission vote for this.\n\nI don\u2019t know how each commissioner would vote, but I have a pretty good idea of how some of them would if that were to happen. There are at least two commissioners that I believe want this to happen and have been for the whole way: Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce. And I also believe that Gary Gensler has been wanting this to happen as well. Look at the facts since he took over as chair. We got a Bitcoin futures ETF very quickly. Then we got an Ether Futures ETF and now we\u2019re getting a Bitcoin spot ETF. There are a lot of people on Twitter who like to hate on Gary Gensler, but from my chair, he\u2019s been very good for Bitcoin.\n\nValkyrie was in a unique position of not meeting with the SEC during the period in December when many issuers were coming in to argue for in-kind creates and redemptions. What\u2019s your view?\n\nA lot of people on my team, including myself, have managed ETFs in the past. One of the pieces of misinformation out there is that most ETFs are always in-kind creates and redeems. That\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s probably the case for equities. But most of my experience is on the bond side and more esoteric types of ETFs. And even though they allow for both, you typically always do cash, so I\u2019m used to cash creates and cash redemption.\n\nThe other thing is when it comes to cash creates, it also allows for more market participants. A lot of the banks just don\u2019t know what the rules allow them to do. So they think, if it\u2019s cash creates, we\u2019ll do it, and if it\u2019s in-kind, we\u2019re just going to have to wait. Setting the standard of cash creates helps beef up the market in the early days. It doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t change later. But for a launch like this, you need as many market participants as possible.\n\nBesides authorized participants, the other main partner is the crypto custodian. In your case, that is Coinbase, which is in a lawsuit with the SEC. Is that a concern for you?\n\nWe don\u2019t have any concerns there, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Almost every firm on Wall Street has had issues or a lawsuit or an investigation by the SEC, and often. Every time that the SEC investigates UBS, people aren\u2019t pulling their money.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s important here is that there are several sides to the Coinbase business. It looks like what the SEC is going after is the tokens on Coinbase\u2019s consumer-facing exchange business. And we\u2019re not facing that business at all. We\u2019re facing their institutional custody business so when you bifurcate that, we don\u2019t have any issues with their institutional business.\n\nThere\u2019s a possible future where Coinbase only offers custodian services in the U.S. and then its exchange business offshores.\n\nThat\u2019s what I would do if I was ruling Coinbase.\n\nWe saw a dynamic in the filings today where issuers are trying to undercut one another with fees and waivers. Your fee, which is set at 0.80%, is higher than many of your competitors. What\u2019s your approach?\n\nThere was the first round of filings. A few people disclosed fees, and a few people didn\u2019t. Our understanding after speaking with the SEC was that they wanted a 100% finished application, so that\u2019s what we delivered. We filled in every blank.\n\nDuring this last round, where everybody filed this morning, a lot of the issuers took the opportunity to lower their fees. We decided not to do that at this point. But we\u2019re constantly evaluating and looking to be competitive. But we also want to note that we\u2019re not going to be the cheap, low-cost provider either. We\u2019re a little bit more sophisticated when it comes to Bitcoin storage, security, and trading.\n\nYou\u2019ve got investors waiting at the gates, and they\u2019re going to go with the name that they recognize. Frankly, the most well-known name is BlackRock. Most people are going to choose BlackRock. But then there are a lot of people who recognize the name BlackRock and say they don\u2019t like that name. So what are the other names that they like? At the end of the day, people are going to choose the advisor that they\u2019re most comfortable with.\n\nIf they\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s more brand-name and well-known, that\u2019s probably not us. If they\u2019re looking for experts in this space, there are no gimmicks here. We\u2019re not putting out TV ads, we\u2019re just experts in Bitcoin. That\u2019s who\u2019s going to choose us.\n\nWho do you think your main bucket of investors will be? Is it retail or institutional?\n\nWe will probably be bifurcated between institutional and retail. [Registered investment advisors] are probably going to go for BlackRock or Fidelity, just because you don\u2019t get fired for choosing BlackRock when you\u2019re handling other people\u2019s money. But I think the retail audience certainly recognizes us. I know when Ether futures launched, we had about the same volume as everybody else put together. We\u2019re going to appeal to people who are looking for experts and are looking for good active managers who are not going to mess it up.\n\nSo much about Bitcoin ETFs seems to be paradoxical to the founding principles of Bitcoin, which decries intermediaries and centralization. How do you think the ETFs fit within the broader ethos of Bitcoin?\n\nI actually believe that ethos. I self-custody my own Bitcoin, and I also have Bitcoin through GBTC in my retirement account. I\u2019ve got Bitcoin in a Valkyrie trust in my retirement account. I own the Valkyrie Bitcoin futures ETF. I own the Valkyrie Bitcoin miners ETF in my own accounts. I like the idea that you have options.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the Bitcoin ethos, which that way over here, we\u2019ve got the super technical people that can go out and buy Bitcoin. They can hold it on their own keys; they can memorize their seed phrases, good for them. Maybe in my thirties I could memorize a 24-word seed phrase, but I can\u2019t today. I certainly know how to store it, and I certainly know how to manage it, and not everybody knows how to do that."

        "title": "How much bitcoin might BlackRock buy for its spot ETF? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs have dominated the crypto zeitgeist ever since BlackRock threw its very valuable hat into the ring last year.\n\nSoon after, almost a dozen other issuers lined up behind Larry Fink and his $9 trillion powerhouse to launch their own spot funds in the US.\n\nAny approvals would mark the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs on US exchanges, as the SEC has denied dozens of applications over the years. Similar products already trade in Canada and Europe.\n\nFink\u2019s vocal appreciation for the number-one crypto, alongside the raft of hopefuls in tow, is a symbolic win for crypto. Especially so considering Wall Street\u2019s failures and repeated government bailouts are believed to have directly inspired bitcoin\u2019s creation.\n\nA more cynical take would be that the rush is purely opportunistic. Fund issuers only see potential revenue in the form of management fees, so any allegiance held is purely to fiat rather than any cypherpunk ideals related to Bitcoin itself.\n\nAll told, there\u2019s plenty to be bullish about finance giants circling bitcoin. And all the hype can be distilled into a single factoid: BlackRock and whoever else gains approval will have to buy and hold bitcoin. Maybe even lots of it, starting as early as this Thursday.\n\nBut exactly how much bitcoin will BlackRock et al have to buy?\n\nRumor has it that BlackRock, for one, has $2 billion earmarked to cover day-one interest in its spot ETF, should the SEC allow it.\n\nMeasuring the global market for bitcoin investment products potentially offers a solid indication of where this is all headed.\n\nThe interactive chart below sizes bitcoin investment products already listed around the world by their assets under management \u2014 split between physically-backed products like Purpose\u2019s in Canada and those with synthetic exposure, such as ProShares\u2019 BITO, a US-listed fund handling futures contracts.\n\nThe market for physically-backed bitcoin vehicles is much more competitive\n\n(Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is not included due in part to its size. With $29 billion in bitcoin under management, GBTC would dwarf all other products on the market, rendering the charts pretty boring. Investment products holding a mix of digital assets were also excluded.)\n\nThe bitcoin investment product market is currently worth $10 billion without GBTC.\n\n$6.3 billion is tied to physically-backed products, meaning they hold an equivalent amount of bitcoin (physically-backed products are worth $35.8 billion including GBTC).\n\n$3.8 billion is with products with synthetic exposure to bitcoin through futures contracts.\n\nBig jump in bitcoin under management after BlackRock filing\n\nInvestment products rarely disclose their bitcoin holdings day-to-day, which makes calculating exactly how much they hold outside of their financial disclosures difficult.\n\nGoing by their assets under management (AUM) hover provides a rough estimate. So, dividing AUMs of the 29 physically-backed bitcoin products on TrackInsight by bitcoin\u2019s price gives us about 134,000 BTC held on behalf of their shareholders.\n\nThat\u2019s less than 1% of bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply and one-fifth of GBTC\u2019s treasury. Although, it isn\u2019t to say that those products haven\u2019t grown.\n\nThere\u2019s 14 physically-backed bitcoin-only investment products with $100 million or more, and 13 of them are easily analyzed through TradingView data.\n\nNote how quickly the top line shot up over the past year \u2014 far sharper than bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nAt the start of 2023, those products\u2019 total AUM was $1.82 billion, estimated to be backed by almost 88,000 BTC.\n\nThe same products are now estimated to be holding more than 113,600 BTC ($5.3 billion) \u2014 a 29% increase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has practically tripled in that time.\n\nBitcoin-backed products listed outside the US did get a boost after BlackRock\u2019s filing on June 16 last year \u2014 with estimated bitcoin holdings swelling by nearly half between then and now, representing $1.6 billion BTC at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s however tough to say what attracted those inflows: Bitcoin\u2019s distinct uptrend since January 2023 or the anticipated buying pressure surrounding BlackRock\u2019s ETF buzz.\n\nInterestingly, price and estimated holdings aren\u2019t always correlated. The number of bitcoins held by the analyzed issuers apparently continued to rise between August 2021 and May 2022, during which time bitcoin fell 65% from $46,800 to $30,400.\n\nThe US market is far larger than Europe\n\nThe price of bitcoin had rallied 30% in the five months leading up to BlackRock\u2019s ETF bid \u2014 which would\u2019ve helped spur growth in investment products. The rate of growth in the wider crypto product market following the filing still indicates the filing pushed interest higher.\n\nWhether that fresh capital sought to capitalize on buying pressure associated with successful spot ETF bids, or whether it aimed to profit on the speculation either way, is really moot.\n\nAnalysts reckon US investors will choose spot bitcoin ETFs based on their liquidity, brand and fees, with details of the latter dripping through official SEC channels ahead of the agency\u2019s first deadline Wednesday.\n\nFor argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say BlackRock\u2019s ETF attracts the most capital. How much bitcoin can we expect BlackRock to buy over the short term?\n\nBTC Group\u2019s BTCE was calculated to have bought the most bitcoin since BlackRock\u2019s filing with 9,700 BTC ($454 million)\n\nAnd let\u2019s say the market interest in bitcoin ETFs mirrors that of gold funds: Europe\u2019s largest gold product, Xetra-Gold ETC, is worth $13 billion. The largest fund in the US, SPDR Gold Shares ETF, is now worth more than $57 billion.\n\nThe top bitcoin-backed investment product in Europe is worth $1.17 billion. Using the same multiplier as the difference between gold markets (and still ignoring GBTC) would mean that BlackRock\u2019s US-listed bitcoin ETF would have to buy up to $5.2 billion in bitcoin to satisfy analogous investor demand \u2014 which seems realistic.\n\nBitcoin in total sees more than $39 billion in volume every day, diminishing any influence from BlackRock\u2019s potential buying (unless it comes all at once, which is highly unlikely).\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that ETF approval would officially bring some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest operators to bitcoin markets, potentially for good. But it could well be that the hype around their participation has an even greater impact than the BlackRocks themselves.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Mercari will convert the BTC in real time through its crypto exchange subsidiary, and will pay sellers in fiat currency.\n\nMercari's subsidiary, Mercoin, will be responsible for converting all Bitcoin payments into Japanese yen, ensuring that vendors receive the equivalent amount in fiat currency. Notably, Mercari will not display prices in Bitcoin, maintaining the listing of items for sale in Japanese yen.\n\nFounded in 2013, Mercari has become Japan\u2019s largest community marketplace, with over 22 million monthly users. The e-commerce platform launched crypto exchange Mercoin in April 2021, positioning itself as a gateway for crypto adoption in the tech-savvy nation.\n\nJapan's pro-crypto regulations have encouraged e-commerce platforms to offer cryptocurrency payment options. Rakuten, another major e-commerce platform, has launched a few crypto initiatives, including allowing users to convert loyalty points to crypto and developing a native non-fungible token platform.\n\nJapan is seeking to encourage further adoption and innovation in the web3 space. According to Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan, Web3 is an aspect of the new form of capitalism. Furthermore, startups can now raise funds in crypto, while Japan is reforming new tax laws to exempt companies from paying taxes on long-term holdings of cryptocurrencies. Japan\u2019s largest investment bank, Nomura, also launched a Bitcoin adoption fund in September 2023."

        "content": "A promoter of the HyperVerse crypto investment scheme has been arrested and charged in the US for his alleged role in the scheme, with court documents claiming he was part of a network that made \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations\u201d to investors and potential investors.\n\nRodney Burton, who goes by the name \u201cBitcoin Rodney\u201d, was arrested in Florida on Friday and remains in custody pending transfer to Maryland, where the charges were laid. He has been charged with operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nThe US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) alleges in court documents that a network of promoters of the Hyper schemes made \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations\u201d for an investment operation that generated revenue from bitcoin mining, which the IRS alleges did not exist.\n\nIt is the first time charges have been laid against anyone involved in the HyperVerse scheme.\n\nA Guardian investigation has revealed the scheme\u2019s links to Australian Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu, two of the directors of the Australian blockchain company Blockchain Global, which collapsed owing creditors $58m.\n\nLee was the chairman of the HyperTech group, while Xu was listed as the group\u2019s founder. The two men were featured prominently in online promotional material for the Hyper schemes, with both speaking as part of the HyperVerse global launch event in December 2021.\n\nThe HyperVerse scheme was the subject of multiple consumer warnings from financial authorities around the world, but escaped the attention of regulators in Australia.\n\nLee and Xu have been referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) for potential breaches of the Corporations Act in relation to Blockchain Global, but Asic has said it does not intend to take action at this time.\n\nNeither Lee nor Xu is mentioned in the US court documents relating to the criminal complaint against Burton.\n\nLee did not respond to a request for comment on the arrest; Xu could not be contacted.\n\nBurton\u2019s appointed public defence lawyer also did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment by time of publication.\n\nIn an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant lodged in the US district court of Maryland, IRS special agent Andrew Accardi alleges that Burton was a promoter of HyperFund, which also operated under the names HyperTech, HyperCapital, HyperVerse and HyperNation.\n\nThe court documents, reported by the website courtwatch.news and seen by the Guardian, refer to all of the schemes collectively as HyperFund.\n\nThe affidavit claims that an IRS analysis of Burton\u2019s personal and company bank records shows that from June 2020 to January 2022, Burton received 562 wire transfers or cashier\u2019s checks, totalling US$7,851,711, from individuals who wished to invest in HyperFund.\n\nThe affidavit also outlines how the scheme allegedly worked.\n\n\u201cHyperFund operated a purportedly legitimate decentralized finance, or \u2018DeFi,\u2019 cryptocurrency investment platform,\u201d Accardi states.\n\n\u201cA network of HyperFund promoters \u2026 made fraudulent promotional presentations to investors and potential investors. In those presentations, promoters touted HyperFund\u2019s investment programs, including the purported returns that prospective investors could earn from investing with HyperFund. Potential investors were told that they could purchase \u2018memberships\u2019 in the \u2018world\u2019s most sustainable passive rewards program\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe scheme falsely claimed that investors who purchased memberships would receive daily rewards of between 0.5% to 1% daily, until the investor\u2019s initial investment doubled or tripled in value, the affidavit alleges.\n\n\u201cTo convince investors that HyperFund could make these daily payments of passive rewards, HyperFund claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from revenues generated from large-scale crypto mining operations,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\n\u201cIn fact, HyperFund did not have any such operations. To the extent investors saw the accrual of any rewards, those investors were paid with funds collected from more recent investors.\u201d\n\nA scheme using the funds of later investors to pay off early investors is commonly known as a Ponzi scheme, although this term is not used in the court documents.\n\nAccardi further alleges that of the 562 payments documented, 342 were made after HyperFund began blocking people from being able to make withdrawals in mid-2021.\n\n\u201cIn other words, in and after July 2021, Burton took investors\u2019 fiat currency and transferred worthless HU [hyper units] from his HyperFund account to investors\u2019 HyperFund Accounts.\u201d\n\nBurton, a 54-year-old American, has promoted his wealth on various social media channels, including boasting in March 2022 that he bought two Rolls-Royce cars on the same day.\n\nHe also recorded himself shopping for a $3.5m yacht, and claims to have bought a diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet watch worth $1.4m.\n\nIn February 2021, Burton posted pictures on social media of himself with Ryan Xu in Dubai, calling him a \u201cmulti billionaire\u201d and an \u201camazing human\u201d.\n\nIn a video posted online of Xu speaking at a dinner with Burton for lunar new year, Xu says that \u201cwe are going to change the world together\u201d. Xu says he decided to travel to Dubai to meet HyperFund promoters because it was a \u201cvery special moment\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou guys, for so many hours, fly here to Dubai, so I think I should make my move and at least make everyone think we are family, we are united and we are going to change the world together.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the future of HyperFund, Xu says: \u201cWe are trying to revolutionise the entire financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we come together and join the same platform, and we can have the same idea and then we can have the same consensus, and we keep recruiting our army, and one day if our army reaches one billion people, then the whole world belongs to us. That is our vision.\u201d\n\nBurton says in the video the plan is \u201csuper exciting\u201d.\n\nDuring the Dubai trip, Burton boasted in social media posts about eating steak enrobed with 24-carat gold and claimed he received $1,000 from the \u201cowner and founder of my current crypto program\u201d for a lunar new year gift, along with \u201ca nice Mont Blanc pen from our management team\u201d.\n\nHe also went on a shopping spree in Dubai, showing purchases from a range of luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga."

        "content": "Retail investors are likely to be able to own bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The bitcoin ETFs will be offered on a centralized financial platform and provide exposure to spot bitcoin with redemptions in cash.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve a number of spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges, including from BlackRock Inc. and VanEck.\n\nA Dec. 14 article noted that if an investor in a bitcoin ETF undertakes a cash redemption, the remaining investors in the bitcoin ETF may have \u201ccapital-gains distributions\u201d and \u201cbe saddled with tax bills.\u201d\n\nOne bitcoin ETF sponsor responded the next day that such tax analysis is incorrect. It said that bitcoin ETFs are taxed as grantor trusts, and \u201ccash redemptions by grantor trusts are taxable events for the redeeming shareholder only\u2014they are not taxable events for the ETF itself or for non-redeeming shareholders.\u201d\n\nThis type of confusion over a bitcoin ETF\u2019s taxation can be reduced by learning more about the tax treatment of other ETFs that own a single asset.\n\nSDPR Gold Trust, or GLD, is an ETF that owns gold, which is a type of physical store of value that is produced through a proof-of-work process known as mining. Gold can be divided into smaller units to create gold trinkets and other non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Gold was even used as a currency, such as by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder who allegedly said \u201cfortune favors the brave\u201d before he bravely got too close to an erupting Mt. Vesuvius and died.\n\nGLD has been a grantor trust for US federal income tax purposes since it was created nearly two decades ago, which means it\u2019s disregarded for US federal income tax purposes. Each holder of the ETF owns an undivided interest in its assets: gold bars stored in a vault.\n\nIf a grantor trust ETF holder decides to redeem for cash, the grantor trust would sell some of its assets for cash and distribute that cash to the redeeming holder.\n\nUnder Reg. Section 1.671-5, widely held fixed investment trusts such as GLD and similar grantor trust ETFs can treat that asset sale as being made only by the redeeming holder, who is the only person who has taxable gain or loss in the sale. The non-redeeming holders of other shares aren\u2019t affected by the asset sale.\n\nThe same result can apply to the bitcoin ETFs, all of which are expected to be grantor trusts. Different and less favorable tax rules can apply to stock and bond ETFs that are \u201cregulated investment companies\u201d for federal income tax purposes, but bitcoin ETFs won\u2019t be regulated investment companies for various reasons, including that they generally can\u2019t own bitcoin under the tax rules.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s assume that a bitcoin ETF is created so that 1,000 shares correspond to one underlying bitcoin. An individual buys 1,000 bitcoin ETF shares for $43,455. The next morning, the shares are worth $38,222 and the individual decides to completely redeem for cash.\n\nThe redemption is typically processed at the end of the day, when the bitcoin ETF can sell one bitcoin for $47,905 and redeem the individual\u2019s shares with those US dollars after paying any crypto transaction fees. The redeeming individual is the only person who has taxable capital gain, of up to $4,450. The redemption is reported to the IRS on an IRS Form 1099-B.\n\nBitcoin ETF ownership through a traditional finance, or tradfi, institution may not be entirely consistent with bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision in his 2008 white paper . Yet it can reduce the risk of losing bitcoins to hacks, forgotten passwords, scam exchanges, or accidentally discarded hard drives that contain wallet private keys.\n\nThe prospectuses for bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly cover many risk factors that can affect bitcoins and the blockchain infrastructure, such as the risk of quantum computers, nuclear war, geomagnetic storms, or investor sentiment shifting to other digital asset ETFs that own currencies such as bitcoin cash, ethereum, dogecoin, or monero.\n\nBut the tax risk of phantom taxable income or gain shouldn\u2019t be a concern for those who are familiar with the grantor trust ETF tax rules.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nLibin Zhang is tax partner at Fried Frank\u2019s New York office.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines"

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that a post sent from the agency\u2019s account on the social platform X announcing the approval of a long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund was \u201cunauthorized,\u201d and that the agency\u2019s account was hacked.\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly spiked more than $1,000 after the post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claimed \u201cThe SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.\u201d Cryptocurrency investors had already driven bitcoin\u2019s price above $46,000 in anticipation of the approval.\n\nAn ETF would provide a way to invest in bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency outright on a crypto exchange such as Binance or Coinbase.\n\nBut soon after the initial post appeared, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said on his personal account that the SEC\u2019s account was compromised and, \u201cThe SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d Gensler called the post unauthorized without providing further explanation.\n\n\u201cWelp,\u201d wrote Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, on X. Like many bitcoin investors, Klippsten had been expecting the agency to approve bitcoin ETFs potentially as soon as this week.\n\nThe price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000 after the unauthorized post hit, and then dropped to around $45,200 after the SEC\u2019s denial. It was trading around $46,150 at 6:15 p.m. ET.\n\nShortly after Gensler\u2019s statement, it appeared that the SEC had gotten back control over the account.\n\nIt was unclear exactly how the SEC\u2019s social media account was hacked. X\u2019s @Safety account tweeted on Tuesday night that a preliminary investigation by the platform determined \u201can unidentified individual\u201d got control of a phone number associated with the account \u201cthrough a third party.\u201d\n\nIt did not elaborate, though it did say that the compromised SEC account, @SecGov, did not have two-factor authentication activated.\n\nEven before that news, politicians who have long expressed frustration at how Gensler operates the SEC \u2014 Republicans in particular \u2014 expressed anger at what they suggested were lax SEC security controls over its accounts.\n\n\u201cJust like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened,\u201d said Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been false market-moving information about the future of bitcoin on regulated exchanges. A false report back in October implied that fund manager BlackRock had gotten approval for bitcoin ETF, causing bitcoin prices to jump sharply.\n\nElon Musk gutted Twitter\u2019s content moderation and security teams after taking over the platform in late 2022. And while internet watchdog groups have complained about a spike in toxic content, including antisemitic and other hate speech on X, many also worry about account integrity.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of account takeovers could potentially be significant, and especially during an election year,\u201d said Brett Callow, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\n\nA spokesperson for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n____\n\nAP Business Writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report."

Youwei Yang, the chief economist at BIT Mining, said in an email to CoinDesk that he thinks no spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved in the near future. Rather, Yang expects the SEC to delay approvals for at least another 3 months. \u201cA delay with some reasons or excuses could still possibly occur, such as questioning of manipulative behaviors sometimes observed in the crypto market that are still unclear, and its criminal or terror activities some congress members claimed that crypto has involved,\u201d Yang wrote. Other analysts think the news has already been priced in, Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance, said that most market participants have been well-positioned for some time now, limiting the upside potential."

        "content": "While stocks are off to a mixed start this week, Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is pushing higher once again, bolstered by expectations for the imminent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) as soon as Wednesday. The widely anticipated move is expected to make the cryptocurrency more appealing to institutional and retail investors alike, potentially bringing waves of fresh capital into Bitcoin.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nAnd that's not the only positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Every four years, the amount of BTC in supply is cut by 50%, which increases demand for the largest cryptocurrency. The next \u201chalving\u201d event is scheduled in April 2024, and BTC has already surged around 70% since the end of April 2023.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has experienced four-year bull-bear cycles. It typically gains momentum six months prior to the halving event, which occurs every four years, and the bull run ends roughly 18 months after the halving event.\n\nAs prices of BTC mining companies are tied to Bitcoin, here are three blockchain stocks you can consider buying today.\n\nTeraWulf Stock\n\nValued at $464.9 million by market cap, TeraWulf (WULF) owns and operates vertically integrated Bitcoin mining facilities in the U.S. It has two BTC mining facilities located in New York and Pennsylvania, generating domestically produced Bitcoin powered by 91% zero-carbon energy resources such as nuclear, hydro and solar.\n\nIn December 2023, TeraWulf mined 334 Bitcoin worth $14.17 million. Comparatively, mining costs were much lower at $3.74 million. Due to rising BTC prices, TeraWulf is forecast to increase sales from $15 million in 2022 to $133 million in 2024.\n\nTeraWulf stated it will repay $14 million in debt with the cash generated in Q4, resulting in lower interest payments.\n\nOut of the five analysts covering WULF, four recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for WULF is $3.40, indicating an upside potential of 70.8%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRiot Platforms Stock\n\nValued at $3.06 billion by market cap, Riot Platforms (RIOT) is among the largest Bitcoin mining companies globally. In 2023, Riot Platforms mined 6,626 BTC at an average price of $28,491. It ended the year with 7,362 BTC worth roughly $324 million.\n\nDue to the company\u2019s unique power strategy, it generated $71.6 million in power credits, equivalent to 2,480 Bitcoin, based on its average price during 2023. Moreover, Riot emphasized it will increase its self-mining hash rate to 28 EH/s by the end of 2024.\n\nOut of the 10 analysts covering RIOT, eight recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201chold.\u201d The average target price for RIOT is $17.91, indicating an upside potential of 20%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCipher Mining Stock\n\nThe final BTC mining stock on my list is Cipher Mining (CIFR), valued at nearly $1 billion by market cap. The company increased mining production in December, despite continued growth in network hash rate.\n\nCipher stated it entered into transactions to acquire new mining rigs, fueling its ambitious growth plans. It also ended 2023 with $120 million in liquidity and no debt.\n\nOut of the seven analysts covering Cipher stock, five recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201chold.\u201d The average target price for CIFR is $5.17, indicating an upside potential of 37.9%.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says Bitcoin Could Continue Soaring in 2024. Here's Why I Agree. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Last year was terrific for investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 all experienced double-digit percentage gains. A lot of the positive momentum in the capital markets was fueled by bullishness about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith so much hype around AI and its myriad applications, it was easy to overlook the performances of other asset classes. After experiencing a brutal crypto winter in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -8.06%) emerged as a big winner last year as well -- surging more than 150%.\n\nWhile this is great for those who bought the dip, there is one big reason in particular to believe that 2024 could be the year Bitcoin eclipses the $100,000 mark. With many anticipating another Bitcoin halving this year, investors may want to assess why now could be a lucrative time to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nThere are multiple ways for crypto investors to gain access to Bitcoin. One is by buying shares of companies engaged in Bitcoin mining. Simply put, miners essentially serve as auditors for transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Subsequently, miners are compensated in Bitcoin for their service. While this is a fairly straightforward process, there are some important nuances that investors should understand.\n\nRemember, Bitcoin is much different from traditional investment vehicles such as stocks or bonds. For starters, the crypto token is decentralized -- meaning it is not governed by traditional financial institutions or regulatory authorities. Furthermore, there is a finite amount of Bitcoin available to purchase. In fact, the total supply of Bitcoin is 21 million tokens, of which about 19.6 million now are in circulation. This feature is what makes mining Bitcoin so tempting.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin miners are rewarded with tokens, there is a unique phenomenon called halving that occurs every few years.\n\nWhy do Bitcoin halving cycles matter?\n\nAfter 210,000 blocks are mined, the reward given to Bitcoin miners is cut in half, slowing the supply growth. As a result, Bitcoin can become perceived as more valuable, assuming demand stays the same or rises. In turn, the price for the token can move higher.\n\nTo get a sense of how Bitcoin has moved after halving cycles, check out the graph below:\n\nPast Bitcoin halving cycles occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The graph above illustrates that in the years between each cycle, Bitcoin tends to eclipse prior highs. With that said, following the halving in 2020, Bitcoin also eventually cratered from its all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nIt's paramount that investors understand that while Bitcoin has reached new highs following halving cycles, the token often experiences striking volatility and is not guaranteed to stay at these highs.\n\nWhere is Bitcoin headed in 2024?\n\nIn a way, Bitcoin halving is a lot like a stock split. When a company splits its stock, the overall value of the company should not change. Even though the share price goes down after a split, the number of shares issued goes up. In turn, the market capitalization for the company does not change.\n\nAlthough this makes superficial sense, seasoned investors probably know that this is seldom the case. Instead, given the lower share price, many investors perceive the stock as cheaper than it once was. This typically results in higher demand and more buying, thereby sending the newly split stock higher.\n\nThe same model can be applied to Bitcoin. Since halving cycles reinforce Bitcoin's scarcity, it's quite possible that the token falls onto more people's radar after these events, spurring some increased -- if temporary -- demand.\n\nAlthough this is all fascinating in theory, investors should be aware of a few things. First, it's not yet known precisely when the next halving will occur. Models and forecasts suggest it will occur in April, but this is not a lock.\n\nMy personal take is that Bitcoin will indeed experience a halving this year and I see the token reaching new highs. But as the graph above illustrates, Bitcoin's price could just as easily drop off a cliff at some point after that. For this reason, investors really need to understand the risks associated with Bitcoin and crypto investing at large. While the potential returns could be enormous, the risks are likely commensurate."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe approval of bitcoin spot ETFs could send the top cryptocurrency more than 300% higher by the end of next year, Standard Chartered Head of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote in a Monday note.\n\nThat comes as Wall Street is waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to greenlight the first of these ETFs by Wednesday, the reported deadline by which the agency must make a decision.\n\n\"If ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible. This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32mn new bitcoins will be held in spot US ETFs by end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote, estimating that inflows this year alone could be $50 billion-$100 billion.\n\nIf bitcoin reaches $200,000, that would represent a price surge of 344% from its current level of about $45,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce up and running, these ETFs would cause demand to soar, providing enough price upside for bitcoin to potentially reach $100,000 before the end of 2024, Kendrick previously forecast. His bullish forecast also sees supply falling, given the upcoming halving cycle and token hoarding by miners.\n\nIn determining his 2025 outlook for bitcoin, Kendrick drew a parallel with the first gold spot exchange-traded product and its price impact on the yellow metal.\n\nAfter SPDR Gold Shares came online in 2004, it gradually increased, multiplying more than fourfold in a seven-year span.\n\n\"We use this 4.3x increase as our base case for Bitcoin, but we expect the BTC gains to occur during a short one- to two-year period because we expect the BTC ETF market to mature more quickly,\" Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also noted how bitcoin's price increased by a similar level when holdings in ETFs outside of the US jumped in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, any increase in demand would have a large impact on bitcoin's price as the amount of immediately available supply is falling, Kendrick added.\n\n\"This measure is at an all-time low as a percentage of total supply in circulation,\" he said. \"In other words, supply is more price-inelastic than it has ever been.\""

        "content": "A bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval could revolutionize the cryptocurrency the way it did investing in gold a generation ago and send bitcoin's price rocketing to $200,000 by the end of next year, according to Standard Chartered. All eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the runup to its Jan. 10 deadline to approve or reject one of multiple applications to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The agency is widely expected to approve more than one ETF to level the playing field from the beginning. \"We see this as a watershed moment for normalizing bitcoin participation by institutional money, and we expect approval to drive significant flows and price upside for bitcoin,\" Geoffrey Kendrick, a London-based analyst at Standard Chartered, said in a note Monday. \"If ETF inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to $200,000 is possible.\" The British bank assumes 437,000 to 1.32 million bitcoins, or between $50 billion and $100 billion, will be held in spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Standard Chartered has previously said the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of this year. On Tuesday, bitcoin traded just below $47,000, a level it reached Monday for the first time since April 2022. Standard Chartered's bullish estimate looks back at the introduction of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF in 2004. Similar to bitcoin, the first gold ETPs, or exchange-traded products, were initially small and restricted to markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Canada, Kendrick said. \"The price of gold rose 4.3x in the seven to eight years it took for gold ETP holdings to mature after the first ETP was introduced,\" he said. \"We expect bitcoin to enjoy price gains of a similar magnitude as a result of spot ETF approval, but we see these gains materializing over a shorter (one- to two-year) period, given our view that the bitcoin ETF market will develop more quickly.\" Bitcoin is currently up 10% in 2024, after soaring 157% in 2023. Some investors are concerned the market is overestimating the effect on the first day of a potential ETF approval. Even they acknowledge, however, that the launch of bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and flows of traditional fiat currencies into and out of them \u2014 are likely to be the most significant driver of the cryptocurrency's price this year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), cautioned investors about the high risks and volatility of cryptocurrency assets on Monday in a post on X (formerly Twitter), as the Web3 industry anticipates the SEC\u2019s decision on several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\n\u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nThe SEC chief\u2019s warning did not specifically reference the proposed ETFs but coincided with a series of amended Form S-1 filings, also known as the initial registration forms for new securities.\n\nThe agency is expected to respond to the applications, which include submissions from industry heavyweights such as BlackRock, Ark Invest/21Shares, and Fidelity, by January 10, with the potential for a landmark approval that could introduce the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been long-awaited and could signal a new era of mainstream investment opportunities for digital assets. Such a move would not only provide a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin but could also pave the way for further integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nThe amended S-1 filings by various asset managers are seen as a final step before potential approval, with some firms even slashing fees to attract investors to their prospective ETF products. For instance, ARK Invest and 21Shares have proposed waiving their 0.25% fee for the first six months for the initial US$1 billion in assets under management, while BlackRock has set a competitive ongoing fee of 0.3%.\n\nWhile the commission has the option to deny the applications, recent legal developments, such as a federal judge\u2019s order for the SEC to reconsider a previously denied spot Bitcoin ETF application from Grayscale Investments, the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, suggest that the regulator\u2019s rationale for any decision will be closely examined.\n\nThe potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would follow in the footsteps of its neighbor, Canada, which permitted the listing of such products on exchanges starting in 2021."

Gensler called the post unauthorized without providing further explanation.\n\nX confirmed the SEC\u2019s account was compromised and said it was because of an \u201cunidentified individual\u201d obtaining control over a phone number associated with the agency\u2019s account through a third party.\n\nThe Elon Musk-owned platform also said late on Tuesday that the SEC did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised and the hack was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems, citing a preliminary investigation.\n\nThe price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000 after the unauthorized post hit, and then dropped to around $45,200 after the SEC\u2019s denial. It was trading at around $46,150 at 6.15pm ET.\n\n\u201cWelp,\u201d Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin, wrote earlier on X. Like many bitcoin investors, Klippsten had been expecting the agency to approve bitcoin ETFs potentially as soon as this week.\n\nIt was unclear how the SEC\u2019s social media account had been compromised. Shortly after Gensler\u2019s statement went live, it appeared that the SEC had gotten control over the account.\n\nPoliticians, particularly Republicans who have long expressed frustration at how Gensler operates the SEC, quickly expressed anger at the SEC\u2019s lax security controls over its accounts.\n\n\u201cJust like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened,\u201d said the Republican senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sits on the Senate banking committee.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been false market-moving information about the future of bitcoin on regulated exchanges. A false report back in October implied that fund manager BlackRock had gotten approval for a bitcoin ETF, causing bitcoin prices to jump sharply."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nA fee war has broken out among the asset managers hoping to launch spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in the US, even though the US regulator has not yet indicated whether it will allow the products to be sold.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it would charge customers just 0.2 per cent of the net asset value of its fund for the first year or until its ETF hits $5bn in assets before rising to 0.3 per cent\n\nRival applicant Ark Investment Management, which had previously indicated it would charge 0.80 per cent of its bitcoin holdings, offered to waive fees for the first six months, or until its ETF\u2019s assets reach $1bn. Thereafter its fee will be set at 0.25 per cent. Invesco likewise will waive fees for six months or the fund\u2019s first $5bn before settling at 0.59 per cent.\n\nThe latest moves are the final touches to regulatory filings ahead of an expected decision this week from the Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to permit stock market funds that invest directly in bitcoin. If approved, funds could be launched in a matter of days.\n\nBitcoin last month soared to a 20-month high of $44,000, and this week has climbed more than 5 per cent to about $45,200 as investor anticipation builds ahead of the SEC potentially giving the green light to several applicants.\n\nBecause the products are similar \u2014 they are all designed to hold bitcoin \u2014 fees and to a lesser extent firm branding will be a key part of how the applicants distinguish themselves in a crowded market.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic price war. How do you prove that your ETF is any better than anybody else\u2019s? The only way you can compete is on price,\u201d said James Angel, faculty affiliate at Georgetown McDonough\u2019s Psaros Center to Financial Markets and Policy.\n\nFor a decade the SEC has resisted applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that bitcoin prices are set on unregulated exchanges and thus it cannot give adequate investor protections. But pressure has been growing on the regulator since it lost a court ruling last summer on its reasons for blocking an ETF application by asset management firm Grayscale.\n\nGrayscale itself on Monday said it would drop its fee from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The remaining list of applicants, including WisdomTree, Valkyrie and Fidelity are all offering fee structures comfortably below one per cent.\n\n\u201cGrayscale is in a difficult position because they were the very first mover in the field, and it was the only way to get in. Now they face competition,\u201d Angel added.\n\nAll of the providers are hoping to benefit from a rush into the asset class akin to the $1bn that flooded into ProShares when it offered the first-ever bitcoin futures ETF in late 2021. That fund hit the $1bn threshold in just the first two days of trading, and now holds about $1.8bn in net assets.\n\n\u201cWith a bitcoin spot ETF, we\u2019re opening the doors to Wall Street,\u201d said Jad Comair, chief executive of Melanion Capital."

The account was \"compromised,\" causing a mini crash in the digital coin as it fell to $45,695.\n\nYikes!\n\nBLACKROCK LAYOFFS COME AS FIRM AWAITS BITCOIN ETF DECISION\n\nAside from the regulatory implications, the incident is among the most embarrassing to hit the commission in recent years. The SEC had been preparing for a big announcement on Wednesday of the Bitcoin \"spot\" ETF approvals \u2014 a key event in the maturing of the $1.7 trillion crypto market.\n\nThe approval would open crypto to possibly millions of retail investors. The ETF would track the daily prices of Bitcoin; small investors could buy and trade shares of the ETF on a major stock exchange for the first time in history.\n\nDespite the SEC claims of being a victim in the mess, lawyers who deal in securities law say the circumstances surrounding the faux posting and the wild swings in Bitcoin it caused should spark an investigation into the SEC by the SEC. Bitcoin is technically a commodity, thus under the direct regulatory purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But, securities lawyers say the SEC has been blurring the lines of its mandate in recent years, particularly in its crackdown on crypto. Many say if a hack of this nature occurred on an account of a Wall Street or crypto firm, SEC staffers would already be on the phone demanding answers.\n\nIn addition to possible market manipulation, the SEC passed new rules in July for so-called \"cybersecurity risk management\" for regulated entities. These rules would \"require registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents and material information on their cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance.\"\n\nLIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE\n\n\"They have to look into this matter since Bitcoin moved so much, it's a given,\" one securities lawyer told Fox Business. \"A registered broker deal would have to make a filing with the commission because the price of bitcoin moved materially. Also, the SEC violated its own cybersecurity rules. I've never seen something like this.\"\n\nSEC press officials didn't return calls regarding how and if it plans to investigate the compromise and the motives of who was responsible. In a statement to Fox Business, it said the X account \"has been compromised. The unauthorized (posting) regarding bitcoin ETFs was not made by the SEC or its staff.\" An SEC spokesperson added, \"The SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET. That unauthorized access has been terminated. The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct.\"\n\nGensler, meanwhile, is a controversial figure on Wall Street and in crypto for his heavy-handed regulatory approach as chair. Wall Street executives say his priorities veer into new and unchartered areas of enforcement, such as mandatory climate disclosures.\n\nCrypto executives say he has exceeded his statutory mandate by regulating crypto through enforcement actions even though the SEC doesn't have clear congressional authority to do so. They say he was forced to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs only after losing several high-profile court cases challenging his crypto regulation.\n\nIt is no surprise that after the hack, he was vilified by crypto enthusiasts and Wall Street executives as a clueless bureaucrat. Scores of trolls reposted an October warning also from the SEC official X account in response to another market-moving report about a spot bitcoin ETF approval that turned out to be false. The post said: \"Be careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.\"\n\nNone other than the famed national security leaker Edward Snowden from his official account stated: \"Jesus Christ Gary get your shit together.\" In a subsequent post by Snowden, he stated: \"You had one job.\" Snowden is wanted in the US on espionage charges, and he now lives in Russia.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe announcement of Wednesday's likely approval has been well choreographed by the SEC staff in recent weeks, during conversations with issuers like BlackRock, Ark Investments, Greyscale, and others.\n\nIn recent days, Gensler himself has been posting on X warning of the dangers of the still opaque crypto business, a move seen as preparing the markets for the big announcement on Wednesday with the ETFs set to trade Thursday.\n\nIt's unclear if the hack will impact the timeline of the approval process; the lawyer involved in the matter says it would be unprecedented for the commission now to reject the applications after recently expediting matters with applicants."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight The account @SECGov posted on the platform, formerly known as Twitter, that the agency had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds for listing on national exchanges.\n\nThe posting occurred shortly after 4 p.m. and attracted millions of views before the SEC wrested control back and declared that the earlier statement was false. By that time, the initial post had been reported by some media outlets.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler later posted on X that the agency\u2019s \u201caccount was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis post followed an SEC statement that the hacker had taken control for a brief period.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct,\u201d said spokeswoman Stephanie Allen.\n\nBitcoin backers have asked the SEC for permission to list such funds repeatedly, a change that would give investors a more regulated way to participate in the crypto markets.\n\nThe false post briefly drove a spike in bitcoin prices, so that anyone with knowledge of the scam could have reaped a major profit.\n\nThe hijack was also notable because the account was not only a source for official news but one branded by X with a silver check mark, meaning that it had been verified as an important government account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is unclear whether such accounts include special security arrangements, but it would be surprising if the SEC account did not include at least a minimal form of two-factor authentication.\n\nNonetheless, X\u2019s own account for safety matters posted late Tuesday that the SEC account did not have two-factor \u201cat the time the account was compromised.\u201d It also said the company believed that the phone number associated with the account had been wrested away by the hacker.\n\nIt has been notoriously easy for hackers to assume control of existing phone numbers for years through attacks, including those known as SIM-swapping. That can lead to the compromise of email and financial accounts, even those using SMS-based two-factor authentication. The Federal Trade Commission last month urged carriers to do a better job confirming the identities of people asking to move their numbers to a new device.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment on the claim.\n\nAllison Nixon, an expert on SIM-swapping, said that X had failed to establish defenses that could stop someone from using a stolen number to alter two-factor requirements. Other companies have such mitigations, she said.\n\nPoor security at X has included years of takeovers of high-profile accounts and multiple whistleblower complaints, including by the company\u2019s former head of security Peiter Zatko.\n\nThe hack follows that of smaller government accounts and those of some accounts with gold checks, which are given to private organizations, over the past few weeks."

Their planning has been guided by the latest medical information, government directives, direct input from our rabbis, faculty and students, and best practices from industry and university leaders across the country. I am deeply thankful to our task force members and all who supported them for their tireless work in addressing the myriad details involved in bringing students back to campus and restarting our educational enterprise.\n\n\n\nIn concert with the recommendations from our task force, I am announcing today that our fall semester will reflect a hybrid model. It will allow many students to return in a careful way by incorporating online and virtual learning with on-campus classroom instruction. It also enables students who prefer to not be on campus to have a rich student experience by continuing their studies online and benefitting from a full range of online student services and extracurricular programs.\n\n\n\nIn bringing our students back to campus, safety is our first priority. Many aspects of campus life will change for this coming semester. Gatherings will be limited, larger courses will move completely online. Throughout campus everyone will need to adhere to our medical guidelines, including social distancing, wearing facemasks, and our testing and contact tracing policies. Due to our focus on minimizing risk, our undergraduate students will begin the first few weeks of the fall semester online and move onto the campus after the Jewish holidays. This schedule will limit the amount of back and forth travel for our students by concentrating the on-campus component of the fall semester to one consecutive segment.\n\n\n\nThroughout our planning, we have used the analogy of a dimmer switch. Reopening our campuses will not be a simple binary, like an on/off light switch, but more like a dimmer in which we have the flexibility to scale backwards and forwards to properly respond as the health situation evolves. It is very possible that some plans could change, depending upon the progression of the virus and/or applicable state and local government guidance.\n\n\n\nBefore our semester begins, we will provide more updates reflecting our most current guidance. Please check our website, yu.edu/fall2020 for regular updates. We understand that even after reading through this guide, you might have many additional questions, so we will be posting an extensive FAQ section online as well. Additionally, we will also be holding community calls for faculty, students, staff and parents over the next couple of months.\n\n\n\nPlanning for the future during this moment has certainly been humbling. This Coronavirus has reminded us time and time again of the lessons from our Jewish tradition that we are not in full control of our circumstances. But our tradition also teaches us that we are in control of our response to our circumstances. Next semester will present significant challenges and changes. There will be some compromises and minor inconveniences--not every issue has a perfect solution. But faith and fortitude, mutual cooperation and resilience are essential life lessons that are accentuated during this period. And if we all commit to respond with graciousness, kindness, and love, we can transform new campus realities into profound life lessons for our future.\n\n\n\nDeeply rooted in our Jewish values and forward focused in preparing for the careers and competencies of the future, we journey together with you, our Yeshiva University community, through these uncharted waters. Next year will be a formative year in the lives of our students, and together we will rise to the moment so that our students will emerge stronger and better prepared to be leaders of the world of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBest Wishes,\n\n\n\nAri Berman"

        "title": "Here's Why Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Are Buying All the Bitcoin They Can Get Their Hands On - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For many equity investors, Michael Saylor may not be a household name. But for crypto investors, Michael Saylor is legendary for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC -8.28%), as well as for some of his more outlandish takes on social media about the future of crypto. His company, MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and it's not even close. After buying an additional $615 million worth of Bitcoin at the end of 2023, his company now owns close to 1% of all Bitcoin in the world.\n\nEven more remarkably, MicroStrategy only started buying Bitcoin back in 2020, more than a decade after Bitcoin originally launched. But in the past three-plus years, Saylor and his company have consistently added to their Bitcoin position, through a variety of different market conditions. So what's behind this push to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can?\n\nBitcoin as a long-term store of value\n\nAs Saylor has reiterated over and over again, Bitcoin is the single best store of value over the long haul -- even better than gold. In fact, Saylor has even opined that the market cap of Bitcoin (now just under $1 trillion) could one day approach the market cap of physical gold, which is estimated to be around $13 trillion.\n\nThere are several reasons for this admittedly audacious point of view. One is that Bitcoin has a limited lifetime supply. According to the algorithm powering Bitcoin, the total lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at just 21 million coins. The current circulating supply is close to 19.5 million coins, so we are getting close to the point where all the Bitcoin that will ever be created has already been created.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption surges on a global scale, it will increase its relative scarcity. More people will be vying to gain access to a very limited supply, and over time, that is going to boost the price of Bitcoin. It's just basic economics. With supply largely unchanged, and demand going through the roof, the price of Bitcoin should soar.\n\nMoreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it attractive for another reason: It is arguably the single-best hedge against inflation over the long term. While gold investors may find this point highly debatable, the underlying logic does make a certain amount of sense, especially when you compare Bitcoin to fiat currency (i.e., currency controlled by governments and central banks, such as the U.S. dollar).\n\nThis is due to the fact that an algorithm carefully controls the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. In fact, every four years, Bitcoin actually becomes more deflationary when the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half (i.e., \"the halving\"). In contrast, a central bank can (theoretically) print as much money as it wants, which is what can lead to inflation and even hyperinflation.\n\nTakeaway lessons for the average investor\n\nPutting this all together, I think there are several lessons for the average investor. Perhaps the most important lesson is the need for a long-term outlook. As Saylor has pointed out over and over again, his Bitcoin strategy is not a short-term trading strategy. This is all about buying Bitcoin for the long haul, and letting the market do its magic.\n\nAnother key lesson is the need to stick to a buy-and-hold strategy, through a variety of different market conditions. Yes, MicroStrategy started accumulating Bitcoin during the last bull market rally, at a time when Bitcoin was skyrocketing to an all-time high of $69,000. But the company was not afraid to add to its position during the crypto market downturn, and Saylor now looks like a market savant, with Bitcoin poised for its next major market rally.\n\nFinally, it's never too late to invest in an asset if you truly believe in its long-term potential for price appreciation. Saylor and MicroStrategy regularly update the public on just how much Bitcoin they own, as well as the average purchase cost of each Bitcoin. Remarkably, the average cost of a single Bitcoin for Saylor at the end of November was $30,252. In essence, that means he completely missed out on the period of time (an entire decade!) in which Bitcoin surged from $1 to $30,000. So, no, it's not too late to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin for the long haul\n\nIt's easy to understand why Saylor is so unabashedly bullish on Bitcoin. But before you rush out and buy Bitcoin, make sure you fully understand the reason why Saylor is buying Bitcoin hand over fist. It's not just because Bitcoin is soaring in price -- it's because Bitcoin has certain inherent properties that make it valuable over the long haul.\n\nDespite the risk and volatility of crypto, the long-term outlook certainly seems bullish for Bitcoin. When Saylor recently appeared on CNBC, he suggested that Bitcoin had the potential to increase in value by 10x. At its current price of $44,000, a 10x valuation multiple means that a single Bitcoin could theoretically one day be worth close to half a million dollars. Own just two Bitcoins, and you could one day become a millionaire."

Cryptocurrency advocates have long fought for the SEC to grant approval for a spot bitcoin ETF but have faced stiff opposition from Gensler.\n\nIn recent months, concerns have grown over X\u2019s ability to protect accounts from takeovers. Since being purchased by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the social media site has cut hundreds of security employees, exposing it to a wave of spam accounts.\n\nThe brief takeover of the SEC account is the latest in a series of high-profile incidents involving prominent Twitter accounts used to spread cryptocurrency scams. Last week, Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant had its Twitter account taken over by someone sharing links to a cryptocurrency platform.\n\nA Canadian senator had their Twitter account taken over to spread a scam, and over the weekend Zack Polanski, the deputy leader of the United Kingdom\u2019s Green Party, had his account hijacked for the same purposes.\n\nIn December, two researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Twitter that were not addressed for weeks by the social media site\u2019s team."

        "title": "Bitcoin Could Run to $200K, Says Research Firm - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has been on a scintillating run since the start of 2023. And more upside could be on the way. Market observers believe the approval of multiple U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs is imminent.\n\nSome analysts and experts believe that event will be a \u201csell the news\u201d proposition. Others see it as a potentially seminal event for the ETF industry and for the cryptocurrency world at large. As such, there could be tangible benefits for funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nThe ETF rallied alongside bitcoin last year. It more than doubled on an annual basis as the digital currency did the same. In other words, SATO is highly correlated to bitcoin\u2019s price action. That\u2019s obviously a positive when the cryptocurrency is rising as it has been to start 2024. Potentially bolstering the case for more SATO upside this year are expectations that bitcoin\u2019s recent rally is still in its early innings.\n\nConsider the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outlook\n\nIt\u2019s possible that spot bitcoin ETFs are approved as soon as this week. With that in mind, some market observers are speculating about the possible longer-ranging effects on prices of the digital currency. Standard Chartered believes it\u2019s possible a spot bitcoin could trigger a quadrupling in bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cIf ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible. This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32mn new bitcoins will be held in spot US ETFs by end-2024,\u201d observed Standard Chartered Head of FX Research Geoff Kendrick.\n\nFrom current levels, bitcoin would need to more than quadruple to get to $200,000. Assuming such a move materializes, SATO could potentially notch significant upside along the way.\n\nThere is some historical precedent that SATO investors might want to consider. Going back about two decades to the launch of the first physically backed gold ETF, the launch of that fund sent spot gold prices to a fourfold increase over the next seven years. Some of that move was helped by gold ETFs\u2019 increasing demand for the yellow metal \u2013 a scenario that\u2019s expected to play out with spot bitcoin funds.\n\n\u201cWe use this 4.3x increase as our base case for Bitcoin, but we expect the BTC gains to occur during a short one- to two-year period because we expect the BTC ETF market to mature more quickly,\u201d added Kendrick. \u201cThis measure is at an all-time low as a percentage of total supply in circulation. In other words, supply is more price-inelastic than it has ever been.\u201d\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee. However, SATO is not issued, sponsored, endorsed, or sold by VettaFi, and VettaFi has no obligation or liability in connection with the issuance, administration, marketing, or trading of SATO."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals burst onto the scene in 2023 essentially as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. The ensuing debate over Ordinals created a considerable fissure in the Bitcoin community, which had been relatively united since the great Bitcoin block size debate of 2016.\n\nRather than risk splintering the Bitcoin community into factions just as massive Wall Street firms gear up to issue Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin Ordinal supporters might consider a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC) similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) so as to keep their NFT on-chain dream alive without the risk of their collectibles being nullified by Bitcoin core developers.\n\nHard forks occur when a blockchain splits into two. The original fork continues on as the pre-existing protocol and ledger. In this case, there would be no Ordinals moving forward on the original chain. The new fork changes the protocol in some way\u2013such as an increase in block size\u2013and then rolls it out as a coin oftentimes proclaiming to be the real Bitcoin as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is evolving into a multiasset network\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin, while Bitcoin SV forked from Bitcoin Cash. Both the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV communities argue that Satoshi saw increased block size as the only way forward for scalability.\n\nThe Bitcoin Ordinals debate of 2023-2024\n\nToday's debate around Bitcoin and Bitcoin Ordinals involves two entrenched factions. In one corner, Bitcoin maximalists argue that Ordinals undermine Bitcoin\u2019s preeminent use as digital gold or electronic currency. They view Ordinals as a bug or even an outright attack on the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nPSA: \u201cInscriptions\u201d are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code,\u2026 \u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023\n\nProponents of Ordinals, on the other hand, would argue that Ordinals were made possible by Bitcoin protocol changes made by core developers themselves. These include Bitcoin transaction format changes in the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade as well as the Taproot upgrade. Proponents believe Ordinals represent innovation.\n\nOrdinal pushers equate scarcity and high prices with artistic value.\n\n\n\nThis is a false equivalency. Taken in an historical context, it\u2019s risibly foolish.\n\n\n\nThis is why the post-market for these things, like the shitcoins they mimic, is collapse.\n\n\n\nAnd, for those who look only at\u2026 \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) December 15, 2023\n\nIn recent months, the debate has reached a fever pitch with both sides increasingly digging in, with Bitcoiners including Max Keiser and developer Luke Leighton leading the charge against Ordinals.\n\nBitcoin Core v27 will make future Ordinals impossible on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nBitcoin core developers are planning to make Ordinals impossible to add to transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain with Bitcoin Core v27, thus repairing the perceived bug. Pre-existing Ordinals would remain as the pending change in Bitcoin Core v27 only stops new Ordinals from being minted. That bitcoin v27 is in the works demonstrates that developers and nodes, not so much Ordinals buyers and miners, have ultimate say as to what Bitcoin\u2019s protocol looks like.\n\nRelated: Ordinals have brought digital spam to Bitcoin\n\nRather than fight an uphill battle against a Bitcoin community on the verge of eliminating future Ordinals at the protocol level, the Bitcoin Ordinal camp could follow the examples set by Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV by forking and building a Bitcoin Ordinals chain without the threat of core developers nullifying their hard work.\n\nThere is a reason, after all, both Bitcoin Cash and BitcoinSV opted for a hard fork. The Bitcoin community united against anything that resembled a wholesale change at the protocol level. The current Bitcoin regime seems intent on undoing Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals could proliferate on their own chain\n\nBitcoin is becoming increasingly divided at this critical juncture in its history. The infighting makes the incumbent Bitcoin community look immature and risks Bitcoin losing its core principles of decentralization and financial sovereignty as institutional money comes pouring in on a new scale.\n\nNow is the time for the Bitcoin community to be united. Now is the time for another hard fork to preserve Bitcoin as the world\u2019s digital gold and/or electronic cash. A Bitcoin Ordinals chain is more likely to succeed than an all-out fight akin to the debate over block size. Moreover, Bitcoin miners are likely to favor an Ordinals chain after experiencing the heightened transaction fees that came in 2023 as Ordinals proliferated.\n\nKadan Stadelmann is a blockchain developer and the Komodo Platform\u2019s chief technology officer.

        "content": "After months of court cases and endless filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission looks poised to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETFs this week. In anticipation of the floodgates opening, issuers are attempting to undercut one another by offering low fees to investors.\n\nIf the SEC moves forward with spot Bitcoin ETFs, which provide investors exposure to the current price of Bitcoin without having to hold the volatile cryptocurrency, it will kick off a race between major players like BlackRock and Fidelity that are hoping to plant a flag in a market potentially worth billions.\n\nBesides factors like name recognition and trust, the fees charged by issuers are one of the clearest ways to attract early investors. Last week, two issuers\u2014Fidelity and Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy/Invesco ETF\u2014released the first indications of what pricing would look like. Fidelity set its fee at 0.39%, while Galaxy put its fee at 0.59%, also announcing it would waive fees for the first six months of operation and $5 billion in assets held.\n\nFilings on Monday escalated the arms race. The crypto-native fund manager Bitwise squeaked in with the lowest fee, 0.24%, while the ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck set the second-lowest overall fee at 0.25%, also announcing last week it would donate 5% of its Bitcoin ETF profits to the group of developers, known as Bitcoin Core, who maintain the blockchain. Several other issuers came close, with Franklin Templeton setting its fee at 0.29% and BlackRock\u2019s iShares ETF announcing a 0.3% fee.\n\nOthers, including Bitwise and BlackRock, aim to sweeten the pot of early entrants by following Galaxy\u2019s model and waiving fees for a set period and for the amount invested at the beginning of the process. In a further attempt to compete with its more traditional competitors, Bitwise said it would waive fees for the first six months or $1 billion invested. Close on its heels, BlackRock set its waiver period at 12 months or $5 billion invested.\n\nThe 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, released in partnership with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, set a waiver period of six months or $1 billion, with a fee of 0.25% after.\n\nI have been talking for months about how fees will be driven down by these ETFs and how it will be good for end-investors. But honestly even i'm surprised at how low things are right now pic.twitter.com/rDYRXlyPfm \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 8, 2024\n\nGrayscale, which paved the way for SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs through its landmark court case against the agency decided last year, set a less competitive rate of 1.5%\u2014still lower than the current fee of 2% for its Bitcoin trust. \u201cHard to imagine [an] advisor (where the big money is) picking a 1.5% ETF when others [are] sub 40pbs,\u201d said Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X/Twitter.\n\nGrayscale may have a different advantage over competitors, however. Unlike other issuers, which are creating new offerings, Grayscale is \u201cuplisting\u201d its existing Bitcoin trust, which has long been one of the most popular investment vehicles in the digital asset space. As Fortune previously reported, there is still a possibility that this process means Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is the first out of the gate. Even so, the SEC seems set on having coordinated launches to avoid a situation like ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin futures ETF, which launched in 2021 and has captured over 90% market share.\n\n$2 billion\n\nFor now, the date to watch is Jan. 10, the deadline for the SEC to decide on the next ETF application in line\u2014ARK 21Shares. Bloomberg reported that issuers have been given until Monday morning to submit the last revisions to their applications, with the SEC set to vote on the filings midweek.\n\nMany in the crypto industry are hoping Bitcoin ETFs will finally encourage traditional investors, from wealth managers to everyday traders, to enter the market. In an X Spaces last week, the head of digital assets research for VanEck said that he heard BlackRock has $2 billion of capital lined up from existing Bitcoin holders who want to put their funds into spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRather than buying Bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase, or self-custodying the asset through hardware wallets, Bitcoin ETFs would allow investors to hold the cryptocurrency through their brokerage accounts for a small fee. The process would not be immune from the risks of the crypto industry. Coinbase, for example, is still set to be the Bitcoin custodian for the vast majority of the issuers\u2014an irony given its ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.\n\nEven with optimism that the agency is set to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is still a possibility that the commissioners and Chair Gary Gensler will delay or reject the applications. On Saturday, Balchunas tweeted that he estimates a 5% chance of rejection, which would likely spur additional court cases. \u201cYou gotta leave a little window open for these things,\u201d he wrote."
