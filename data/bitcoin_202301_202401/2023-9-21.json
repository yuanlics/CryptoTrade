        "content": "The upcoming bitcoin halving could be a boon for the share price of payment company Block, as Berenberg Capital Markets analysts argued bitcoin\u2019s impact on the stock is more than it should be.\n\nThe correlation between Block shares and the price of bitcoin \u2014 standing at 0.61 \u2014 \u201cappears to be a case in which investors\u2019 perception of the impact of bitcoin on the company\u2019s prospects matters more than the reality,\u201d the analysts said in a Wednesday research note.\n\nA potential price boost to bitcoin with the upcoming halving set for April 2024 \u2014 an event when rewards offered to bitcoin miners are cut in half \u2014 could support Block\u2019s stock price, the note adds.\n\nHistory would suggest bitcoin\u2019s price could spike in the upcoming halving\u2019s aftermath, industry watchers have said. Matt Lason, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital, told Blockworks in July that such events \u201cserve as a great reminder for everyone of the power of bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy and the true value of scarcity in an inflationary world.\u201d\n\nBlock \u2014 formerly known as Square \u2014 was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in 2009. Square remains the name of its payments platform for businesses, while mobile payment service Cash App is another one of its main offerings.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price was $45.39 at 1 pm ET Thursday \u2014 down about 30% year to date. Berenberg\u2019s price target for Block shares is $75.\n\nA questionable correlation?\n\nInvestors have used stock in Block as a means of gaining bitcoin exposure since the company announced in November 2017 that it would facilitate BTC trading for customers, according to Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer.\n\n\u201cThere are more equities that provide that kind of exposure now, but Block stands out because of its high profile and large market capitalization,\u201d Palmer told Blockworks.\n\nStock prices with a correlation to bitcoin higher than Block\u2019s 0.61 correlation include Coinbase and MicroStrategy \u2014 at 0.93 and 0.90, respectively, he added.\n\nRead more: Will MicroStrategy ever stop buying bitcoin?\n\nBlock officially launched bitcoin trading on Cash App in 2018. The total sale amount of bitcoin sold to customers of the mobile payment service during this year\u2019s second quarter jumped 34% year over year to $2.39 billion.\n\nThe company invested $50 million in bitcoin during the final quarter of 2020 and an additional $170 million in the crypto asset during the first three months of 2021. The fair value of the company\u2019s bitcoin investment was $245 million, as of June 30.\n\nBlock\u2019s affiliates include Spiral, an independent team focused on open-source work around the Bitcoin blockchain and TBD, a builder of decentralized platforms, protocols and tools.\n\nStill, Cash App reported just $44 million in gross profit from bitcoin transactions in the second quarter \u2014 a fraction of its total gross profit was $968 million in the three-month span.\n\nThe bitcoin that Block held on its balance sheet at the mid-year point \u2014 when adjusted for fair market value \u2014 represented 0.79% of its total assets, Berenberg analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe impact of bitcoin on Block\u2019s operating performance is not all that significant at this point,\u201d the Wednesday Berenberg note states.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "2 'Strong Buy' Bitcoin Stocks Under $5 With Triple-Digit Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since coming on the scene, cryptocurrencies have fired the imaginations of online traders, currency speculators, and mathematicians alike. The leading digital currency, bitcoin, is currently priced at approximately $26,550 per coin, representing a ~60% increase year-to-date. And it looks like bitcoin will see a strong upward pressure on that price over the next year.\n\nThe bitcoin algorithm has a built-in halving mechanism, whereby the reward given to miners for solving a blockchain link is cut in half. The process takes place about every four years, and is next expected in May of 2024. The bitcoin halving has happened regularly since 2012, and has historically had a positive effect on the digital currency\u2019s price, as well as on the share prices of bitcoin-related stocks.\n\nThat last gives investors a chance to get in early. The predictability and regularity of the bitcoin halving makes now the right time to start looking into bitcoin stocks, to find an attractive point of entry well before this catalyst takes place. Wall Street\u2019s analysts can help with this; they\u2019ve been pointing out solid choices among the bitcoin mining companies, anticipating a rise in price.\n\nA quick look at the TipRanks data shows that their latest picks have several common attributes that should bring in investors. We\u2019ll look at two bitcoin mining stocks, each currently priced under $5 per share, and boasting a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating. Additionally, some are projecting triple-digit upside potential for the coming year. Here are the details.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Bitfarms, a bitcoin mining company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and operating with 11 bitcoin mining facilities \u2013 farms, as the company calls them \u2013 located in 4 countries. The company has approximately 56,200 mining rigs deployed. Bitfarms can boast a hashrate of 5.6 EH/s, and generates an average of 12.4 bitcoins per day.\n\nBitcoin mining won\u2019t happen without power, and bitcoin miners also operate the large-scale power generation facilities needed to support their data center operations. Bitfarms has 240 megawatts of power generation planned, and this past August the company announced the start of a 50 megawatt deployment plan, located in Paraguay, for the generation of hydroelectric power. The plan is the first phase from a set of contracts totaling 150 megawatts in hydropower development. The current phase is located near Bitfarms\u2019 existing Paraguay facility, and is expected to go online in 1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Bitfarms is expanding its Argentina operations. The company added 3,150 modern mining rigs to its Rio Cuarto facility, and has planned deliveries for another 1,068 rigs, scheduled for installation this month.\n\nBitfarms\u2019 activity to expand its power generation and farming network is bringing results. The company\u2019s 2Q23 financial report showed that the company mined 1,223 bitcoins during the quarter, and its hashrate, as of June 30, was up 10% from Q1 and stood at 5.3 EH/s. That hashrate alone shows one measure of the company\u2019s expansion \u2013 two months later, in August, the hashrate was up to 5.6 EH/s. The company has targeted a 7.0 EH/s hashrate for the first quarter of next year.\n\nIn a recent update for August\u2019s production numbers, Bitfarms reported mining 383 bitcoins during the month. This was up from 378 mined in July, although it was down from 534 bitcoins generated in August of last year. The 383 figure was in-line with Bitfarms\u2019 monthly production during the first 8 months of this year \u2013 and the year-to-date total of 3,281 bitcoins is higher than the equivalent figure, 3,252, from last year. Of the bitcoins mined in August, Bitfarms sold off 323, generating $9 million in total proceeds. The remaining 60 bitcoins were added to the company\u2019s treasury, increasing its holding to 654 bitcoins. Bitfarms valued this holding at $17.8 million, based on the August 31 price.\n\nAccording to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Josh Siegler, Bitfarms has plenty of strength as it heads into next year, which investors might be overlooking right now. He writes, \u201cWe continue to believe the Bitfarms story may be under-appreciated by investors. The company has demonstrated substantial progress in establishing a clear line-of-sight for near-term growth and improving its cash expenses, in our view. With a strong balance sheet and higher visibility to energizing Argentina, we believe BITF may be unfairly receiving a discount on its valuation relative to peers. If Bitfarms achieves its near-term hash target \u2026 while demonstrating improved free cash flow and unit economics, we believe there may be significant upside to the stock price.\u201d\n\nSignificant upside, indeed. Along with an Overweight (Buy) rating on the shares, Seigler\u2019s $3 price target implies a robust upside potential of 168% for the next 12 months. (To watch Siegler\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nThe Street would appear to be in agreement, as all 3 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently priced at $1.12, and the average price target of $3.67 is even more bullish than Siegler\u2019s, indicating potential for a 228% gain over the coming year. (See Bitfarms\u2019 stock forecast.)\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR)\n\nNext up is Cipher Mining, another growing concern in the bitcoin mining industry. Cipher is a US-based firm currently in the process of building out its primary mining facility, in Odessa, Texas, which came online in November of last year. The facility is scheduled to reach completion before the end of this quarter, which will bring Cipher\u2019s total bitcoin mining hashrate to 7.2 EH/s. The company reported a total hashrate of 6.8 EH/s as of the end of 2Q23.\n\nCipher has two additional mining facilities, both wind-powered, located in Alborz, Texas and Bear and Chief, Texas. These sites can operate at 40 and 20 megawatts respectively. Among its three active sites, the company has 68,000 miners deployed, and at the end of August this year had a potential capacity to mine as many as 16.1 bitcoins per day.\n\nIn the firm\u2019s most recent production update, for August of this year, Cipher reported mining a total of 357 bitcoins. This was down 15% month-over-month, and after sales of 355 bitcoin, the company had an account balance of 519 bitcoin available. At an estimated price of $27,000 per bitcoin, this holding is worth over $14 million. Cipher management reports that the company is on track to meet its current expansion and production goals.\n\nWhile Cipher\u2019s core business is bitcoin mining, the company is also building out its power generation capacity \u2013 and that has caught the attention of BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis. He sees the company\u2019s potential as a net-seller of electricity as a clear benefit, complementing the firm\u2019s success at entering low-cost power contracts, and writes, \u201cThe company has a very low-cost fixed-price power purchase agreement at ~$0.027/kWh (expires 2027) with the ability to opportunistically sell electricity back to the grid. Cipher has one of the lowest cost structures in the BTC mining industry creating attractive unit economics allowing the business to operate through the cycle. In the near term, Cipher\u2019s core business should remain BTC mining, but longer term we see the opportunity to become a more integrated player in the energy-generation space.\u201d\n\nTaking this forward, Lewis puts a Buy rating on CIFR, and his $6 price target points toward a potential one-year gain of 124% for the stock. (To watch Lewis\u2019 track record, click here.)\n\nThe analyst consensus view on Cipher is unanimous, a Strong Buy based on 6 positive ratings set over the past 3 months. The stock has a $5.25 average price target, suggesting a 96% increase from the current share price of $2.68.

        "content": "Maracay (Venezuela) (AFP) \u2013 Bitcoin mining machines and rocket launchers were among the astonishing contraband found in a Venezuelan prison recaptured from a gang that had turned it into a playground kitted out with a pool, a nightclub and a zoo.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nVenezuelan authorities showed off the loot on Thursday after seizing control of the Tocoron prison in a massive operation involving more than 11,000 police and soldiers backed up by tanks and armored vehicles.\n\nOne soldier was killed in the operation, which had been planned for more than a year, said Interior and Justice Minister Remigio Ceballos.\n\nThe facility hit in Wednesday's raid had served as the headquarters of the Tren de Aragua gang that operates in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.\n\nCeballos said sniper rifles, explosives, rocket launchers and grenades were seized, along with cocaine, marijuana and expensive motorbikes.\n\nThe wives or girlfriends of inmates who had been living inside with them were kicked out.\n\nAt a press conference outside the prison, authorities displayed buckets of bullets, heaps of machine gun ammunition belts and machines used to mine the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nOn Wednesday, AFP saw officers carrying televisions, microwaves and air conditioners out of the jail as angry women outside shouted, \"That's ours!\".\n\nCeballos said zoo animals kept at the facility died in a fire started by prisoners.

        "title": "There Are Only Six Bitcoin Billionaires in the Whole World. Is Crypto Becoming Irrelevant? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A recent report from Henley Global into crypto wealth showed that there are only six Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires in the world. That's just six people who hold over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin on the entire planet. When you think about the amount of hype around crypto, six Bitcoin billionaires really isn't a lot.\n\nThe report also says that the total value of the cryptocurrency market is $1.2 trillion. That's a drop in the ocean when you compare it with other assets. For example, the World Gold Council puts the market cap of the gold market at around $12 trillion. Last year, State Street Global Advisors said the total value of all investable assets was a whopping $179.0 trillion.\n\nSome might argue those figures show the huge potential of crypto -- right now, it accounts for less than 1% of the total investable assets. Just imagine what might happen if it could take even a slightly bigger chunk of that pie. But the opposite could also be true. Perhaps crypto just isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin billionaire?\n\nThere are different ways you can define a Bitcoin billionaire. The report looks at people who own a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin. But at one point in 2021, the same label was used for people who made their billions in crypto. The study, which also counts a total of 22 crypto billionaires globally, doesn't say how any of them came by their wealth.\n\nIt's certainly true that the net worth of several of the high profile crypto billionaires has significantly diminished since the crypto frenzy we saw a few years ago. In 2022, Forbes said there were 19 billionaires who'd made their money through crypto. That included Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since fallen from both rich lists and popular favor faster than an ice cream melts on a sunny day.\n\nIndeed, according to Forbes, this year, 10 of the 19 are no longer billionaires. And their collective wealth has fallen from $140 billion to $30 billion. That $110 billion drop is partly a reflection of the drop in crypto's value. It's also due to the collapse of several crypto platforms, including Bankman-Fried's empire. Bitcoin has mostly hovered between around $20,000 and $30,000 this year -- significantly down on its high of around $67,000 in November 2021.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nIs crypto becoming irrelevant?\n\nIt is interesting to look at crypto billionaires. But, for the most part, they can handle losing money on a risky asset like cryptocurrency. It's the ordinary investors like you and me who may not be able to stomach the losses. Given that Henley & Partners report puts the number of crypto users at 425 million, that's a lot of people who could take a significant financial hit if crypto collapses.\n\nThe dramatic drop in crypto prices and collapse of several crypto platforms has been accompanied by a significant decline in both consumer interest and confidence. Many investors who had money on now-defunct platforms now await the outcome of what could be lengthy bankruptcy proceedings to see if they will get their money back.\n\nAs an investor, the current crisis of confidence is one thing. The bigger question is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could perform well in the long term. And, given that cryptocurrencies are extremely risky, the related question is whether there are other, safer, assets that could perform as well or better over time.\n\nFor cryptocurrency to stay relevant and reach its potential, it needs to overcome a number of challenges. Putting aside the regulatory and confidence issues, there's still a long way to go with the actual nuts and bolts of crypto. For example, if it's to become more widely adopted, crypto needs to be as easy to use as email or online banking. It needs to become more widely accepted as a payment method. There are also issues of scalability, congestion, and network fees to address.\n\nThere are many different investment opportunities\n\nI hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and I plan to hold them for the long term. Bitcoin could have significant potential as a digital currency, particularly when it comes to global settlements. I also think smart contract cryptocurrencies could be transformative in a number of ways. However, there are no guarantees and it is still early days. Even if the cryptocurrency industry as a whole succeeds, the coins and tokens that are popular right now may not.\n\nUnless you're a billionaire with money to burn, the biggest takeaway is this: Don't count on crypto to make you wealthy. It can play a part in a wider portfolio, but only a small part. If you want to build up a nest egg for your old age, consider opening a brokerage account. Making consistent investments over time into a balanced portfolio that contains a mix of assets is a proven way to build wealth.

U.S. stock futures were trading flat during opening hours in Asia after all three major U.S. indexes logged losses of over 1.0% Thursday.\n\nCryptos drop as US bond yields soar\n\nBitcoin fell 2.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,580.90 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,389.30 on Thursday night, its lowest level in a week.\n\nAfter deciding to keep interest rates unchanged in September as expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve projected one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. While it lowered its prediction for the pace of interest rate cuts in 2024, comments from Fed members were \u201cmore hawkish\u201d than analysts expected.\n\n\u201cThe drop in most tokens this morning could reflect the cautious stance of investors, who are carefully digesting the implications of the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate remarks,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure platform Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the surge in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to 16-year highs could have played a role in reshaping market dynamics,\u201d Stefanidis added.\n\nFollowing the Fed meeting Wednesday, benchmark 10-year U.S. treasury yields rose to a 16-year high of 4.49% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cU.S. equity and rates markets have broken some very key levels on the back of this (Fed projection), and reflexivity can take over with the bearish thesis from here,\u201d said digital asset trading firm QCP Capital in a Thursday Telegram market update.\n\nThe drop in equity markets and rising treasury yields \u201ccould seep into crypto markets and take BTC lower with it, albeit with a lower beta as compared to other very stretched macro markets like the NASDAQ,\u201d said QCP Capital.\n\nDespite macro pressures, Bitcoin can receive some support from the multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications ongoing in the U.S., said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, which we believe is a 70% probability over the next six months, then there could be an immediate re-pricing and Bitcoin could be +20% more expensive in an instant. Hence, it is essential to keep upside exposure to such an event,\u201d Thielen said in an emailed comment.\n\nEther fell 2.35% to US$1,585.53 and was trading 2.66% lower for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since last Thursday.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers, falling 3.73% to US$19.54. But it still posted a weekly gain of 3.35%\n\nMeanwhile, the collapsed Tokyo-based crypto exchange Mt. Gox delayed the deadline to repay its customers from October 2023 to October 2024, according to an announcement by Mt. Gox trustees on Thursday.\n\nAround 850,000 Bitcoins (worth about US$22.57 billion at the current price) were stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014, which was then the largest crypto exchange in the world. The crypto exchange currently holds about 142,000 Bitcoins. Analysts expect the return of the lost Bitcoin to Mt. Gox customers will exert selling pressure on the wider Bitcoin market.\n\n\u201c(Mt. Gox\u2019s delay) alleviates \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a wave of selling that many traders must have been prepping for and that can now be ignored,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nElsewhere, Tether Holdings, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, expanded its USDT lending services during the latest financial quarter, less than one year after saying it would phase out the practice.\n\n\u201cMost investors and holders would see that as additional risk, as it means more assets will be used by third parties and, if market conditions were to turn for the worse, could pose liquidity issues,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nUSDT traded at US$1.0001 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, slightly higher than its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. The valuation suggests \u201cinvestors are not worried and actually prefer it to most other stablecoin options,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.67% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume jumped 158.64% to US$72.41 billion.\n\nNo sign of US economic slowdown; BOJ maintains monetary easing\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite leading the losers with a 1.82% slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also booked losses of over 1%.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all booked losses. The Kospi led the losers with a 0.92% drop, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite posted a marginal gain of 0.05%\n\nThe drop in equity markets followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish tone on monetary policies at its September meeting Wednesday. Fed members projected the interest rate to reach 5.6% by the end of 2023, indicating another 25-basis-point rate hike to come within the year. The Fed also raised the projected median interest rate by the end of 2024 from 4.6% to 5.1% in a sign it intends to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Fed may need to further raise the interest rate \u201cto make sure that core inflation especially continues to come down at an appropriate pace so the committee can get back to 2% inflation in a reasonable time frame,\u201d Former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe prospects for a soft landing are very good, but you haven\u2019t landed until you get inflation back to 2%,\u201d said Bullard. The U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) for August rose 4.3% year-on-year, the smallest increase in almost two years.\n\nOn the economic data front, the initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped to 201,000 in the week ending Sept. 16. The figure is lower than the analyst expectation of 225,000 and marks the lowest level since January. The data could add to the Fed hawkishness regarding monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThis economy is just not showing any sign of slowing down which hints that inflation will not be coming back down to target,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York, told Reuters on Friday. \u201cThe Fed was wise to keep another interest rate hike in their back pockets just in case, and it now looks like another rate hike is warranted.\u201d\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 73.8% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 71.6% on Thursday. It also gives a 54.8% chance of another pause in December, up from 53.4% on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Russia issued a temporary ban on diesel and gasoline exports on Thursday with an unspecified end date. The announcement triggered a jump in diesel prices in Europe.\n\n\u201cDespite this being only a temporary ban, the impact is significant as Russia remains a key diesel exporter to global markets,\u201d Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets at global consultancy group Wood Mackenzie Ltd., told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe global refining system will struggle to replace those lost Russian volumes at a time when global diesel inventories are already at low levels,\u201d Gelder added.\n\nIn Japan, the country\u2019s central bank announced its own decision on interest rates Friday. The Bank of Japan will maintain its ultra loose monetary policy. That includes a short-term interest rate target of -0.1% and an effective cap of 1.0% on 10-year bond yields.\n\n(Updates with equity section, Stefanidis\u2019 comment)"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies\n\nWith recent developments in the regulatory, legal, and compliance landscape surrounding Bitcoin and a spot Bitcoin ETF (i.e., an ETF backed by physical Bitcoins. If the value of the digital coins backing the ETF rises, the value of the investment will generally be expected to increase), some investment advisers may be considering how to potentially integrate Bitcoin (and/or other types of cryptocurrencies) into client portfolios. This Alert is intended to provide an update on the regulatory landscape and inform advisers how to fulfill their compliance and fiduciary obligations should they determine to integrate Bitcoin (specifically, the current GBTC (see below) and/or anticipated ETFs that will invest in Bitcoin or other types of cryptocurrencies) into client portfolios or assist a client with a requested purchase thereof. Please Note: This Alert is not, and does not serve as, an endorsement of Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency. Advisers must separately educate their investment professionals and clients about cryptocurrencies prior to integrating crypto into client portfolios or assisting with a client directed purchase.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin is considered to be speculative. The SEC has been aggressively reviewing cryptocurrency investments during examinations. Depending upon the scope of an adviser\u2019s assistance with/use of crypto (employing same as a courtesy/client directed accommodation vs. utilizing same as an asset class in client portfolios) both applicable clear and conspicuous ADV disclosure, and a separate Acknowledgment executed by the client, are strongly encouraged-we continue to assist our clients with such disclosures/acknowledgements.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of Grayscale Investments in Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC for denying the company\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Court\u2019s ruling vacated an order by the SEC denying Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application and requires the SEC to consider the application anew.\n\nThe ruling could have far-reaching implications for other spot Bitcoin ETF applications. As of August 30, 2023, the SEC is considering 14 spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including applications from financial behemoths like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco, to name a few. Analysts have predicted that odds of spot Bitcoin ETF approval are 75% in 2023 and 95% in 2024. With the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, investment advisers could determine to consider adding a Bitcoin ETF to client portfolios. However, doing so comes with compliance implications, and it is critical for advisers to conduct appropriate due diligence to confirm that such integration is reasonable and suitable for clients.\n\nCompliance Program\n\nInvestment advisers registered at the federal and state level are required to maintain a robust compliance program. Advisers who want to integrate a Bitcoin (or other type of crypto) ETF should update their policies and procedures to address the unique risks and challenges that Bitcoin presents, including:\n\nSuitability \u2013 prior to proactively (vs. only per client request/direction) purchasing a Bitcoin ETF for clients, advisers should confirm that these assets are suitable for the client. Bitcoin is historically (and notoriously) volatile, and advisers should assess whether an investment in Bitcoin (or any other type of cryptocurrency) is consistent with a client\u2019s suitability, long-term objectives, and risk tolerance.\n\n\u2013 prior to proactively (vs. only per client request/direction) purchasing a Bitcoin ETF for clients, advisers should confirm that these assets are suitable for the client. Bitcoin is historically (and notoriously) volatile, and advisers should assess whether an investment in Bitcoin (or any other type of cryptocurrency) is consistent with a client\u2019s suitability, long-term objectives, and risk tolerance. Disclosures and Acknowledgements \u2013 advisers should request that clients execute an Acknowledgement which, among other disclosures, makes clear that cryptocurrencies are considered to be speculative investment, and that unlike conventional currencies issued by a monetary authority, currently, cryptocurrencies are generally not controlled or regulated, and their price is determined by the supply and demand of their market. Additionally, those advisers who are considering proactively incorporating crypto into client portfolios should amend their Brochure (i.e., Form ADV Part 2A) to include language that similarly describes the risks associated with Bitcoin and how the adviser can integrate crypto into a client\u2019s portfolio (i.e., on a discretionary/non-discretionary basis, or at specific client direction). Stark & Stark can assist with preparing the acknowledgement and appropriate ADV disclosure language.\n\nFiduciary Duty\n\nRegistered investment advisers are fiduciaries and are required to act in the best interests of their clients. As such, comes the responsibility to:\n\nConduct thorough due diligence, including understanding bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics, its correlation with other assets, and the technology behind it;\n\nEducate clients so that they can better understand both the risks and potential rewards of investing in Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrencies); and,\n\nDisclose the fees associated with such an investment (i.e., both the underlying investment\u2019s fees and the adviser\u2019s fee).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling on Grayscale\u2019s spot ETF application, and the SEC\u2019s currently anticipated approval of a spot ETF, reflects Bitcoin\u2019s growing legitimacy as an asset (however, as indicated above, this Alert is not, and should not be construed in any manner whatsoever as, an endorsement of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency investment). However, integrating Bitcoin into client portfolios comes with compliance obligations. By adhering to a robust compliance framework, keeping abreast of regulatory changes, and educating themselves and clients on the both the risks and benefits of Bitcoin, advisers can seek to harness the potential of Bitcoin while fulfilling their fiduciary and compliance obligations."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Resilience in the Face of Challenges: Lessons from Recent Events - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency sector is sometimes fraught with upheaval, yet maybe no digital asset exemplifies resilience more than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has encountered various hurdles throughout its existence, ranging from regulatory scrutiny to market crashes, yet it has continually survived these storms and emerged stronger. In this article, we look at recent events that put Bitcoin to the test and extract useful lessons for investors, enthusiasts, and the broader financial industry.\n\nA Brief History of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, created in 2008 in a whitepaper by an unnamed entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, was launched to the world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Many people were captivated by its revolutionary use of blockchain technology and the promise of a borderless, censorship-resistant, and decentralized money.\n\nBitcoin's price has fluctuated dramatically throughout the years, owing to market sentiment, technological advancements, and macroeconomic considerations. It has gone through several market cycles, each with its own set of obstacles and possibilities.\n\nRecent Events Put Resilience to the Test\n\nRegulatory Difficulties\n\nGovernments and regulatory agencies around the world have been debating how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies in recent years. Increased inspection was prompted by concerns about money laundering, fraud, and consumer protection. Because Bitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, it has found itself at the center of these debates.\n\nLearning Experience\n\nBitcoin's decentralized nature and broad user base have made it resistant to regulatory scrutiny. The lessons presented center on the significance of compliance, openness, and interaction with regulatory bodies. Long-term sustainability requires collaboration between the cryptocurrency sector and policymakers.\n\nVolatility and Market Corrections\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has seen tremendous swings, with high volatility becoming a defining feature. Market corrections, in which prices fall after making significant advances, have occurred several times. These occurrences can upset investor confidence and put long-term investors to the test.\n\nLesson Learned\n\nBitcoin's resiliency in the face of volatility emphasizes the significance of maintaining a long-term view. Investors who survived previous price declines frequently benefited from later price recovery. Risk management and diversification are critical techniques for handling the price volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nSecurity Breach\n\nWhile Bitcoin's blockchain technology is extremely secure, third-party services such as exchanges and wallets have been subject to security breaches and hacks. Large amounts of Bitcoin have been stolen as a result of these instances.\n\nProtecting Bitcoin holdings necessitates a proactive approach to security. It is critical to use secure wallets, hardware wallets, and follow best practices for protecting private keys. It is also critical to exercise caution while selecting cryptocurrency service providers.\n\nMacro Events and Economic Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin has acquired popularity as a digital gold store, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. Events like as the COVID-19 epidemic and inflation fears have added to Bitcoin's allure as a hedge against traditional financial insecurity.\n\nLesson Learned: Bitcoin's resiliency in the face of macroeconomic events highlights the currency's potential position in diversified investment portfolios. While its connection with traditional assets is still being debated, its lack of correlation during crises shows its significance as a potential hedge.\n\nTechnological Advancements\n\nThe underlying technology of Bitcoin has evolved over time. Scalability difficulties have been addressed by innovations such as the Lightning Network, which has improved transaction efficiency. These advancements demonstrate Bitcoin's versatility and dedication to continuous progress.\n\nThe willingness of Bitcoin to adapt and embrace technological innovations is critical to its continued relevance. To address scalability, security, and usability issues, the cryptocurrency sector must stay agile and responsive.\n\nGrowing Institutional Interest\n\nInstitutional investors and corporations are beginning to see Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Companies such as Tesla and Square have devoted considerable amounts of their treasuries to Bitcoin, indicating the currency's rising acceptance in mainstream banking.\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin by institutions demonstrates its development as an asset. Institutional participation can help to stabilize and liquidate the market. Investors should keep an eye on institutional developments because they have the potential to greatly influence Bitcoin's direction.\n\nWhy Decentralization Matters: Crypto Companies Consider Leaving the US Amid Regulatory Crackdown\n\nIn response to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the United States, particularly on cryptocurrency exchanges, many American crypto companies are exploring international expansion or even relocating their operations abroad. This shift comes as the U.S. has become one of the most stringent cryptocurrency regulators globally, with several recent enforcement actions by the SEC and other agencies.\n\n6 key points on this evolving landscape:\n\nRegulatory crackdown: Recent law enforcement actions and regulatory crackdowns have made the U.S. a challenging environment for crypto companies. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it marketed securities without proper registration. Binance, an international crypto exchange, was also sued by the SEC, leading to its founder being banned from the U.S. securities market. Changing industry sentiment: The crypto industry, once seen as a decentralized system beyond government control, has increasingly sought legitimacy through cooperation with regulators. However, these efforts have often failed to meet regulators' expectations. International expansion: Many American crypto firms are considering expanding into international markets or relocating entirely. Locations such as the Cayman Islands, London, Bermuda, Hong Kong, and Dubai are being explored. Mining companies flocking to the U.S.: In contrast, companies specializing in Bitcoin mining, which requires significant energy resources, are attracted to the U.S. due to its access to cheap electricity. Ongoing tensions and Coinbase\u2019s role: Tensions between the crypto industry and U.S. regulators have been escalating since Gary Gensler, a crypto critic, became SEC Chairman. Disagreements over classifying cryptocurrencies as securities and disclosure requirements have fueled this tension. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto company, has been at the center of the regulatory debate. Despite its efforts to cooperate with regulators, it has repeatedly faced challenges from federal regulators. Coinbase has started expanding its international presence, opening an exchange in Bermuda. This move allows foreign users to engage in high-risk trades prohibited in the U.S. Startup opportunity: Smaller crypto startups find international relocation more appealing, offering flexibility and a potentially friendlier regulatory environment.\n\nWhile the crypto industry continues to navigate regulatory challenges, it remains to be seen how companies will balance their global ambitions with the evolving regulatory landscape in the United States.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\n\nThe energy usage and carbon footprint of Bitcoin have been debated and criticized. Concerns about its environmental impact have sparked debate over the long-term viability of its mining operations.\n\nThe response of Bitcoin to environmental concerns will be critical to its long-term existence. These concerns can be addressed through innovations in energy-efficient mining and increased utilization of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin's future depends on sustainability and responsible mining operations.\n\nBitcoin's Future: A Resilient Journey Continues\n\nBitcoin's tenacity in the face of a slew of problems indicates both its continuing popularity and the strength of decentralized digital assets. While it may encounter new challenges in the future, the lessons acquired from its previous experiences can help investors and the greater cryptocurrency sector.\n\nAs Bitcoin progresses, it will very certainly remain a symbol of innovation, decentralization, and financial sovereignty. Its tenacity in the face of hardship demonstrates the power of blockchain technology and decentralized currencies to reshape the financial world. As they negotiate the ever-changing world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, investors and fans alike must be cautious, adaptive, and knowledgeable."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin with Venmo - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Venmo, a versatile financial application, provides a range of features, including peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers and cryptocurrency transactions. Serving as a comprehensive financial tool, Venmo enables users to seamlessly handle transactions, including the option to participate in digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The app is designed to simplify financial operations and assist users in navigating contemporary economic systems.\n\nWhat is Venmo?\n\nVenmo, a mobile payment service established in 2009, has been under PayPal\u2019s ownership since 2013. It operates as a P2P platform for money transfers within the United States. The social payment app facilitates money exchanges between users and businesses. Additionally, it functions as a digital wallet that enables individuals to accumulate funds within their Venmo accounts for future expenses.\n\nVenmo also extends its capabilities by integrating cryptocurrency transactions, enabling users to buy, sell and hold digital assets within the app. Following a similar initiative by its parent company, PayPal, this feature was introduced in April 2021. Venmo users in the U.S., excluding Hawaii, can engage with four cryptocurrencies: BTC, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the future, Venmo has plans to incorporate the PayPal USD stablecoin (PYUSD).\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Venmo\n\nTo purchase Bitcoin with Venmo, users can use their Venmo balance, bank account or debit card, among other payment methods. However, it\u2019s important to recall that credit cards and Venmo Credit Cards cannot be used to complete these transactions. Moreover, users are restricted from making crypto purchases through Venmo. Users are limited to a weekly cap of $20,000 and a yearly cap of $50,000 in crypto acquisitions.\n\nSince cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, buying them involves exchanging one currency for another. The exchange rate determines the amount of Bitcoin users receive in exchange for U.S. dollars. Keep in mind that cryptocurrency values are highly volatile and change frequently.\n\nSteps to buying Bitcoin through Venmo\n\nOpen the Venmo app and navigate to the \u201cCrypto\u201d tab at the bottom of the menu.\n\nSelect \u201cBitcoin (BTC)\u201d from the list of cryptocurrencies. The current exchange price of Bitcoin is also available on the page.\n\nClick \u201cBuy\u201d at the bottom of the page.\n\nEnter the dollar amount to buy in BTC and tap the \u201cReview\u201d button. This step confirms purchase details, such as bank account, exchange rate and transaction fee, before finalizing the transaction.\n\nThe app will provide a breakdown of the amount of Bitcoin to be purchased, along with any associated fees.\n\nOnce satisfied with the details, tap the \u201cBuy\u201d button to complete the Bitcoin purchase through Venmo.\n\nAfter completing a purchase, crypto acquired through Venmo becomes irreversible. This implies that users have to sell their digital currencies to regain U.S. dollars. It\u2019s also important to note that Venmo does not provide compensation to users for any losses caused by price fluctuations.\n\nAfter successfully purchasing Bitcoin through the Venmo app, users can conveniently track its price fluctuations within the app itself. The app also provides historical price data for the selected cryptocurrency, including past transactions involving that digital asset.\n\nSteps to track the current market price of Bitcoin in Venmo\n\nIn Venmo, the current price of Bitcoin can be tracked using following steps:\n\nVenmo\u2019s app is equipped to monitor cryptocurrency prices in real-time, with updates occurring every few seconds. By default, it uses a line graph to show price movements over a 24-hour period. The time frame for price changes can be switched to one week, one month, six months, a year or the entire lifespan of the cryptocurrency selected. Tapping on the timeline graph provides more specific values over time.\n\nVenmo fees for purchasing Bitcoin\n\nAcquiring cryptocurrencies through Venmo involves fees based on the purchase\u2019s size, with transparent fee disclosure during transactions. These fees consist of the spread between the market price from Venmo\u2019s trading service provider, Paxos, and the USD-to-crypto exchange rate, along with a transaction fee associated with buying crypto assets. Venmo discloses both rates during crypto transactions, with an estimated 0.50% spread, subject to market conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that Venmo doesn\u2019t detail the specific spread earned on each transaction. By utilizing Venmo\u2019s crypto services, users agree to cover all relevant exchange rates, including the spread and the associated fees.\n\nAdditionally, if a linked bank account or debit card is used as the funding source for purchasing crypto assets, additional bank fees, such as overdraft charges, may be imposed. Venmo doesn\u2019t bear responsibility for bank-imposed fees, so it\u2019s important to understand a bank\u2019s fee policies when using these funding sources for crypto transactions.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin with Venmo?\n\nTo buy Bitcoin with Venmo, the app needs to be accessed, and specific user criteria must be met:\n\nAge requirement: Users must be at least 18 years old.\n\nLocation: Cryptocurrency services are accessible to users physically present within the U.S., except for Hawaii.\n\nPayment methods: Either a Venmo balance, bank account or debit card is needed.\n\nUnique cell phone number: Users need a unique U.S. cell phone number not associated with another Venmo account.\n\nAnyone who fulfills these prerequisites is eligible to create a Venmo account and can proceed with acquiring Bitcoin. To access cryptocurrency transaction services on Venmo, a user\u2019s identity must be verified. This verification process includes providing essential information such as a Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Furthermore, these services are exclusively accessible for personal Venmo profiles and are not supported for business or charity profiles.\n\nPrice Alerts in Venmo\n\nTo stay informed about Bitcoin market movements, Venmo\u2019s Crypto Price Alerts can assist in monitoring and responding to crypto price fluctuations, assisting in making timely and informed decisions in this dynamic financial landscape. When activating crypto price alerts, push notifications will be sent when the chosen cryptocurrency\u2019s price experiences a daily percentage change.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to rely solely on them for cryptocurrency-related decisions. Crypto price alerts may experience delays or disruptions due to market conditions and data interruptions. Thus, verifying any information received through a price alert before making decisions is advisable.\n\nTo set up Bitcoin price alerts in Venmo:\n\nNavigate to the \u201cCrypto\u201d tab.\n\nSelect \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\n\nActivate price alerts using the Price Alerts toggle.\n\nOnce activated, specify the desired percentage for price fluctuations, which can be adjusted as necessary.\n\nIf identity verification with Venmo is already complete and an account is configured for cryptocurrency activities, it\u2019ll be possible to subscribe to price alerts while purchasing Bitcoin.\n\nSecurity and safety measures in Venmo\n\nVenmo employs data encryption technology to safeguard users from unauthorized transactions, ensuring user information is securely stored on protected servers. The mobile payment service also allows users to log out of their Venmo accounts on lost or stolen phones, set up personal identification numbers (PINs) for mobile applications, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\nDespite Venmo\u2019s security protocols, users should be aware of potential risks, including scams and fraud by cybercriminals. Although the source of these risks might not be attributed to the payment application itself, the resulting implications may directly impact Venmo users. It\u2019s crucial never to share login details, use strong passwords, set accounts to private, and transact only with trusted individuals and businesses.\n\nAccording to research findings, Venmo publicly reveals all peer-to-peer transactions by default, with the exception of the transaction amount, which could possibly disclose sensitive user information in certain instances. In 2018, the company reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to address multiple privacy and security concerns related to this and other aspects, leading to corresponding setting adjustments. Nevertheless, Venmo remained under scrutiny for potentially exposing users to privacy vulnerabilities.\n\nDrawbacks to buying Bitcoin with Venmo\n\nBuying Bitcoin through Venmo presents certain drawbacks to consider. Firstly, Venmo\u2019s Purchase Protection doesn\u2019t extend to cryptocurrency purchases, leaving users vulnerable to losses stemming from cryptocurrency price fluctuations. While unauthorized activity is safeguarded, Bitcoin transactions on Venmo are irreversible, underscoring the need for thorough research and cautious decision-making.\n\nUnlike traditional banks, Venmo\u2019s Bitcoin and investment balances lack protection by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Securities Investor Protection Corporation\n\n(SIPC) or any other public or private insurance. Consequently, funds held within the app are not protected as they would be in a bank account, making Venmo an insecure choice for storing substantial cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nAdditionally, any currency or asset acquired on Venmo remains limited to the platform, making it impossible to transfer crypto to other platforms or personal accounts. This limitation can be restrictive for those who prefer to hold their coins in digital wallets or explore different trading options."

        "content": "A Swiss non-profit working on the world\u2019s first zero-knowledge light client for Bitcoin, has reached a major milestone towards bringing zero-knowledge proofs to the most valuable crypto network.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s verifier for the Bitcoin network\u2019s block headers makes it possible to build a zk proof-based light client for the network, the first step in a roadmap of permissionless innovation, according project lead Robin Linus.\n\nIn the near term, a light client might let you run a Bitcoin full node on, say, a mobile phone. But that roadmap includes a second-layer protocol on top of Bitcoin, that can bring tokens \u2014 such as stablecoins \u2014 to the Bitcoin network, along with a 20 to 50 times throughput increase, without requiring any sort of fork.\n\n\u201cWhat is cool about that solution is that, first of all, you can process about 100 transactions on the base layer,\u201d Linus told Blockworks. \u201cAnd in addition to that, we also get perfect privacy \u2014 you can encrypt both the transaction amounts and the transaction graphs, and then you basically get best-in-class privacy, comparable to Zcash.\u201d\n\nThe privacy benefit is essentially a byproduct of the protocol\u2019s use of STARKs, the proving system invented by StarkWare, not a deliberate design choice.\n\nZeroSync received a grant from Geometry Research in 2022, one from StarkWare earlier this year, and has since formed the foundation. The group\u2019s work is the first effort to use StarkWare\u2019s Cairo programming language outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA soft fork would be required to enable trustless bitcoin bridging on the layer-2 network that ZeroSync envisions. Yet even without that, the network can permissionlessly support useful features, such as token transfers where the fees are paid in a stablecoins, removing the need for bitcoin (BTC) to pay for transactions.\n\nBitcoin is resistant to change by design, requiring consensus from Core developers, and near-consensus from full node operators, including miners. The prior soft fork in 2021, called Taproot, was years in the making and only activated after more than 90% of node operators signaled their assent.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be hard to change so that it can be hard money, but some changes are necessary,\u201d Linus said. \u201cIt seems to be that there is a consensus that at some point we do want to have some kind of [zk proof] verifier on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLinus sees ZeroSync\u2019s role as helping figure out what kind of approach makes the most sense.\n\n\u201cWe try to participate in the community and push that forward,\u201d he noted. \u201cEverything has to be free and open-source, otherwise it will never get into the main layer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the chain state proof they\u2019ve completed won\u2019t require any kind of fork.\n\nWaiting for Bitcoin Simplicity\n\nZk proof technology is still in its infancy. There are many different proof systems available with various different tradeoffs to consider. Those choices have ramifications for virtual machines built on top. Linus recognizes it would be quite hard to reach consensus on just one.\n\nEric Wall, a board member of the StarkNet Foundation, and a bitcoin thought-leader, articulated one of the challenges with Bitcoin\u2019s decision-making process in this area.\n\n\u201cHow is the Bitcoin community ever supposed to reach consensus on enshrining a specific zk-verifying opcode, when the zk community itself is not in any way in consensus on what type of zkVM would be ideal for Bitcoin for the next year, let alone the next 5 or next 100 years?\u201d\n\nFortunately, Linus sees a likely solution coming via the Simplicity programming language, first unveiled by Blockstream about five years ago.\n\nSimplicity, a smart contract language similar to Solidity on Ethereum, has been described as \u201cBitcoin\u2019s last soft fork.\u201d If it is activated, it will \u201cvastly increase the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin,\u201d Linus said.\n\n\u201cWe are already starting to experiment with it because Blockstream just activated it on the Liquid testnet\u2026that will be the first step for us to experiment with a [zk proof] verifier on Bitcoin\u2019s main layer.\u201d\n\nStarkWare\u2019s co-founder, Eli Ben-Sasson, unsurprisingly advocates for the Cairo+STARK stack.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBut Linus said the adoption of Simplicity would allow zk proof teams to sidestep the need to rely exclusively on one proof system or another.\n\n\u201cYou can pretty freely choose what proof system you want to use\u2026it\u2019s a high level language for smart contracting and that allows you to do basically any kind of computation that you can do in regular programming languages,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so there wouldn\u2019t be much drama anymore about the question of which [zk proof] verifier we want to activate \u2014 we would basically just implement what we think is best,\u201d he added.\n\nIf anyone else thinks they have a better proof system, they\u2019re free to implement it, without needing anyone\u2019s permission.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Federal Reserve's hold on the bitcoin price may be back in play following the central bank's latest policy update. Bitcoin's price action was generally unchanged this week, even after the Fed meeting, where the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. The cryptocurrency is currently at the lower end of the tight range it has been stuck at for months between $25,000 and $30,000. However, unlike the March and June rallies that followed oversold conditions, bitcoin has been trading sideways since its last major drop . \"This move in rates is impacting long duration, speculative assets and bitcoin definitely falls into that camp,\" Rob Ginsberg, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC. \"Oversold conditions are a great indicator that you should rebound \u2014 you get concerned when [prices] don't respond.\" BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin has struggled to rebound from its Aug. 17 drop \"[When] rates break out to new cycle highs \u2026 it wouldn't surprise me if we take out [the] $25,000 support level \u2026 and then something starts to break in the system,\" he added. \"That's when the Fed pivots and that's when you see a violent rotation back into risk.\" Last year's crypto winter was unlike others before it in that the Federal Reserve and its inflation fighting rate hiking campaign had perhaps the biggest influence over bitcoin's price action. Bitcoin is now up about 60% in 2023, but the long-anticipated developments in regulation and the bitcoin exchange-traded fund space that were expected to be positive catalysts haven't propelled prices higher. Apathetic investors are on pause as they await next moves from the Fed. If bitcoin breaks above $28,000, it could continue to as high as $32,000 in the short term, Ginsberg said. However, he said it's not very likely as the market's recent deterioration would have to be a head fake. If bitcoin takes out the $25,000 support level, it could fall further still to between $20,000 and $21,000, according to Ginsberg. \"Real rates are moving higher and they're breaking out to cycle highs,\" he said. \"That to me is still the biggest headwind for speculation and crypto in particular. So you need to see that breakeven and work lower to get people to come back into that part of the market.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin blasts past its 2021 all-time high in Argentina, but hyperinflation outpaces gains - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Argentina has grappled with hyperinflation for several decades due to failed policies that have led to budget deficits. As time marches on, the likelihood of Argentina \u2014 home to 47 million people \u2014 facing a full-scale currency collapse looms. But what are the prospects for increased adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), given its outstanding track record when priced in the local Argentine peso currency?\n\nThroughout its history, the Argentine government has frequently resorted to inflating the money supply through bank deposits or government bonds. Notably, Argentina\u2019s aggregate money supply M1 \u2014 comprising currency, demand deposits and other checkable deposits \u2014 has surged from 2.81 trillion pesos in July 2019 to a staggering 10.66 trillion pesos, marking a 277% increase over three years.\n\nWhat happened to Bitcoin\u2019s price in Argentine pesos?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price on domestic exchanges has soared to 19.6 million Argentine pesos, up from 14.2 million when BTC reached its all-time high in United States dollars in November 2021. This means that despite a 61.5% drop from $69,000, investors in Argentina have still managed to accrue gains of 38% when measured in the local currency.\n\nBitcoin price in pesos at Bitso exchange. Source: Bitso\n\nHowever, one may encounter a different result when consulting Google or CoinMarketCap for Bitcoin\u2019s price in pesos. The answer to this discrepancy lies in the official currency rate for the Argentine peso, which is more intricate than most investors are accustomed to.\n\nTo begin with, there is the official rate, known as the \u201cdollar BNA,\u201c set by Argentina\u2019s central bank and used for all government transactions, as well as for imports and exports.\n\nBitcoin price in pesos on Sept. 21. Sources: Google, Ripio, Bitso.\n\nObserve how the Bitcoin price in Argentine pesos, as effectively traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, is nearly double Google\u2019s theoretical price.\n\nThis theoretical price is calculated by multiplying the BTC price on North American exchanges in U.S. dollars by the official Argentine peso rate provided by the local government. This phenomenon is not unique to cryptocurrencies; it also affects other highly liquid international assets, such as stocks, gold and oil futures.\n\nBy artificially strengthening the official rate in favor of the Argentine peso, the government aims to stabilize the economy, reduce capital flight, and curb speculative trading by making it more expensive to purchase foreign currency and store wealth in U.S. dollars. This measure may also increase the cost of imports while boosting exports, with the goal of improving the trade balance.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin soars in Argentina as Javier Milei wins presidential primary\n\nHowever, manipulating the official foreign exchange rate, as seen in Argentina\u2019s case, ultimately contributes to inflation and impedes economic growth. Firstly, it creates incentives for the existence of an unofficial and unregistered market, known as the \u201cdollar blue,\u201d which also fosters illegal activities, undermines financial transparency and discourages foreign investment.\n\nThis leads to varying exchange rates, depending on the market in which the transaction occurs and whether or not it involves the government and official banks.\n\nIs Bitcoin a reliable store of value for investors in Argentina?\n\nAccording to Bitso exchange prices in Argentine pesos, Bitcoin has gained 150% over the two years ending Sept. 21, moving from 7.84 million pesos to 16.6 million pesos. However, the accumulated official inflation rate during this period has exceeded 300%, making it incorrect to claim that Bitcoin has been a dependable store of value.\n\nNotably, those who opted for U.S. dollars, whether in the traditional form or stablecoins, have seen their holdings increase by 297% during the same period, effectively matching the inflation rate. This analysis exclusively compares the two-year period between September 2021 and September 2023.\n\nNonetheless, the outcome is somewhat disappointing for BTC proponents and is likely to favor the adoption of stablecoins in the region.\n\nOn a positive note, investors have had the opportunity to learn about the advantages of self-custody and scarcity, given that the local currency has been decimated by its continuously inflating supply.\n\nIn the end, for Argentinians, as long as the U.S. dollar maintains its purchasing power by keeping pace with local inflation, there is little room for Bitcoin to become the preferred store of value.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Gox\u2019s infamous 2014 security breach \u2014 which lost 850,000 Bitcoin (BTC) of investors\u2019 funds \u2014 resulted in its users embarking on a seemingly never-ending, decade-long pursuit of closure via funds reimbursement.\n\nOver the years, Mt. Gox has repeatedly postponed plans to reimburse the funds that the crypto exchange had barred its users from withdrawing since Feb. 25, 2014.\n\nLatest notice concerning the change of repayment deadlines. Source: Mtgox.com\n\nHowever, with Mt. Gox postponing its repayment deadlines by one more year, from Oct. 31, 2023, to Oct. 31, 2024, the wait for redressal extends into the 11th year for Mt. Gox investors.\n\nMt. Gox 2014: The year of the largest Bitcoin hack (Avg. BTC price $420)\n\nDays after Mt. Gox lost 850,000 BTC in the February 2014 breach, leaked documents revealed that the crypto exchange became insolvent. It read:\n\n\u201cThe cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.\u201d\n\nIt was generally assumed that the fall of Mt. Gox would mean the end for Bitcoin, considering that the exchange managed 70% of the total circulating Bitcoin at the time. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court, Japan, after losing nearly $500,000 in value.\n\nThe exchange was soon hit by numerous lawsuits as investors feared the possibility of Mt. Gox\u2019s intention to return investors\u2019 funds. The sentiment of mistrust grew over the year as Mt. Gox revealed no plans for reimbursement while deleting its website and social media presence.\n\nMt. Gox 2015: Back and forth with Tokyo court (Avg. BTC price $260)\n\nAmid its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in Tokyo District Court, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpel\u00e8s was arrested without charge for 23 days by the Japanese police for allegedly manipulating the computer system to inflate his account. Authorities found it hard to link criminals to crypto crimes due to the lack of cryptocurrency regulations.\n\nOn April 22, 2015, Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, instructed users to file a claim for their missing Bitcoin via mail or a form that could be accessed with a Mt. Gox login and password.\n\nIt was believed that Mt. Gox would return around 20% of the users\u2019 funds, considering the fall in Bitcoin\u2019s market price.\n\nMt. Gox 2016: Investors go through the claim process (Avg. BTC price $620)\n\nMt. Gox revealed that only $91 million in assets were slated to be distributed to claimants. However, not all investors agreed with Mt. Gox\u2019s alleged plans to reimburse a small portion of funds. As a result, the total claims for reimbursement reached $2.4 trillion, even though the loss was around $500,000.\n\nThis was also the year when the idea of storing cryptocurrencies in cold wallets got much-needed attention from the crypto community.\n\nAfter being arrested twice in 2015 under the allegations of embezzlement of $3 million of customers money, Karpel\u00e8s was released from jail on July 13, 2016, after paying a bail bond of nearly $100,000.\n\nMt. Gox 2017: Legal struggles and introduction of Karpeles coin (Avg. BTC price $5,000)\n\nDiscussions around funds reimbursement were overshadowed by the legal proceedings against former Mt. Gox CEO Karpel\u00e8s\u2019 involvement in funds embezzlement.\n\nKarpeles admits operating Willy bot, now called an \"obligation exchange\", but says it was for good of company so not illegal #KarpelesTrial \u2014 Kolin Burges (@The_K_meister) July 11, 2017\n\nDuring the trial, Karpel\u00e8s admitted to operating a so-called \u201cWilly Bot\u201d (obligation exchange). The bot earned its name from Mt. Gox traders concerned about the manipulation of the exchange\u2019s volumes at its peak.\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2017, Karpel\u00e8s introduced his plans to conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) to raise $245 million to \u201crevive\u201d Mt. Gox. However, Karpeles discarded the decision after learning about the legal hurdles around launching an ICO campaign.\n\nMt. Gox 2018: A slow year for creditors (Avg. BTC price $7,000)\n\nFollowing a strong price recovery in 2017, on Aug. 1, 2018, Mt. Gox revised its basic policy for preparing a rehabilitation plan. It read:\n\n\u201cMt. Gox is not capable of returning all BTC deposited by creditors. Accordingly, we consider that all assets of Mt. Gox should be distributed to creditors and not to shareholders.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the exchange believed that most of the assets, including approximately 166,000 BTC and 168,000 of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and other derivatives currently held by Mt. Gox, should be paid to creditors at the time of the first payment.\n\nDespite the ongoing discussion, a resolution was never reached that could satisfy legal and creditors\u2019 requirements.\n\nMt. Gox 2019: Plan extensions and delays (Avg. BTC price $8,000)\n\nThe anticipation around Mt. Gox peaked as a rehabilitation plan was seemingly underway.\n\nMt. Gox extends deadlines for rehabilitation plans. Source: Mt. Gox\n\nHowever, Mt. Gox requested the Tokyo court to extend the deadline for the submission of the rehabilitation plan. On Oct. 25, 2019, the Tokyo District Court issued an order to extend the deadline for a rehabilitation plan from Oct. 28, 2019, to March 31, 2020.\n\nMt. Gox 2020: Plan extensions and delays (Avg. BTC price $11,000)\n\nGoing against the five-year-long trend of delaying reimbursements to users, in early 2020, New York-based private equity firm Fortress offered to buy out creditor claims from Mt. Gox. Had the deal gone through, eligible creditors would have received $1,293 for every Bitcoin they owned on the exchange\u2019s wallet.\n\nBy March, Mt. Gox issued yet another draft rehabilitation plan, which revealed its plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies other than BTC and BCH. However, investors were made to wait much longer after the Tokyo court approved Mt. Gox\u2019s request for another extension, citing \u201cmatters that require closer examination.\u201d\n\nThe court heeded the motion, thereby postponing the Mt. Gox Bitcoin settlement date to Oct. 15, 2020, which was later pushed further into the next year.\n\nMt. Gox 2021: Bitcoin bull run creates hopium (Avg. BTC price $37,000)\n\nOn Oct 20, 2021, Mt. Gox creditors approved a rehabilitation plan to compensate them for billions in lost Bitcoin. According to Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, roughly 99% of the creditors affected by the collapse sided with the latest reimbursement plans.\n\nWith Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $69,000, it was popularly believed that the value held in Mt. Gox\u2019s Bitcoin stash could suffice to reimburse complete losses for the investors.\n\nAmid positive investor sentiment, users awaited further instructions while waiting for the approved plans to unfold.\n\nMt. Gox 2022: Registrations for reimbursement contiues (Avg. BTC price $42,000)\n\nThe enthusiasm from 2021 seeped into 2022 as investors lined up to provide details for registering repayment methods.\n\nMt. Gox shares repayment method plans. Source: Mt. Gox\n\nIt was also rumored that the release of 150,000 BTC could create a \u201cblack swan\u201d event for the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Mt. Gox creditors were given until January 2023 to register and select a repayment method as part of the plan by which they will be compensated for their losses.\n\nRelated: Mt. Gox repayment date looming: Is Bitcoin in trouble?\n\nMt. Gox 2023: The day that never comes (Avg. BTC price $27,000)\n\nThe deadlines for reimbursement registrations got pushed into the future twice in 2023. However, on April 7, Mt. Gox trustee Kobayashi stated that the deadline for creditors to provide their repayment information \u2014 clarification of payee and payment type \u2014 had passed.\n\nTo the creditor\u2019s disappointment, Mt. Gox changed the repayment deadline to October 2024.\n\nMt. Gox has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment about its commitment to reimburse users\u2019 funds. In a Sept. 21 letter, Kobayashi wrote that, with the permission of the Tokyo District Court, he had extended the deadline for the base repayment, the early lump-sum repayment and the intermediate repayment.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018AI has killed the industry\u2019: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change"

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading around $26,500 and did not witness notable gains over the week. Toncoin (TON) was the top performer over the week, up almost 10%. Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, which was developed by the team behind messaging app Telegram. Toncoin was followed by Chainlink\u2019s LINK token, which is up 6% for the week, with most gains happening on Monday following a flurry of announcements on new partnerships with traditional financial institutions."

        "content": "On this week\u2019s episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the real estate markets, highlighting stagnant mortgage demand, attributed to rising rates. With an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate of 7.27%, refinancing and home purchase applications have dropped significantly.\n\nStill, Pechman speculates that house prices might rise if inflation continues to grow. While some sellers may be distressed, real estate, especially urban residential, has historically been a reliable store of value. He concludes by highlighting that other investment options may not provide a safer haven in the current economic climate.\n\nIn the second segment, Pechman discusses Instacart\u2019s initial public offering, which established its valuation at roughly $10 billion, significantly lower than its $39 billion peak valuation. This reflects the challenges faced by venture capitalists in the current economic climate. Pechman suggests a shift in investor metrics, emphasizing the need for a reliable store of value, where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) could play a role.\n\nPechman notes that not all cryptocurrencies seek growth through user bases and fees. Bitcoin can operate as a transparent reserve system for banks and nations, issuing Bitcoin-backed digital assets without requiring a billion users. This shift in perspective highlights the need for a reliable store of value. Unlike precious metals with auditing challenges, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can fill this role regardless of everyday user adoption.\n\nFor additional details and the complete analysis, check out the Cointelegraph YouTube channel."

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners' Digital Power Network Shows Off Industry Consolidation - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Political advocacy group Digital Power Network launches, representing 50% of total US hash rate. A look at consolidation in the mining industry before next halving.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce, a political advocacy group dedicated to Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, has turned heads with an announcement that the members of its new mining-specific group represent more than 50 percent of the entire US Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce has existed since 2014, with its own registered committee able to make contributions to political candidates. Although its existence represented a significant step for the growing relationship between a hostile political establishment and the new economic world of cryptocurrency, its footprint remained relatively small for most of its existence. Campaign disclosures have only recorded $2700 in donations for any Congressional races, in 2017, but in March 2023 they partnered with a Texas Representative to introduce a bill supporting proof-of-work mining.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s work in getting this bill off the ground has apparently been quite useful in building up industry connections, because it made a major splash in late September by announcing the formation of a new working group: the Digital Power Network. With a mission statement of promoting the interests of American miners, the Network plans to partner with legislators to support fair and straightforward regulation over many aspects of the crypto industry. This is all well and good, but this new group has some real heft to back up these goals: its various members collectively represent more than half of the nation\u2019s entire Bitcoin hash rate.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why a group like this is so necessary, according to Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Chamber for Digital Commerce. She said in interviews that \u201cdigital asset mining, at its heart, is both an energy and national security matter, and we firmly believe that Bitcoin will drive policies that unite all political stakeholders to advance this crucial industry in the United States.\u201d The various representatives in the Digital Power Network seem to share her enthusiasm, with Riot Blockchain CEO Jason Les claiming that \u201cat its core, Bitcoin mining converts stranded, low-cost energy into a valuable commodity, which is why our industry has tremendous potential\u201d and Marathon CEO Fred Thiel declaring the group \u201cimportant for ensuring that the perspectives of digital energy stakeholders are considered.\u201d These two firms alone are some of the most productive Bitcoin miners in the United States.\n\nA development like this in the crypto mining world is vitally important not only for the possibilities of the group, but also for the state of the industry that such a group can even exist. Among these companies, one topic has been growing and growing in everyone\u2019s mind: the upcoming Bitcoin halving. A planned occurrence within the Bitcoin blockchain, halvings occur every few years to ensure a stable taper in the supply of available bitcoins, and the next one is coming soon. After some time around April 2024, the same exact amount of work from mining rigs will produce half as much Bitcoin, and it will be up to the miners to figure out how to keep their businesses profitable.\n\nSeveral strategies are immediately apparent for these companies: for one, most obviously, efficient equipment is key. Especially with growing concerns of the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, the halving will make it simply unviable to actually use outdated equipment at large scale. Similarly, firms have been encouraged to diversify investments, build up cash reserves and several other tactics that point to one overall strategy: consolidation of capital. Smaller firms that are unable to remain functional after the halving, to buy new equipment or stay in business without cash flow, will simply be pushed out, and the survivors will have a larger share of the new pie to split amongst themselves.\n\nThis consolidation is already evident from the emergence of the Digital Power Network. Their site lists 11 major players as members of this miner advocacy group, and their consortium represents most of the US Bitcoin mining industry. It is certain that every one of these firms has given a great deal of thought to the upcoming halving, and in all likelihood this group is part of their long-term plans. And even outside of these major players, signs of this increasing consolidation are ubiquitous. For example, Hut 8, a Canadian bitcoin mining company, has received approval from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on September 18th, authorizing them to carry out a merger with US Bitcoin Corp. This new company will be chartered within the United States, and upon incorporation the new \u201cHut 8 Corp\u201d will immediately become one of the largest mining companies in the nation. Hut 8\u2019s stock price went up by 6.5% after gaining this approval, showing off the market\u2019s confidence.\n\nBetween these firms that represent such a large chunk of the Bitcoin mining industry, and new mining giants forming by merger outside of the Digital Power Network, it seems clear that the consolidation of industry is a serious tactic for these companies to survive in a wildly competitive mining ecosystem. With all these giants, after all, how many smaller companies exist to make up the remaining share of the pie? And more to the point, how many of those companies will continue to exist a year from now? The world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is wide in scale and chaotic in temperament; it requires a deft hand to stay afloat. Yet, with moves like these, it seems clear that the miners have full confidence in their abilities to thrive, and this attitude is representative of the whole crypto scene. With an innovative and industrious mindset, Bitcoin has fostered a community of movers and shakers that can propel decentralized currency into the future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "ETFs Can Mitigate Bitcoin Panic - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is a young asset class. Over its brief life span, it\u2019s developed a reputation for sharp price action in both directions. Bitcoin is a case study in that trait.\n\nDramatic, short-term declines by bitcoin have a way of unnerving smaller investors. This is especially so when it puts newly initiated positions at immediate deficits. That underscores the utility of equity-based crypto plays, including the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) .\n\nThose Invesco exchange traded funds could be relevant to smaller investors seeking crypto/bitcoin exposure. This is the case because bitcoin\u2019s recent price action has been weak. Since popping above $30,000 on speculation, regulators could finally approve a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, the largest digital currency has stumbled, recently sliding below $27,000.\n\nBLKC, SATO Could Help New Bitcoin Investors\n\nBLKC, SATO and other equity-based crypto ETFs are not foolproof avenues for accessing digital currencies. In particular, SATO holdings are often highly correlated to bitcoin prices. Still, the ETFs could be safer avenues for short-term holders (STH) seeking crypto exposure.\n\n\u201cSTHs, which correspond to entities holding coins for 155 days or less, have seen their aggregate cost basis fail as market support,\u201d reported William Suberg for Cointelegraph. \u201cAs Glassnode notes, as of Sep. 17, the cost basis for those not spending BTC is now $28,000 \u2014 around 5% above current spot price.\u201d\n\nMany bitcoin newbies aren\u2019t buying significant stakes in the cryptocurrency right off the bat. Their behavior is relevant because data indicates smaller bitcoin investors who see quick profits are apt to add to their positions, while counterparts on the other end of the spectrum become skittish about buying more.\n\n\u201cFrom this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August,\u201d according to Glassnode.\n\nAdditionally, smaller crypto market participants are pertinent in terms of gauging market sentiment. On that note, bitcoin market sentiment is currently dour because so many new entrants are in the red on their positions.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in a negative shift in sentiment, with investors spending now having a lower cost basis than the rest of the cohort. This suggests a degree of panic is dominating this group, which is the first time since FTX collapsed,\u201d added Glassnode."

        "content": "Bitcoin advocate Nic Carter has come out to reiterate his support for the theory that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) had something to do with the creation of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOn Sept. 15, Iris Energy co-founder Daniel Roberts seemingly revived the decade-old theory on X after posting screenshots of a 1996 paper titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\"\n\nThe paper discusses using public-key cryptography to allow users to make anonymous payments without revealing their identity \u2014 referencing a number of academic cryptographers.\n\nThe footer notes show the research paper was \u201cprepared by NSA employees.\u201d Sources included cryptography expert Tatsuaki Okamoto, who later co-invented the Okamoto\u2013Uchiyama public key cryptosystem in 1998.\n\nOn Sept. 21, Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, doubled down his support for the notion, stating, \u201cI actually do believe this,\u201d before adding:\n\n\u201cI call it the \u2018Bitcoin lab leak hypothesis.\u2019 I think it was a shuttered internal R&D project, which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release.\u201d\n\nCarter has actually held the theory for several years, proposing back in 2020: \u201cIf Bitcoin was written by NSA cryptographers as a monetary bioweapon, if you will, and the code escaped those sensitive confines... does that make it a virus... that escaped from a lab?\u201d\n\nIn 2021, he stated, \u201cThe only decent thing the NSA ever did from the world was let bitcoin leak from the lab.\u201d\n\nI actually do believe this. I call it the bitcoin lab leak hypothesis. I think it was a shuttered internal R&D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release https://t.co/qXJkQTciSK \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) September 21, 2023\n\nHowever, he went on to say that this doesn\u2019t imply that the United States government secretly controls all the Bitcoin, another theory that often piggybacks on the Bitcoin/NSA conspiracy theory, which suggests the NSA created a backdoor to the Bitcoin code.\n\n\u201cIn my version of this made-up idea, the researcher did it without permission of the NSA and chose to leave the coins behind so as to preserve his anonymity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of other circumstantial evidence which supports this [theory],\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, some users drew attention to one of the cryptography academics, Tatsuaki Okamoto, listed in the 1996 paper, suggesting the name sounds very similar to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe name could have been used as inspiration for Satoshi. That\u2019s not really a critical part of the theory, though,\u201d Carter said.\n\nRelated: This is how Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned crypto working\n\nMeanwhile, Matthew Pines, director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Krebs Stamos, believes it was most likely a \u201ccross-fertilization of NSA crypto nerds and cypherpunk nerds,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI suspect Satoshi (or at least his/their close intellectual collaborators) has close NSA work associations \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Bitcoin itself or the white paper were officially sanctioned.\u201d\n\nFormer Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal has previously shared his own theory. In an interview with Impact Theory earlier this year, he said:\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. government and the U.K. government invented it... which is the NSA and the GCHQ in the U.K., who are the two world centers of cryptography.\u201d\n\nIn August, Cointelegraph did a deep dive into the conspiracy theory and interviewed former NSA cryptanalyst Jeff Man, who said that, while it was \u201cfeasible\u201d that the NSA could have created Bitcoin as a means to gather intelligence about its enemies, it is highly doubtful.\n\nHowever, Man concluded that even if they did, it is likely we\u2019ll never find out the real story behind the world\u2019s most popular digital asset until it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?\n\nUpdate (Sept. 26, 12:48 am UTC): This article has been updated to reflect that the 1996 paper titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint\" was not the first paper to describe a Bitcoin-like system."

Let\u2019s start at the beginning: (1/25) \ud83e\uddf5#SBF #FTX pic.twitter.com/x5wKvT0Dy2 \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) August 23, 2023\n\nBaradway and Binance.US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBitcoin traders on Binance.US panicked on October 21, 2021, when the cryptocurrency\u2019s price suddenly plummeted from around $65,760 to as low as $8,200 at 11:34 UTC (7:34 a.m. ET), before quickly rebounding. This abrupt drop had no apparent cause, while other bitcoin exchanges continued to operate as usual.\n\nRecent tweets from a former Alameda Research employee suggest that the trading company may be responsible for the turmoil, though the investor\u2019s true identity remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cI had my entire life savings stolen from me by my former boss: Sam Bankman-Fried,\u201d said the ex-employee, Aditya Baradway.\n\nAlthough algorithms conducted the majority of trades at Alameda, Baradwaj noted that traders could occasionally manually place orders during volatile market conditions or to capitalize on opportunities. This manual intervention led to the incident in question.\n\nThe main one was our semi-systematic strategies, where traders set model parameters that control a complex automated trading system. This way, traders aren't placing actual trades, but rather fine-tuning an algorithm that decides how to execute the trades at high frequency. 3/n \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Baradwaj\u2019s tweet, the trader tried to sell a block of BTC in response to the news and sent out the order via our manual trading system. They failed to notice that the decimal point was wrong by a couple of spaces. They sold BTC for pennies as opposed to the going rate on the market.\n\nArbitrage traders promptly noted the mispricing, then returning Bitcoin to its previous values. But Alameda suffered a significant financial loss.\n\nThe result was immediate. The price of BTC shot from a high of $65k to as low as $8k on some venues, only to be quickly restored by arbitrageurs. The sudden price movement lit crypto Twitter on fire as traders scrambled to figure out what was going on: 8/n pic.twitter.com/50YP6PO84J \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nAlameda incurred massive losses, in the tens of millions, due to the sincere fat-finger error. Baradwaj explained that, given its genuine nature, there were limited options other than implementing additional sanity checks for manual transactions.\n\n\u201cBinance US \u2013 which was the epicenter of the flash crash \u2013 released a statement claiming that it had been caused by one of their \u201cinstitutional traders\u201d who had a \u201cbug in their trading algorithm\u201d I guess Caroline had made some phone calls,\u201d admitted Baradway mentioning Bakman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend at the time.\n\nUnlikely Market Crash from FTX Crypto Asset Sales\n\nA prospective liquidation of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings, according to digital asset exchange Coinbase, won\u2019t have a detrimental impact on the market.\n\nThis analysis was conducted in response to widespread concerns that the sale of FTX digital assets to investors for more than $3.4 billion will result in a significant price decline based on the asset\u2019s weekly transaction volumes.\n\nBecause of volume restrictions imposed at each stage of the liquidation, the company asserts that the sale won\u2019t cause a significant market impact.\n\nContrary to the initial rumors of a $1.3 billion overnight sale, the liquidations will start with a weekly cap of $50 million and gradually increase to $100 million in the coming weeks.\n\nStill, FTX debtors and their committees will need to approve a permanent $200 million per week.\n\n\u201cStrict controls in place for selling certain \u2018insider-affiliated\u2019 tokens that require 10 days advance notice to these same committees,\u201d said David Duong, the head of institutional research.\n\nHowever, the business can sign contracts for hedging digital assets with a certified advisor under the provisions. This hedging agreement exclusively applies to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the possibility of adding other coins subject to creditor approval.\n\nThe company is also required to provide periodic updates (weekly and monthly) on balances, transactions, sales, yields, market insights, and other revenue-generating sources.\n\nAccording to a recent court judgement, the defunct exchange can now sell its cryptocurrency holdings to reimburse investors either directly or through investments.\n\nMarket Anxiety Sparked by Bankruptcy Proceedings\n\nThe collapse of FTX in November 2022 hit the market in a number of ways, from the immediate market decline that destroyed billions of dollars to the more current worries over the sale of its crypto holdings.\n\nThe exchange reportedly has $7 billion in assets, including Bahamian real estate, stocks, and cryptocurrency, according to a recent court filing.\n\nThe firm holds $560 million in BTC and $1.16 billion in Solana (SOL). The exchanges also own real estate valued at over $200 million and venture capital assets totaling over $4.5 billion in many businesses.\n\nExperts\u2019 predictions that the sale would have a large effect on the market last week prompted Tron\u2019s Justin Sun to call for greater community support and to suggest that he would make a bid for some of the assets in order to lessen the effects on the market."

        "title": "Top 4 US states that are more interested in Ethereum over Bitcoin in 2023 - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin maintains a stronghold in terms of market share across most US states, certain regions have shown an increased inclination towards Ethereum. According to recent findings, four states \u2014 New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin \u2014 stand out with a higher Ethereum preference.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper into the reasons behind this shift.\n\nTop 4 US states that prefer Ethereum over Bitcoin in 2023\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s interest in Ethereum and crypto\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s recent legislative moves clearly signal its intent to become a pivotal crypto hub. The state\u2019s General Assembly has passed the \u201cDigital Assets and Blockchain Regulation\u201d Act, which introduces a range of provisions favorable for the cryptocurrency sector. It lays down regulations for digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technologies and paves the way for decentralized autonomous organizations to establish themselves within the state.\n\nSen. Robert Singer\u2019s comments reflect the state\u2019s approach: \u201cWe want to be more industry-friendly.\u201d This, combined with incentives for virtual currency businesses and the focus on blockchain integration, positions New Jersey at the forefront of Ethereum adoption.\n\nColorado: The home of ETHDenver\n\nGovernor Jared Polis\u2019s 2022 announcement to establish Colorado as a center for crypto innovation has borne fruit. The state has introduced a program allowing tax payments through cryptocurrency and embraced Ethereum-centric events like ETHDenver.\n\nETHDenver, one of the largest web3 conferences in the world, has seen enormous support from the blockchain community. Its mission to build Colorado as the ultimate destination for a decentralized future is making significant strides. The event\u2019s community-funded approach and the proposed $10 million fund for decentralized projects further amplify Colorado\u2019s commitment to Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFlorida: Crypto Adoption led by a passionate Mayor and Governor\n\nFlorida is emerging as an attractive destination for crypto investment, thanks to the efforts of Governor Ron DeSantis and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. The state\u2019s endeavors to integrate blockchain technology into various sectors and Mayor Suarez\u2019s aggressive campaign to lure crypto businesses to the region have significantly fueled Ethereum\u2018s popularity. The renaming of the Miami Heat\u2019s stadium to FTX Arena (before FTX went down in flames and the stadium quickly ditched the moniker) and the symbolic gesture of leaders receiving pay in Bitcoin testify to the state\u2019s growing enthusiasm for digital currencies. With the state attracting several businesses and developers, there is hardly any surprise why they lean more heavily towards the sophisticated use cases of the Ethereum ecosystem over Bitcoin.\n\nWisconsin: The Silent Ethereum Advocate\n\nThere is not much information out there about Wisconsin\u2019s interest in crypto. However, the survey suggests otherwise. The state, known for its progressive approach towards technology and innovation, is likely recognizing Ethereum\u2018s potential beyond just a digital currency. As Ethereum establishes itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications, states like Wisconsin, which value technological progress, would naturally gravitate towards it.\n\nWhy should you buy Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?\n\nCertainly, Bitcoin holds the mantle as the premier cryptocurrency, its pioneering presence and vast adoption making it a household name. However, when diving into the intricate tapestry of blockchain technology, Ethereum emerges as a potent contender, not just as a cryptocurrency but as a comprehensive platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2018s programmability is its trump card. This isn\u2019t just about trading or holding a currency; it\u2019s about harnessing a versatile framework upon which a myriad of applications can be built. In essence, Ethereum offers an entire ecosystem, opening doors to decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, art, and much more.\n\nThis functionality has a magnetic pull on states with a burgeoning crypto presence and developer community. Consider Colorado and Florida; their robust crypto-awareness has led them to prefer the multifunctional Ethereum over the monolithic Bitcoin. As these states champion technological innovation, it\u2019s only logical for them to gravitate toward a platform that offers more than just a digital currency.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s multifaceted capabilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to smart contracts, are drawing the attention of progressive states. The proactive measures by the states of New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Wisconsin clearly indicate Ethereum\u2018s growing significance in the US\u2019s crypto narrative. As 2023 unfolds, observing how other states respond to this trend and the innovations that Ethereum will undoubtedly catalyze will be interesting.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs it better to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nBuying Bitcoin or Ethereum often boils down to individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Being the first and most well-established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often seen as a \u201cstore of value\u201d and likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d On the other hand, Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, making it a currency and a comprehensive ecosystem. Those seeking a diverse range of applications lean towards Ethereum, while those looking for a more established and straightforward digital currency might choose Bitcoin.\n\nWhat problem does Ethereum solve?\n\nEthereum was designed to overcome limitations in earlier cryptocurrencies, primarily regarding flexibility. While Bitcoin introduced the concept of blockchain and decentralized money, Ethereum took it a step further by creating a platform where developers can build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. This means tasks, transactions, and programs can run autonomously without intermediaries, potentially revolutionizing various sectors, from finance and real estate to entertainment and governance.\n\nWill Ethereum overtake Bitcoin?\n\nPredicting the future of the crypto market is challenging due to its volatile nature. While Ethereum brings a lot of functionality to the table with its smart contract capabilities, Bitcoin\u2019s primary value proposition is its status as the original cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption as a store of value. Some experts believe Ethereum\u2018s expansive use cases might give it an edge in the long run, a concept termed the \u201cflippening,\u201d but it remains speculative. Both cryptocurrencies have their strengths and could coexist, catering to different market segments.\n\nWhat will happen to Ethereum in 2030?\n\nIt is impossible to predict Ethereum\u2019s valuation in 2030. With the incorporation of multiple L2s and sharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues should be solved, potentially making Ethereum more efficient and capable of handling more transactions per second. With favorable regulations, Ethereum should have plenty of use cases.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s biggest problem is integrating and deploying all the cool scalability innovations that are happening right now. For example, sharding can be complicated, and integrating it with Ethereum\u2019s chain could have unforeseen consequences."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) speculators are in \u201cpanic\u201d mode, as nearly all of them are in the red, research says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode revealed 97.5% unrealized losses among Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STHs).\n\nResearch warns of \u201cnon-trivial\u201d Bitcoin sentiment slide\n\nBTC price action in recent months has tested the resolve of investors, but none more so than those who bought BTC over the past three months.\n\nSTHs, which correspond to entities hodling coins for 155 days or less, have seen their aggregate cost basis fail as market support.\n\nAs Glassnode notes, as of Sept. 17, the cost basis for those not spending BTC is now $28,000 \u2014 around 5% above the current spot price.\n\nAs part of its research, the firm separated the STH cohort into holders and spenders, discovering \u201ca relationship between abrupt changes in implied (unrealized) profitability and the shift in spending by STHs (realized profitability).\u201d\n\nThe result, it says, is what it calls a \u201cnon-trivial change in sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August,\u201d The Week On-Chain explained.\n\n\u201cThis suggests a degree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term.\u201d\n\nBitcoin STH holder and spender data annotated chart (screenshot).

Apart from the mining hardware purchase deal, Bitmain and Core Scientific have signed a new hosting arrangement to assist Bitmain\u2019s mining operations.\n\nThe deal was finalized in August when a court filing highlighted Bitmain\u2019s plan to sell mining hardware in exchange for cash and equity as part of Core Scientific\u2019s restructuring plan.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator and Bitcoin skeptic Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has been charged with bribery after allegedly accepting swaths of gold, cash, and mortgage payments as part of a \u201ccorrupt relationship\u201d with three businessmen in his home state.\n\nThe charges follow years of criticism from the politician targeting cryptocurrencies, which he has accused of enabling a range of criminal activities while empowering foreign actors to evade U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom at least 2018 up to and including in or about 2022, Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, agreed to and did accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence,\u201d read the Friday indictment.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Menendez helped enrich three businessmen\u2014Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes\u2014while also benefiting the government of Egypt by providing \u201csensitive U.S. government information,\u201d among other charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, prosecutors say Menendez used his influence to dismantle a criminal probe in New Jersey against Uribe, and to protect an Egyptian business monopoly granted to Hana by the Egyptian government that was partly responsible for paying Menendez\u2019s bribes.\n\nMenendez denied the allegations in a statement. \u201cI remain focused on continuing this important work and will not be distracted by baseless allegations,\u201d he said. All in all, the senator faces three federal charges: conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. If convicted, Menendez faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, in June 2022, a search warrant against Menendez, his home, and a safe deposit box revealed some of the proceeds from the alleged bribes: over $500,000 in cash, a luxury vehicle, and over $100,000 in gold bars. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of the seized assets.\n\nMenendez\u2019s use of more traditional instruments to allegedly hide ill-gotten gains presents a stark contrast to his historic outlook on Bitcoin. In 2017, the senator sent a letter to FinCEN stating that the \u201canonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions\u201d makes it \u201can ideal choice for criminals.\u201d\n\n\n\nMenendez is well known in crypto circles for co-sponsoring the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act, which seeks to investigate how El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender could create \u201crisks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nMenendez was also among many politicians to sound the alarm on Facebook\u2019s now-defunct stablecoin project, Libra, in July 2019. \u201cLibra could be the Wild West of cryptocurrency where money launderers, criminals, and countries seeking to avoid U.S. sanctions could operate,\u201d he said during a Senate hearing at the time."

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) pioneer Hal Finney shared his vision for zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs more than 25 years ago, a full decade before the launch of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThe video, purportedly from the Crypto \u201898 conference held on Aug. 26, 1998, in Santa Barbara, shows Finney discussing in detail the concept of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technology that gained immense popularity decades later.\n\n\ufe0f NEW: Bitcoin legend Hal Finney discusses Zero-Knowledge Proofs in a newly unearthed presentation, made 25 years ago at Crypto '98 in Santa Barbara.\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard @halfin's voice before? pic.twitter.com/HdddworTsg \u2014 Trust Machines (@trustmachinesco) September 20, 2023\n\nFinney explains how one could hypothetically perform a zero-knowledge proof on a SHA-1 hash, describing the possibility of sending a cryptographically encrypted claim without revealing any of the details contained within the same claim.\n\n\u201cI want to prove to you that I know a message that hashes to a given hash value using the SHA-1 hash. I don\u2019t want to reveal anything about the message to you. It\u2019s a zero-knowledge proof, and I\u2019ve written a program to do this that I\u2019ll tell you about,\u201d explained Finney.\n\nA ZK-proof is a cryptographic protocol that enables one user (the prover) to convince another (the verifier) that a particular claim is true without disclosing any details about the claim itself. The concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first conceived in 1985.\n\nAt the time of Finney\u2019s speech, zero-knowledge proofs were considered a possibility, but due to hardware limitations at the time, they were widely regarded as, as Finney puts it, \u201cinefficient or impractical.\u201d\n\nRelated: Idealistic Ethereum community-built zkEVM Scroll launching in weeks\n\nDecades later, the crypto industry is now abuzz with discussions and debates on how best to implement zero-knowledge proofs, with the main use of the technology being leveraged to scale the Ethereum network.\n\nFinney is a storied pioneer of the cryptocurrency industry. He was a computer scientist who made some of the earliest contributions to privacy-enhancing technology, including the first fully anonymous remailer, a tool that protected user identity when sending emails. Additionally, Finney created the first reusable proof-of-work system, which preceded Bitcoin by nearly five years.\n\nIn 2009, Finney was the very first recipient of Bitcoin after he was transferred 10 BTC by the cryptocurrency\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, and was known to have worked closely alongside Nakamoto in Bitcoin\u2019s earliest days.\n\nSome have speculated that Finney himself could be Satoshi Nakamoto, though he has denied the theory.\n\nFinney was diagnosed with a rare neurological disease known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, the complications of which would later claim his life in 2014. Finney was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona.\n\nThe video could be one of the first times that some people have been able to hear Finney\u2019s voice, suggested TrustMachines on X.\n\nBig Questions: What\u2019s with all the crypto deaths?"

So, I think it\u2019s very clear that you need to be aware that they\u2019re not in desperate need for a given crypto to increase significantly in value.\u201d\n\nNot everyone would be inclined to agree with Christensen, however.\n\nBen Simpson, founder of crypto education platform Collective Shift, said there\u2019s a wealth of data and indicators that suggest that we\u2019re already witnessing the initial stages of a Bitcoin bull market.\n\n\u201cThe drawdown from the all-time high chart and market-value-to-realized-value ratio suggest we\u2019re in the final stages of accumulation, often a precursor to a bull market,\u201d explained Simpson.\n\nWhen it comes to the assets most primed for a major boom, Simpson believes the next bull market will blow wind into the sails of Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and application-specific tokens and sectors such as gaming.\n\n\u201cDeFi tokens are risky but offer significant upside, and Bitcoin, I believe, emerges as the \u2019silent winner\u2019 amid broader adoption and one I\u2019m most bullish on.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bitcoin ETF won\u2019t have any impact on the price\u201d pic.twitter.com/ArSTwskEec \u2014 Ben Simpson (@bensimpsonau) September 13, 2023\n\nThe last two-year period has been tough for the crypto industry.

The Bitcoin halving is the centerpiece of this theory, and it\u2019s the major catalyst optimistic investors are focused on.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tina Teng, a market analyst from CMC Markets, explained that it\u2019s far too early to start worrying about whether or not massive gains are on the horizon. Instead, investors should be bracing themselves for a new wave of uncertainty.\n\nRelated: China suffers worst capital flight in years, but could it pump Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that it\u2019s the start of a bull market in crypto.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has seen a 36% year-to-date increase in its price in 2023 in U.S. dollar terms. This recovery, however, is modest given that ETH is currently trading 66% below its November 2021 peak of $4,870.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: 14-month downtrend and counting\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 20, Ether reached its lowest levels against Bitcoin (BTC) in 14 months, breaching the critical 0.06 BTC support. This has raised questions among Ether investors about the factors behind this price decline and what it will take to reverse the trend.\n\nETH/BTC price on Coinbase. Source: TradingView\n\nETH buyers placed their biggest hopes on protocol upgrades that significantly reduced the need for new coin issuance when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThese hopes were realized in mid-September 2022, resulting in an annualized issuance rate of just 0.25% of the supply. This transformation aligned with the Ethereum community\u2019s vision of \u201cultrasound money.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent Shapella upgrade on April 12 allowed for withdrawals from the native staking protocol, addressing a major concern for investors. Previously, both the 32 ETH deposits and the yield from participating in the network consensus were locked up indefinitely.\n\nConfidence among Ethereum enthusiasts grew as these significant hurdles were crossed with minimal issues. They anticipated that the price of Ether would surpass $2,000, a prediction that came true on April 14.\n\nHowever, this optimism was short-lived, as ETH\u2019s price promptly fell back to the same $1,850 level just a week later.\n\nNotably, instead of witnessing a net withdrawal, Ethereum staking experienced a net inflow of 3.1 million ETH in the 30 days following the Shappela upgrade, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum network\u2019s planned developments have generally been on track, albeit with the customary delays, investors now need to explore other potential catalysts for reversing the current downtrend in Ether\u2019s price relative to BTC.\n\nExternal factors present important triggers for ETH price\n\nOne of these potential catalysts lies in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly impact Ether\u2019s price momentum.\n\nThe SEC contends that XRP (XRP) sales to retail investors constitute a securities offering. However, in July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP generally does not qualify as a security under SEC guidelines, especially when distributed through exchanges.\n\nAs noted by the \u201cAmerican lawyer and Bitcoiner\u201d Bryan Jacoutot on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum Foundation remains exposed due to the presale of ETH directed toward institutional investors and subject to a lock-up period.\n\n(1/12) ANALYSIS: I've reviewed the district court ruling on XRP and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.\n\n\n\nAND Ethereum Foundation remains at risk even if its upheld because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the \"pre-mine\"\n\n\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) July 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Jacoutot, even if Ripple were to secure a favorable outcome, it wouldn\u2019t immediately mitigate the risks for Ethereum. Nevertheless, it\u2019s undeniable that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Ether initial coin offering (ICO) remains a source of concern for investors.\n\nOn Sept. 20, an Ethereum address associated with the ICO era showed its first activity, transferring 32.1 ETH (valued at $52,000 at the time) directly to Coinbase. This additional movement only amplified regulatory concerns since there are no apparent incentives for addresses that have remained dormant for four to eight years to divest at this particular point in the market cycle.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now.\n\n\n\nThe address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis.\n\n\n\nAnd the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nA similar occurrence unfolded with an address linked to Vitalik Buterin, which sent 300 ETH (worth $490,000 at the time) to the Kraken exchange on Sept. 19.\n\nMore positive news gives hope to Ethereum investors\n\nOn the news side, Ethereum has seen some positive surprises, such as the unexpected request for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund by ARK Invest and 21Shares on Sept. 6. This development reduced the risks associated with excessive institutional concentration in Bitcoin, particularly if the ETF is approved.\n\nAdditionally, Canto, a layer-1 Cosmos-native blockchain, announced its expansion to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 on Sept. 18. This zero-knowledge, permissionless rollup, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is primarily focused on bringing traditional finance into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShould Bitcoin\u2019s price surge be driven solely by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF or inflation concerns in the United States, Ether is well-positioned to follow suit, benefiting from the same catalysts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s primary competitors in the decentralized applications sector, namely Solana and BNB Chain, face similar risks pertaining to ICO and securities regulations, making it unlikely for them to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of total value locked and trading volumes.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "How An \u2018Inconsequential\u2019 Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin is known to be a very volatile digital asset as its price is often wont to rise and fall unexpectedly, and sometimes without a clear reason. One of these instances of the digital asset flash-crashing was back in 2021 when the price of Bitcoin had fallen 87% on some exchanges in a matter of minutes. However, the mystery behind this flash crash has been unveiled two years after it first occurred.\n\nFormer Alameda Research Engineer Spills Secret\n\nAlameda Research is the sister company of the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange run by Caroline Ellison who served as CEO until it collapsed. Following the bankruptcy, employees at the trading firm have, at various times, come forward to tell stories of what took place at the company. This time around, an ex-engineer Aditya Baradwaj is telling the story of how a simple mistake caused the company to lose tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBaradwaj took to his X (formerly Twitter) account to reveal how an Alameda employee had unwittingly triggered a Bitcoin flash crash in 2021. According to him, the error was a result of two trading systems operated at the company.\n\nPART 2: THE FAT-FINGER or The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world. (1/n) \ud83e\uddf5#SBF #FTX pic.twitter.com/jCykh6rg1o \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nThe ex-engineer explained that Alameda had semi-systemic strategies in which a complex automated trading system was controlled by model parameters set by traders. The second was manual trading which would be done when the former could not execute a trade due to a number of reasons.\n\nIn the case of the trader who triggered the flash crash, they had to manually enter a trade to sell a large tranche of BTC using Alameda\u2019s manual trading system. However, the trader had failed to realize that the decimal point in the trade was off by a couple of spaces, which meant that they were selling the BTC at much lower prices than the current price.\n\nThe result of this simple error was Alameda selling off a sizable portion of BTC at pennies on the dollar which resulted in a flash crash on multiple exchanges. The crash was most prominent on the FTX and Binance exchanges, where prices fell from $65,000 to $8,000 in a matter of minutes.\n\nCovering Up The Bitcoin Crash\n\nThe aftermath of the flash crash, according to the ex-engineer, involved Alameda rushing to put in place sanity checks that should have been available before any manual trades were executed. He notes that this was not out of the ordinary as they were always waiting for things to break before fixing them at the company.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s usually how things worked at Alameda \u2013 we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it,\u201d he said. Baradwaj also referred to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried saying that the utility gained after the events outweighed the costs incurred from poor risk checks and hacks.\n\nHe also pointed to Binance commenting on the flash crash with a statement that blamed a bug in the trading algorithm of one of their institutional traders. \u201cI guess Caroline had made some phone calls,\u201d Baradwaj said, referring to Alameda\u2019s CEO.\n\nBTC price holding support | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Nairametrics, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could see \u201csubstantial inflows\u201d from China within the next few months amid a weakening Chinese yuan and one of the country\u2019s biggest capital flights in years.\n\n\u201cThe familiarity of Bitcoin by Chinese investors in times of a weakening domestic economy could see substantial inflows into Bitcoin over the next few months,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport.\n\nThe latest official data, compiled by Bloomberg, shows China\u2019s capital outflows hit $49 billion in August, the largest monthly capital outflow since December 2015, potentially spelling more pressure for the yuan.\n\nChina just experienced a capital outflow of $49 billion last month, the largest outflow in more than 7 years pic.twitter.com/X4Or9k3Oiu \u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) September 19, 2023\n\n\u201cThe USD/CNY exchange rate is trading at a 17-year high as the U.S. economy is strongly expanding while the Chinese economy appears to have weak growth momentum,\u201d said Thielen.\n\n\u201cThe post-COVID-19 consumption rebound underwhelmed, and the authorities have not implemented enough countercyclical measures to support the economy. Chinese companies are suffering from weak margins in the absence of growth.\u201d\n\nThielen believes continued pressure on the yuan and the \u201cabsence of growth\u201d among local companies could see investors searching for opportunities outside of China.\n\nHowever, considering the country\u2019s strict capital controls, crypto may turn out to be one of the few channels available, he said, arguing:\n\n\u201cCrypto might be one of the only viable options.\u201d\n\nIn a Sept. 20 post on X, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes alluded to a similar possibility, suggesting that Chinese capital may already be flowing into gold and paying down United States dollar offshore debt. He also shared hopes that some of the capital would \u201cfind its way\u201d to Bitcoin.\n\nAs long as the $JPY weakens, the $CNY must weaken so that Chinese exports remain competitive vs. Japan.\n\n\n\nWherever the Chinese capital is going, it will keep going in SIZE.\n\n\n\nI hope some finds its way to Lord Satoshi and $BTC \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) September 20, 2023\n\nIn fact, such a narrative seemingly played out for Bitcoin in late 2016, with reports that investors in China were increasingly looking to Bitcoin to get capital out of the country.\n\nAt the time, the trading volume out of China suggested a possible link between the value of the Chinese yuan and the price of Bitcoin, which eventually peaked around late 2017.\n\nRelated: Sky-high interest rates are exactly what the crypto market needs\n\nHowever, Singular Research crypto analyst Edward Engel argues that times have changed and a Chinese capital flight today may not have the same impact on Bitcoin as it did then.\n\n\u201cThis is not something I\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Engel in a statement to Cointelegraph. \u201cThe last time I heard of something like this was 2017\u20132018, when junkets were using Bitcoin to support underground banks, but we all know the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] plugged those holes a while ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s gotten pretty savvy when it comes to stopping outflows, so I\u2019d be surprised if people were using older ways.\u201d\n\nJunkets refer to organizations that helped wealthy Chinese gamblers move substantial sums of money overseas. China has since cracked down heavily on these firms.\n\nThielen, however, claims there may still be surviving methods for Chinese capital to use crypto, such as using domestic electricity to mine crypto or using over-the-counter traders to buy Tether (USDT) via Tron to send crypto internationally \u2014 seemingly in the face of restrictions.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has continued to hover between $25,000 and $27,000 since mid-August. It is currently trading at $26,621, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: PEX staff flee event as scandal hits, Mt. Gox woes, Diners Club crypto"

        "title": "The 60/40 Portfolio Isn't Dead, and Neither Is Bitcoin. But Mixing Them Can Be Lethal. - Morningstar Asia",
        "content": "Bitcoin has performed surprisingly well for the year to date. The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe trusty balanced portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index VBAIX has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60/40 fund (referring to its split between stocks and bonds) might be dead. Balanced funds\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of U.S. stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nSo far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave many investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin.\n\nCompared with other assets, though, bitcoin\u2019s volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\nRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023.\n\nEven though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin\u2019s impact on the 60/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly 4 times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behavior of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.\n\nHow Much Is a Lot?\n\nLet\u2019s say that in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60/40 portfolio\u2014that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested. (For the purposes of this example, let\u2019s also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn\u2019t change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis\u2014that will become important in a second.)\n\nOur study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: A 60%/38%/2% split between stocks/bonds/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%/30% S&P 500/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\nBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nFurther up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90/10 portfolio than a 60/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong. The closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!)\n\nDecomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\nBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nAlthough adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out that investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\nBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWith that being said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren\u2019t likely to hold in practice. That\u2019s because regulators in the United States have barred most brokerages from offering bitcoin alongside traditional stock and bond investments. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.\n\nWhen it comes to security selection\u2014picking individual stocks, for example\u2014the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\nFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nEven one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWhile the SEC weighs proposals that might broaden investor access to bitcoin by way of an exchange-traded fund, we see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it\u2019s permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.\n\nEven so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would advise those investors to tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.\n\nA note on the disclaimer below: Most digital assets, including the cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, are not currently classified as shares of registered securities by the SEC and therefore do not fall under Morningstar\u2019s editorial policies.

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Opportunity will come and patience will be rewarded - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price rests below the $27,500 level as those who profited in the September 12-18 rise recently await the next move.\n\nEthereum price is likely to fall 5% if BTC shows weakness, sending ETH for a liquidity grab below the $1,552 support level.\n\nRipple price must break and close above the mean threshold at $0.5337 or fall 10% retracing the $0.4600 level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price holds steady with reduced trading volume as the weekend mood sets in. Ethereum (ETH) price hackens to the BTC cue, with both cryptos engaging low gear. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is rejected from a key level but maintains an overall bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC downside likely after 20-week EMA culls bulls\n\nBitcoin price holds below $27,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $27,000 psychological level, with investors digesting the FOMC meeting reports following the Federal Interest Rate decision. The current stance could be attributed to the weekend mood, or more ideally, traders having taken profits from the September 12-19 upswing and are now waiting for the next move.\n\nIt is likely that Bitcoin price could extend the slump below the $26,000 psychological level before a possible pullback with the odds of a move below the $25,229 level increasing by the day. A decisive break and close below this level would confirm the downtrend.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) decisively moves above 50, Bitcoin price could shatter the downtrend line at $27,210, clearing the path for more gains. This could potentially deliver BTC above the $28,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin trading volume in spot and derivatives market points to dwindling liquidity, limits price growth\n\nEthereum price follows BTC to the heel\n\nEthereum (ETH) price could have little to say as far as its next move is concerned, considering the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token has been mirroring the price action of Bitcoin for quite some time now, owing to its strong correlation with BTC.\n\nIndependently, however, Ethereum price remains bare, with momentum falling as indicated by the RSI dropping. The immediate support at $1,624 is therefore critical for ETH, as losing it would plunge it back under a confining bearish trendline. The downtrend could go as low as the $1,552 level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOtherwise, if bullish momentum increases, Ethereum price could very well rise above the immediate hurdle at $1,682, then $1,791, with a confirmed daily candlestick close above the $1,900 likely to kickstart an uptrend. The steady climb of the AO is a good sign, with the sustained green shade solidifying the case for the bulls.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum and Bitcoin are ready to dive\n\nRipple price repels the MT\n\nRipple (XRP) price has repelled the supply zone order block's mean threshold (MT) at $0.5337. However, the overall outlook is still bullish, with the RSI inclined north and the AO steadily climbing to the positive region. Nevertheless, investors should still wait for confirmation above the aforementioned level for the uptrend to be considered plausible.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA strong rejection from the mean threshold, potentially positioning Ripple price under $0.4600 could mean the supply zone will hold as a resistance level, with the ensuing selling pressure sending Ripple price toward the foot of the latest uptrend at $0.4600. In the dire case, the downtrend could continue, with the remittance token potentially tagging the May lows at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP is the next Bitcoin if we solve a multi-trillion-dollar problem, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse"

        "content": "Bitcoin price continues to retrace its January 2022 steps, hinting at a steep correction on the big picture.\n\nA breakdown of the $25,229 support level will confirm and kickstart a bearish outlook for BTC.\n\nIf bulls fail to reduce the bearish pressure, the pioneer crypto could revisit the $20,431 support level.\n\nA bullish scenario will develop if BTC flips the $30,000 psychological level into a support.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) bearish price fractal, as discussed in a previous article, is underway, but the lack of volatility is causing ambiguity and doubt. Regardless, BTC might see a bit of an upside before the long-term bearish scenario plays out.\n\nRead more about Bitcoin\u2019s bearish fractal: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC contemplates crash in September\n\nBitcoin price delays bearish outcome as volatility dries up\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price trades at $26,628 after dropping 3.13% over the last 48 hours after rejection at the 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $27,290 on September 18. The lack of volatility is another reason for the bearish fractal not progressing.\n\nRejection at the 20-day EMA was also noted in March 2022, which was soon followed by a small correction and a sweep of the buy-side liquidity to the upside. If such a price action were to unfold again for Bitcoin, a revisit of the $25,762 could lead to a sweep of the $27,500 level and the buy side liquidity resting above it.\n\nRead more: What volatility? Bitcoin price dismisses FOMC, Mt. Gox with $26.7K dip\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nInvalidation of this short-term bearish fractal will occur if Bitcoin price flips the $29,659 hurdle into a support level. In such a case, BTC could revisit the $31,643 resistance level.\n\nContemplating a bullish BTC outlook\n\nOn the daily chart, away from the bearish fractal perspective, Bitcoin price looks bullish after it reclaimed key hurdles. These key resistance levels are the 13-day, 25-day, and 30-day EMAs, all of which are at a confluence at $26,580.\n\nUnlike the long-term bearish outlook described above, which has a higher probability of playing out, the current bullish outlook has low probabilities. Moreover, a breakdown of the EMA confluence at $26,580 will invalidate it.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConclusion\n\nThe long-term bearish fractal is still in play, and the targets for this outlook mentioned in the previous article are still valid.\n\nBut if investors are looking to open long positions with the EMA confluence as a support level, they should tread carefully. This bullish outlook is contingent that the $26,580 foothold will not give in to selling pressure on the daily timeframe.\n\nOn the other hand, a continuation of the downtrend over the weekend could fit into the short-term bearish perspective described at the start of this article. For this scenario, the take-profit levels include $25,757 and $25,153.\n\nAlso read: First Ethereum futures ETF expecting approval by October 2"

        "title": "Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace Launches, Delivering Peer-to-Peer Trading of Bitcoin Mining Capacity - Business Wire",
        "content": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace will officially launch on September 26th, unlocking global access to Bitcoin mining hashpower for Web3 users.\n\nLaunching on September 26th on the Arbitrum One network, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace represents the next step towards the greater decentralization of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin miners will have a frictionless path toward buying and selling mining capacity, and non-miners will be able to participate in the same marketplace.\n\nSmoothing the \u201cPeaks-and-Valleys\u201d for Bitcoin Miners\u2019 Operations\n\nThrough the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, miners can sell their hashrate through smart contracts, specifying hashrate amount, duration, and price. This contributes to business predictability and de-risking, enabling them to set fixed prices that provide regular earnings.\n\nConversely, miners can use the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace to purchase hashpower from other miners. This allows miners to increase their chances for earning bitcoin rewards without purchasing rapidly depreciating equipment. These buyers can easily browse and select contracts that suit their needs, secure in the knowledge that they are engaging in direct, trustless transactions and paying in real-time as the contract is completed.\n\nIn either scenario, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace helps provide additional predictability to their revenue streams. Further, miners in low-electricity-cost areas could arbitrage those below-average prices through selling hashrate contracts at market prices, keeping the difference.\n\nMining: Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere\n\nThrough the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, users can mine bitcoin without the need for highly specialized knowledge, costly hardware outlays, or long-term commitments. With the Lumerin Wallet and detailed documentation, users can buy hashpower contracts, route that hashpower to their pool, and earn mining revenue directly.\n\nUnlocking Access to Mining for a More Decentralized Bitcoin\n\nFounder Ryan Condron explained the potential impact of the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace\u2019s launch: \"Today marks a milestone in our journey to re-democratize mining,\" says Condron. \"With the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace now live, we are starting to restore the decentralization of the Bitcoin mining landscape by providing a direct, accessible path for everyone to be part of the mining ecosystem.\"\n\nThe choice of launching on the Arbitrum One network underscores Lumerin\u2019s commitment to user experience, offering users faster transactions, reduced gas fees, and a seamless experience overall.\n\n\"Bitcoin hashpower remains the basis for supporting the most secure distributed network yet devised, creating opportunities for new financial systems and so much more,\" said Jeff Garzik, CEO and co-founder of Lumerin partner Bloq, Inc. \"Through Lumerin, professional miners and crypto enthusiasts alike will be able to participate in Bitcoin mining in ways that make the distribution of hashpower more fluid and democratized, thus bringing our ecosystem closer to its goals.\u201d\n\nThe platform's unique approach has the potential to reshape the dynamics of crypto mining, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nAbout Lumerin\n\nThe Lumerin Protocol is an open-source project working on decentralized data stream routing. Its first development, the Lumerin Hashpower Marketplace, is a peer-to-peer platform that makes Bitcoin hashrate tradable and liquid, unlocking mining profitability and providing greater access to capital and hashrate on a global scale.\n\nWebsite: https://lumerin.io/\n\nX (formerly Twitter): https://x.com/hellolumerin\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/lumerin-blog\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/LumerinOfficial\n\nIntroductory Video: \u201cMine Bitcoin Everywhere\u201d\n\nDocumentation: https://lumerin.gitbook.io/lumerin-hashpower-marketplace/"

BTC traded below the $27,000 and $26,800 support levels to enter a bearish zone.\n\nBesides, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support near $26,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair retested the $26,350 support zone and is currently consolidating losses. It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $27,494 swing high to the $26,358 low.\n\nBitcoin is now trading below $27,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.

        "title": "From Bitcoin Market to Web3 colonies: How crypto exchanges have evolved over the years - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Phemex, an innovative crypto exchange, is at the forefront of the hybrid trading approach. Rooted in a firm commitment to decentralization, Phemex provides CEX-like liquidity, user-friendly functionalities, and access to DeFi opportunities through its Phemexia ecosystem.\n\nOver the years, cryptocurrency trading venues have come a long way \u2014 from the Bitcoin Market exchange owned and operated by a single anonymous user, dwdollar, in 2010 to automated market makers (AMMs) relying on mathematical formulas to price assets a decade later.\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXs) use an order book where market makers and takers place their orders. Their order books then match buyers and sellers, and the exchanges take a small portion of the transaction as a fee. Their counterparts, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), operate via smart contracts \u2014 autonomous code snippets on a blockchain, executing transactions. And users pay gas for their activity on the chain.\n\nTrading venues combining features of CEXs and DEXs, nevertheless, exist already and are called hybrid exchange models. For example, Phemex is one of the leading platforms pioneering such a hybrid, semi-centralized exchange structure.\n\nThe rise of centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges\n\nHowever different CEXs and DEXs might seem from the current perspective, the timelines of their evolution overlapped a few times, making these exchange models inseparable from one another in the historical context.\n\nIn 2012, initial regulatory concerns began to surface, pushing the centralized exchange founders to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. Over a few years, due to ever-emerging restrictions and decreasing anonymity levels in the crypto niche, the first DEXs, like EtherDelta and IDEX, gained traction.\n\nWhen the world saw the explosion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, there were already such prominent centralized platforms as Binance or Bitfinex, which listed all the new tokens and built a reputation as a result. But despite that popularity, individual crypto traders became increasingly preoccupied with KYC, centralized custody of their funds and possible hacks. The decentralized finance (DeFi) boom of 2020-2021, with $250 billion in total value locked (TVL) as of November 2021, was a solid response to the unnerving tension slowly accumulating over the years in the crypto community.\n\nHowever, as the years passed, more breaches started happening in DeFi. So, some crypto projects started investing time and effort into researching alternative exchange models. And this is how a semi-centralized trading venue model saw the light of day for the first time, bringing together many benefits, including the security measures of CEXs and the lack of censorship common for DEXs.\n\nSo, what other ways can the semi-centralized model contribute to the crypto community?\n\nHow do hybrid exchange models work?\n\nThe hybrid exchange model is not yet widespread in the niche. However, one crypto trading venue, Phemex, is pioneering the semi-centralized approach in its operations.\n\nPhemex offers its users the benefits of CEXs, such as robust liquidity, an intuitive user experience, and flexible on- and off-ramps. Beginning in April 2023, the exchange signaled its move toward decentralization and introduced its Web3 ecosystem Phemexia, where holders of the non-tradable soul-bound token Phemex Soul Pass can unlock DeFi opportunities.\n\nTo be eligible to mint their own PSP, users have to record at least $10,000 in trading volume over the previous 30 days. But once minted, the pass allows them to accumulate airdrops of xPT, the exchange\u2019s upcoming native token. Users can also propose and vote on the platform\u2019s development in the Phemex DAO, participating in the platform\u2019s growth, operations, financial management and external partnerships.\n\nSource: Phemex\n\nPhemex offers Phemex Soul Pass holders various opportunities and events to use their tokens as much as possible on its DeFi platform. Right now, one of these events is actually in progress. In honor of Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced Bitcoin (BTC) on October 31st, 2008, Phemex has organized a significant event focused on the world of digital gold. PSP holders are invited to predict the price range of Bitcoin on October 31, 2023. Participants with accurate predictions will have the chance to share a BTC prize pool that may reach as high as 1,000 BTC.\n\nSource: Phemex\n\nThis campaign serves as the latest significant benefit extended to PSP holders, following Phemex\u2019s 100 Ether (ETH) giveaway conducted in August. It underscores Phemex\u2019s commitment to providing tangible advantages to its dedicated supporter community while commemorating prominent cryptocurrency projects.\n\nLearn more about Phemex and Phemexia"

        "content": "Bitcoin is on track to close the second consecutive week in the green as the price continues to retest the resolve of investors. A \u201cdegree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term\u201d as investors who bought BTC over the last three months see their aggregate cost basis fail as market support, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nAs a result, there is an overall sense of caution among Bitcoin traders and analysts, with many predicting a test of lower levels still to come. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index reinforces these views as market \u201csentiments and emotions\u201d remain fairly bearish according to data from Alternative.\n\nNonetheless, for smallholders, Bitcoin remains an attractive investment as they accumulate more in anticipation of good returns in the long run. Sentiments analysts unveiled a trend where non-whale wallets, which are defined as \u201caddresses with under 100 $BTC\u201d, have soared to all-time highs, \u201cnow owning 41.1% of the available supply.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udcc9 #Bitcoin\u2018s non-whale wallets, defined as addresses with under 100 $BTC, have climbed to new #AllTimeHigh levels, now owning 41.1% of the available supply. Meanwhile, whales with 100 to 100K, own 55.5% of the supply, their lowest amount held since May. https://t.co/JktSd6yM6Z pic.twitter.com/f2cwYZ3MTX \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 21, 2023\n\nThis points to massive accumulation, which is a bullish sign for the holders of the big crypto.\n\nCan Bitcoin Climb 50% Before the End of the Year?\n\nBTC is trading at $26,622, down 1.67% over the last 24 hours and up 0.5% over the last seven days. On the medium timeframes, Bitcoin looks bearish as it trades at 13% and 3% down over the last three months and six months respectively.\n\nOn the longer timeframes, the pioneer cryptocurrency is optimistically bullish. It is up 61% year-to-date (YTD) and 44% over the last 12 months.\n\nFor the last five weeks, the price has still successfully managed to stay above $26,000, and even when it dips below this level, it quickly bounces back up.\n\nThis suggests the bearish wave is trying to break the support at $26k. The support is holding for now, but if it breaks the price of the flagship cryptocurrency will drop to revisit the $23,500 to $24,500 demand zone. Note that this is a strong defense zone as it is where the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Suptrend\u2019s green line lie.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the most vigorous resistance limiting Bitcoin from heading further up is at $28,000, close to the 200-day SMA. Although BTC did manage to breach it a couple of times in March and June, even going to $32,000 on one occasion, thus making a YTD high.\n\nNote that the month of September and Q3 2023 will end in just over a week. Historically, this is the worst period for crypto prices, while Q4 is usually much more bullish.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that history will repeat itself, market participants are looking forward to entering the final quarter. Not only that, but the most optimistic predictions believe that BTC might recover to $40,000 before the year ends. This would mark a 50% uptick from the current price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This abrupt turn-around runs counter to his earlier forecasts of Bitcoin\u2019s price growth to ranges between $220,000 and $1 million. Many of his supporters look perplexed by this about-face as they try to make sense of his incoherent remarks.\n\nDonations in BTC, ETH, and ADA\n\nArmstrong sought donations for his legal defense, receiving significant support from the crypto community shortly after. Donations started to flood in. Armstrong\u2019s mission was enthusiastically supported by backers, who generously donated sums in several cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, donations made in Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Cardano (ADA) amounted to more than $80,000 .\n\nEthereum Donations: Armstrong\u2019s Ethereum address (0xa6079bC88540cC9360D3c8D6f9cE583cdC3dC6) received a total of 32 ETH, worth $53,843.44.\n\nBitcoin contributions: At the time of writing, donations to Armstrong\u2019s Bitcoin address stood at $227.50.\n\nCardano Donations: Cardano\u2019s support for Armstrong\u2019s campaign underscores the importance of community solidarity in challenging times, despite the unverifiable trackability of ADA donations.\n\nArmstrong has been having difficulties ever since the Hit Network, a business he helped start, removed his YouTube channel and other social media accounts following allegations of drug usage and extramarital affairs. The crypto influencer, unable to use the BitBoy name, has decided to be called just \u2013 Ben.\n\nArmstrong solicited donations at three different addresses: a Bitcoin address, a Cardano address, and an Ethereum address. He claimed to be in need. The greatest donation to yet looks to be approximately 11,000 USDT from an unidentified source.\n\n\u201cThe fact is I was under duress, I\u2019ve been under duress.\u201d Armstrong said in the latest livestream, \u201clike, when people see what they did to me with this Lamborghini, trying to bleed me out, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nHit Network took possession of Armstrong\u2019s Lamborghini Huracan Performante because it was registered in their name.\n\nThe influencer explicitly stated that he would not return the funds he is collecting as a \u201clegal fund\u201d to the donors."

        "title": "Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a notable discovery, Arkham Intel, a leading blockchain intelligence platform, has identified $25 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) reserves held by Coinbase, the prominent US-based cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThis revelation puts Coinbase at the forefront of the Bitcoin landscape, positioning it as the largest Bitcoin entity in the world alongside the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. The uncovered reserves amount to nearly 5% of the total Bitcoin supply.\n\nCoinbase Emerges As Top Bitcoin Holder\n\nArkham Intel\u2019s comprehensive analysis has successfully tagged over 36 million Bitcoin deposits and holding addresses associated with Coinbase. Remarkably, Coinbase\u2019s largest cold wallet alone contains around 10,000 BTC, serving as a testament to the scale of their holdings.\n\nHowever, Arkham Intel suggests that Coinbase\u2019s actual Bitcoin reserves may extend beyond the identified addresses. Based on Coinbase\u2019s recent financial reports, it is highly likely that the exchange possesses thousands more BTC that have yet to be tracked and labeled.\n\nMoreover, Arkham Intel\u2019s platform reveals that Coinbase holds substantial amounts of other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.\n\nThe US-based exchange is reported to possess approximately 1.68 million ETH (Ethereum) valued at around $2.69 billion. Additionally, Coinbase holds 68.59 million LINK (Chainlink) tokens, estimated at $471 million.\n\nThe stablecoin USDC (USD Coin), pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is also part of Coinbase\u2019s portfolio, with holdings totaling 222 million USDC. Lastly, Coinbase holds a 921,000 BNB (Binance Coin) valued at approximately $194 million.\n\nBase Emerges As Top Contender Surpassing Solana In TVL Rankings\n\nIn a noteworthy development for the exchange and its new Layer-2 (L2) blockchain, Base has emerged as a formidable contender, surpassing Solana in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nAccording to the latest statistics from Defillama, Base, Coinbase\u2019s L2 solution boasts a TVL of $370 million, surpassing Solana\u2019s $310 million. This achievement signifies an important milestone for Base, highlighting its growing prominence and influence in the industry.\n\nNotably, Base\u2019s TVL positions it ahead of prominent blockchains such as Cronos, Kava, Defichain, Bitcoin, Fusion, Pulsechain, and Cardano. With its current TVL, Base accounts for approximately 0.96% of the overall $38.14 billion TVL in the DeFi space.\n\nBase has secured its place among the top protocols regarding TVL, ranking just behind Mixin, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, BSC, Tron, and Ethereum. This accomplishment highlights the growing prominence of Coinbase\u2019s L2 blockchain within the DeFi landscape.\n\nData from Dune Analytics reveals that since its L2 launch, Base has successfully bridged a total value of $426.81 million. Of this, 54.4% or $232.19 million comprises 143,467 ether, demonstrating strong support and adoption from the Ethereum community. Additionally, approximately 27.2% of the bridged assets to Base consist of 115,993,548 USDC stablecoins.\n\nHowever, it is not all good news for the firm. Coinbase stocks, traded under the name COIN, are experiencing a significant decline that has been ongoing since July 20.\n\nThe stocks have declined from the $111 level, followed by the lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the firm and Binance. Presently, the exchange\u2019s stocks are trading at $71.78.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s spot volume on Binance dropped by 57% between 1 and 20 September.\n\nWhile the BTC/TUSD fee changed, Bitcoin may not experience any notable selling pressure.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] spot volume hit a 35-month-low after it fell another 8% in the last seven days, according to K33 Research. When measuring spot volumes for any asset, the right place to look at is the exchanges. This is because they are the ones who provide trading pairs on the spot market.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBinance pushes Bitcoin\u2019s drop\n\nOne cogent reason the king coin\u2019s volume decreased was the seven-day spot volume on Binance, which fell by 57% since September began.\n\nFor the most part, the decrease could be linked to the regulatory battles that Binance seemed to be fighting. However, that was not the case, as a certain decision appeared to be the driving force behind the plunge.\n\nOn 7 September, Binance took an unexpected decision to change the fees accustomed to the BTC/TUSD pair. According to the exchange, the taker fee on the pair changed from zero to rate based on the VIP level any user was.\n\nAs a result of the decision, the BTC/TUSD volume, which boasted 380,000 Bitcoins involved between 31 August and 6 September, fell to 90,000 Bitcoins between 7 and 14 September. This drop signaled the displeasure traders had with the decision to change the fee rate.\n\nAt the same time, the resolution could be linked to Binance\u2019s desire to increase the usage of the First Digital USD [FDUSD].\n\nRecall that Binance had announced the introduction of the stablecoin as a potential replacement for Binance USD [BUSD], which was in a phasing-out stage. So, it was not surprising when FDUSD\u2019s market cap grew by 51% to reach $394 million on 6 September.\n\nCalm in between the storm\n\nOn looking at the exchange netflow, CryptoQuant showed that Bitcoin had a netflow of -4,191. This metric is the difference between Bitcoin flowing into exchanges and those flowing out. For spot exchanges, high values indicate selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the value mentioned above was in the negative region. So, Bitcoin was not experiencing any major selling pressure up until press time.\n\nThe exchange netflow inference was further reinforced by the seller exhaustion constant. The Bitcoin seller exhaustion constant is the product of the 30-day price volatility and the percentage supply in profit.\n\nWhichever value is gotten from this calculation shows low-risk bottoms or high-risk tops.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s seller exhaustion constant was 0.023. A value like the one mentioned here implied that the broader market was not looking to sell BTC at press time.\n\nIt also reflected a possible chance of buying Bitcoin at a price very close to the bottom, considering the current cycle. Therefore, regardless of the Binance volume drop, Bitcoin\u2019s price may not experience a sharp decrease anytime soon."
