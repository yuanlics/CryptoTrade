        "title": "The Controversial Business of Cash-to-Crypto Bitcoin ATMs - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City",
        "content": "Bitcoin ATMs, or \u201cBTMs,\u201d are a substantial industry in the United States. Despite the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and some controversy over potentially predatory or illicit uses, the cash-to-crypto BTM industry continues to experience consumer demand. However, data on the industry and its effects are sparse. This Payments System Research Briefing surveys the data available and reviews the industry\u2019s overall shape, size, and customer base in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow BTMs Work\n\nBTMs allow consumers to purchase, and sometimes sell, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While all BTMs handle Bitcoin, many also handle cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ether, as well as the stablecoins Tether and USDC. The standalone BTM machine resembles a traditional ATM and generates fees for the \u201coperator\u201d\u2014the individual, small business, or corporation that manages the BTM. BTMs are generally placed in locations with heavy foot traffic, long hours, and convenient in-and-out locations, such as convenience stores, gas stations, cafes, and supermarkets; locations that are relatively cheap to rent and offer privacy and accessibility are preferred (Coin ATM Radar 2015; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Chad Otsuji ATM Business 2021; Nordqvist 2022).\n\nAlthough the process of buying or selling Bitcoin at a BTM varies by machine, users follow some basic steps. First, the customer selects a purchase tier (such as $5\u2013$1,999 or $2,000\u2013$7,500). After providing the BTM with identification, such as a phone number, the customer enters the address of the digital wallet that will receive the Bitcoin purchased, usually using a QR code. If the customer prefers not to use a digital wallet, the BTM can create a paper wallet printed with the public and private cryptographic keys that allow access to the Bitcoin (again, usually via QR code). Finally, the customer feeds cash (or a debit card) into the machine and receives a receipt of the transaction. Selling Bitcoin at a BTM mostly follows the same procedure except that the address to send Bitcoin is that of the BTM operator, and cash is dispensed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of U.S. BTM Users\n\nAbout 10 to 25 percent of U.S. adults hold or use cryptocurrency, and while some of these adults use BTMs, the exact number is unknown (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Arkana and Li 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022). Based on their reasons for using BTMs, consumers generally fall into at least one of four groups (Thinking Crypto 2023; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Tompor 2018).\n\nCash users: People who prefer to transact in cash and may be unbanked or underbanked.\n\nOlder consumers: Older users who may not be as adept with current technology but are used to traditional ATMs. These users tend to prefer familiar, personal, and tangible experiences.\n\nPrivacy seekers: Users who want greater anonymity than is provided by a crypto exchange.\n\nConvenience-focused consumers: Users who want quick and easy transactions and are willing to pay a fee for this convenience.\n\nDemographically, most BTM users are male and almost evenly distributed across age groups, with a slight majority age 30 to 44 (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). These characteristics are roughly in line with other studies on cryptocurrency users, though BTM users may skew older (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022).\n\nAccording to one industry source, the vast majority of BTM users earn less than $80,000 per year (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). Research reports from outside the BTM industry suggest that low- and middle-income consumers are in fact overrepresented among BTM users\u2014a characteristic that news articles also support (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022; Peters 2020; Tompor 2018).\n\nNews articles also point to a significant proportion of BTM users belonging to minority groups (Peters 2020; Tompor 2018; Mika 2023). This finding appears consistent with research that consistently shows that minority groups are the biggest holders and users of cryptocurrency in general, with Asian users slightly outpacing Black and Hispanic users (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023).\n\nA share of BTM users may also be immigrants. According to limited evidence from the BTM industry, a majority of users buy cryptocurrencies from BTMs to use in person-to-person transactions or remittances. Because many BTMs appear in immigrant neighborhoods in major cities, news reports also stress the role of BTMs in remittances (Luthi 2022; Ajiboye 2022; Mika 2023). One explanation for this usage may be that the cost of using cryptocurrency obtained from a BTM in a remittance may be comparable to the cost of sending a remittance via third parties using cash, when factoring in convenience, time savings, and transactional certainty and speed.\n\nAfter remittances, BTM users report using Bitcoin to an almost equal extent for investing or making online purchases. A minority of users also report using Bitcoin as a store of value or converting it into another form of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). These reports are at odds with most research and news articles that show investment as the leading reason for buying or holding cryptocurrency among consumers overall (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Arkana and Li 2023; Tompor 2018; Luthi 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the U.S. Bitcoin ATM Industry Operates\n\nCustomers pay high fees to use a BTM, on top of a possible exchange fee. The median fee for buying Bitcoin from a BTM, as self-reported by BTM operators in the United States, is 16 percent of the value of the transaction (Coin ATM Radar 2023). When selling Bitcoin, the median fee (again, self-reported) is 15 percent (Coin ATM Radar 2023). Sometimes added to these usage fees are unfavorable exchange rates derived from the operator charging above-market prices for the Bitcoin. Hearsay evidence puts exchange rate costs at between 5 and 7 percent of the value of the transaction (Knight 2023). In total, fees of 20 percent may not be uncommon.\n\nBecause the total cost of operating a BTM is estimated at only 3 to 6 percent of revenue, Bitcoin ATMs are a high-margin industry for operators (Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). Operator costs can be roughly broken into \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d costs. The direct costs are the BTM machines, the rent for their locations, and the cryptocurrency transacted. BTMs are usually bought new or used, but they can also be rented. Operators must also maintain Bitcoin and cash balances to run their BTMs, usually by buying the Bitcoin from an over-the-counter dealer (Coin ATM Radar 2023; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Thinking Crypto 2023).\n\nThe main indirect or overhead cost of operating a BTM is regulatory compliance. BTMs are basically money services businesses and therefore are supposed to follow state and federal rules related to the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) rules (BitAML 2019; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021). Many BTM suppliers provide guides and documents to new BTM owners to manage compliance on their own. Large operators have their own staffs to handle regulatory compliance, and some third-party businesses do all AML work for smaller BTM operators._ However, many BTM operators do little or nothing to comply with existing regulations (PYMNTS 2022; Thomson Reuters 2022; State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of the U.S. Bitcoin ATM Industry\n\nThe lack of data makes it hard to determine the size of the Bitcoin ATM industry in the United States. However, the number of BTMs, the number of operators, and revenue can give a broad outline.\n\nThe total number of BTMs in use varies widely depending on the data source. For example, Coin ATM Radar reports 30,712 BTMs in operation as of July 2023. However, the website \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d reports 67,962 BTMs as of January 2023. A very rough approximation of the number of BTMs may be the average of the two figures: 49,337 BTMs. (See the appendix for more information on these data.)\n\nData on the number of U.S. BTM operators are again scarce and probably inaccurate. \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d reports only 19 operators. In contrast, Coin ATM Radar reports 220 operators; however, this number is still likely on the low side given that some operators do not record their presence on this website. The United States may have significantly more than 220 BTM operators, especially considering the potential for numerous small operators with just a few BTMs (Coin ATM Radar 2023).\n\nAgain, data on revenue in the BTM industry are sparse and questionable. Based on industry and news sources, the industry average for monthly income from a BTM in the United States ranges between $5,000 and $7,250, resulting in an average of $6,125 (see the appendix for the derivation of these monthly figures). Multiplying the monthly income average ($6,125) by the estimated number of BTMs (49,337) results in an average monthly income across the industry of $302,189,125\u2014an estimated annual revenue of $3.63 billion, though this is only an approximate figure. If the usual fee involved in a transaction is 16 percent, consumers buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at BTMs must spend $22.69 billion in cash in a year to produce this annual industry revenue.\n\nThe rapid growth of the BTM industry in the United States was significantly affected by the 2022 \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d when cryptocurrency prices declined dramatically. Growth in the industry came to a halt, with some retrenchment before the number of BTMs stabilized (Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). The operator of Coin Cloud ATMs, for example, filed for bankruptcy in early 2023, removing thousands of BTMs from use in the United States (CoinCodeCap 2023).\n\nNevertheless, some BTM operators are expanding, notably Bitcoin Depot, which became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ in July 2023, with a market cap of around $45 million. In early 2023, Bitcoin Depot started a partnership with convenience store chain GetGo to install BTMs in its stores (Dworski 2023). At the same time, Coinhub entered into agreements with gas stations and convenience stores to host its BTMs (Coinhub Bitcoin ATM 2023). By mid-2023, the overall number of BTMs began to grow again (Sarkar 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks of Bitcoin ATMs\n\nThe BTM industry has been charged repeatedly with predatory and illicit behavior, gaining a reputation that may eventually affect consumer use as well as future regulation. BTM operators have already formed the Cryptocurrency Compliance Cooperative to get ahead of potential conflicts with regulators and law enforcement (Partz 2021).\n\nThe industry is most often charged with \u201cpredatory inclusion,\u201d or disguising high-risk, high-cost services as ways for the financially disadvantaged to gain entry to lucrative financial investments. Some argue that BTMs are marketed to the unbanked, low-income, and migrant communities, consumers who tend to use cash more often. Further, cryptocurrencies are marketed as an investment that can be purchased without a broker or bank account, with effectively no minimum dollar amount, and with the potential for large returns. However, the volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the transaction fees involved are not clearly presented (Tompor 2018; Knight 2023; Peters 2020; Luthi 2022; U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022; Mika 2023).\n\nLaw enforcement have received reports of scam victims being directed to send money to scammers through BTMs. Victims are usually sent a QR code (the scammer\u2019s digital wallet address) and directed to go to a BTM, convert cash into cryptocurrency, and send it to the address provided. These funds are unrecoverable. Chainalysis reports that BTMs are the source of around 1 percent of payments by scam victims, reaching over $35 million in 2022 (TRM 2023; U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022; FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center 2021; Chainalysis 2023).\n\nAccording to one report, BTMs are the most common way to launder money, with an individual BTM operator able to process tens of millions of dollars in dirty cash (TRM 2023). The relative anonymity of transactions, along with the speed, convenience, and irreversibility of the cash-to-crypto conversion make BTMs ideal for money launderers. Cash from illicit activities is converted into cryptocurrency and sent to a wallet that serves as an off-ramp for the illicit funds via an online exchange (TRM 2023; Thomson Reuters 2022; State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar U.S. BTM industry, built on a cash-to-crypto service, continues to grow, with the number of BTMs increasing after the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d retrenchment. Despite high fees attached to BTMs, consumers seem likely to use them\u2014perhaps for remittances, investment, or both.\n\nGrowth in the industry should not obscure charges of predatory and illicit behavior. Given the size of the Bitcoin ATM industry in the United States, the losses to uneducated crypto investors using BTMs to purchase volatile cryptocurrencies could be substantial. Further, the industry\u2019s role in facilitating money laundering and scams may pose significant risks to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix: Notes on U.S. BTM Industry Data and Calculations\n\nNumber of BTMs\n\nOnly two sources exist for nationwide data on BTMs, and both have some reliability issues. The website \u201cCoin ATM Radar\u201d covers many aspects of the U.S. BTM industry, but all data on the site are self-reported by operators, who get exposure and free marketing for their businesses. Data are not comprehensive, as some large operators and perhaps many small BTM operators do not report to the website.\n\nThe other source of data on the U.S. BTM industry is \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs,\u201d a website run by an anonymous group of researchers who use \u201ccompany websites and official directories\u201d as their sources. These data sources appear to leave out large BTM operators that appear on Coin ATM Radar. Further obscuring the data on \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d is whether a Bitcoin ATM is defined as a BTM, as a retailer providing an over-the-counter service, or both. The potential inclusion of non-BTM operations likely inflates the number provided.\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nGiven sparse and questionable revenue data, perhaps the best way to get a sense of the industry\u2019s overall revenue is by first estimating the revenue per BTM and then combining it with the number of BTMs we estimate. For this, we use information from the publicly traded Bitcoin Depot and estimates put forth by other sources to try to determine the revenue per BTM.\n\nVarious sources have put the estimated monthly revenue of a BTM as between $1,000 and $10,000, depending on use and transaction volume (ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). This gives a midpoint monthly revenue per BTM of $5,000.\n\nIf we assume that a Bitcoin Depot BTM earns at an industry average (a big assumption), we may be able to get a more focused number. Using their 2021 revenue of $548,980,000 and an estimated 6,300 BTMs in the United States, we calculate the average monthly income per BTM was $7,262 (Yahoo! Finance 2023; Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023; Bitcoin Depot 2021)."

        "title": "Gold vs. Bitcoin: Which is a better investment? - CBS News",
        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nWhich investment option is right for you depends on your risk tolerance, strategy and timeline. /Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, both gold and Bitcoin have become popular investment options. While gold has for centuries been a traditional go-to investment, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have gained traction among investors looking to cash in on the latest trends.\n\nWhich is right for you? The answer depends on your investment strategy and preferences.\n\nLearn more about gold investing with a free information kit.\n\nGold vs. Bitcoin: Which is a better investment?\n\nTo determine whether gold or Bitcoin is the better investment for you, you must first understand how the two compare.\n\nGold\n\nGold offers several perks, as well as a few downsides.\n\nPros\n\nGold has been a trusted investment for centuries. It's recognized as a safe haven in times of economic crisis and is widely considered a hedge against inflation.\n\nGold's value is not tied to any governmental or economic system. In fact, when financial turmoil causes stock prices to drop and currency to weaken, gold prices often increase, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from losses.\n\nFinally, gold is rare. There is a limited supply of it, and we cannot produce more when it runs out. And since gold is used in everything from jewelry to electronics, it is always in demand. While prices might fluctuate in the short term, they tend to remain relatively stable over time. This makes gold a solid long-term investment that can provide you with peace of mind and safeguard your portfolio.\n\nCons\n\nDespite its benefits, gold does have downsides. While it generates steady returns, these returns are typically modest, making gold better for wealth preservation than wealth generation. You shouldn't keep more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in gold so you have room for other assets, such as stocks, to create bigger returns.\n\nIn addition, if you choose to invest in physical gold, you must store is securely and insure it, which adds to your costs.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new investment option that's wildly popular among tech enthusiasts and trend-watchers. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency (known as cryptocurrency) that operates independently of central banks and is powered by blockchain technology. It also has its perks and downsides.\n\nPros\n\nOne of Bitcoin's biggest attractions is the possibility to generate large returns quickly. While gold has been a stable investment over time, Bitcoin has skyrocketed in value \u2014 at times, precipitously. For example, in January 2019, 1 Bitcoin was worth about $3,800. By November 2021, it was worth up to over $60,000.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is purely digital. It has no physical form and is bought and sold electronically on a variety of platforms and exchanges. This makes Bitcoin transactions fast and straightforward, which can be appealing to investors.\n\nStart exploring your gold investment options \u2014 request your free investors kit today!\n\nCons\n\nHowever, with the potential for huge rewards comes the potential for huge losses. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, with sharp upswings and downswings, and timing is everything. And, it can be hard to predict where prices are heading. For investors who prefer a known commodity with a long track record to rely on, gold is the safer bet.\n\nIn addition, many investors are hesitant to invest in Bitcoin due to its relative newness. It isn't widely accepted as a currency, and you must learn some confusing jargon to understand it. Plus, the lack of regulation makes it ripe for scams. And even if your account remains secure, you can lose everything if you misplace your digital wallet or private key.\n\nWhich investment is better?\n\nWhen it comes to deciding between gold and Bitcoin, you must weigh the pros and cons of each. Which is better for you depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals and preferences.\n\nGold is generally best suited for investors who prioritize stability and are focused on long-term goals. It doesn't require constantly monitoring the news or engaging in risky speculation.\n\nBitcoin is better for investors willing to take on a high level of risk for potentially high returns. If you like the thrill of trying to time the market and you can comfortably afford to lose a large amount if you time it wrong, Bitcoin might be worth considering.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nGold and Bitcoin offer different benefits and drawbacks. Bitcoin is a more volatile investment that may provide quick returns, while gold is relatively stable but has limited growth potential. Understanding each investment's pros and cons is necessary to decide which is better for you. Ultimately, it comes down to your risk tolerance, goals and investment timeline.\n\nRegardless of which option you choose, it's essential to do your research and keep your overall investment strategy in mind. When in doubt, a financial advisor can help you."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETF\u2019s False ESG Claims\n\nThis decision could pave the way for new investment products that further impede efforts to meet our climate goals. Before jumping on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon, financial institutions need to do their due diligence on Bitcoin\u2019s climate risk and its disastrous impact on communities.\n\nWashington, DC (August 30, 2023)\u2013Yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale Investments in a lawsuit against the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which had denied the company\u2019s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange traded fund (ETF). The ruling will require that Grayscale resubmit their application and that it goes back to the SEC for review. In response to the decision, Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead, said: \u201cThis decision could pave the way for new investment products that further impede efforts to meet our climate goals. Before jumping on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon, financial institutions need to do their due diligence on Bitcoin\u2019s climate risk and its disastrous impact on communities. Bitcoin is using as much energy as entire countries, most of it derived from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Bitcoin ETFs have been gaining momentum as a potential way for Bitcoin to become more mainstream, with devastating consequences for the planet. Recently, Jacobi Asset Managements attached an ESG label to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in Europe, shocking environmental experts who have been sounding the alarm about Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive mining process.\n\nJacobi claims that its ETF is compliant with EU rules about ESG investments based on purchasing renewable energy certificates (REC) to offset the emissions from the fund\u2019s bitcoin holdings. In a recent Bloomberg article, Matthew Brander, a senior lecturer in carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh Business School, says using RECs to fulfill a decarbonization strategy \u201cisn\u2019t credible.\u201d\n\nIn response to Jacobi Asset Managements Bitcoin ETF, Archer said: \u201cAttempts to label a Bitcoin ETF as an ESG investment are a deception. Buying a renewable energy certification doesn\u2019t translate to a meaningful reduction in the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and its substantial carbon emissions. It\u2019s greenwashing and it fails to address the genuine challenges of decarbonization and cleaning up Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAs the SEC evaluates numerous applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, it is imperative for regulators to tread with caution. The SEC\u2019s decision to green light or reject a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. should encompass a thorough evaluation of its potential climate impact and risks. Given the significant carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining, a comprehensive assessment of the environmental implications and climate risks should be taken into account while considering an ETF\u2019s approval. Ignoring the broader consequences of such investments could risk perpetuating unsustainable practices and hinder the progress toward reducing climate destruction.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], (631) 404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "title": "Is It Time to Sell Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.29%) has been volatile lately. After hovering near the $30,000 mark for several weeks, a handful of mildly bearish news items drove the largest crypto down to $26,000. Then, a helpful legal verdict briefly pushed Bitcoin past $28,000 again.\n\nThese unpredictable price swings beg the question -- is it time to buy Bitcoin at a reasonable price, or time to sell before the coin takes a swan dive?\n\nLet's take a look at both sides of the Bitcoin.\n\nReasons to sell Bitcoin today\n\nBitcoin bears have a few arguments in favor of cashing in their coins and moving on. For example:\n\nCryptocurrencies started 2023 in fine form, but the rally ran out of steam. The ups and downs of the last five months added up to nothing: Current Bitcoin prices also prevailed in the middle of May. Ergo, the bull run is over and the only way is down.\n\nMaster investors like Warren Buffett still don't see any value in digital currencies. Bitcoin is just a speculative gamble to the Oracle of Omaha, and he's a financial genius. He can't be wrong in the long run, right?\n\nThe long-awaited breakthroughs in regulations and legal codes are still conspicuously absent. You can't expect institutional investors and other heavyweights to put real money into Bitcoin until there's a robust governmental framework for owning and trading it. It's time to give up, since lawmakers and regulators keep dragging their feet.\n\nBitcoin is a bunch of numbers, automatically managed by computer programs. Where's the substance? This silly digital contraption shouldn't be worth thousands of dollars per token, because it doesn't really do anything.\n\nOh, and the immunity from inflation that many bulls hold up as a great reason to own this digital coin is just an illusion. The lifetime cap of 21 million Bitcoins is just a single value in the system management code, easily changed and forgotten.\n\nReasons to buy Bitcoin nowadays\n\nOn the other hand, bullish Bitcoin investors have plenty of arguments to fuel their digital fires:\n\nShort-term chart squiggles don't mean much in the long run, and past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Whether the Bitcoin market moves up or down from here, the stalled pricing in the middle of 2023 won't mean much to future Bitcoin investors. But the leading crypto shows market-beating returns over the last three or five years, and the gap only grows if you stretch the timeline further. The Bitcoin community is building a game-changing financial tool here, and it shows in the sustained creation of long-term value.\n\nBuffett is indeed an investing genius, but he would also be the first to tell you that he makes mistakes, too. In particular, he has been known to stay away from market-beating winners such as Amazon AMZN 0.96% ) Apple AAPL 1.32% )\n\nThe legal wheels may grind slowly, but they do keep on moving. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuit against XRP 's XRP -0.15% ) has moved on to precedent-setting appeals and trials, with strong support for treating (at least some) cryptos more like currencies than securities. In another legal case, the SEC has been ordered to stop kicking the can and finally review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust 's GBTC -2.09% )\n\n's has moved on to precedent-setting appeals and trials, with strong support for treating (at least some) cryptos more like currencies than securities. In another legal case, the SEC has been ordered to stop kicking the can and finally review the 's Bitcoin is an advanced system for managing transactions and the value each contract represents. It keeps a publicly available record of financial actions on the open internet, protected by a complex system of encryption and a safety-in-numbers approach to transaction security. In Bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain network, you can't roll back or duplicate transactions unless you control more than half of the global network of Bitcoin's mining nodes. That's an impossibly expensive idea. And this public yet ultra-secure system offers lower fees and faster resolution of transactions than traditional banking services. The blockchain ledger is a real and useful business tool.\n\nOh, and the large-scale computing requirements that protect Bitcoin's transactions play a similar role in protecting the anti-inflation cap. In order to change that value, you'd have to convince the owners of more than half of the world's Bitcoin miner machinery to dilute the value of their own current and future Bitcoin holdings. It would also undermine public trust in the whole Bitcoin system -- and cryptocurrencies at large. I don't see that happening.\n\nRisks, meet rewards: Bitcoin is a solid long-term investment right now\n\nThere's a solid counterargument to every bearish complaint, but I'm not so sure about rebuttals for the bullish arguments. So I'm keeping a close eye on the legal developments and changes on the technical side of things, fully expecting the general price trend to continue upward in the long run. And we haven't even looked at upcoming value drivers such as the \"halvening\" of 2024 and rising interest in decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe conclusion is clear. This would be a terrible time to sell all your Bitcoin and walk away from the crypto market. If anything, Bitcoin's lull looks like a buying opportunity. Given the long-term value creation and advancements on the regulatory front, betting against Bitcoin now may be a decision you'll regret in 2024 and beyond."

In response to this decision, Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead, said: \u201cAcross the country, Bitcoin mining companies have tried to make families foot the bill for Bitcoin\u2019s enormous energy consumption. Kentucky regulators\u2019 recent decision to reject a cryptocurrency mining subsidy sends a powerful message that the needs of average energy consumers are more important than crypto profits. The proposed Bitcoin mine in Kentucky had the potential to burden ratepayers further at a time of growing energy prices and extend the Big Sandy gas plant\u2019s life cycle until the distant year of 2041. This decision is a significant step forward, but Ebon International\u2019s proposed mining facility remains a threat to our efforts to avert the worst consequences of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining facilities cause enormous amounts of pollution and are a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. Kentucky has taken a good first step to stop this one Bitcoin mine from exploiting and polluting a community. However, the real issue lies in Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive consensus mechanism and the tactics utilized by Bitcoin miners. Until Bitcoin moves to a less energy-intensive code, companies like Ebon International will move from one community to another searching for more opportunities to exploit communities and delaying progress on climate change.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], (631) 404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "Michael Rihani is holding a bitcoin-emblazoned basketball in his hands.\n\nIt\u2019s a ball commemorating the Bitcoin Classic, a tournament sponsored by Cash App, during which champions are rewarded \u2014 in bitcoin, of course. Rihani explains how this piece of sports memorabilia ties into the fintech company\u2019s mission, which is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping customers touch and feel bitcoin, even though it can feel like magic internet money,\u201d Rihani said.\n\n\n\nCash App\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin isn\u2019t something that can be held in one\u2019s hands \u2014 but still, its impact is tangible. Alongside his peers at Cash App, Rihani, who works as a bitcoin product lead, supports the company\u2019s efforts to help consumers see bitcoin\u2019s potential for themselves by meeting them where they are, whether that\u2019s at a basketball court or a grocery store, so that they can see the digital currency\u2019s potential for themselves. Because although Rihani may have referred to bitcoin as feeling like \u201cmagic internet money,\u201d there\u2019s a lot more at work than meets the eye.\n\nBitcoin Engineering Manager Milly Rowett describes bitcoin as an alternative currency created \u201cby the people, for the people,\u201d rooted in computer code and mathematics.\n\nYet despite its humanistic origin, Rowett admits that the way bitcoin works is inherently complex, which can feel exclusionary for everyday people.\n\nTAPPING INTO BITCOIN\u2019S POTENTIAL According to Rowett, while Cash App is not yet available outside of the United States and the U.K., the product holds the potential to accelerate bitcoin\u2019s move to a day-to-day currency, which would greatly benefit emerging markets, such as Nigeria and Argentina. In places such as these, government-issued currency, or fiat currency, is susceptible to hyperinflation and government seizure. Bitcoin would allow these markets to exchange currency freely and quickly. \u201cNo one controls bitcoin,\u201d Rihani added. \u201cNo one can compromise the system because of its decentralized nature. Everyone is on the same playing field.\u201d\n\nIn order to demystify bitcoin and its influence, Bitcoin Brand Lead Maria Pesce and her creative teammates aim to humanize it through approachable, digestible and even playful branding.\n\n\u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be this jargon-y concept that\u2019s exclusionary, as if you have to read an entire encyclopedia to understand it,\u201d she said. Her team at Cash App also creates educational content to explain the currency, including an illustrated children\u2019s book called My First Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Pesce\u2019s team embraces unconventional initiatives to reinforce bitcoin\u2019s accessibility and creativity, Rihani and Rowett focus on building a product that\u2019s easy to understand and impactful. All of these efforts, from engineering to product design to marketing, are intended to \u201cgive the product soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney can be a very stressful and personal topic,\u201d Rihani explained. \u201cWe try to make it interesting and fun both within the product and outside of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney can be a very stressful and personal topic. We make it interesting and fun.\u201d\n\nCash App\n\nReframing the Culture of Bitcoin\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to a bitcoin conference, it\u2019s easy to feel out of place,\u201d Pesce said.\n\nExcessive displays of wealth have been a fixture of the bitcoin scene for the past decade, reinforcing the idea that digital currency is solely for the eccentric billionaire, not the average person with a nine-to-five job. Cash App wants to turn this on its head by establishing what bitcoin would look and feel like if it was actually for everyone.\n\nPesce said the company is striving to reinvent the wheel when it comes to bitcoin marketing. For instance, it\u2019s easy to have someone speak at a conference and regurgitate the same futuristic talking points, but let\u2019s take it a step further and get outside the four walls of a conference room. During the Bitcoin Miami conference, Cash App created an actual marketplace filled with local vendors and popular brands while gifting passersby with bitcoin so they could use it in the market as a currency and experience it for themselves.\n\nCash App\n\n\u201cIt was a curated space that created a low-stakes way for everyday people to get bitcoin in their hands and experiment with what the future could look like,\u201d Pesce said.\n\nA part of Cash App\u2019s plan to reach more communities involves humanizing bitcoin. From iconic Rucker Park basketball tournaments, to inspiring creatives of bitcoin\u2019s potential at NYFW, to collaborating with artists at Art Basel, Cash App is inserting bitcoin into subcultures that it hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to thrive in yet.\n\n\u201cI feel like Cash App has a unique essence and flair that makes us as a brand stand out in the financial space,\u201d she said. \u201cCreatively we\u2019re always trying to push visual limits and connect with our customers in an authentic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreatively we\u2019re always trying to push visual limits and connect with our customers in an authentic way. \u201d\n\nCash App\n\nSimplicity is Key\n\nBehind the vibrant, inclusive design, the technology that powers Cash App\u2019s platform is what has made the company an innovator in the fintech space.\n\nAccording to Rowett, the company is continuously breaking ground in the engineering realm. As a part of Block, the global technology company with a focus on financial services, Cash App has access to some of the industry\u2019s most innovative organizations, including the bitcoin open-source development nonprofit Spiral.\n\nLast year, Spiral, another part of the Block ecosystem, created the Lightning Development Kit, which was used by Cash App\u2019s engineers to launch support of the bitcoin Lightning Network product. This product is designed to facilitate instant, scalable, lower-cost transactions, which is radically changing the bitcoin landscape.\n\nCash App\n\nWhile the technology that powers the company\u2019s products may sound complicated in nature to some consumers, Rihani and his teammates ensure that the impact is easy to understand. He said the company\u2019s product is designed to be as approachable as possible by rejecting technical jargon and relying on a simple UX instead.\n\nRihani also considers the company\u2019s offerings to be accessible, particularly the Bitcoin Roundups feature, which allows consumers to invest in bitcoin through their everyday purchases. For example, if a Cash App Card holder buys a coffee for $3.50, that purchase will round up to $4, with the extra $0.50 automatically invested into bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re curious and want to experiment with and learn a little bit about bitcoin, you don\u2019t need to make this big, stressful commitment,\u201d Rihani said. \u201cYou can just flip a switch and ease into it with Cash App.\u201d\n\nINHERENTLY GLOBAL Bitcoin is inherently global, given its decentralized nature, so it only makes sense that Cash App employs individuals from across the world to harness its power. With a distributed team spread across North and South America, Europe and Australia and hailing from countries including El Salvador, Lebanon and Brazil, the company has a wide range of diverse perspectives to help refine its bitcoin technology and brand. In fact, many team members came to Cash App with more bitcoin curiosity than hands-on experience, and Rowett explained that those perspectives are brought to light in cross-functional collaboration, which the company relies on to bring its global team members together for carrying projects across the finish line.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re Just Getting Started\u2019\n\nCash App\u2019s mission to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money\u201d will take some time to accomplish. But time doesn\u2019t deter from the excitement Rihani and others feel when they talk about the future; it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nIn line with its mission, the company wants to bring the power of its app to people outside of the United States. In Rowe\u2019s mind, this feat will require careful thought and ample people power to continuously refine its approach.\n\n\u201cWe are essentially disrupting ourselves when you think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe future is incredibly bright, but it\u2019s also like riding a rollercoaster.\u201d\n\nCash App\n\nRowett added that the fast-paced nature of the bitcoin landscape, coupled with its immaturity, make it an especially energizing environment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something happening,\u201d she mused. \u201cI imagine this is what it felt like to be working on the early internet. We feel like a pioneer front-running the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine this is what it felt like to be working on the early internet. We feel like a pioneer front-running the industry.\u201d\n\nWith several key projects in the works \u2014 such as a bitcoin wallet with both hardware and mobile components, called Bitkey \u2014 Block is at a pivotal stage in its growth. For both existing employees and those who join Cash App over the next year, these undertakings unlock the opportunity to build a future beyond what anyone can imagine.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is so much bigger than us,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cWe\u2019re really building the foundation for something that the next generation will hopefully experience and utilize daily.\u201d\n\nPesce, who considers her work at the company to be \u201cone of the biggest marketing challenges of her career,\u201d acknowledges the roadblocks that come with working on a new digital asset class. Nevertheless, she considers the work to be \u201cconsuming, powerful and influential.\u201d\n\nFor Rihani, working at Cash App isn\u2019t just exhilarating from a professional standpoint. He believes the work they do has the potential to help people across the globe \u2014 including his loved ones.\n\nHe said his family and friends in Lebanon have lost 98 percent of their finances due to hyperinflation, and they\u2019re far from the only ones to be affected by a volatile financial system. By supporting bitcoin, he feels he\u2019s doing his part to help others achieve economic stability, one feature update at a time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re literally paving the path for bitcoin, which is scary at times but also very rewarding,\u201d Rihani said. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive opportunity to help billions of people all over the world, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\n"

Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neomi Rao ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must abandon its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to the exchange traded fund structure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the ruling compels the SEC to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs \u2013 arguably the most desired product in U.S. ETF industry history \u2013 but experts believe that\u2019s exactly what the ruling implies. After all, Rao wrote her in her opinion that it\u2019s \"arbitrary and capricious\" that the SEC continues stifling GBTC conversion efforts after approving futures-based bitcoin ETFs several years ago.\n\nIndeed, the ruling is \u201ckind of a big deal\u201d and the reasoning behind that statement is easy to understand. Score of ETF issuers have filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. Should that structure gain regulatory approval, those funds will create substantial demand for the largest cryptocurrency \u2013 pertinent because bitcoin supply is fixed at 21 million.\n\nTranslation: New demand for bitcoin could lead to more constrained supply, in turn sending prices higher. Should that scenario play out as expected, other established crypto-correlated ETFs stand to benefit. Here are a few to consider.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO)\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) already proved its leverage to the possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF coming to market, surging nearly 13% on Tuesday following Judge Rao\u2019s ruling. SATO, which follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, allocates 15.70% of its weight, making a predictable, potent winner should the index fund convert to ETF status.\n\nAdditionally, the bulk of the rest of the SATO lineup are bitcoin miners equities \u2013 stocks that are intimately correlated to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price action. In other words, there\u2019s a lot to like with SATO should spot bitcoin ETFs be approved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s excellent that the judge in the Greyscale vs SEC case was able to see the obvious correlation between Bitcoin futures and spot price. Products like Grayscale\u2019s holdings have converted to ETFs in other commodity markets, and it makes no sense to treat crypto differently,\u201d said Greg Moritz, Chief Operating Officer at AltTab Capital, in a statement. \u201cRules for financial markets need to be based on data, not arbitrary and capricious sentiment toward a legitimate and growing asset class.\u201d\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an index-based ETF that turned two years old in May. Its approach is comparable to that of SATO in that it\u2019s chock full of crypto-correlated stocks, including miners and exchange operators such as Coinbase (COIN).\n\nIndeed, BITQ\u2019s lineup is small with just 27 holdings, but it\u2019s potentially mighty when it comes to leverage to a spot bitcoin ETF coming to fruition \u2013something that could happen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the SEC will act as kingmaker and the most likely outcome is a block approval of applications that meet requirements, probably in Q1\u201924,\u201d noted Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group. \u201cThe level of pent up institutional and retail demand in the US is significant and we expect this to have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin as can be seen from today\u2019s price reaction, as well as further accelerate the global trend towards acknowledging crypto as a new asset class.\u201d\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF (BKCH)\n\nThe Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) follows the Solactive Blockchain Index and as its name implies, its point of emphasis is blockchain technology. The good news there is blockchain has expansive applications beyond crypto, but BKCH still has credibility as a spot bitcoin ETF beneficiary.\n\nThat much is confirmed by the fact that the Global X ETF is up 7.45% over the past week, indicating it benefit from the appellate court ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark legal win for crypto against the US regulator,\u201d said deVere Group CEO Nigel Green in a new report. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Little evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF would expand the market - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nYou don\u2019t have to want to invest in bitcoin to be in favour of US regulators giving their approval to a bitcoin exchange traded fund. You can disapprove of other people putting their money into the cryptocurrency but defend the idea that the Securities and Exchange Commission should let them. Perhaps not to the death \u2014 we don\u2019t need to go all Voltaire about this \u2014 but you get the idea.\n\nApplications for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 a fund that would actually hold bitcoin directly as opposed to investing in derivatives tied to the bitcoin price \u2014 have been consistently rejected by the SEC over the past decade.\n\nBut a court ruling this week looks to have changed the picture. A judge ruled that the regulator acted capriciously in denying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s request to convert to an ETF, given futures-based bitcoin funds are already available.\n\nThe ruling added to excitement about spot bitcoin ETFs that has been building since June when BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, put in its own application to launch one. Surely, crypto enthusiasts reasoned, well-connected BlackRock would not be making such a request unless it knew the regulator was thawing its position?\n\nThere were specific reasons to think BlackRock will be able to break the logjam. Its application included a plan for a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d arrangement with a crypto exchange, to deal with the SEC\u2019s concern that nefarious traders could manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the ETF\u2019s investors. Other asset managers, including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark, have amended their pending bitcoin ETF applications to copy the BlackRock plan.\n\nThe bitcoin price shot up 20 per cent in a week after the BlackRock news in June, and was up 7 per cent on Tuesday\u2019s court victory by Grayscale, as traders bet the launch of an ETF will tempt in a rash of new buyers.\n\nPersonally, I am tiring of the 15-year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself. It has been sad to watch a generation of young people lured into cryptocurrency trading instead of learning the long-term investment techniques that build wealth. It\u2019s been enraging to watch the explosion of get-rich-quick products labelled \u201cdecentralised finance\u201d when so many are just Ponzi schemes hiding in plain sight. To see some of the more egregious purveyors of this financial snake oil being hauled before the courts has been pleasing but it\u2019s surprising, frankly, to see the \u201cvalue\u201d of bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies remain above $1tn despite the cascading failures of the past year.\n\nBut who am I to disagree with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink\u2019s view \u2014 recently acquired \u2014 that bitcoin is an \u201cinternational asset\u201d for investors to \u201cplay\u201d as an alternative to gold or currencies such as the euro or sterling? His group\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF will probably have lower fees than the current futures-based funds in the US, and provide a better guarantee of doing what it says on the tin \u2014 tracking the price of bitcoin \u2014 than alternatives such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which, as currently structured, has swung as far as 50 per cent in either direction from its net asset value. For people who feel they must \u201cplay\u201d, spot bitcoin ETFs will be safer, cheaper, simpler products, and the benefits of protecting people who have already been lured in to cryptocurrency outweigh the risk of luring in more.\n\nTraders already have a cornucopia of crypto vehicles to pick from on US exchanges, from \u201c2x leveraged\u201d bitcoin funds using derivatives to stock funds stuffed with highly speculative companies that have cryptocurrency or blockchain investments of their own. By comparison, a spot bitcoin fund looks positively vanilla.\n\nMore generally, ETFs are home to a dazzling array of bad investment ideas, even more so now that actively managed funds are crowding in after the index trackers that established the product.\n\nI am tiring of the 15 year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself\n\nThe flipside is that fund managers have become more inclined to close funds when an investment fad fizzles, says Todd Rosenbluth of VettaFi, a research firm. Casualties in recent months have included the Punk Subversive Metaverse ETF and the AdvisorShares Drone Technology ETF. BlackRock has no Midas touch, either. Last year, it shut a number of ETFs under the iShares Evolved brand that promised to use machine learning and analysis of font sizes in financial documents to sort stocks into sectoral funds ranging from consumer discretionary to \u201cinnovative healthcare\u201d. They had failed to gather significant assets.\n\nThere is scant evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF will expand the market at this point. BlackRock will put its marketing muscle behind the product, but I doubt it will be taking out Super Bowl commercials. Crypto trading was long ago \u201cdemocratised\u201d by Coinbase and other exchanges and the demos has drifted off. Those betting the debut of a spot bitcoin ETF will usher in a new bull market are just as likely to find it opens up short-selling opportunities that hold the price down.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou predicts a BlackRock launch will do little more than draw liquidity away from other products, notably bitcoin futures, in a zero-sum game. Spot bitcoin funds have existed for some time outside the US but have failed to attract large investor interest, he pointed out in a research note.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-year-old Purpose Bitcoin ETF in Canada has just $600mn in assets, for example, and bitcoin funds globally have not had significant inflows since mid-2021. Spot bitcoin ETFs would be a perfectly inoffensive addition to the US market, though the SEC might find it is opening the stable door after the horse has died.\n\nStephen Foley is the FT\u2019s US accounting editor.

While the action potentially paves the way for the firm to attract a fresh wave of investors, there\u2019s just one thing: The product carries a 2% fee in its current form.

        "title": "Bitcoin: Bull vs. Bear - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A look at a price chart over the past decade would easily show that Bitcoin (BTC -0.36%) is, without a doubt, one of the best financial assets to have owned. It has skyrocketed from about $123 in August 2013 to just over $26,000 today. That's a ridiculous gain of more than 21,000% compared to the 283% rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nHowever, the ride up hasn't been smooth, as it's been full of volatility. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently 61% off its peak price. This might prompt some to eye this big discount to its all-time high as a potential buying opportunity.\n\nTo gain a better perspective of the situation, let's examine the bull and bear cases for the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nMassive upside\n\nIn the past three months, major asset management firms, like BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which haven't yet been available in the U.S. These large investment companies manage trillions of dollars on behalf of global client bases. And their involvement with Bitcoin might provide a stamp of approval for the crypto, which could introduce a massive inflow of fresh capital. That might provide the tailwind Bitcoin needs to reach new highs.\n\nAnother reason to be optimistic about this top digital asset is that there's a lot of upside potential should more people learn about and try to understand Bitcoin. It might appear overly complex, but Bitcoin's entire objective is to fix the issues that come about with government-controlled money, known as fiat currency. Some countries deal with hyperinflation, while almost all nations undergo ongoing money-printing measures to help deal with the huge and growing amounts of outstanding debt. In the U.S., this reality doesn't even include underfunded entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThis financial mismanagement by those in charge can't go on forever. Once people come to this conclusion, they'll naturally be drawn to owning Bitcoin. Its decentralization and fixed supply cap are the exact opposite traits of government money.\n\nThis leads to the next point, which is that the central bank can't keep raising rates forever, nor can it keep them this high for long. Interest payments will continue to make up a higher part of the government's budget. Consequently, the possibility that interest rates will eventually decline again can be a boon for riskier assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe risks are clear\n\nIf the U.S., the world's economic superpower, were to make it illegal to mine or own Bitcoin within its borders, then it would definitely deal a blow to the crypto. This would be possible by shutting down the major brokerages and exchanges, like Coinbase or Robinhood, and seriously restricting their activities. By limiting access to Bitcoin, its price could be under pressure as demand is weakened.\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin is just software. And as is the case with lines of computer code, there's the chance that a bug is eventually revealed. That's always a possibility, albeit a small one.\n\nIf the software revealed issues, it could undermine the Bitcoin network's security, which is its key feature. To its credit, Bitcoin hasn't been hacked in its more than 14 years of existence. But if something happened that caused everyone's private keys to be easily accessed, akin to bank accounts and passwords being exposed, then Bitcoin's price would crash as trust vanishes.\n\nAnother clear risk that might be overlooked is that interest in owning Bitcoin simply disappears. This could happen for several reasons, including the possibility that gold becomes even more attractive as a store of value, particularly for the younger and digitally native demographic. Interest could also wane if government money printing ceases to exist, as there would be less of a reason to find a solution to the current monetary system. In this scenario, Bitcoin would probably fall out of favor, and its price would decline.\n\nA compelling asset to own\n\nBitcoin's risks are important factors to keep in mind, especially when trying to gain a thorough understanding of this top digital asset. After all, there is still so much uncertainty going forward, with its ultimate outcome still a topic of huge debate.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that Bitcoin's bullish arguments outweigh the potential downside, a point of view that only strengthens with each passing year. I think investors who took the time to learn more would come to the same conclusion."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After an impressive rally to start off 2023, persistent macroeconomic uncertainties and other factors are taking some wind out of Bitcoin's (BTC -0.36%) sails. On Aug. 16, Bitcoin began to tumble, at one point shedding more than 10%, marking an end to a historically long period of record-low volatility.\n\nBitcoin's boom-and-bust cycles are well known, making the recent sell-off nothing surprising. But rather than projecting the likelihood of Bitcoin entering a new bull market and surpassing previous levels based on a hunch, we need to dig a little deeper to understand the inner workings of what makes Bitcoin unique and why today could be an opportune moment for investors to add more Bitcoin to their portfolios while it trades below $30,000.\n\nNew hash rate record\n\nBecause the crypto is a decentralized network with no single entity managing funds, Bitcoin holders should have confidence that the blockchain is secure. And based on recent trends, that confidence should be higher than ever.\n\nHash rate is a metric the quantifies Bitcoin's computational power. The greater the hash rate, the greater the security and strength of the network -- and it just recently hit an all-time high. Not only that, but it has consistently grown for more than a decade despite some ups and downs.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nA higher hash rate indicates more miners are joining the Bitcoin network with more powerful machines, thereby increasing the system's integrity. Even during a brutal bear market, this continuous growth is a testament to the network's resilience and reinforces Bitcoin's position as the most reliable and secure blockchain, a central aspect of its long-term value proposition.\n\nHistoric supply shortage\n\nAdding to Bitcoin's distinctness is a mechanism built into its code known as a halving. The halving is an event that occurs every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain (roughly every four years): The issuance rate awarded to miners for successfully mining a block is cut in half. Currently, the miner reward is 6.25 bitcoins, but in about eight months, the next halving will occur and reduce it to 3.125 bitcoins.\n\nObviously, the diminishing rate of Bitcoin's supply growth figures into the simple dynamics of supply and demand. As fewer bitcoins enter the market, assuming demand stays at least the same, prices should increase.\n\nAnother halving on the horizon might be reason enough to take advantage of Bitcoin's recent dip, yet data shows that the supply shock of this halving could be unlike any other in Bitcoin's history due to an additional factor.\n\nThe number of bitcoins on exchanges shows a clear trend of an increasing supply until March 2020, when supply peaked at nearly 3.2 million coins. At 2.2 million, the number of coins available today is the same as in the spring of 2018.\n\nThere are likely a handful of reasons behind this, but the most straightforward explanation involves the halving of Bitcoin's supply growth. Up until March 2020, the growth rate of Bitcoin seems to have outpaced demand, at least enough to cause bitcoins to pile up on exchanges. Yet after the most recent halving, in May 2020, the situation changed.\n\nWith the next halving set for April 2024, Bitcoin's available supply will likely face another shock and continue to dwindle. The current scarcity of Bitcoin combined with the decreasing pace of supply growth may cause Bitcoin's price to be pushed and pulled by the dynamics of supply and demand more than ever, making the recent dip below $30,000 a better opportunity to buy as investors remain focused on short-term instability."

During the show, Broyles laid out his Bitcoin investment thesis and his unique perspectives on how the asset\u2019s price could eventually rise into seven-figure territory.\n\nBroyles said that in 2020, he realized the bond market was broken. While searching for alternative investments, he discovered Bitcoin as a sound option. When asked about his Bitcoin investment strategy and how he stomachs the volatility, Broyles said:\n\n\u201cI do not own bonds. I have sold off 97% of my stocks over the past three years, and I\u2019m selling off the last 3% this week actually, so it\u2019s funny that you ask that. By the end of this week, the only three assets that I will own will be U.S. dollars, aka cash, the best political currency in the world; second, real estate; and third, Bitcoin. That\u2019s it. And I sleep better now than I did with a diversified portfolio.\u201d\n\nEverything is overpriced and should crash\n\nAnother key factor backing Broyles\u2019 Bitcoin investment thesis is his belief that \u201ceverything is overvalued, nothing makes sense, and everything should crash; however, we don\u2019t want to deal with it. Politicians don\u2019t want to deal with it. Lawyers don\u2019t want to deal with it. I, as a real estate investor, don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d Broyles believes that stocks, healthcare, real estate and the education industry are highly overvalued, so people are losing faith in the dollar and their dollar purchasing power \u2014 which highlights the allure of Bitcoin as a supply-capped asset.\n\n\u201cIf we have a credit unwind, of course we\u2019re going to print ourselves out of it.\u201d\n\nRelated: The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving\n\nWhen is it too late to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nWhen asked whether there is a particular price where it becomes \u201ctoo late\u201d for investors to consider buying Bitcoin, Broyles made the analogy of a sinking ship and suggested that for those on the boat, it\u2019s never too late to exit.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it ever too late to buy Bitcoin, but it will be too late to exit bonds and to exit fiat.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

        "content": "A federal appeals court handed Grayscale a monumental victory in its path to converting its bitcoin trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF. Crypto traders are doubling down on bullish sentiments as this decision could change the tide for broadened crypto asset exposures in the future.\n\nSwan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the volatility to come in the crypto market.\n\n\"Too many bulls... that think the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks,\" Yang says. \"I'm not sure we are going to see a launch of any bitcoin, I don't think we'll see we will be a launch of any spot bitcoin ETF before year-end and I'm happy to bet people on this, I've been... goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\"\n\nYang also comments on the potential for bitcoin price manipulation and how Wall Street firms like BlackRock (BLK) may adopt bitcoin ETF investments.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- So what do you think that then means for the price of crypto, the price of Bitcoin then, at least in the near term. Certainly sounds like we could see a lot of volatility if that is, in fact, the case.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: It, there will be some volatility as the market digests, and I believe comes around to my view that short term, there's too much hopium, there's too many crypto bulls and Bitcoin bulls who think that the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks. I'm not sure we're going to see a launch of any Bitcoin. I don't think we'll see a launch of any spot Bitcoin ETF before year end. And I'm happy to bet people on this, I've made been goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\n\n- Even with the cleanup that's happening within the space, you said that there's still a lot of price manipulation that's happening specifically on Bitcoin. We're seeing it trading above that $27,000 handle. What is the real value, you think, if the manipulation is still happening.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: So I think Bitcoin, the real value, is it's way undervalued. This is the best asymmetric upside, asset with asymmetric upside I've ever seen in my life, and I've been in finance many years. [CHUCKLES] But short term, who knows, because until the wash trading price manipulation and fraud is completely cleaned up.\n\nStory continues\n\nI do feel like if you look at the trading volumes they've gone down in Bitcoin, maybe because of US and Chinese authorities going after some of these Chinese exchanges like Binance, like Kobe, and the threat of that has made them not want to be as aggressive, I think, in their wash trading. So maybe the current volume is about right when you strip out the bump up in trading volume due to this recent Grayscale decision. But for some time, we've been seeing a pretty significant decline in trading volume.\n\n- Terrence, interest that we've seen from BlackRock, from Fidelity, just to name a few on the spot Bitcoin ETF here potentially for the future, how big of a catalyst is that going to be just in terms of wider adoption and getting more people to eventually potentially trust Bitcoin.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: Sure. Once they launch, especially those two plus Invesco which is the manager for QQQ, the very popular tech ETF, once those three launch, or any of those three launch, it will be a massive bullish sign where a flood of money should come into Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy? Because those three are three of the most respected traditional finance or tradfi companies in the world. They really know ETFs, they really know finance, they're respected by institutions, and high net worth and other folks as well. So once they are actually launching and offering Bitcoin ETFs, I think a flood of cash will come in.\n\nVery different from gold ETFs. Why? Because gold was around for thousands of years, accepted across all cultures as valuable. By the time the gold ETF came about it was like OK, this is great. There was a flood of cash that rushed into gold, gold because of gold ETFs, but I think with Bitcoin it's going to be like 10x bigger if not much more.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a teenager, it's considered a scam by some of the people I respect the most in my life, family members, extremely accomplished law school classmates, they don't get Bitcoin, and I think that's going to change within about a year."

        "content": "The crypto world is still reveling after Grayscale\u2019s unanimous court victory over the SEC this week. The decision, which saw an appeals court conclude that the SEC\u2019s refusal to grant Grayscale a Bitcoin ETF was arbitrary and unfounded, has resulted in a modest jump in crypto prices and no shortage of memes dunking on the SEC\u2019s embattled chairman, Gary Gensler.\n\nEveryone agrees the ruling was a much needed piece of good news for the crypto industry\u2014but what happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. For starters, the SEC has a 45-day window to appeal the decision to a larger panel of judges on the same D.C. court or to file an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. In this week\u2019s ruling, however, the three judges who issued the decision\u2014including the Obama-appointed chief justice\u2014issued such a sound spanking of the SEC\u2019s reasoning that the agency has no obvious grounds for appeal.\n\nThis means the SEC can either find another pretext to delay approving Bitcoin ETFs or simply fold its cards, take the loss, and save what\u2019s left of its capital for a different fight. As the Wall Street Journal noted in a withering editorial on the Grayscale decision, Gensler has already overplayed his hand:\n\n\u201cMr. Gensler is holding Bitcoin spot ETPs hostage in his crypto-market power grab. Until crypto exchanges register with the SEC, he won\u2019t authorize spot Bitcoin ETPs. Arbitrary regulation and regulatory overreaches are recurring themes of the Gensler SEC and the Biden administration. Is he trying to match Lina Khan\u2019s losing record at the Federal Trade Commission?\u201d\n\nGiven that an appeal is unlikely, the biggest wild card now is when and how the SEC approves the first Bitcoin ETF, which is widely expected to result in billions in new capital flowing into the crypto market. While Grayscale has been the face of the long-running legal fight, it is hardly the only one seeking to launch an ETF. Other firms petitioning the SEC to launch one include familiar names Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIn the case of BlackRock, the first deadline for the SEC to respond to the company\u2019s ETF application is this Saturday\u2014though a person familiar with the process says the company is expecting the agency will say it needs more time to examine the paperwork. The SEC already did this with another application, filed by crypto firm ARK, earlier this month. The upshot is that the crypto world must resign itself once again to the waiting game, and accept that the long-awaited capital infusion from an ETF approval will only come late this year\u2014or in 2024.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nRobinhood\u2019s crypto wallet, which initially supported only Ethereum-based tokens, rolled out capacities for Doge and Bitcoin, and will soon feature swaps.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped when a judge sided with Grayscale in its bid to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The possibility of an ETF is not the only thing to watch when it comes to the cryptocurrency though. Bitcoin is in a \"new world now,\" Axios Crypto Reporter Brady Dale tells Yahoo Finance Live. \"We're in a world that bitcoin has never seen before. What's different about this world is were no longer under zero interest rate policy,\" Dale says. Dale notes that it is normal to not be in a zero interest rate policy environment, but that \"it just hasn't been for a very long time.\"\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to regulation, Dale, who also wrote the book SBF: How The FTX Bankruptcy Unwound Crypto's Very Bad Good Guy, says that he thinks \"this SEC is going to fight crypto in every possible way it can, but Congress really wants to change the rules. And if Congress changes the rules, the SEC has to follow.\"\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- In terms of the tokens themselves, we do see analysts sort of on the fence about what's actually going to happen from here. There's always these very lofty valuations as to where Bitcoin is going to go, but what's the reality showing us right now?\n\nBRADY DALE: I love this question, Rachelle. So there's a really exciting answer to this question, I think. We are in a new world, at least in terms of Bitcoin now, that we're in a world that Bitcoin has never seen before. And what's different about this world is we're no longer under zero interest rate policy. Bitcoin was created under zero interest rate policy, every single boom we've had so far has been in a zero interest rate environment, and now there's actually yields that investors can get like off of treasuries. I mean, that's the thing everyone's got to compete with.\n\nAnd so Bitcoin has never been up against this environment before, it's a completely different world. I mean, it is the normal world. It's the way that investing has been in the United States for most of time, but it just hasn't been for a very long time since the Great Recession.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo the next big boom, I think it'll probably come. But it could be more muted this time because investors aren't piling into risk assets in quite the same way now that they have actual yields they can get off of treasuries again.\n\n- But does it take other cryptocurrencies with it or is it just all Bitcoin? And that is even though of course, is the largest market cap of the total crypto market cap right now, is it just zero sum Bitcoin after a ruling like this?\n\nBRADY DALE: Oh, I can't imagine a world in which a boom in Bitcoin doesn't yield a boom in everything else just like it always does, yeah.\n\n- Sure.\n\n- And we know that when it came to even classifying Bitcoin versus other cryptos as securities versus assets Bitcoin, has seemed to be in its own lane at the moment. Do we see that changing as we look at some of the potential regulation or sort of regulation by violation as we've been seeing when it comes to some of these exchanges and tokens? Do we expect more of that any standouts coming ahead for you?\n\nBRADY DALE: Well, I mean, the SEC's other big loss this year was its the decision on XRP where the courts found that XRP wasn't a security, which a lot of people have questions about that ruling and the SEC is going to try to appeal it, but we also have Congress looking to create a new definition for different kinds of cryptocurrencies. And so this world in which Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is not a security, it's hard to imagine that lasting forever. The question is just how long until a few other cryptocurrencies get the green light to trade normally like Bitcoin has.\n\n- And so is this for an industry that's saying regulate us, regulate us, regulate us so we know how we can move forward with the necessary boundaries, is this the first piece where we see this opening up a floodgate of other regulation that then paves the way for people to know how they can engage with and for companies who are trying to introduce assets to know how they can engage with consumers as well?\n\nBRADY DALE: Well, I still think this SEC is going to fight crypto in every possible way it can, but Congress really wants to change the rules. And if Congress changes the rules, SEC has to follow. So I guess, in terms of like really giving the industry a path forward, my bet is either on Congress acting or a new president. I don't know that Gary Gensler as SEC is ever going to like, create that path for cryptocurrency. So they have to wait a while if it's just a regulation question.\n\n- Does that mean crypto is on the ballot in '24?\n\nBRADY DALE: I mean, it's definitely a voting issue for some people. I don't think it's going to decide the election.\n\n- Not everybody, yeah."

        "title": "How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto is a volatile place. Money can be as easily lost as made through the ups and downs of Bitcoin and the wider market, and there are massive decisions to make. Should you just hodl \u2014 invest and do nothing \u2014 or actively trade the market? How many coins should your portfolio hold? Self-custody or keep your funds on an exchange with pre-determined stop losses?\n\nBasically, how do you protect your stack from the million and one things that can go wrong? We asked Bitcoin OGs and experts in the space for their advice and opinions.\n\nWalk before you can run\n\nWhen faced with the question of how best to protect your crypto, OG Brock Pierce is circumspect. The former presidential candidate and co-founder of Tether and Block.one points out that not everyone is in the same place.\n\n\u201cEarly noobs looking to begin their journey might go to Coinbase and purchase their first $20 or $50 worth of crypto, and it\u2019s not an investment in crypto, but an investment in yourself. However, the moment you have a material investment \u2013 and that is a different amount for everybody \u2013 then it\u2019s important to understand the basics of hodling and investing in crypto,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always better to walk before you can run, to walk in baby steps and don\u2019t let FOMO (fear of missing out) cloud your judgment. This is a marathon, a long game, so take you time and be informed.\u201d\n\nSelf-custody for safety\n\nPierce repeats the mantra, \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d This is one of the most widespread pieces of wisdom in the world of crypto, where people are encouraged to take responsibility for holding their own crypto rather than outsourcing it to an exchange that can get hacked.\n\nBut there are dangers with this approach, too, and if something goes wrong, there is no centralized bank authority to reset the passwords or refund money lost to scams. It\u2019s like holding cash under the mattress \u2014 the entire responsibility rests with you \u2014 and is referred to as self-custody in crypto.\n\nItai Avneri, deputy CEO and chief operating officer at INX Limited (Supplied)\n\nSelf-custody is the key to safe trading, according to Itai Avneri, deputy CEO and chief operating officer at INX Limited, the first and only fully regulated, end-to-end platform for listing and trading both SEC-registered security tokens and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cSelf-custody is the key here. Especially when thinking about digital securities and not just crypto. Trading on a centralized exchange that provides the confidence and protection of regulation and, at the same time, trading in a decentralized manner when the customer holds his / her own assets. Generally speaking, your wallet, your keys, your assets. This is the best way to protect yourself from a sudden hold on withdrawals or other events we witnessed in the past year,\u201d Avneri says.\n\nBut Bitcoin billionaire Tim Draper of Draper VC says that while that\u2019s true, institutions aren\u2019t keeping funds on a Ledger in a drawer.\n\n\u201cI no longer believe that my dollars in the bank are very safe. They are subject to political winds and inflation,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe safest personal money is BOL\u2014Bitcoin on Ledger. The safest institutional money is BAC\u2014 Bitcoin at Coinbase,\u201d Draper continues.\n\nTim Draper, founder of Draper VC, chatting with journalist Jillian Godsil.\n\nDiversification: Don\u2019t just buy eggs\n\nPierce points out that people advanced in sophistication can look at investigating yield farming or decentralized finance. This allows people to not only protect their crypto but also to look at increasing it through earning yields \u2014 but again, this involves risk.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of investing in your own education and notes the importance of diversification.\n\nBrock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation (Supplied)\n\n\u201cIf you are participating in those markets, then you by necessity take on the counterparty risk associated with those platforms, and how you mitigate those risks is through diversification, but not having all your eggs in one basket. If any one asset fell, it won\u2019t wreck (rekt) your entire portfolio.\u201d\n\nDiversification in crypto is tricky, as Bitcoin and the rest of the market tend to move up and down at the same time. But Pierce warns against putting too much money in more volatile coins, for example, memecoins, in case of a downturn where the pain will be magnified.\n\nAndrew Latham, a certified financial planner based in Rolesville, North Carolina and the director of content for financial websiteSuperMoney.com, echoes Pierce\u2019s restraint and suggests looking outside of crypto as well.\n\n\u201cThe key to surviving market downturns is diversification and a disciplined approach. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across various asset classes can help cushion against volatility. Keep a disciplined approach to crypto investing, focusing on long-term goals over short-term market fluctuations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd while crypto investing is often a little bit too interesting for its good, he says successful investing is often the opposite.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the old adage goes, \u2018Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas,\u2019\u201d Latham says.\n\nHigh-conviction bets\n\nSometimes, it makes sense to be overweight in a blue chip, market-leading token though, as Warren Buffett\u2019s 50% portfolio allocation to Apple shows. There are plenty of Bitcoin-only hodlers, but Lakov Levin, the co-founder of the new DeFi investment platform Locus Finance, leans heavily on Ethereum.\n\nLevin suggests: \u201cEthereum is the blockchain, which is used as the fundament for the financial evolution of the 21st century. It is a hub for hundreds of protocols that build value for its users. Holding Ethereum is similar to holding a fraction of the internet and value it provides to users. It is truly a remarkable financial opportunity.\u201d\n\nLevin notes that Ethereum\u2019s hodlers can stake their assets and receive 5% APR in ETH itself and points out the \u201cEthereum blockchain burns fees for each transaction made on the blockchain, which makes Ethereum a deflationary asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think that ever in human history we saw a deflationary asset that generates consistent yield and has potential for such innovation,\u201d concludes Levin.\n\nA stop loss can prevent further losses. (Pexels)\n\nA tool to stop losses\n\nPierce is sanguine about overall market dumps if you are positioned properly.\n\n\u201cIf the market falls by 10%, take the hit using something like a stop loss, and try to recover in the next run.\u201d\n\nA stop-loss is a risk management tool that automatically sells a token once it reaches a certain floor \u2013 predetermined by the user. It is designed to limit losses but can be a blunt tool in the crypto world, where movements of 10% are common and could see all assets dumped as a result.\n\nLakov Levin, a co-founder of Locus Finance (Supplied)\n\nLevin is cautiously bullish on stop losses, which basically allow traders to close a trading position at a specific price.\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of any tool lies in the hands of those who use it. The most important thing about \u2018stop losses\u2019 is the feeling of control, which protects from the anxiety of being in the market.\n\nOne of the scenarios that stop losses is the management of hypotheses on market behavior. When entering a trade, a trader has a hypothesis of the behavior of the market, which leads to opening a trading position.\n\n\u201cStop losses allow you to pick the price where your thesis is rejected by the market and limit your loss, which is a must thing to have for long-term trading. But \u2018stop losses\u2019 do not save from cognitive biases, which heavily affect trading. In this case, a trader may re-enter trade a few times, breaking his own rules under the influence of greed or fear. It is important to have discipline to follow your own rules.\n\n\u201cOne of the rules that I used when trading is when hit by stop loss, I take a break from trading this asset,\u201d says Levin.\n\nPierce is not an active trader and sees himself more as a long-term participant in the market. He appreciates that market volatility is not a negative thing and that tremendous wealth is made in volatile markets \u2014 the more movement, the more opportunity.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. You know, you\u2019re riding a roller coaster ride almost every day,\u201d says Pierce.\n\nOptions can protect against extreme volatility\n\nAll-time highs \u2013 and all-time lows. Recent reports in The Wall Street Journal point to SpaceX writing down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million. It is currently unclear whether SpaceX sold or merely reduced the value of its digital assets in its accounts. This may cause difficulty in the future, as U.S. accounting rules dictate that once written down, the value of Bitcoin on company balance sheets cannot be adjusted upward, even if its price rises.\n\nThe subsequent downward movement took many by surprise \u2014 established investors and newbies alike. What other tools are available to users to protect their crypto? Well, a 50-year-old model created by Nobel-prize-winning professors could be an option.\n\nOptions trading gives the trader the right or obligation to buy or sell a specific security on a specific date at a specific price \u2013 it\u2019s a contract that\u2019s linked to an underlying asset such as a stock or security. Since 1973, options have been priced using the Black-Scholes model originally authored by two university professors. This mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of assets based on implied volatility, taking into account the impact of time and other risk values. It is to this day regarded as one of the best ways to price an option contract.\n\nIn 1973 two finance geeks, Black and Scholes, created a financial model used to price risk and volatility.\n\n\n\nIt gave birth to the $13tr options market and won the Nobel Prize for Economics.\n\n\n\n50 years later, Bumper brings it up to the age of DeFi, a breakthrough in risk management. pic.twitter.com/ZxNqROwQPV \u2014 Gareth Ward (@S_Boomerang) August 25, 2023\n\nAsked if he might consider using a tool like options, Pierce is cagey. He reckons that leverage is the demise of most people\u2019s wealth. Leverage is the use of borrowed funds to increase one\u2019s trading position beyond what would be available from one\u2019s cash balance alone.\n\n\u201cBe very careful playing with leverage. It\u2019s a tool for hedging to try and achieve great gains but can be the thing that creates more problems if you are not a skilled trader.\u201d\n\nPierce has bought into options in the past \u2013 a few times where he tried to swing for the fences with leveraged option bets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worked out well, for me, because one of my problems is I\u2019m so close to the market, that the markets are not as rational.\u201d\n\nPierce quotes the recent SEC/Ripple legal action. He didn\u2019t trade on this occasion, but if he had, he would have bet on an altcoin bull run.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. If I had followed my gut, then I would have bought and been wrecked the next day.\u201d\n\nAs Pierce said, that\u2019s why he\u2019s not an active trader.\n\nStop losses and options?\n\nA new protocol called Bumper is launching this month, claiming to provide a safety net for downward volatility. It combines stop losses and options in a way that co-founder Jonathan DeCarteret claims is cheaper and more efficient than both those traditional tools.\n\nJonathan DeCarteret, CEO of Bumper (Supplied)\n\nBumper\u2019s backtested economic simulations claim a yield improvement of 46.2% over options pricing during the 2022 bear market. This is demonstrated through a historic simulation report audited by Cryptecon and CADlabs.\n\n\u201cDecentralised Finance (DeFi) typically has low latency and high frequency of liquidity, which poses certain complexities for the model.\n\n\u201cOption desks make great use of pricing risk but have to add their costs on top. Bumper evolves the now half-century-old Black-Scholes equation to leverage all the unique properties of DeFi, such as pooled liquidity, smart contracts and protocol composability. Two years ago, we raised $20 million in funding to create a superior crypto equivalent,\u201d says DeCarteret.\n\nDon\u2019t fall foul of criminal scams\n\nThe membership program Crytolock.ai enables users to save up to 90% of compliance and recovery expenses in case of a crypto breach. Not surprisingly, CEO Roger Ying says to focus on prevention, detection and recovery.\n\nRoger Ying, CEO of Crytolock.ai (Supplied)\n\n\u201cCrypto users need to be educated on ways to prevent, secure and make sure they are not transacting with illicit entities otherwise, they may be implicated in a crypto crime,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there are a growing number of ways to monitor your crypto on the blockchain and be immediately notified of unintended transactions and stop them before they get confirmed.\u201d He adds that if you still end up the \u201cvictim of a hack or rug pull, understanding the necessary processes to recover crypto is very important both in time and expenditure savings.\u201d\n\nHodling as a safe course\n\nOf course, hodling large-cap cryptocurrencies is probably the safest and easiest way to maintain a position. Pierce recommends using cold storage provided by hardware wallets as a safe way to keep crypto.\n\n\u201cBack in the day when I started, we used paper wallets. You\u2019d have a new device, and you\u2019d print out the keys, laminate the paper, and chuck it into a safe.\u201d\n\nSorkin is very direct in his hodling actions:\n\n\u201cBuy ETH, stake it in Lido, receive LDO and find ways to stake LDO. Otherwise just buy Bitcoin and forget about it completely until late 2024 when halving of BTC happens.\u201d\n\nLatham says the key to hodling is patience and conviction. \u201cInvest only in cryptocurrencies that you believe have long-term potential and can withstand market downturns. Regularly review your holdings to ensure they still align with your investment goals. Time in the market does beat timing the market, but that only works when you pick cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t flop, so it\u2019s crucial to vet your investments carefully.\u201d"

A federal appeals court says the SEC must review Grayscale's bid to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The decision effectively paves the way for the first spot bitcoin ETF and more widely for crypto assets to cement their status as part of mainstream finance.\n\nNow shares in the trust rocketed on the ruling. Take a look at that price action. It manages the world's largest cryptocurrency fund and first applied for the conversion back in October of 2021. There was a big reaction across all of Bitcoin and crypto related assets, including the likes of Coinbase, Riot Blockchain, and Hive. BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree. They are just some of the firms that have applied for their own ETFs over the last few months as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWell joining us now, we've got Michael Sonnenshein, who is the Grayscale CEO. Great to have you here in studio with us.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Great to be here.\n\n- So we were taking a look at the reaction yesterday. What type of inflows did you see just off of the ruling itself?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well yesterday, we actually did see a pretty big spike in trading volume in GBTC. You know, this is the world's largest bitcoin investment vehicle. It's been publicly traded since 2015. It's been an SEC reporting company since 2020. It's held by nearly a million investors here in the US directly within ETFs, within mutual funds. So there are a lot of eyes and certainly a lot of hands looking very closely at the GBTC victory yesterday.\n\n- And Michael, Rachelle here. I mean, a lot of people were wondering, you know, questioning the logic. You already have bitcoin future ETFs allowed. So a lot of people were wondering why we weren't seeing these spot bitcoin ETFs. What does this now open up, and what's been some of the reaction that you've been getting from investors?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, you know, yesterday was really an overwhelming victory not just for Grayscale and our investors, but for the investment and crypto communities as a whole. The panel of judges unanimously agreed with us three to zero that the arguments we put forward in front of the court were such that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by approving the bitcoin futures products, but not approving bitcoin spot products like GBTC's conversion.\n\nAnd we really demonstrated-- or rather, the SEC didn't have a good explanation as how to make a distinction between these two product types given that they both derive their pricing from the same underlying Bitcoin market. And so this is a really, really important milestone on GBTC's path to eventually converting to an ETF.\n\n- And so walk us through the timeline from this point. How soon could we see the actual spot ETF come forward?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, so today is day one of a 45-day period during which the SEC can actually request a rehearing of the case.\n\n- OK.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: So we have to be a little bit patient. We have to follow the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure here. And ultimately, the court will be issuing a final mandate that will detail the operational next steps. In the interim, however, though, of course, our legal teams will be proactively working with the SEC to try and make for an expeditious as possible conversion of GBTC to an ETF.\n\n- Now Michael, I do have to ask. If the floodgates do open and this is finally approved, how will you differentiate your product from some of the other ones that have also been applying for spot bitcoin ETFs?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: You know, it's a great question, Rachelle. And there's actually already quite a bit of differentiation. GBTC is just a couple weeks away from celebrating its 10th anniversary. And that's 10 years of, you know, operating within the digital asset ecosystem. Custody, audits, accounting, disclosure, creations, investor, disclosures, tax treatment. All of these things are really core to running GBTC every single day.\n\nAnd in contrast, a lot of the other products seeking to come to market are merely just ideas. They're just ideas on paper. They're just filings. So in a lot of ways, GBTC has paved the way for a lot of the other issuers to even think about bringing their products to market, making use of GBTC's operations, disclosures, financial reporting, et cetera. And I think when investors do have a choice about which product to invest in, certainly thinking about a crypto native asset manager, a product that has billions of assets, hundreds of millions of dollars of daily trading volume. You know, these are the types of distinctions that I think investors will be paying attention to. But ultimately, we do believe investors should have choice.\n\n- So is this ruling enough to really kind of overshadow some of the crypto winter detractors to cryptocurrency, whether that's SBF and FTX and what's taking place there, or whether that's the algorithmic stablecoin debacles of last year? And the depegging, basically, to the dollar. Is this enough for investors and for the sentiment that's moved forward and had to navigate so many of these issues?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Certainly. I think investors are paying attention to the fact that crypto has been one of the best performing assets year to date. They're looking at not only the Grayscale victory, they're looking at the recent ripple victory in court. They're looking at the pending legislation that's being worked on in Washington, both around stablecoins, as you mentioned, as well as looking more at market structure.\n\nAnd it's encouraging from my seat having been in crypto now for almost a decade to actually see crypto becoming a nonpartisan issue. To see both sides of the aisle working on legislation. Their constituents are getting involved in crypto. They're getting involved in the name of investor protection. They realize investors are going to be involved in this asset class no matter what.\n\nAnd so I am very encouraged that we will have some progress around a lot of these in the weeks and months to come.\n\n- Who does this benefit the most? Who stands to benefit? Is it the retail investor that has been, you know, bullish on Bitcoin for the past 10 years, say? As long as you've been involved. Or is it the institutions now and making this more accessible and them being able to make sure that they've seen some type of revenue come through as a result of any products or assets that they might bring to market.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: You know, ultimately, I think an ETF is a wrapper that is tried and true. And it's been used for everything from gold and other commodities to equities to, you know, sub themes. I think there's no exception when it comes to Bitcoin, right? Investors appreciate the ETF wrapper as a way to give them greater protections. And this is a wrapper that's used both by retail investors as well as institutions.\n\nSo I think this is an overall win for the investment community as a whole if we move forward with seeing these spot bitcoin products like GBTC converting and coming into the market.\n\n- And Michael, I do have to ask. Because when you think of where Bitcoin and crypto started and now you have this influx of institutional investors and them waiting for the next catalyst, whether it be Bitcoin, halving. What do you think is going to be the next catalyst in the crypto investment space?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, I actually think, Rachelle, you nailed it. One of the things that we and our investors are very focused on is the next Bitcoin halving that's slated to come around early next summer. And as we think about both that as well as the regulatory and legislative landscape I just mentioned, I do think that it, you know, portends for an environment around crypto like we actually haven't seen before. And some catalysts that could be really, really unique to continuing to the staying power of the asset class."

        "title": "BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF application: a rocky way towards approval - Finextra",
        "content": "BlackRock, the world largest asset manager, last June has applied at the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF for its American clients. According to Blackrock there is still large interest of their clients to have Bitcoin in their portfolio.\n\nIn the past years BlackRock has continuously pushed the boundaries of ETF offerings, reaffirming its position as a leading force in the financial industry.\n\nIn this blog a number of questions will be answered, such as the involvement of BlackRock in Bitcoin, why BlackRock is bullish on Bitcoin, what is a spot Bitcoin ETF, what are the benefits and what the drawbacks, what is the chance that the SEC will approve this application and if so what would that mean for the crypto markets.\n\nBlackrock and Bitcoin involvement\n\nThe distinguishing factor of BlackRock's application is its stature as the world's largest asset manager, with almost $10 trillion in assets under management. For that reason some analysts expect that the application of Blackrock will be approved, though not everybody agrees.\n\n\n\nNext to that Blackrock is very much involved in the crypto market especially Bitcoin. BlackRock\u2019s investment in Bitcoin mining companies has positioned the asset manager as the second-largest investor in the industry, just behind Fidelity Investments. This move is a testament to the growing acceptance and interest from traditional financial institutions as well as regulators in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are significant for several reasons. First, they show that the asset manager is bullish on Bitcoin because of its innovation and resilience as a technology and network. This despite the volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, Second, they indicate that BlackRock is diversifying its portfolio with alternative assets that have high growth potential and low correlation with traditional markets. Third, they signal that BlackRock is positioning itself as a leader in the digital asset space, as it has also launched several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track companies involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Fourth, BlackRock believes that it has a unique value proposition as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, an alternative asset class, and an innovative technology.\n\nBlackrock spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBlackRock thrilled the crypto community when it applied at the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) on 15 June to track the spot price of Bitcoin.\n\nBlackrock chairman Larry Fink said he wished to make it easier and cheaper for investors to invest in Bitcoin. Similar products to BlackRock\u2019s application were already launched in other countries, including Canada, Brazil and Dubai. A second important step was the announcement of a partnership between Blackrock and crypto exchange Coinbase, providing institutional investors access to Bitcoin through Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian. This partnership enables enabling investors to trade in Bitcoin with Blackrock\u2019s Aladdin, the portfolio- and risk management platform of the company, offering institutional investors a trusted entry point with BlackRock\u2019s involvement. Coinbase will monitor and at the same time serve as custodian, ensuring market integrity and overseeing potential market manipulation. By doing so both companies make a bridge between the crypto world and the traditional financial system (TradFi).\n\n\n\nWhat is a spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWhereas the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), spot Bitcoin ETFs are of a different order. Contrary to the futures ETF, where the price is based on future contracts a spot Bitcoin ETF directly follows the actual rate of the Bitcoin on the market.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF provides investors with exposure to the real-time price movements of Bitcoin in the underlying market. This kind of ETF offers a direct and transparent way for investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin price.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would directly hold and track the (spot) price of actual Bitcoins, which is the current price of bitcoin at any given moment, as opposed to ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin futures contracts, a number of which have received US regulatory approval.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF investment vehicle would allow institutional and individual traders to gain exposure Bitcoin without the need to actually by and store or manage actual Bitcoins themselves. It would give institutional investors access to Bitcoin without being confronted with complex store problems.\n\nFirst Reactions on the crypto market\n\nThe announcement of BlackRock\u2019s desire to initiate a bitcoin ETF and expectations of an approval by the SEC has had a positive effect on the crypto markets, leading to a swift recovery from recent Bitcoin losses. The Blackrock action triggered the interest of institutional investors, bringing more money of these investors to the market for Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. But there was optimism showcased by retail investors as well. This was mainly because of the anticipation of the demand that would be generated [by the launch]. As a result BlackRock\u2019s application had had a \u201cvery positive\u201d impact on bitcoin ETF flows and the price of Bitcoin. This caused the Bitcoin rate to increase to a 12-months high beyond $ 30.000, a 80% rise since the start of this year, while also boosting the price of Ethereum, Ripple and other major cryptocurrencies. European crypto-related exchange traded products also have seen a boost in flows after BlackRock applied to launch a bitcoin fund in the US. Europe-domiciled ETPs with crypto-related names had net inflows of \u20ac150mn in June, Morningstar data shows. This followed a similar trend globally, with inflows totalling $610mn (\u20ac560mn) in June and July, according to CoinShares data.\n\n\n\nApllications by other asset managers\n\nAt the same time the Blackrock application sparked a flurry of similar applications for such a product at the SEC from other asset manager firms in the US. These include names like Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Wise Origin, VanEck, and Galaxy, while others have refiled their earlier applications to address the SEC\u2019s concerns. This could further strengthen the case for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Drawbacks\n\nBut there is also a flipside. As long as there is no approval investors should be aware of potential drawbacks. These may include regulatory hurdles, and uncertain ETF approval timelines.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with over 30 rejections, may raise concerns as to whether they will accept BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF. A spot Bitcoin ETF could also give traditional finance firms more control over the cryptocurrency space, harming the network\u2019s decentralised nature and original purpose of blockchain. This may raise debates over the benefits behind BlackRock\u2019s ETF introduction.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and the SEC\n\nUntil now, the SEC has given the green light to several bitcoin ETFs and other crypto exchange-traded funds. However, these have only been funds monitoring cryptocurrency futures or owning shares in companies with indirect crypto exposure. But spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s are another storey.\n\nThe US SEC has stated to accept Blackrock\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF. This however does not mean it would approve this application. It only means that the SEC just will handle the application. This should be seen as the first step towards a possible launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nWhat may we expect from the SEC?\n\nWhile there are already spot-Bitcoin ETF\u2019s amongst others in Canada and Europe, a spot Bitcoin ETF does not yet exist in the US. Up till now the SEC is hesitating to approve such a product and called market manipulation one of their worries. Despite the SEC\u2019s history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there is growing confidence among market analysts that BlackRock's ETF application could be approved within the next six months.\n\nMike Novogratz, chief executive of crypto financial services company Galaxy Digital, said it is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve at least one of a handful of ETF applications. ETF manager Cathy Wood called on the SEC to approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously.\n\n\"The SEC\u2019s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be done in a fair and orderly manner.\" \"I think the SEC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\" Cathy Wood\n\nWhat may a SEC approval bring to the market?\n\nBlackRock's decision to file for a bitcoin ETF may mark a significant moment in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. If the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved we may experience a number of beneficial ripple effects to impact the Bitcoin market.\n\nA SEC's positive decision will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the market and could potentially shape the future of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nMore institutional investors\n\nIf the SEC would approve Blackrock\u2019s application that would trigger more institutional investors to bring money to the market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a more structural way, legitimizing the Bitcoin market and providing a secure and regulated entry point for investors..\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could significantly enhance mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin investing, making it more accessible, thereby providing an easier way for traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without the need for digital wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges, making it more accessible. This streamlined investment process would attract other investors ranging from those curious about cryptocurrencies to seasoned investors seeking a more straightforward way to access the bitcoin market.\n\nIt could trigger a wave of similar products in the market and could lend a new level of legitimacy to the Bitcoin market. A spot Bitcoin ETF could also unveil new types of investment opportunities, such as short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin. This could add another dimension to Bitcoin investing and open up additional ways for investors to profit from the cryptocurrency market.\n\nPrice surge of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. would as a result have a \"material positive impact\" on bitcoin's price as well as that of other crypto currencies. Thanks to the expected growing interest of institutional and other investors this may trigger a firm price surge of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Some are expecting a rise of more than 400 percent and will go beyond the $ 150.000 barrier.\n\nAccording to Research institute Fundstrat the possible launch of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by could have a significant impact on the Bitcoin rate, and may rise to somewhere between 140.000 en 180.000 dollar. Much will depend within which period the SEC come with its decision.\n\nWaiting to a SEC decision: what are the chances?\n\nBlackRock's recent proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF has sparked fresh discussions and speculation about the probability of such an ETF becoming a reality. Though a decision was expected in the first half of August the SEC will certainly extend the term. The real deadline, including all possible extensions, is 23 February 2024.\n\nSo we still have to wait some time to the final decision of the SEC. Yet, the road to approval is fraught with challenges, and the outcomes of this endeavour remain uncertain. This path to launching a spot Bitcoin ETF will likely be riddled with regulatory obstacles and opposition.\n\nIt is thereby important to note that the approval process for ETFs can be lengthy, and the SEC may request additional information or make further evaluations before making a final decision. The SEC will carefully evaluate the application on the basis of regulation and security measures.\n\n\n\nBut what are the chances for Blackrock to get approval?\n\nAlthough similar applications in the past have been rejected, the growing influence of big financial players like BlackRock could increase the chances on approval. The credibility behind BlackRock\u2019s experience in ETFs and its position as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, carries significant weight and credibility in the financial industry.\n\nThe SEC might view BlackRock\u2019s involvement as a sign of maturity and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which could positively influence the approval decision.\n\nIt is clear that the approval of such an ETF could validate Bitcoin as a legitimate investment, while it may bring more approved Bitcoin spot ETFs to the market with a very positive impact on the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIts endorsement of Bitcoin could encourage more institutional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolios to the digital asset, as well as pave the way for more regulatory clarity and innovation in the crypto space. Ultimately it could bring a revolution in the financial world.\n\nBut this prospect is at this moment anything but sure."

        "title": "25 Countries that Mine the Most Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 countries that mine the most Bitcoin. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that mine the most Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, and bitcoin mining in particular, has been one of the most controversial discussions in the past decade, with arguments ranging from it being the savior of private finance to it being considered one of the biggest scams in history. Regardless of what one may think, and despite volatile fluctuations, Bitcoin started to become mainstream in 2017, 8 years after its creation, when the first Bitcoin bubble resulted in explosive popularity, which in turned led to many people losing their life savings after the crash happened. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Bitcoin then reached its best ever run in 2021, with an all-time high of around $68,000 in November 2021, only to crash spectacularly over the next year as well. However, by that point in time, the demand for cryptocurrency, not just limited to Bitcoin, had increased massively, with other cryptocurrencies growing even more and major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) going public in 2021, and is among the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in May 2023.\n\n25 countries that mine the most Bitcoin\n\nCompanies driving Bitcoin mining\n\nFor Bitcoin to be created, it has to be mined, a process which has a significant environmental footprint and has been called out for being damaging to the environment. As cryptocurrencies were seeing their values soar, more and more people started to mine Bitcoin due to higher potential margins, especially in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, and an important component of possessing the firepower needed to be able to mine Bitcoin are graphics cards, which is where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) came in. One of the only companies in the world with a market cap of $1 trillion, it's known more for being a top AI company right now, but is also famous among gamers and cryptocurrency miners for its GPUs. With enthusiasm for cryptocurrency declining as the value of top such currencies fell amid scandals including the collapse of FTX (even though it isn't among the biggest bankruptcies in American history) and the collapse of Celsius, there has been some impact on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the cryptocurrency, while still far away from all-time highs, has had a new lease on life in 2023, with Bitcoin's value increasing and more people in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin once again increasing their mining operations, and while AI has been the biggest driver of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than 200% YTD share price gain, cryptocurrency has played a part. At its peak, the use of GPUs were so in demand, even the SEC took notice with the regulator stating the company \u201cfailed to disclose that crypto mining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its GPUs designed and marketed for gaming\u201d, and resulted in a $5.5 million fine.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne challenge that companies which produce equipment used in cryptocurrency mining is Ethereum's shift form proof of work to proof of stake will significantly reduce mining requirements and hence, a huge part of demand for cryptocurrency will end as the second largest cryptocurrency will no longer require it.\n\nCryptocurrency industry outlook\n\nWhile the top cryptocurrencies have performed brilliantly in the first half of 2023, it is important to remember that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, are nowhere near their all-time highs, and so far, have been a bit dismal in the second half of 2023 despite a court ruling against the SEC and in favor of the company which made XRP. Recently, another major cryptocurrency called Worldcoin was launched by the CEO of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT and the project focuses on identifying whether a person online is real or AI, something which is becoming an increasing concern in today's world.\n\nMeanwhile, though cryptocurrency is currently mainly focused on trading even while providing various applications, it is expected to move more towards nontrading uses as echoed by Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2023 earnings call \"The first 10 years in crypto were primarily about trading, but we've seen our customer base shift its activity over time where the majority of our active customers now do something with crypto other than trading. My belief is that the next 10 years in crypto will become predominantly about nontrading use cases. So, what could some of those be? Well, payments is a big one. As the scalability of blockchain improves by moving to Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Optimism, and Base, we'll see payments emerge as a larger use case. Getting more scalable blockchains will be as important as the internet moving from dial-up to broadband. We'll also see the rise of decentralized identity systems with decentralized messaging and social apps that will accompany those connected right into those decentralized identities.\" Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has had an excellent performance in the first two quarters, which has led to its share price increasing by 120% YTD.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, we referred a study carried out by Cambridge University which shows the percentage share of each country by month. We have considered statistics for both January 2022 and December 2021, and used the average of these rankings to determine our list.\n\n25. Italy\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.11%\n\nItaly has one of the highest prices for Bitcoin mining, which is why miners are considering other countries, and if this continues, Italy will soon drop off our list.\n\n24. Mexico\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.11%\n\nMexico's importance in cryptocurrency mining can be seen by the fact that the World Digital Mining Summit 2022 was held in Cancun where the focus was on proof-of-work power, not to mention exploring additional industry trends.\n\n23.

Ukraine\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.15%\n\nWhile Ukraine has benefited massively from cryptocurrency donations in the Russia-Ukraine war, but is likely to drop out of this list as Bitcoin mining operations have been hugely impacted from the war.\n\n19. Netherlands\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.21%\n\nA giant greenhouse in the Netherlands is actually using heat from Bitcoin mining to grow cash crops including tulips, with both ironically being associated with financial bubble at their peak.\n\n18. France\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.21%\n\nOne month ago, the first fully-licensed cryptocurrency provider was formed as a subsidiary of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n17. Georgia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.23%\n\nOne of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies in the world CleanSpark, Inc.

Indonesia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.35%\n\nWhile many countries in our list are clamping down on Bitcoin mining, Indonesia is exploring ways in which Bitcoin adoption will provide benefits to the country, and hence, could likely see Indonesia's rank improve in the coming years.\n\n12. Australia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.36%\n\nAn Australian company Arkon Energy raised $22 million in November 2022 to further expand Bitcoin mining operations based on renewable energy, as Bitcoin miners try to shed their image of greatly damaging the environment.\n\n11.

        "content": "News that a Washington DC Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale Investments LLC over the Securities and Exchange Commission has ignited hope that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund will soon be available. Bitcoin prices jumped.\n\nCrypto fans are using terms like \u201cwatershed,\u201d \u201cturning point\u201d and \u201cRubicon\u201d for the Grayscale v SEC ruling. That\u2019s not unjustified since it could lead to the SEC throwing in the towel and unlocking a virtuous spiral upward in crypto prices and legal acceptability. But it\u2019s also very far from certain as the direct practical effect of this decision is infinitesimal."

        "title": "What Is the Best Bitcoin Wallet? 5 Contenders | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) market is booming, and cryptocurrency has transitioned from a niche interest for tech enthusiasts to a legitimate alternative to fiat currency and traditional asset classes. One of the first steps in buying, trading and using Bitcoin is choosing a Bitcoin wallet, and there are many different types of wallets out there. Here's an overview of the options:\n\nIntroduction to Bitcoin Wallets\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Wallet?\n\nBitcoin wallets are software applications or hardware devices used to store Bitcoin. Instead of storing hard currency, Bitcoin wallets store the private keys needed to send or receive cryptocurrency. Bitcoin wallets can be hardware devices similar to USB sticks, or they can be digital apps accessed on a smartphone or other device.\n\nImportance of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nBecause there is no physical Bitcoin, digital access to the cryptocurrency must be stored in some form of wallet. Anyone with access to a wallet\u2019s private keys \u2013 a long series of alphanumeric characters \u2013 has access to all the cryptocurrency stored using the wallet. While the Bitcoin blockchain is extremely secure, a crypto owner's stake is only as secure as the private key and the wallet in which it's stored.\n\nUnderstanding Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nCrypto wallets help Bitcoin users interact with the blockchain network, and there are several different types of wallets. Bitcoin wallets are broken into two main categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets, or Bitcoin wallets connected to the internet, typically make it faster and easier for users to trade and spend their Bitcoin. Cold wallets, or wallets not connected to the internet, are more secure compared to hot wallets, but they typically make it more difficult for users to use their Bitcoin.\n\nHardware Wallet\n\nHardware wallets are physical, cold storage devices that keep a Bitcoin user's private keys safe and offline. Hardware wallets are generally extremely secure compared to hot wallets because hackers and cybercriminals do not have access to cold wallets. However, hardware wallets can be lost or stolen in the physical world, just like a traditional wallet.\n\nDesktop Wallet\n\nA desktop wallet allows Bitcoin users to store and manage private keys securely on a personal computer hard drive. A user simply downloads desktop wallet software and installs it on their PC just like you would install any other application. Desktop wallets are typically hot wallets and can be ideal for Bitcoin users who often make crypto transactions on a PC. However, they are less secure than hardware wallets.\n\nWeb Wallet\n\nWeb wallets are hot wallets that store a user's private keys on a server, and users can access them as long as they have access to the internet. Web wallets are controlled by a cryptocurrency exchange or other third-party entity, and users access them by signing in using an ID and password or other means of identification. Web wallets can be extremely convenient, but they are only as secure as the third party managing them.\n\nMobile Wallet\n\nA mobile Bitcoin wallet is an app that stores private keys on a smartphone, allowing users to easily use or trade crypto on the go. Mobile wallets are hot wallets, and they come with all the risks associated with malware or other cyberattacks. However, mobile wallets can be extremely convenient for using crypto as a payment method, including via QR code scans.\n\nPaper Wallet\n\nPaper wallets are cold storage wallets that are created using a key generator program that prints public and private key pairs used to make crypto transactions. Once these keys are printed, the paper wallet is essentially akin to paper fiat currency. If your paper wallet is lost or stolen, the funds in it are gone just like a stolen $20 bill. Paper wallets were once the preferred method of cold storage in the crypto community, but they have now largely been replaced by hardware wallets.\n\n\n\nTop 5 Best Bitcoin Wallets\n\nThere are many different brands of Bitcoin wallets, and each has its unique pros and cons based on the type of wallet it is, the features it offers and its price.\n\nHardware Wallet: Trezor\n\nTrezor wallets are known for their advanced security features, such as Shamir Backup for lost, broken or stolen devices. Trezor wallets are also very affordable, starting at only $69 for the Trezor Model One. In addition to Bitcoin, Trezor wallets support roughly 1,000 other popular cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Cardano and Solana.\n\nDesktop Wallet: Exodus Wallet\n\nExodus Wallet is a user-friendly hot storage wallet that is known for its functionality. In addition to its desktop wallet, Exodus users can access their wallets via mobile devices and web extensions. Exodus is also free to use, but critics have pointed out it doesn't have as many security features as other leading wallets.\n\nWeb Wallet: Coinbase Wallet\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (ticker: COIN) operates one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its Coinbase Wallet web wallet is one of three crypto wallets it offers to its users. Coinbase Wallet does not offer a desktop application, but its simple, highly functional mobile app and web browser extension support thousands of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens. In addition, Coinbase Wallet allows staking directly from the wallet, and its compatibility with Ledger \u2013 another wallet brand \u2013 allows users to easily transition from hot storage to cold storage.\n\nMobile Wallet: Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is a popular mobile Bitcoin wallet that has millions of users, supports more than 4.5 million tokens and can interact with 65 different blockchain networks. Trust Wallet is also the official digital wallet of Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Trust Wallet has an intuitive interface and built-in staking capabilities, but it does not have a cold storage feature.\n\nPaper Wallet: BitAddress\n\nBitAddress is a popular crypto platform that generates paper wallets for Bitcoin. BitAddress users can quickly and easily print out paper wallets with private and public keys that can used to securely store their Bitcoin offline. BitAddress paper wallets are convenient for new crypto users or users who do not trust digital storage, but they can be easily lost or stolen and are generally considered inferior to other modern cold storage methods.\n\nThe Security Aspect of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nThe decentralized nature of blockchain networks promises users an unprecedented level of security when it comes to verifying and securing cryptocurrency transactions. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain network itself is extremely secure, a Bitcoin user's cryptocurrency is only as secure as the wallet in which it is stored. Many cryptocurrency wallets use advanced security features to protect their contents, including multifactor authentication, multi-signature and seed phrase security.\n\nImproving Your Wallet's Security\n\nThere's no way to make a Bitcoin wallet 100% safe and secure, but there are plenty of steps to improve security and minimize risk. Cold storage eliminates the possibility of hacking or online access to your wallet. In addition, Bitcoin users should always use only reputable wallet providers that prioritize security features, and they should regularly change their wallet passwords.\n\nContingency Plans for Wallet Security\n\nNo matter how many security features your wallet has, loss, theft or even personal incapacitation can have severe consequences when it comes to accessing your Bitcoin holdings. Well before you forget or lose access to a crypto wallet, you should clearly document how to access private keys or backups and record the specifics of the recovery process along with instructions on how to use any recovery tools. If you become unable to manage your wallet or forget what to do when you lose access, a contingency plan can help you or a close, trusted friend or family member recover your crypto assets.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet\n\nMuch like cryptocurrencies themselves, identifying the best cryptocurrency wallets largely involves weighing a trade-off between security and convenience. Individual investors will have different levels of risk aversion and different goals in mind for their Bitcoin that will influence their wallet priorities. In addition, users should consider the features different wallets offer, the usability of the wallets based on their level of experience and the costs or fees involved.\n\nTakeaway"

        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have rallied sharply this week, but that rally cooled off over the last 24 hours. Tuesday's jump was driven by Grayscale's win over the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court, which could pave the way for more crypto ETFs, but the rally hasn't lasted.\n\nBetween noon ET on Tuesday and 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the value of Bitcoin (BTC -0.26%) fell 2.7%, Ethereum (ETH -1.47%) was down 1.9%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 8.23%) dropped 2.1%. But the cryptocurrencies are up 2.9%, 1.4%, and 2.2% over the past week, so there has been a rally overall.\n\nSo what\n\nThe court's ruling yesterday that the SEC must review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust application to convert into an ETF could pave the way for more Bitcoin ETFs. And that could open up more crypto ETFs for Ethereum or even Dogecoin.\n\nWhat the judge's ruling doesn't guarantee is that any ETFs will actually be approved. The SEC just needs to review the application and treat it like any other Bitcoin ETF application, which hasn't yet been approved. So, it's back to a waiting game for investors.\n\nWhat we have seen is repeated wins for the crypto industry in court. The Ripple ruling in July paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be regulated more like commodities rather than securities, and now trading options may be opening up via ETFs.\n\nIt's not clear when there will be a final ruling on a Bitcoin ETF or if an answer on what's a commodity and what's a security will be coming, but this was seen as a positive sign for the industry.\n\nNow what\n\nThe bounce in values on Tuesday is what's reversing today. There was at least some hope that this would lead to more ETFs and more certainty for the industry, but as the market has processed the ruling, it's clear that's not what happened.\n\nThat said, the court being more friendly to the crypto industry should be an incremental positive long term. Trading has all but dried up for most cryptocurrencies, and that's left the industry in an uncertain place. The regulatory uncertainty hasn't helped, but if that gets answered, there's billions of dollars of investment that's gone into companies building on the blockchain. That's where the real innovation will take place that could cause values to increase.\n\nFor now, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic when there's a positive ruling, but the bounce doesn't last long because there's no fundamental change in the market. That's what's holding values back and why we get the pop and then the slow drop of the last 36 hours. Expect that trend to continue until there's regulatory clarity, which at this rate could still be years away."

        "title": "Bitcoin Briefly Breaks Above $28K After Grayscale's Court Win Over SEC - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Joining us now to discuss perhaps the most important thing. The crypto markets is Clara Mili Kai, co director of research. Welcome, Clara. Thank you. Happy to be here. It's our pleasure to have you here now. Bitcoin prices. Uh They did some somersaults as we know in the last 24 hours, they sold some 7% on Tuesday as traders reacted to this gray scale Bitcoin spot ETF court decision and you noted that liquidity remains thin. So is this sudden price movement sustainable? Well, what's interesting is we looked at the trade volume data today and I think trade volume overall historically is one of the best indicators for general engagement in Cryptocurrency markets. And what we found was trade volume only spiked to its highest level since the August 17th sell off, meaning it's only at its highest level over the past two weeks. Um And it's relatively low compared to other mini bull markets we've seen. Um But the good news is that we did see a spike in average trade size. That's chart that you see on the screen right now. Um This means that even though volumes were still low, um the average buy orders on average were larger, which means it could be a bit of whale activity that was reentering markets. But I think ultimately a lot of this price volatility. Bitcoin gained quite a bit, it crashed quite a bit on August 17th is due to underlying liquidity issues. We still have relatively low liquidity on order books which makes volatility a lot likelier. Yeah, you bring up this low liquidity, low capital in the market. We've been talking about catalysts on this show all week. What do you think it's gonna take to get new investors injecting capital into the market instead of just um these whales that you're speaking about? I mean, I think that a wave of ETF approvals could definitely be the bullish catalyst that crypto markets need right now. That would really open up a whole new class of investor to the space. Um But again, we're in the middle still of a sort of tumultuous period for the industry. There's quite a few bankruptcies and lawsuits that are ongoing, especially in the exchange space. Um And so I think we still need to wait and see how that resolves, especially in the United States. Yeah. Right. Uh You know, you also wrote uh that average trade size for Bitcoin is at its highest level since June, which means buyers were on average, placing larger orders. What does it really tell you about market sentiment? So I think average trade size, it typically correlates with a big market, uh, big market event. And when you see a spike in average trade size, it means that there were either a lot of large buy or sell orders. However, what we see that during a bull market, we typically see a prolonged increase in average trade size. So of course, over the past few months, past 6 to 8 months, we've seen a slow decrease. So any spike we see is good news. Um And I think that yesterday's uh price bump while it may be too early to tell if it's sustained and will get us past the 30 k price level. Um There are some small signs that suggest we could be seeing a slight reversal. I just want to take you through what happened in the minutes and let's say hours right after the result, the court order yesterday, uh initially, there was a bit of legal confusion about whether this was going to mean that the court had actually now approved, uh you know, a spot Bitcoin ETF and that's what it had ordered the SEC to, to basically do. And then later, it was kind of, you know, when the water has kind of calm down, everyone understood that. Well, this is just the case being one for the moment and now it goes back to the SEC, they have 23 options, uh one to review to come up with a different reason, et cetera. And that's when suddenly the market sentiment and, and Bitcoin prices went back down to, let's say a more nominal acceptable, uh less frenzy atmosphere. Is, is that something that you were seeing also? Yeah. Yeah, we were also seeing similar patterns and I think that's common every time you see either a price crash or a price bump, you often see a pullback uh to previous levels shortly after, especially uh in our current environment. It's, you know, liquidity is thin. And so you're seeing these wild uh price uh price swings uh pretty frequently these days. All right. And it's not always all about Bitcoin. Of course, you uh we're talking about lack of liquidity, lack of capital and Bitcoin markets. Uh What are you seeing with, with alt coins? I know two of the top meme coins by market cap and Pepe are down year to date. Um Are meme coins following a different trend here. What's going on outside of Bitcoin? I mean, meme coins are always following their own special trends. Um And I think with Pepe in particular on Monday, we had some of the founders news broke that they were selling a lot of their tokens and so that caused a huge price crash. We wrote about it in our Monday research note for Kai O. But ultimately, I think meme coins, they sort of run on their own clock. Uh You see, especially Doge coin, it's tightly correlated to anything happening with Elon Musk and Pepe. I guess has had some news events over the past few weeks causing it to diverge from what you see with Bitcoin and E now we're jumping a little bit all over the place here, but we of course, spoke to Grace Gill before this segment. Uh The court win ignited a trading frenzy with G BT C shares, pushing trading volume to the highest since June of 2022. What are your thoughts there? Um I mean, I think all the investors in gray scale, they're extremely happy with this news. It's been sort of a major headwind for institutions in the Cryptocurrency industry over the past few years, just the inability to redeem to redeem Bitcoin. And actually, it's been a bit, people have described it as a Bitcoin black hole. So it'll be very interesting to see what happened if they are able to convert into an ETF whether we'll see a lot of because this will actually enable Bitcoin redemptions and what will happen with these Bitcoin then. Um But overall investors are clearly happy with what's going on. Um And I think on the institutional side, it's probably one of the best news we've had so far this year, um especially as we've seen a lot of capital exit the market. All right, Clara, we are gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show. It was wonderful seeing you again. Thank you. That was Clara Bed Kaiko, Director of Research."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not in their \u201clongest-ever bear market\u201d and probably are not even in a bear market at all, according to some industry observers.\n\nMN Trading founder Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe took to X (formerly Twitter) on Aug. 27 to claim that Bitcoin is currently in its \u201clongest bear market\u201d in history.\n\n\u201cRight now, the price of Bitcoin is nowhere near the valuation of the peak in November \u201921. It\u2019s down more than 50% and in a bear market of 490 days,\u201d the trader wrote.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s statement has brought much attention from X users, amassing 1.3 million views and nearly a thousand reposts at the time of writing. Some crypto enthusiasts, however, are confident that Van de Poppe\u2019s information is not the case.\n\nTo determine the length of the current \u201cbear market\u201d in crypto, it\u2019s necessary to understand that there are different interpretations of the term.\n\n\u201cThing is, the terms \u2018bull\u2019 and \u2018bear market\u2019 are entirely subjective,\u201d Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt can mean either the price has moved in the past or that the price is expected to move in a certain direction in the future,\u201d Greenspan said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe ambiguity creates endless opportunities for analysts to make pointless arguments in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph\u2019s market editor Allen Scott, one may view the current market situation as a \u201cmultiyear bear market now until a new all-time high is broken.\u201d Such a perspective suggests that Bitcoin has been in a bear market since reaching its historic peak near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, or for 659 days. The period is even longer than the one mentioned by Van de Poppe, but it\u2019s still not the longest \u201cbear market\u201d based on such an approach.\n\nAs previously mentioned by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin once saw its price stay below its previous highs for a period of 37 months \u2014 or about 1,125 days \u2014 between November 2013 and January 2017. For over three years, Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to reclaim $1,000 after hitting the price mark in 2013.\n\nAfter reaching $20,000 for the first time in December 2017, Bitcoin again lagged behind the price level until December 2020, or for 1,095 days. But does that mean that Bitcoin was in a \u201cbear market\u201d during this period at all? Looking at the charts, one could say that Bitcoin was actually on the trajectory of hitting its all-time peak of $68,000.\n\nBitcoin price chart between late 2017 and August 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAccording to another interpretation, Bitcoin may not currently be in a bear market at all.\n\nSome classic definitions suggest that a bear market happens when a market index or asset declines by 20% or more from its recent high.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin\u2019s most recent high occurred in mid-July 2023 at around $31,400. At current prices, Bitcoin is around 13% shy of that level. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has climbed 34% over the past year.\n\n\u201cIf you zoom out enough, Bitcoin is just one big green candle and has been in a continuous bull market since 2009. I guess those that focus on short timeframes might be experiencing a bear market,\u201d Jan3 CEO Samson Mow told Cointelegraph.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin soars in Argentina as Javier Milei wins presidential primary\n\nThe Bitcoin advocate also hinted that he sees the current market situation as \u201cvery bullish\u201d amid contributing factors like high inflation, loss of purchasing power, spiraling debt and adoption by nation-states like El Salvador. Mow also has his own definition of a bear market:\n\n\u201cA bear market is what high-time-preference crypto investors experience periodically.\u201d\n\nQuantum Economics\u2019 Greenspan supported Mow\u2019s remarks, arguing that Bitcoin has never actually been in a bear market. \u201cTaking the longest time frame for both past occurrence and future expectations, we can, however, determine that Bitcoin always has and always will be in a bull market,\u201d he stated.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Propel Crypto Prices, Says Expert - ETF Trends",
        "content": "As has been widely reported, big news in the cryptocurrency realm arrived Tuesday when a US Appeals Court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must consider Grayscale\u2019s efforts to convert the GBTC bitcoin index fund into an exchange traded fund.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee spot bitcoin ETFs will come to life. Still, the ruling suggested the SEC\u2019s reasoning for rejecting such funds is faulty. While the future of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. still hangs in the balance, it\u2019s clear Tuesday\u2019s ruling was a positive for bitcoin prices and other crypto-related assets, such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) .\n\nBLKC makes for an obvious beneficiary of the Grayscale news. The Invesco exchange traded fund allocates 15.78% of its weight to the aforementioned GBTC. Alone, that fact underscores BLKC\u2019s potentially positive correlations to the SEC eventually approving spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 something some experts believe is now a foregone conclusion.\n\nBLKC Could Benefit from \u2018Landmark\u201d Ruling\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of praise for the appellate court\u2019s ruling in the Grayscale case. Some experts are going so far as to describe the case as monumental.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark legal win for crypto against the US regulator,\u201d said deVere Group CEO Nigel Green in a new report. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nShould the SEC ultimately give the green light to these ETFs, BLKC stands to benefit. This is not simply because of its large weight to GBTC. The ETF also holds shares of multiple crypto miners \u2014 an asset class highly levered to the underlying assets\u2019 price movements.\n\nFurther Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why Tuesday\u2019s ruling could be a boon for BLKC. A slew of fund issuers have filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. If these funds are approved, the market could feel immediate, substantial demand for the largest digital currency. There are other avenues for BLKC upside as well.\n\n\u201cFirst, if Bitcoin ETFs are approved, it would open up the cryptocurrency market to a broader range of investors who might have been hesitant to directly invest in digital assets. This influx of new capital from institutional and retail investors could drive up demand for Bitcoin, leading to an increase in its price,\u201d concludes Green. \u201cSecond, ETFs typically involve the purchase of the underlying asset by the fund managers. If Bitcoin ETFs follow this structure, it could create a substantial demand for actual Bitcoins to back the ETF shares. This increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), could lead to a supply-demand imbalance, resulting in a price surge.\u201d\n\nHe believes the first US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs could come to market in the first quarter of 2024, if not sooner."

        "title": "BTC Miners Struggle to Break Even: Cathedra Bitcoin Reports C$2.9 Million Loss - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The financial results of yet another publicly traded cryptocurrency miner showed that it is challenging to make a net profit under current market conditions. Cathedra Bitcoin Inc. (TSX: CBIT), a Toronto-based Bitcoin mining company, has disclosed its financial performance for Q2 2023. Despite the report revealing significant growth in mining output and revenue, the net loss still seems sizable.\n\nCathedra Bitcoin: Modest Growth in Profit and Decline in Net Loss\n\nIn Q2 2023, Cathedra Bitcoin mined 77.15 BTC, marking an increase of 19.5 BTC from the 57.65 BTC mined in the same period last year. This growth is attributed to the company's hash rate Hash Rate A hash rate is the measure of a cryptocurrency miner\u2019s performance and a key security metric. In the context of mining, the more hashing or computing power in a given network, the greater its security and its overall resistance to attackMining hashrate is a key security metric. The more hashing (computing) power in the network, the greater its security and its overall resistance to attack.

Hash rate is also a measurement of the output of a device that is used to add transactions to a blockchain Read this Term expansion from 231 PH/s to 382 PH/s. Despite a surge in the network mining difficulty and a drop in Bitcoin's average price, the company's revenue rose from C$2.5 million in Q2 2022 to C$2.9 million in Q2 2023.\n\nOn top of that, the company has significantly reduced its net loss. Last year, it was C$11.9 million for the three-month period ending in June, and it has now reduced to C$2.9 million. The net loss for the entire first half of the year was C$5.2 million, compared to C$15.8 million reported in the first half of 2022.\n\n\"Recent weeks have seen the improved bitcoin mining conditions of H1 2023 regress to levels comparable to the most challenging periods of Q4 2022. During this time, we remain focused on finding creative, capital-efficient ways to create value for our shareholders,\" the company commented in the official press release.\n\nHowever, this doesn't change the fact that Cathedra Bitcoin is another publicly traded crypto miner that recently published a financial report showing a net loss. The pattern is usually the same: companies are mining more Bitcoins but cannot achieve profitability.\n\nJust yesterday, companies like Canaan and Argo Blockchain released their reports. The former saw a quarterly revenue increase to $73.9 million, but this was significantly lower than the $245.9 million reported in Q2 2022. The latter reported a decline of 31% in revenue to $24 million for H1 2023. Riot Platforms Inc. and Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. also posted adverse financial outcomes for Q2 2023.\n\nThese companies are among five publicly-listed firms that have suffered a loss of $2.8 billion following a sharp decline in Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market in mid-August.\n\nSource: AltIndex\n\nDevelopment despite Difficult Conditions\n\nAlthough market conditions are not favorable, Cathedra Bitcoin is constantly trying to grow its business. The company managed its debts effectively, converting C$2.5 million of its 3.5% senior secured convertible debentures into 18.5 million common shares. As of the end of August 2023, the company holds approximately C$4.4 million in cash and Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term, providing a solid liquidity position.\n\nThe company completed the deployment of Bitmain Antminer S19J Pro and XP machines at its data centers in Washington and a facility in Kentucky. A renewed hosting agreement with a partner in Tennessee and a new strategic partnership with 360 Mining in Texas further expanded its operational footprint.\n\n\"This focus is exemplified by our recent partnership with 360 Mining, under which we will continue to deploy idle hash rate and infrastructure with minimal capex, as well as our ongoing efforts to underclock our machines using custom firmware to ensure profitability. As always, we thank our shareholders for their continued support,\" the company added.\n\nCathedra Bitcoin aims to enhance its energy efficiency by underclocking its mining machines, thereby reducing the break-even hash price by 12%. This move is expected to maintain the machines' positive cash flow."

Their project is a never-ending saga as an application approval is pending since 2021.\n\nAfter experiencing prior failures from the SEC because of worries about market manipulation and insufficient investor safeguards, this year marked the beginning of their renewed push.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of Ark, is optimistic. She imagines the SEC approving several ETFs at once, with success being largely dependent on marketing skill and effective communication.\n\n\u201cBecause most of these essentially will be the same, it will come down to marketing and communicating the message. We are trying to get the word out there that our research is deep, and we have been doing it since 2015,\u201d Wood said .\n\nHowever, Scott Farnin, the Better Markets\u2019 legal counsel, expressed grave doubts. Farnin argued that the proposals\u2019 surveillance-sharing agreements were insufficient prior to the SEC\u2019s recent judgment.\n\nAs a result of its inflated trading volumes, concentration, and reliance on a small number of people and organizations, Farnin emphasized that Bitcoin is vulnerable to manipulation. He said that because of these characteristics, the proposed spot Bitcoin-based ETF is particularly vulnerable to abuse, putting investors at undue risk.\n\n\u201cThe principal beneficiaries of the crypto craze are the criminals who use it to facilitate ransomware, money laundering, and illegal conduct of all types. It is within this context that the SEC must evaluate the latest wave of Bitcoin ETF filings this month,\u201d Farnin stated .\n\nHe also urged the SEC to take into account Bitcoin\u2019s inherent weaknesses and to continue rejecting spot Bitcoin-based ETFs that do not adhere to legal criteria.\n\nGrayscale Files Lawsuit in Pursuit of Approval\n\nGrayscale Investments\u2019 proposal to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF was rejected by the SEC last year on the grounds that the cryptocurrency markets are too vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. Because the SEC had already approved ETFs that follow Bitcoin futures, Grayscale filed a lawsuit seeking the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision, which the business described as being arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\nFor years, there has been a strong desire for a spot-Bitcoin ETF among members of the crypto community and outside supporters. They contend that it would not only help bring digital assets closer to traditional financial markets but would also make investment in Bitcoin more accessible to regular individuals.\n\nRegulators have continuously refused to authorize such a product, however, citing fraud and manipulation as some of the reasons. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who established Gemini, were the first company to file for a physically backed Bitcoin ETF in 2013. Similar to numerous other attempts by other issuers, SEC turned it down.\n\nElliott Stein, senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted that the SEC would put off making decisions \u201cto the extent that it can\u201d until a judgement in Grayscale was made by the court. He calculates that Grayscale has a 70% chance of succeeding in getting the SEC\u2019s rejection order overturned.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Entry Sparks Optimism for Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nWhen it filed in June, BlackRock Inc. put the race for a spot-Bitcoin fund into high gear. As the asset manager\u2019s nearly flawless track record of launching ETFs, some analysts hypothesized that this time, the applications \u2014 from BlackRock and others \u2014 could have a higher likelihood of being accepted.\n\nAnd the current excitement over the prospect of a fund has given businesses the confidence to experiment with more unconventional vehicles in addition to Bitcoin ETFs. Several businesses have submitted papers for funds that combine Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and/or Ether futures.\n\nAccording to some reports, the SEC will approve the trading of Ether-futures funds in October, which many see as a victory for the sector.\n\nAfter reaching around $31,000 in mid-July, the price of Bitcoin was standing at around $27,178 on Thursday. In late 2021, the value of the biggest digital asset reached an all-time high of about $69,000."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGrayscale achieves a partial victory against SEC.\n\nBitcoin spiked to $28,000 after court decision.\n\nChart analysis points out a potential downtrend continuation.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled a reassessment of the SEC\u2019s refusal of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application. This development marks a significant turning point in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHistorically, the SEC has rejected Bitcoin ETF proposals, citing concerns about market manipulation. However, the court emphasized that the SEC\u2019s reasons for denial lacked clear comprehensiveness.\n\nThe court explained that the SEC failed to offer sufficient rationale for approving the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs while rejecting Grayscale\u2019s proposed Bitcoin ETP.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged over 7% to $28,000 on Tuesday after a U.S. federal appeals court directed the SEC to re-evaluate its denial of Grayscale Investments\u2019 proposal to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nWhile Bitcoin settled just above $27,900, GBTC\u2019s value increased by 17%. This court decision hints at the potential for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which could enhance accessibility to Bitcoin investments.\n\nAfter the news, crypto stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy surged. Major altcoins also rose about 5%. The ruling visibly impacted the market, causing $87 million in shorts to be liquidated in a day, possibly leading to the price spike.\n\nAs Bitcoin previously fell by 14%, can this be a catalyst for an upturn?\n\nOn-chain data\n\nThe positive news definitely impacted the cryptocurrency market and boosted Bitcoin price. But what did actually cause this spike?\n\nLooking at the Bitcoin all exchanges reserves chart, there is evidence of an on-chain accumulation. From August 15, when the price started decreasing, the number of Bitcoins on exchange hasn\u2019t changed a lot. But in the sideways range that followed between August 18 and 28, it started picking up the momentum.\n\nIt went from 2,071,250 to 2,028,169 right before the rise and has now fallen to 2,007,135. This suggests that, before the news, investors had been accumulating Bitcoin in its sideways range and later doubled down after the news came.\n\nThe derivatives market has certainly amplified the increase. Open interest, which represents the number of open positions (long and short), was also on the rise. This metric suggests that traders reacted to the news and were attentive in capturing the uptrend.\n\nThere was a large spike in short liquidations that definitely added to the price rise, as short positions were forced to buy up the coin as their stop losses were reached.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous Bitcoin analysis, we projected the start of a recovery to exactly $28,000.\n\nThis was expected as a corrective move, either as a lower B wave from the ABC correction to target the $22,000 area for Bitcoin, or as wave 2 from the larger five-wave impulse downward.\n\nIn both cases, we may see a further downside movement for the Bitcoin, according to these counts, as the uptrend completion occurred. $28,000 is a significant horizontal level that served as support and is now being tested for resistance. We saw a large price spike but the overall bearish structure hasn\u2019t been broken.\n\nReviewing the current chart, this projection remains valid, even if the price rises slightly. It would become invalid if it surpasses its previous high of $31,850. This would suggest the earlier assumed completed uptrend has further potential upward movement.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the midst of the recent regulatory developments, markets reacted positively. It is important to note that this isn\u2019t a major victory nor it indicates that the Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF is a certainty.\n\nOn the other hand, it just means that the U.S. regulators have taken a fair approach to crypto regulations and haven\u2019t been one-sided on the ETF matter. Bitcoin\u2019s price rose on both fundamentals and technicals sides but can this rise propel the market into a sustainable uptrend?\n\nWe are going to see shortly the outcome as $28,000 may be an area of strong resistance that is going to set up the price into a further downtrend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "U.S. District Court Judge Labels Ether and Bitcoin as \"Crypto Commodities\" in Dismissal of Lawsuit Against Uniswap\n\nIn a significant legal development, United States District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap while categorizing Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) as \"crypto commodities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Uniswap users who alleged financial losses due to fraudulent tokens on the exchange.\n\nJudge Failla's dismissal order, issued on August 30, highlighted the unique nature of cryptocurrencies by referring to ETH and BTC as \"crypto commodities.\" This classification played a pivotal role in her decision to reject the case that Uniswap\u2019s token sales are to be regulated under the exchange act.\n\nHowever, her statement does not serve as a definitive ruling on the legal status of Ethereum and Bitcoin in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThis latest judgment diverges from recent legal actions that have treated certain cryptocurrencies differently. Notably, a July ruling by a U.S. federal judge classified XRP as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when sold to the general public or distributed to staff members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was left \u201cdisappointed,\u201d with the agency planning to appeal the decision.\n\nThe disagreement between regulatory bodies adds another layer of complexity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been debating jurisdictional rights concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler's assertion that \"everything other than Bitcoin\" falls under the SEC's jurisdiction as securities, which clashes with the CFTC's claim that cryptocurrencies, including Ether, should be treated as commodities.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has prompted lawmakers to introduce various bills in Congress aimed at bringing clarity to the issue.\n\nHowever, these bills propose differing solutions, including categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, and determining the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong these bills, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act suggests a process for classifying cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposes the registration and regulation of crypto spot exchanges under the CFTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill introduces the concept of SEC certification for cryptocurrencies, ensuring sufficient decentralization before granting commodity status."

        "title": "CME Bitcoin trading volume surpasses Bybit, but is it impacting BTC price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced its Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017. This was around the same time that Bitcoin (BTC) had reached an all-time high of $19,800, but by late 2018, the price had dropped to $3,100. Investors in cryptocurrencies quickly learned that CME derivative contracts allowed them to make bullish bets with leverage but also enabled them to bet against the price, a practice known as shorting.\n\nHistorically, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals due to concerns about manipulation on unregulated exchanges. The growing significance of CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures market might address this issue, and recently, Hashdex has even requested a Bitcoin ETF that relies on Bitcoin's physical trades within the CME market.\n\nProfessional traders often use BTC derivatives to hedge risks. For instance, one can sell futures contracts while simultaneously buying BTC using borrowed stablecoins using margin. Other examples include selling longer-term BTC futures contracts while purchasing perpetual contracts, which could help a trader benefit from price discrepancies over time.\n\nCME overtook Bybit to become the second-largest BTC futures market\n\nCME has played a key role in the Bitcoin futures market since 2020, amassing an impressive $5.45 billion in open interest by October 2021. However, over the following years, the gap widened, as CME's Bitcoin futures market reached $1.2 billion in January 2023, trailing behind exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit and Bitget.\n\nMore recently, the Bitcoin price dropped by 12.8% between Aug. 16 and Aug. 17, leading to a $2.4 billion reduction in the aggregate futures open interest. Notably, CME was the only exchange unaffected in terms of open interest. As a result, CME became the second-largest trading platform on Aug. 17, with $2.24 billion in BTC open interest, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nBitcoin futures open interest ranking. Source: CoinGlass\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that CME exclusively offers monthly contracts, which differ from perpetual or inverse swap contracts, the most traded products on crypto exchanges. Additionally, CME contracts are always cash-settled, while crypto exchanges provide contracts based on both stablecoins and BTC. These distinctions contribute to the difference in open interest between CME and crypto exchanges, but there's more to the story.\n\nCME futures show discrepancies relative to crypto exchanges\n\nAside from differences in contract settlement and the absence of perpetual contracts, the trading of Bitcoin futures on the CME diverges significantly from most crypto exchanges in terms of both volume and pricing dynamics. The CME records an average daily volume of $1.85 billion, which falls short of its $2.24 billion open interest.\n\nIn contrast, Binance\u2019s BTC futures see a daily volume nearing $10 billion, three times greater than its open interest. A comparable pattern is observed at the OKX exchange, where daily trading in BTC futures reaches about $4 billion, surpassing its $1.4 billion open interest. This variance can be attributed partially to CME\u2019s higher margin requirement and the fee-free trading environment for market makers on crypto exchanges. Additionally, CME\u2019s trading hours are constrained, with a halt from 4:00 pm Central Time to 5:00 pm and a full closure on Saturdays.\n\nHowever, various factors contribute to price distinctions compared to other exchanges. These include shifts in demand for leverage among long and short positions, along with potential disparities in the Bitcoin index price calculation across different providers. Lastly, it\u2019s crucial to consider the solvency risks associated with the tie-up of margin deposits (collateral) until the BTC futures contract settlement.\n\nRelated: When will it be too late to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nDecember 2023 BTC futures, CME (blue) vs. Binance (orange) vs. Bybit (cyan). Source: TradingView\n\nNotably, CME Bitcoin futures have traded at approximately $280 higher than those on Binance for the same December 2023 expiration. Ultimately, the day-to-day pricing of BTC futures contracts hinges on several variables. While CME\u2019s trading volumes are trending upward, its pricing mechanism might not flawlessly mirror Bitcoin\u2019s price movements on crypto exchanges.\n\nGiven the intricate interplay of variables impacting its pricing and trading dynamics, it fails to provide enhanced price guidance to BTC investors.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Circuit\u2019s decision in SEC vs. Grayscale. This victory requires the SEC to review its stance on the spot-based Bitcoin ETF application. As a result, BTC and related tokens such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), and Stacks (STX) have all gained positively.\n\nBitcoin Cash increased by 19% on Tuesday, August 30, 2023, reaching $228 and making an overall increase of 40% since its August 18 low of $162.\n\nBitcoin Cash originated in 2017 from Bitcoin through a blockchain fork, resulting in the creation of a distinct asset and network based on a copy of Bitcoin\u2019s code.\n\nThis is why it wasn\u2019t deemed as an unregistered security as it was offered to Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork.\n\nIn a resurfaced video from 2018, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, Gary Gensler, asserted that Bitcoin Cash \u2013 just like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin \u2013 are not considered as securities.\n\nChair Gensler in 2018 at a Bloomberg conference in NYC: \u201cBitcoin.

Deep fake? pic.twitter.com/p7DJlYkJIt \u2014 Ryan Selkis \ud83e\udeb3 (@twobitidiot) June 12, 2023\n\nThis video posted in mid-June had an explosive price rise of Bitcoin Cash followed. From June, 10 when the price was sitting at $100, a 227% increase to $328 happened on July 1, propelled by the the Wall Street-approved EDX exchange listing on 20 June.\n\nThis definitely proves that Bitcoin\u2019s regulatory sentiment impacts its forks and related projects and Bitcoin Cash has been paving the way.\n\nBCH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous BCH analysis on July 27, we projected another lower low before the price enters a bullish period. This lower low was expected to be at around $221.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, the price could potentially drop to around $221 before recovering to somewhere in the region of $360.\u201d\n\nThe price initially dropped to $221 on August 3 and then climbed to $246. But it lacked the momentum to sustain the upward movement and faced rejection at the descending trendline. This seems to be a continuation of corrective wave 4, with the price now aiming for a new high above $331.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting from November 10, 2022, a five-wave upswing began. The drop to $162 on August 18 finished wave 4. If this holds and the price rises again, it could validate our initial bull cycle hypothesis. Alternatively, the jump to $331 on June 30 ended the ABC correction, wave X from the highest count. This implies the descent from August begins the broader wave Z, potentially taking the price to the $90 support zone.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s positive surge, Bitcoin Cash has also rebounded strongly. Despite a slightly deeper expected low in line with our prior analysis, our bullish perspective remains intact. Nevertheless, a downturn below the $180 initial point of this uptrend might suggest a corrective increase, signaling the beginning of a broader downtrend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "No, Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not inherently bullish for crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto analysts on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) and in YouTube interviews have been abuzz with talk about the trend of Bitcoin leaving centralized exchanges.\n\nOn Aug. 29, the quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) held within exchanges saw a decline, reaching its lowest point since January 2018. While various factors might underlie this movement, experts analyzing blockchain data often interpret the shift as a positive indicator. Traders are now questioning what might have been causing Bitcoin\u2019s inability to break above $31,000 since this price action doesn\u2019t align with their view that fewer coins on exchanges is bullish for the BTC price.\n\nThe perspective on the decline of Bitcoin held at centralized exchanges stems from the notion that when traders withdraw their coins, it signals a bullish sentiment. This is typically associated with a strategy of holding assets in self-custody for the long haul.\n\nAlthough these suppositions lack conclusive evidence, their persistence likely stems from historical precedent. However, establishing a relationship between these events and a specific cause remains elusive, regardless of the frequency of such occurrences. While buying on exchanges might necessitate depositing fiat currency beforehand, the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\nData fails to show correlation between on-chain metrics and Bitcoin price action\n\nData from blockchain transactions displays a consistent reduction in Bitcoin deposits on exchanges since mid-May. Concurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory fails to offer substantial indications of a bullish upswing, with the exception of a brief surge in mid-June that coincided with BlackRock's submission of an application for a spot exchange-traded fund.\n\nBitcoin aggregate exchange net position change, in BTC. Source: Glassnode\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the period encompassing a 30% surge from March 12 to March 19 witnessed an increase in deposits on exchanges, contrasting the predictions of on-chain analysis. Despite this contradiction, instances of influencers addressing the weaknesses in these enduring myths are scarce. This could be attributed to the simplicity of linking deposits on exchanges to an augmented inclination for selling.\n\nCertainly, all indicators are prone to occasional inaccuracies, and depending solely on on-chain analysis to dictate market trends is unwise. Yet, the notion that withdrawals from exchanges are predominantly earmarked for transfer to cold storage lacks substantial grounding and exists largely as a hypothetical proposition. For example, there are three possible reasons that explain reduced deposits on exchanges unrelated to a diminished short-term selling intent.\n\nBitcoin holders shifted to a reliable custody solution\n\nThe foremost explanation for Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges not necessarily indicating a decrease in short-term selling pressure is the burgeoning trust in custody solutions. This implies that these coins might have been acquired in the past, and only recently has the owner felt at ease moving them. Notably, reputable custodians like Prime Trust took investors by surprise when it sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware due to a shortage in customer funds. Additionally, a staggering sum of approximately $35 million in crypto assets was pilfered from Atomic Wallet users in June. The prevailing lack of trust in custody solutions could elucidate the cautious approach investors adopted before initiating withdrawals from exchanges.\n\nInvestors have lost confidence in centralized exchanges\n\nOn June 5, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a legal suit against Binance, alleging the offering of unregistered securities. Just a day following the Binance lawsuit, the commission turned its focus to Coinbase on analogous grounds, contending that prominent altcoins provided by the exchange meet the criteria for securities. Further compounding matters, an Aug. 2 report from Semafor disclosed that United States Justice Department officials expressed apprehensions about a Binance indictment triggering a run on the exchange, akin to the events surrounding FTX in November 2022. These regulatory actions may have influenced users\u2019 decisions to keep their deposited coins away from exchanges, irrespective of their selling intentions, thus rendering the withdrawals unrelated to price fluctuations.\n\nDecreasing interest from buyers could balance out the trend\n\nEven if one postulates that the majority of the Bitcoin departing from exchanges is indeed headed to cold wallets, implying holders have a reduced propensity to engage in short-term selling, the demand facet of the equation has encountered its own set of challenges. For instance, a search for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d on Google Trends has struggled to surpass 50% of its previous two-year peak.\n\nGoogle Trend searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d worldwide. Source: Google\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin\u2019s spot trading volume has averaged a modest $7 billion per day in August, representing less than half the trading activity observed between January and March.\n\nBitcoin adjusted daily volume, USD. Source: Messari and Kaiko\n\nAs a result, the data underscores a waning interest from buyers, which in turn mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s lack of bullish momentum. This parallel trend aligns with the decrease in the number of coins being deposited on exchanges. Consequently, despite Bitcoin\u2019s exchange deposits plummeting to levels last seen in 2018, the effect on the supply-demand equilibrium is negligible, owing to the subdued trading activity that has prevailed.\n\nUltimately, while on-chain metric analysis might provide foundational support for the notion of coins transitioning to the possession of long-term holders, this viewpoint offers scant backing in terms of price dynamics, as the movement may reflect a broader reluctance to actively trade the asset.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Grayscale\u2019s legal head says bitcoin spot ETF approval is a \u2018matter of when, not if\u2019 - TechCrunch",
        "content": "After the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of digital asset management firm Grayscale in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regards to a bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF), the firm\u2019s chief legal officer Craig Salm expects the regulator to approve the ETF.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when, not a matter of if,\u201d bitcoin spot ETFs will be approved in the U.S., Salm told me on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast.\n\nThe new verdict was in response to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF on June 29, 2022. The court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin \u201cworth tens of billions of dollars,\u201d according to the legal filing.\n\n\u201c[The ruling] is a huge win for us, our shareholders and really the whole crypto community. Right now, we\u2019re focused on finishing those final steps to get this conversion to happen,\u201d Salm said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait any longer to let that happen, especially now that we have this paving of the road to an ETF conversion.\u201d\n\nThe exact timeline is difficult to predict, as the ruling is subject to a 45-day review period, Salm noted. But if there\u2019s no \u201crehearing,\u201d then it will be smooth sailing for the company. Bloomberg ETF analysts increased their odds from 65% to 75% that the SEC will approve a bitcoin spot ETF this year and are betting on odds of 95% by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cMy view is that this should happen as soon as possible because we have investors today. GBTC represents nearly a million investors across all 50 states,\u201d Salm said. \u201cBut because the product is not an ETF today, it is trading at a discount.\u201d\n\nOn August 30, GBTC traded at a 19.5% discount to the value of its underlying coin, according to YCharts data. Narrowing that discount through a conversion of GBTC into an ETF would represent \u201cbillions of dollars of value being returned to shareholders,\u201d Salm said.\n\nAs for the actual crypto asset, bitcoin\u2019s price rose over 7% on the week after the ruling was announced, but has since retracted to a 4% gain during the past seven days.\n\nGrayscale getting an approval to launch a bitcoin ETF could also boost demand for cryptocurrencies in general. Institutional investors being able to offer (and use) a bitcoin spot ETF in a regulated manner could open the door to traditional financial players, who may have not been able to purchase the cryptocurrency so far due to regulatory constraints, among other reasons.\n\nSure, not every big firm or individual investor will buy bitcoin, but even a small percentage of the trillions of dollars in the financial market will have a massive effect on the supply and demand for bitcoin trading, potentially bolstering its value.\n\nTo that point, over the years, ETF wrappers have proven to be a great way for investors to access any asset class, whether it\u2019s bonds, commodities, securities or cryptocurrencies, Salm said. \u201cIt opens up the universe of investors that can invest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of investors that are more regulated, more institutional, that really need that ETF wrapper [around crypto assets] in their brokerage account with all their other investments if they\u2019re going to make an investment into bitcoin.\u201d\n\nNew investors who buy bitcoin through an ETF \u2014 if it gets approved \u2014 will create a network effect, Salm believes. \u201cThe more people who use [bitcoin], the more usable it becomes, the more valuable and the healthier the whole ecosystem becomes. \u201d\n\nWhile the crypto community, particularly the companies that have applied to form bitcoin spot ETFs, are hopeful this will open the door to traditional investors, there\u2019s no guarantee that we\u2019ll see these ETFs being approved across the board. However, it seems likely that at least more than one will see the light of day soon enough if things work out in the crypto industry\u2019s favor.\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast, Chain Reaction.

        "title": "The Single-Most Important Catalyst Taking Bitcoin and the Crypto Market Higher - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Yesterday's highly awaited decision from a federal appeals court appears to have paved the way for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to finally be launched. This news sent Bitcoin (BTC -0.26%) rocketing higher yesterday, with the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly breaching the $28,000 level. Today, cooler heads and some apparent profit-taking have led Bitcoin to settle around the $27,200 level as of this writing.\n\nA three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel in Washington effectively overturned the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) decision to halt the development of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by crypto asset manager Grayscale. The SEC views futures-based ETFs (which are currently allowed) as safer for investors. The SEC has suggested it will review the decision, but all eyes are now turning to which companies will be in line to launch a spot ETF first.\n\nWhy this ruling matters\n\nGrayscale's proposal appears to be one that should have been approved, at least according to Judge Naomi Rao, who inserted some interesting comments in the court's opinion on this matter. The judge suggested that the \"denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\" In essence, the court failed to see how a spot Bitcoin ETF would be substantially different from a futures-based ETF (which are currently allowed), given the close correlation of the underlying assets of both products.\n\nThe panel appears to be calling into question the SEC's logic with how it has regulated crypto-related products thus far. While crypto proponents have long called for such common sense questioning of the status quo, this latest case of a court siding with the crypto sector certainly has many investors taking a bullish stance on this alternative asset class. This win is the latest feather in the cap of crypto enthusiasts, who previously saw XRP (XRP -0.15%) win a key ruling in its legal fight against the SEC over whether cryptocurrencies constitute securities.\n\nWho will win the race to list the first spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nIt's not entirely clear if Grayscale will be the first to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, even though this victory is tied to the company's legal fight against the SEC. Other high-profile spot Bitcoin ETF applications remain on the SEC's proverbial desk, meaning this precedent-setting victory for Grayscale could lead to an influx of ETFs in a short amount of time.\n\nIf the floodgates open, as many as 10 other spot Bitcoin ETF applications from the likes of BlackRock, Invesco, VanEck and other major asset managers could be approved in short order. Many of these applications have approaching deadlines, which could lead to a flurry of activity in this sector.\n\nSome experts believe that the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs could amount to as much as $150 billion, about the same amount of capital currently floating around in precious metals ETFs. That's plenty of potential capital to be spread across 10 or more spot ETFs, and it could lead to increased competition in this niche, which could potentially result in a race to the bottom in terms of fees for fund managers.\n\nWhat now?\n\nA regulated and competitive spot Bitcoin ETF market only serves to improve liquidity in the Bitcoin and crypto market overall, as well as lower the barriers to entry for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with this alternative asset class. In theory, competitive fee structures and publicly traded ETF options should lead to greater institutional investor adoption, which should prompt more stability in this otherwise volatile asset class.\n\nFor long-term investors who have already diversified into crypto, this court ruling provides the kind of validation many expected to see in years past. As the saying goes, it's better late than never, and with the SEC clearly running into legal roadblocks in its effort to constrain the crypto market, this latest ruling should spur investor interest in this asset class for some time to come."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decisions on six applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAccording to SEC filings dated Aug. 31, the commission has designated a longer period in which it may review spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, as well as the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity. The SEC will have another 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register to consider the proposed rule changes allowing listing of the investment vehicles, giving the regulator until October to approve, deny or delay a decision.\n\nThe delays followed speculation that the SEC could approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. for the first time after the commission lost a crucial court case brought by asset manager Grayscale. An appellate court ruled on Aug. 29 the SEC would need to review Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, leading many experts to suggest the odds for approval of at least one spot crypto ETF had significantly increased.\n\nJUST IN: SEC is opting to delay (as expected) on spot bitcoin ETF deadlines pic.twitter.com/W4JjOji6L2 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 31, 2023\n\nRelated: Grayscale wins the court battle, but what does this mean for a spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Bitcoin ETF proposal didn\u2019t get the SEC\u2019s approval following a 2021 filing.

        "content": "In the evolving Bitcoin market, stories of missed opportunities and astonishing deals abound \u2013 however, few are as eye-popping as this sale from August 30, 2010.\n\nUnearthed by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, a BitcoinTalk thread shows how an early Bitcoin user amassed 30,000 BTC, only to sell them for $0.03 each.\n\nThen sold below market price, roughly $0.06 at the time, the sale netted $900. The same amount of Bitcoin, if sold today, would be worth over $810,000,000.\n\nWhile few could have predicted the meteoric rise of Bitcoin to $27,000 in the years to come, it seems the seller in this case might have been motivated by an interest in disproving that the cryptocurrency would work at all.\n\nThough there is only speculation in the thread, it shows that market participants at the time believed the seller to be William \u201cNenolod\u201d Pitcock, a data center employee who is said to have amassed close to 100,000 BTC that he liquidated in 2010.\n\n\n\nSpeaking about another sale in July, he discussed his motivation was to spark a \u201cbank rush,\u201d writing: \u201cThe purpose was to demonstrate in two ways that the Bitcoin system can be attacked\u2026 [and] cause speculation in the bitcoin economy.\u201d\n\nWhile no connection between the events can be substantiated, the thread, buried in the archives of an early Bitcoin user forum, serves as a time capsule, transporting readers back to a moment when the true potential of Bitcoin was still shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nWhile some may view it as a painful reminder of missed opportunities, others see it as a testament to the enduring allure that Bitcoin has created over the years.\n\nEither wary, thanks to the sale, some lucky Bitcoiners were able to get bids filled at once-in-a-lifetime prices.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "After Grayscale\u2019s landmark court victory over the SEC, CEO Michael Sonnenshein took a victory lap.\n\n\u201cHuge win for Grayscale, huge win for our investors\u2014and really the crypto and investment community as a whole,\u201d he said Wednesday morning in a TV interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Grayscale in its more-than-year-long case with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it claimed that the federal agency had unreasonably denied its request to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. The court found that the SEC could not reasonably explain why it denied Grayscale\u2019s request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust digital asset investment product into a spot Bitcoin ETF after already approving Bitcoin futures products.\n\nCrypto advocates celebrated the ruling as a rare bright spot amid the lingering bear market. News of the decision fueled a 6% jump in the price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, on Tuesday. It was trading at around $27,000 on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSonnenshein said in the interview that the court\u2019s decision vacated the SEC\u2019s denial of its GBTC application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. He pointed out that the SEC has 45 days to request a rehearing, but following that period there will be a final mandate from the court.\n\nDespite increased competition from BlackRock and Fidelity over spot Bitcoin ETFs, Sonnenshein said he didn\u2019t see a need for a surveillance-sharing agreement when it comes to GBTC\u2014an approach considered by peers\u2014although a court ultimately could require one.\n\n\u201cThe court agreed with us,\u201d Sonnenshein continued, \u201cthat the arguments we\u2019ve been putting forward all along throughout this process are such that the SEC already has the tools it needs to approve spot Bitcoin products like GBTC.\u201d\n\nSonnenshein added that Grayscale will lower fees for GBTC once it\u2019s converted to an ETF, which he said the company is working with the SEC to accomplish \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d GBTC charges a fee of 2%, much higher than the average fee of 0.54% across other ETFs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nFollowing the landmark decision on Tuesday, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that he and fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart believed the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year had risen to 75%\u2014and to 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nNEW: @JSeyff & I are upping our odds to 75% of spot bitcoin ETFs launching this yr (95% by end of '24). While we factored Grayscale win into our prev 65% odds, the unanimity & decisiveness of ruling was beyond expectations and leaves SEC w \"very little wiggle room\" via @NYCStein pic.twitter.com/IyEGmWjuHa \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 30, 2023\n\nThe marketplace entry of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors to put money into the cryptocurrency directly without owning it, has the potential to supercharge crypto markets with billions of dollars in liquidity. But that\u2019s also led to some concerns over whether TradFi giants might use their outsize influence to push for changes in the crypto space."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said it needs a \"longer period\" to evaluate several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those of BlackRock, Wisdom Tree Funds, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie Funds.\n\nOne by one, the SEC disclosed delays today for nearly every outstanding spot Bitcoin ETF application, except for Global X\u2019s\u2014the SEC\u2019s deadline to respond is Oct. 7. Notably, the regulator saved BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, for last.\n\nAccording to filings from the securities regulator, it'll need until at least Oct. 17 to decide whether to approve or reject most of the applications. The SEC set a fresh deadline of Oct. 16 for Bitwise's application, while Valkyrie received a deadline of Oct. 19. The SEC would have otherwise been due to announce a decision on the applications before Saturday, Sept. 2.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this week there was a spike in anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin\u2014after a court sided with crypto asset manager Grayscale in its own effort to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBut as experts have pointed out, the court ruling isn't the same as an approval and the securities regulator still has 45 days to appeal the judge's opinion. An appeal is possible but unlikely, Coffey Modica of LLP Joseph A. D\u2019Avanzo previously told Decrypt.\n\nMarket analysts, such as Bloomberg\u2019s ETF expert James Seyffart, said earlier this week they expected the SEC to delay decisions on the remaining Bitcoin ETF applications, as it digests the court order that poked holes in its reasoning for repeated rejections.\n\nThe agency has swatted down spot Bitcoin ETF applications since 2013, citing fraud and market manipulation concerns. But judges earlier this week said the logic doesn\u2019t track, considering the SEC has approved applications for futures Bitcoin ETFs since 2021.\n\nAs the SEC\u2019s delays came about, Bitcoin moved lower. As of this writing, the coin was down 4.1% over the past day at around $26,100, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has recently delayed decisions for other spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls as well. ARK Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, filed an application for the Ark21Shares ETF in June 2021. The agency punted earlier this month.\n\nWith several Wall Street titans in the mix with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own, including BlackRock and Fidelity, crypto\u2019s years-long quest to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF has gained momentum and arguably resembles a regulatory footrace.\n\nAs anticipation within crypto circles increased incrementally, so too have the odds of a regulatory green light. Seyffart of Bloomberg penciled in a 75% chance that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year, giving the odds a bump in light of Grayscale\u2019s victory.\n\nStill, if the starting gun ever comes, firms like Grayscale have argued it would be unfair for the SEC to let one asset manager move forward while others are left waiting. In July, the company said all spot Bitcoin ETFs should be approved at once because the SEC \u201cshould not pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to include the full list of Bitcoin ETF applications for which the SEC issued delay notices today."

The move would limit the SEC\u2019s oversight of the industry, assuming crypto regulations were deemed a \u201cmajor question.\u201d\n\nHowever, the question as to whether the doctrine applies to the crypto industry is currently being tested in U.S. courts. While several amicus briefs were filed in support of Coinbase making the same argument, a recent court hearing in the Terraform Labs case ruled the doctrine doesn't apply to crypto tokens because its economic implications aren't significant enough.\n\nRamaswamy is one of three presidential candidates still in the running who has shown outward support for the crypto industry, along with Robert Kennedy Jr. and Ron DeSantis.\n\nTesla CEO and multibillionaire Elon Musk recently praised Ramaswamy for his acceptance of Bitcoin and pro-crypto advocacy, adding that he stands as a \u201cvery promising candidate.\u201c\n\nIn late May, the presidential candidate began accepting Bitcoin for campaign donations.\n\nRelated: GBTC Bitcoin \u2018discount\u2019 may be gone by 2024 as share price gains 17%\n\nGrayscale Investments' recent court victory against the SEC on Aug. 29 was lauded as a win for the cryptocurrency space and Bitcoin ETFs in particular.\n\nBTC\u2019s price increased 7.3% to $27,940 before cooling off to $27,200 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko, while several analysts from Bloomberg noted that Grayscale\u2019s win increases the likelihood of spot Bitcoin ETFs being approved by the end of 2023.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

        "content": "Amazon is the biggest retailer in the US, and the sixth largest retailer in the world. With rapid international delivery options and a huge selection of products, there\u2019s no wonder why it\u2019s so popular.\n\nWhat some people have been wondering, however, is whether it\u2019s possible to spend their favourite crypto on their favourite online store.\n\nDoes Amazon accept bitcoins? What about other crypto payment options? Let\u2019s look into the options when it comes to spending bitcoins on Amazon.\n\nDoes Amazon Accept Bitcoins?\n\nTechnically, no, Amazon does not accept direct spending of bitcoins. Amazon\u2019s stance on accepting cryptocurrency remains unclear at this time.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t spend Bitcoin or other cryptos on Amazon through other means!\n\nWith crypto cards and gift cards on the rise, there are a number of ways to use bitcoins on Amazon without spending it directly on the store.\n\nHow to Use Bitcoin on Amazon?\n\nThere are many ways to spend Bitcoin, even if a vendor doesn\u2019t have direct Bitcoin transaction capabilities on their site or in their brick-and-mortar store.\n\nThere are 2 ways to use Bitcoin on Amazon.\n\nUse Crypto Card to pay with crypto on Amazon\n\nBuy Amazon gift cards with cryptocurrency\n\nUse Crypto Card to Pay with Crypto on Amazon\n\nThis option is the best way to use Bitcoin on Amazon. Simply sign up for a crypto card, top it up, and spend Bitcoin or other cryptos on Amazon.\n\nA crypto card is like a regular bank or payment card, but one that allows crypto payments. Most crypto cards support 5 \u2013 10 cryptos and may require manual conversion of crypto to fiat before allowing a purchase, a process that can be slow and expensive.\n\nHowever, the CryptoWallet.com crypto card has the lowest fees and most supported cryptos in the world, plus direct spending! Check out our whitelist for more info.\n\nBuy Amazon Gift Cards with Cryptocurrency\n\nThere\u2019s another option when it comes to Amazon accepting crypto \u2013 gift cards!\n\nAmazon gift cards are like vouchers that are only accepted on Amazon. You can buy them from many locations and redeem them online for Amazon products just like you would spend cash at a store.\n\nThink of an Amazon gift card like a prepaid bank card \u2013 it has a balance, listed in fiat, which you can spend on anything you like on Amazon.\n\nYou can easily buy gift cards with Bitcoin on sites like Coinsbee or CryptoRefills. Read our section further down in this article for more details on how to complete this process.\n\nWill Amazon Ever Accept Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether Amazon will accept Bitcoin in the future. The last official statement on the matter was in 2014, when Amazon stated that it would not be accepting Bitcoin payments, but much has changed since then.\n\nWith major companies like PayPal, AT&T, and American Express embracing Bitcoin, it\u2019s possible that Amazon will eventually come around as well.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another point to consider. There are indications that Amazon may launch its own digital currency, with a beta project already being rolled out in Mexico. If Amazon intends to launch a major digital currency through its platform, the company may not wish to lend credence or support to existing competitors like Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto Card: Spend Bitcoin and 800+ Cryptos on Amazon\n\nThe CryptoWallet.com crypto card allows direct spending of crypto, meaning you can simply make a transaction and the card will instantly update your wallet balance. The card works with on-platform or third-party wallets, it supports over 800 cryptos, and it has the lowest fees out of any crypto card in the world.\n\nSign up for our crypto card here.\n\nAmazon Crypto Payments FAQs"

        "content": "A year ago, it would have sounded impossible to imagine inscribing artwork, games, or even meme tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, but now it is possible thanks to Ordinals . The Bitcoin community has seen astonishing changes over the last few months.\n\nAnd the latest on the list of changes is that users can add fully-on-chain music to Bitcoin. Let\u2019s discover more about this initiative.\n\nWhat is Audionals?\n\nNew projects have found ways to inscribe on-chain music onto the Bitcoin blockchain and sell it as individual Ordinals. Anyone can now generate a music track on the blockchain by simply entering a few keywords. So, one of the projects enabling the inscription of audio files on the Bitcoin blockchain is Audionals. It provides a tool for developers, sound engineers, musicians, and audiophile collectors to add music to the blockchain.\n\nThe Audional Sequencer has been updated. Audional samples hardcoded onto the load buttons for fast selection. Samples can now be loaded seamlessly during live play, even entirely new sequences, without any pause in the music! Song inscriptions coming on https://t.co/BV7kLjqCm9 pic.twitter.com/orWX8QZPdP \u2014 @audionals (@audionals) July 27, 2023\n\nAudionals relies on the transparent and immutable nature of blockchain technology to offer a unique way of inscribing audio directly to the Bitcoin blockchain. This service could potentially usher in a new era of music ownership, content creation, and distribution, as well as disrupt the traditional music industry.\n\nHow does Audionals Achieve this?\n\nThe core technology behind Audionals is the inscription of audio data to the blockchain in the form of Base64-encoded JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files. Audionals accepts audio files encoded in the Base64 format, which converts binary data into a sequence of ASCII characters. Then, this audio data is embedded within a JSON file.\n\nOne of the advantages of this strategy is that the audio data is simply indexable and sortable thanks to the JSON format. The JSON file can include metadata, such as the audio format, the instrument applied, the genre, key, BPM, and user-defined features.\n\nSo, this makes it easier to search for, organize, and modify audio files on Audionals. It simply generates an accessible database of audio files that can be sorted and searched, making it effective and user-friendly.\n\nWorking on a new musical genre.. Live music production using an #ordinal sequencer with multiple #audional inscriptions to write new music in an entirely web3 environment Remixing #btc satoshis live, direct from an immutable, shared global library. Might call it Early Music \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/UrB8fCggni \u2014 Jim.btc (@jimdotbtc) July 7, 2023\n\nIn addition, the direct inscription of audio data on the blockchain has significant ramifications for authenticity, ownership, and copyright. When audio is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes unchangeable and irreversible. It is transparently owned and cannot be changed or erased.\n\nOrdinals are Changing the Game\n\nCasey Rodarmor exploited a loophole in Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Taproot upgrade and helped launch Ordinals in January. Ordinals enable the inscription of different data file formats onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIt's been quite a journey, but we've built a standalone player that will play any number of #audional inscribed AUDX songs.

        "title": "How Bitcoin mining is a model for modern industrial loads - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining has long been attacked by policymakers as an expensive, wasteful industry consuming power that would otherwise be going to households or valuable industries. Indeed, the scale of global Bitcoin mining is massive: Coin Metrics estimates that Bitcoin miners today consume 13.5GW of power, equivalent to 15% of the peak generation capacity of the Texas grid. But in recent years miners have adapted to changing grid conditions and found ways to make their presence much more benign \u2014 whether this involves exploiting entirely stranded sources of power, like flared gas, by co-locating with under-monetized renewables, or by participating in grid flexibilization initiatives.\n\nBitcoin miners are pioneers in this respect, in the future we can expect other types of energy-intense industries to follow their lead. In future years, I expect that Bitcoin miners will be looked on by environmentalists and policymakers not with scorn, but with grudging admiration. In time, it will be undeniable that miners helped develop a new type of industrial \u201csmart load\u201d that is more able to accommodate renewables, bring load to the generation source and turn down when necessary.\n\nThe green transition is changing the way electrical grids work. We are moving from a model of fossil-fueled generation which ramps up and down to accommodate load to one in which variable, intermittent renewables play a much larger role. This means a few things: grid operators must find ways to modulate demand up and down (to accommodate the unpredictable nature of wind and solar), rather than just moving supply up and down.\n\nThis is known as demand response, and environmentalists consider this a vital tool in architecting an energy transition \u2014 bringing about a world where energy consumers are able to respond in real time to changing grid conditions. The IEA has called for dramatically more demand response in order to meet Net Zero scenarios. This means that households are increasingly being asked to install smart thermostats which can strategically curtail when electricity is scarce. But no one wants to turn down their AC on a hot day \u2014 even better if industrial consumers of power are able to perform this service. And indeed, energy-intensive industries like aluminum smelting, steel plants, cement production, paper pulping and oil refinery do play this role. However, all these industrial processes cannot fully ramp down their usage, and they can\u2019t curtail indefinitely or on very short notice. Bitcoin miners by contrast can ramp down fully on a moment\u2019s notice and stay off indefinitely (since the process of mining Bitcoin is actually trillions of distinct mathematical operations each second \u2014 there is no \u201cprogress\u201d in SHA-256).\n\nFor this reason, miners have found themselves very able to participate in demand response, and have begun building this into their strategies. As it turns out, in some markets, it\u2019s more profitable for a miner to plan to be online 95% or 90% of the time and to turn off strategically when energy is scarce (and expensive). In fact, grids benefit from loads that can do this \u2014 that they will actually pay miners to turn themselves off \u2014 since that\u2019s cheaper than paying a generation source to come online quickly. In Texas, during the recent summer heat in which the grid was taxed, Bitcoin miners went offline, freeing that power up for other uses.\n\nA recent paper from the Energy Systems Integration Group shows exactly how this works. As the power grid experienced congestion during a few hot July days, the price of power spiked, and Bitcoin miners strategically went offline.\n\nThere have been concerns that Bitcoin miners might overwhelm the Texas grid, but that didn\u2019t happen. Texas has been able to manage its influx with the large flexible loads task force. In practice, miners achieve a dual benefit by paying for more generation to be added to the grid (and in Texas, the vast majority of new power being brought online is wind, solar and battery storage) while turning down when needed. They are a model citizen as far as renewable grids are concerned.\n\nBy being location agnostic, miners are also able to exploit sources of power, especially renewable, that are otherwise underutilized. Ordinarily, fossil-fueled generation is built near population centers. However, wind and solar resources may not be near cities or industrial parks, so expensive transmission must be built to deliver that power to load centers. Miners can mine from anywhere, so they can go straight to the source. We see this with Crusoe Energy, which mines right on remote oil and gas wells, using excess methane. Only a few industries historically have been able to do this. In the past, aluminum smelters would locate themselves right on abundant power sources, like hydro in upstate New York. In some cases, Bitcoin miners have moved into these old facilities.\n\nNewer industrial loads should follow this model, especially as modern grids incorporate more remote wind and solar (and transmission remains a bottleneck). Already, other power-intense industries like green hydrogen production, desalination and fertilizer production are mirroring the development of Bitcoin mining. Other industries will be challenged to follow Bitcoin\u2019s model. Cloud computing, which is growing rapidly because of AI, is a candidate.\n\nCurrently, ordinary data centers are less able to interrupt themselves like Bitcoin data centers do, since they do suffer serious costs if they were forced to turn down on short notice. Cloud computing providers provide uptime and reliability guarantees to their clients, so they can\u2019t tolerate an outage at the data center level. AI data centers doing model training probably won\u2019t be able to tolerate downtime at all. But inference (the practice of interrogating an existing model) could potentially be made interruptible.\n\nAs AI continues to grow and consume more and more energy, policymakers and the press will ask the same questions of the AI sector. AI data centers should follow the example of Bitcoin miners: they should look to co-locate with renewables, bring their load right to the generation source, and figure out how to bake in unscheduled downtime into their operations. Their future might depend on it.\n\nMegan Nyvold is Head of Media, North America, leading crypto exchange BingX.\n\nThis article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is facing its first deadlines to decide on seven spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund applications, with the latest being Sept. 4 amid its defeat to Grayscale Investments in a U.S. federal appeals court.\n\nInvestment firm Bitwise will learn if its ETF will win the SEC\u2019s approval on Sept. 1 while BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Invesco and Wisdomtree will all be awaiting the SEC\u2019s decision for their funds by Sept. 2, according to several SEC filings.\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie is set to hear back from the SEC on Sept. 4.\n\nList of recent Bitcoin spot ETF applicant filing dates and deadlines. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on Aug. 29 that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d \u2014 but this doesn\u2019t mean the SEC must approve Grayscale\u2019s application or others in the future, says Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nIn an Aug. 29 Bloomberg interview, Seyffart explained that Grayscale\u2019s win \u201cdefinitely\u201d increases the odds of a successful outcome for the next wave of applicants.\n\nHe isn\u2019t sure when that day may come, though, as the SEC can delay its decisions and has two more proposed deadlines for each fund before being forced to make a final decision on the 240th-day post-filing.\n\nFor the awaiting applicants, the final deadlines for the SEC are all in mid-March next year.\n\n99.99999% of the world doesn't know that the SEC has to decide on 7 BTC ETFs within the next 3 days:\n\n\n\n-blackrock\n\n-bitwise\n\n-vaneck\n\n-wisdomtree\n\n-invesco\n\n-fidelity\n\n-valkyrie\n\n\n\nthe suits at our doorstep \u2014 odin free (@odin_free) August 29, 2023\n\nWhat are the SEC\u2019s options post-Grayscale decision?\n\nAfter the Aug. 29 ruling in favor of Grayscale, the regulator has 90 days to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court or apply for an en banc review \u2014 where a full circuit court can overturn a ruling made by a three-judge panel.\n\nHowever, the SEC hasn\u2019t made clear what its next move will be.\n\nIf the SEC doesn\u2019t appeal the court will need to specify how its ruling is executed which could include instructing the SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s application, or at the very least revisit it.\n\nRelated: BTC price jumps to 2-week highs on Grayscale vs. SEC Bitcoin ETF win\n\nEither way, Seyffart only saw two viable options for the regulator.\n\nThe first is for it to concede defeat and approve Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its GBTC to a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nAlternatively, the SEC would need to revoke the listing of Bitcoin futures ETFs entirely or deny Grayscale\u2019s application based on a new argument, said Seyffart.\n\nThe second potential avenue is to deny on reasons not used before/yet... which i have been saying for months could have to do with Custody or settlement of #Bitcoin which is not something that futures ETFs have to worry about. SEC has made a lot of noise around custodians \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 29, 2023\n\nHowever, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas considered the odds of the SEC revoking the Bitcoin futures ETFs as \u201chighly unlikely\u201d because of the SEC's reported openness to Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nLol, this guy turned the last paragraph of Judge Rao's legal smackdown today into an MGMT-esque sythe banger.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA major proposal to increase Bitcoin\u2019s functionality is making the rounds on Twitter\u2014and as is now par for the course, it's stirring controversy among developers.\n\n\u201cDrivechains\u201d\u2014proposed by Paul Sztorc as BIP 300 and BIP 301\u2014would create a native sidechain mechanism for Bitcoin, allowing BTC to be \u201ctrustlessly\u201d bridged to separate chains.\n\nThe sidechains are secured through blind merge mining, which allows Bitcoin\u2019s existing miners to effectively secure other blockchains without needing to run the sidechain\u2019s software. These networks could be built with whatever alternative functionality that developers want while inheriting both Bitcoin\u2019s security and native currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSidechains are a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 upgrade to Bitcoin,\u201d Sztorc told Decrypt via DM. \u201cWe get every single feature we could want, and\u2014even better\u2014the features are all opt-in.\u201d\n\nThat includes privacy, smart contracts, and additional tokens. Certain critics, however, don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cThe more I read about BIP300, the more it seems like a great way to introduce enormous amounts of grift, complexity, risk and shitcoinesque functionality into the Bitcoin codebase,\u201d tweeted the popular Bitcoiner hodlonaut on Sunday.\n\nLike many within the community, hodlonaut supports being \u201cextremely wary of change,\u201d and of the motives of anyone \u201cpoliticking to change Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin rough consensus is beautiful. Almost 15yrs in, and several soft forks along the way, and we **still do not know** the process for forming, agreeing to, and activating consensus changes. Feature, not a bug. Nobody is in control, and that is the whole point. \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ud83c\udf0b\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) August 28, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany others oppose drivechains as being a thinly-veiled excuse to introduce so-called \u201cshitcoins\u201d to Bitcoin because they\u2019re not entirely convinced it will deliver much utility. That includes avid Bitcoiner and \"Bitcoin Standerd\" author Saifedean Ammous, who now advises El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\n\nPeople only think tokens are a good idea because we live in a world of broken money. A good money is the only token anyone ever needs. Bitcoin is going to detokenize the world. https://t.co/q8Nhc7XcOX \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) August 28, 2023\n\nYet according to Sztorc, the opposite is true: BIP300 stands out from protocols like Taro, Ordinals, and Coloured Coins in that it does not require a new asset. Instead, they can be used for strictly BTC purposes, like more private and scalable transactions.\n\nIn a sense, it also keeps with the spirit of Bitcoin conservatism: Through one upgrade, drivechains could allow future development to take place on top of Bitcoin, no longer requiring changes to the base layer.\n\n\u201cIt is the same as the lightning network. If you don't run a drivechain node, then you won't even see it,\u201d said Sztorc.\n\nWhat the plebs don't seem to get (yet) is that drivechains enables all upgrades to Bitcoin, the ones we know about and the future ones that we didn't even think about yet. https://t.co/QoA80xsPKT \u2014 bitcoin-is-crypto (@dangershony) July 28, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect solution, however. Certain developers are critical of drivechains for technical reasons\u2014especially related to their peg-out mechanism.\n\nAs Sztorc explained, users must \u201ctrust 51% of the [Bitcoin] hashrate not to broadcast an erroneous hash for 6 months straight,\u201d in order to unlock drivechain features. \u201cIf that happens, the L2 coins are lost.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, this would make a hypothetical 51% attack against Bitcoin far more dire. Not only could miners conspire to reverse the blockchain, but they would actively have the power to steal users\u2019 coins.\n\n\u201cWith the current state of mining centralisation, IMO it would be pretty dumb to send any bitcoins to a drivechain,\u201d wrote Dashjr last week. \u201cThere are better ways to burn bitcoins or donate to miners.\u201d\n\nThat said, the developer said he remains \u201cneutral\u201d on drivechains as a concept, and that they should be available to those who want them if there\u2019s enough community support. Earlier this month, he submitted a rough draft proposal to Github on how to potentially implement sidechains.\n\nWhile acknowledging the risk, Sztorc considers this vector of attack \u201ceasier said than done,\u201d given that any nefarious miner behavior would be \u201chighly auditable,\u201d and would need to be maintained \u201cblock after block for 6 consecutive months.\u201d\n\nSztorc said miners should be incentivized to keep drivechains alive since they harvest them for fees. Theoretically, if this idea proves incorrect, then Bitcoin itself may also be doomed.\n\n\u201cSatoshi's design assumes that\u2014in the long run\u2014fees alone will be juicy enough to compel forward motion of a valuable blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cSo either the fees are an effective deterrent, or they're not.\u201d\n\nAtomic Finance CEO Tony Cai is also interested in how drivechains can foster Bitcoin-based innovation\u2013but has several security and economic concerns. For example, Miner Extractable Value (MEV) could quickly complicate Bitcoin\u2019s economics and incentives if miners feel prioritized to process drivechain transactions over on-chain ones.\n\n\u201cIf a drivechain were compromised, it might tarnish the overall trust in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d he added in a message to Decrypt. \u201cWe should probably tread carefully.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSztorc, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t worry too much about drivechains somehow corrupting \u201cminer incentives.\u201d As he pointed out, Bitcoin has already withstood numerous changes affecting its miner economy, including natural gas flaring, electricity repurchase agreements, Namecoin merge mining, and more.\n\n\u201cThe mining incentives are the same they've always been: follow the full node rules, hash as much as possible, maximize revenues, and minimize costs,\u201d he said.\n\nUltimately, Sztorc believes bringing new features to Bitcoin through drivechains may be the key to ensuring its victory over all other currencies. If not, the risk of an altcoin with better features and monetary properties eventually overtaking Bitcoin still looms large.\n\n\u201cWith Bip300 sidechains, even that remote possibility is eliminated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Bitcoin's victory (over Alts and Fiat) is nearly certain at that point.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note: This post was updated to correct a misspelling of Paul Sztorc's last name."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum records more long-term holders than Bitcoin, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nWhile there is a notable increase across the board, ETH outranks BTC when it comes to large holders.\n\nMetrics such as percentage coins in USD, time held, and number of addresses were considered.\n\nExperts attribute this margin to Ethereum\u2019s DeFi dominance as the network offers more functionality besides being a crypto, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has shown a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) price, tracing almost similar price actions with momentum indicators also aligning. A closer look, however, reveals that ETH has outranked BTC on several metrics, particularly where large holders or whales are concerned.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a commendable rise in long-term holders over the last year, with Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, Ethereum boasts a stark 73.5 million long-term holders (those who have held the cryptocurrency for more than one year) vs Bitcoin\u2019s 33.61 million.\n\nWhen it comes to whales, ETH boasts 5,370 addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. BTC, on the other hand, only has 1,920 addresses with between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\nETH assets by time held\n\nThe number of humpbacks (addresses holding more than 5000 ETH) is also very high: 106,000 Ethereum holders own between 10K-100K, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 103,670 holders.\n\n108 addresses hold more than 100,000 ETH versus only four holding as many BTC.\n\nETH Addresses by holdings\n\nIn addition, six wallets hold over a million Ether.\n\nBTC assets by time held\n\nThe percentage of Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings in USD also paints a similar picture in favor of ETH.\n\nBTCassets by holdings\n\nPossible reasons for Ethereum flippening Bitcoin\n\nExperts attribute the disparity, which favors Ethereum, to the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) space dominance. Specifically, the proof-of-stake (PoS) token has more functionality or use cases than Bitcoin, which is valued only as a digital currency.\n\nAmong the applications of the Ethereum network include:\n\nHosting other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nCreation and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nDevelopment of decentralized applications (DApps) in finance, web browsing, gaming, and advertising, among others.\n\nProviding access to financial services, including but not limited to crypto-lending, yield farming, and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nCreation and maintenance of digital identities for individuals, companies, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nThe share of ETH locked in the DeFi landscape is also vast, recording up to $22.31 billion, relative to Bitcoin\u2019s $162.6 million locked within the same domain. This explains why Ethereum has more long-term holders.\n\nBitcoin price is up approximately 31% year-to-date, while Ethereum price is up only 6.8% over the same timeframe. Needless to say, the variation shows that dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are not limited to valuation alone. Despite Bitcoin being the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has managed to attract more large holders."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBubble shooter (or popper) games have been a fan favorite dating back almost 30 years to Taito\u2019s Puzzle Bobble (aka Bust-a-Move), and the genre has corralled a new generation of casual fans on mobile. Now you can earn Bitcoin by playing them, too.\n\nA pair of games on iOS and Android\u2014Bitcoin Pop and Bitcoin Bay\u2014offer cryptocurrency rewards while playing, although beyond that shared premise they vary in design, amount of ads that pull you out of the game, how they each dole out Bitcoin rewards.\n\nAfter playing dozens of rounds of each game on iPhone, here\u2019s a look at how the games compare, and approximately how much Bitcoin you can potentially collect from each.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChill vibes in Bitcoin bubble shooters. Image: Decrypt\n\nBitcoin Pop\n\nHailing from Bling Financial, a company with numerous play-to-earn mobile games, Bitcoin Pop (iOS, Android) delivers a relatively straightforward rendition of the tried-and-true bubble shooter format. It tasks players with launching colorful bubbles onto the board above with an aim to match at least three of a kind, thus clearing them from view.\n\nOften, the goal to finish a level is to clear a certain number of special soda bubbles using a limited number of shots. Power-ups and other twists emerge along the way to shake things up, but otherwise this is a pretty standard riff on the genre.\n\nScreenshots from Bitcoin Pop. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt\u2019s loaded with lengthy, full-screen video ads, however, which pop up after nearly each level and take over your screen\u2014often for a minute or more. This means that you\u2019ll spend nearly as much time playing as watching ads, and you\u2019ll often see the same handful of commercials, including scammy-looking ones that promise to pay thousands of dollars for playing other mobile games.\n\nBitcoin Pop, however, can\u2019t make that kind of claim. After two hours of playing, I netted enough Bling points\u2014a little bit at a time after each level\u2014to convert to 233 satoshis, or 0.00000233 BTC. That\u2019s about $0.06 worth. You can convert your points into Bitcoin or Ethereum and send it to a Coinbase account, or otherwise cash out via U.S. dollars through PayPal.\n\nBitcoin Bay\n\nTHNDR Games, another company that specializes in play-to-earn Bitcoin mobile games, is the firm behind bubble popper Bitcoin Bay (iOS, Android). The premise is broadly the same as Bitcoin Pop, but Bitcoin Bay strikes a different tone and takes a distinctive approach to payouts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshots from Bitcoin Bay. Image: Decrypt\n\nBitcoin Bay\u2019s vibe is centered around a beach theme with a feline hero, as you connect bubbles containing things like crabs, starfish, and shells. The end result isn\u2019t terribly different from Bitcoin Pop, but there\u2019s a bit more depth to the game here, including a world map that lets you go back and replay levels plus skills that you can upgrade over time.\n\nThankfully, Bitcoin Bay isn\u2019t nearly as overloaded with ads as Bitcoin Pop\u2014the video ads only launch every so often, typically after playing a few levels, and generally they\u2019re not as long or obnoxious here. The downside, however, is that I earned far, far less Bitcoin while playing.\n\nUltimately, I netted only 26 satoshis across two hours of play\u2014that\u2019s less than $0.01 worth of Bitcoin. As with other THNDR games, you earn in-game tickets for completing levels, and those are put into an hourly raffle to claim a share of potentially thousands of satoshis. Earnings can be cashed out to the ZBD wallet or Cash App, for example, but you must withdraw any Bitcoin within a week of earning\u2014otherwise, you lose it.\n\nWhich should you play?\n\nI had a lot more fun with Bitcoin Bay, which has an appealing vibe and way fewer ads, but I earned almost 10 times as much Bitcoin playing Bitcoin Pop for the same amount of time. Bitcoin Bay\u2019s raffle model means that your mileage may vary, however. Had I hit the jackpot while playing, I would have netted significantly more satoshis than in Bitcoin Pop.\n\nBut ultimately, I only earned approximately $0.07 worth of Bitcoin between the two games across four total hours of play. Neither game is going to give you much cryptocurrency in exchange for playing and viewing ads.\n\nUnless you\u2019re dead set on stacking sats very, very gradually, you might have more fun playing one of the many bubble shooters on the iOS App Store or Android Play Store that isn\u2019t built around Bitcoin\u2014but might be more polished or robust, or lack so many intrusive interruptions."

This was because the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale and crushed the SEC\u2019s logic for denying an ETF.\n\nMost cryptocurrencies operated in the green at the time of writing, Bitcoin [BTC] included. At press time, the king of cryptocurrencies was exchanging hands at $27,655 and was trading 6.47% higher over the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, can BTC investors consider the price movement back on track for good?\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIt\u2019s all about the sentiment\n\nAs per an analysis posted by CryptoQuant analyst Onchained, BTC institutional investors, individual traders, and long-standing holders displayed resilience during the recent price pullback. Furthermore, the CrytpoQuant analyst also stated the recent price shift highlighted the unwavering confidence that holders have in BTC.\n\nThis was because more than 20,000 BTCs were transferred from exchanges to cold wallets. Additionally, this move indicated an inclination of holders to retain their assets for the long haul. The analyst also called this move an attempt by investors to shield their invested capital from the ongoing market instability.\n\nThis indicated that long-term holders were in it for the long run. However, retail investors too showed some interest. As of 29 August, BTC holders that held 0.1+ coins reached an all-time high of 12,286,836.\n\nAlthough this update wouldn\u2019t impact the price of the coin in a significant manner, it was a strong indication that retail investors were jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Addresses Holding 0.01+ Coins just reached an ATH of 12,286,836 Previous ATH of 12,286,555 was observed on 28 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/oyguxpaA2y pic.twitter.com/2xvwwdoDal \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 29, 2023\n\nWhere will BTC head from here?\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC was trading almost 6% higher than its opening price on 29 August. This was a good sign for holders in general considering BTC\u2019s recent price plummet below $26,000. Additionally, a massive development in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also seen in the price chart.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBTC\u2019s RSI moved from the oversold value of 26 on Monday 28 August to stand at 49.79 at the time of writing. The rise in RSI indicated a reviving buying pressure from traders and investors in the market. Furthermore, the Awesome Oscillator (AO), although below the zero line, flashed green at press time.\n\nHowever, a look at the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) didn\u2019t move as quickly as the RSI. Although the RSI took off in swing, the MACD only managed to just have a bullish crossover albeit below the zero line.\n\nWhile this was good news for holders at large, BTC investors may need to keep the buying pressure alive. Considering BTC\u2019s slow price drop and sudden price surge, investors may still need to watch out for signs of a reversal. Traders should thus, move forward with caution."
