        "content": "A Bitcoin ATM, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap that operates free of any central control and that relies on a peer-to-peer software and cryptography, on the BitBase stand during the Mobile World Congress 2023 on March 10, 2023, in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nSentiment has been high in crypto since late last week, when BlackRock , the largest asset manager in the world filed an application for what would be the first ever spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The application came a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued two of the biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Many have speculated about the timing of BlackRock's move, particularly with Coinbase as its crypto custody partner.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 5% to $28,002.18, its highest level since early May, according to Coin Metrics. Ether added 3.5% to trade at $1,782.99.\n\nThe price of bitcoin climbed on Monday as financial institutions continued to give their bitcoin blessing.\n\nThen Tuesday morning, a new crypto exchange backed by financial giants Charles Schwab, Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities announced that it has been live for several weeks trading bitcoin and ether.\n\nFidelity has been actively following along with crypto developments since 2014. In more recent years, the firm has opened the Fidelity Digital Assets division, created a commission-free retail investing app called Fidelity Crypto, and began offering 401(k) investors access to cryptocurrencies (an option that needs to be made available by employers).\n\nMany financial incumbents are keen to show enthusiasm for blockchain technology and the ways it can advance old financial infrastructure. Most are quieter, however, about their views on crypto investing.\n\nWith big names like BlackRock and Fidelity putting their crypto commitments on display, investors were optimistic Tuesday that some of the reputational risk of conducting any kind of crypto business \u2013 which for some investors has been a mental barrier to buying bitcoin \u2013 could start to fade.\n\nBitcoin has struggled to break out of a narrow trading range this quarter but has yet to fall meaningfully under $25,000. Tuesday's big move pushed its monthly gains into the green. It's now up 69% this year."

        "content": "Owners of datacenters and crypto mining operations are claiming that their businesses, far from being a drag on electric systems, can help integrate renewables and balance grids.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nWith its Renewable Bitcoin Quarq Spread Index, S&P Global Commodity Insights tracks the profitability of mining bitcoin, accounting for the costs of renewable certificates using Platts Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) and Platts Guarantee of Origin (GOs) data.\n\nWhile crypto mining is in the money in key markets, according to the index, during times of low crypto prices and high electricity prices, miners have profited from opting out of consumption from the grid, sometimes earning more than from the mining activities themselves.\n\nSome sector pioneers now point to crypto mining's ability to capture energy from renewables that otherwise would have been curtailed, improving project economics and enabling more development in low-price regions.\n\nPart of that trend is a pivot to smaller-scale behind-the-meter installations, according to the founders of a US mining startup.\n\n\"Our view is not that you should throw up a bunch of generation assets so that you can mine bitcoin,\" said Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization Inc., an energy services startup developing behind-the-meter computing solutions for renewables assets.\n\n\"When you really pencil out that math, it is very hard to make that work,\" Webber said. \"It cannot be the only thing that you are doing with that energy asset.\"\n\nInstead, Webber and business partner Alex Stoewer, COO of DPO, see co-located crypto mining behind the meter as an optimization tool that reduces curtailment or sales into a low power price environment, as well as an enabler for fresh renewables in regions where power is cheap.\n\nDPO has also been able to fund maintenance for an old hydroelectric plant in central Wisconsin after acquiring it and adding computing capacity on-site. Built in 1908, the 6.8-MW Hatfield Hydro Project would have otherwise eventually been decommissioned, Stoewer said.\n\nMining 'seizes valuable resources'\n\nSimilar concepts could work in unlocking more development in regions in Africa that anticipate population growth, the startup founders say. Meanwhile, Europe \"has better uses for [its] power,\" Stoewer said.\n\nIndeed, the energy crisis only reinforced European lawmakers' attention on energy efficiency and potential drains on supply, and regulatory winds have been changing for bitcoin miners as a result.\n\nOne of Europe's more active mining markets is Norway, which offers affordable and clean power due to large hydroelectric and wind reserves. About 250 MW of capacity is estimated to be powering mining in the country, mostly in the northernmost price zones where electricity remains comparatively affordable.\n\n\"We see the energy situation as demanding and that crypto mining is seizing valuable power resources,\" Norway's state secretary, Elisabeth S\u00e6ther of the Labour Party, told S&P Global.\n\nWhile grid operators are obligated to connect new power end-users to the grid -- as well as to award increased capacity to existing end-users -- on a nondiscriminatory basis, queues for grid connection have lengthened in Norway due to rising demand from various sectors, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nTo tackle that, the government laid out an action plan in the spring that proposed introducing new prioritization criteria for grid connections based on the maturity of projects that request grid connections.\n\nThe criteria include financing and plans for load usage, and the minister stressed that the filter will not discriminate against any particular sector.\n\nHowever, in an upcoming revision of the Norwegian Act on Electronic Communications, the government is expected to propose new obligations for all datacenter operators, including crypto miners. The bill is set for a vote in mid-June.\n\nThe government is also revising its national Data Center Strategy, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nNeighbor Sweden, also a hub for mining in Europe, has also indicated it was prioritizing resources for other ventures such as hydrogen-based steel or chemicals production.\n\nBitcoin passes baton to AI\n\nWhile major crypto miners may be relegated to the back of the queue, Sweden remains a hub for flexible datacenters joined with renewables projects, Hungarian startup founder Daniel Jogg said.\n\nHis flexible datacenter startup, Enerhash Technologies, has developed projects across Europe and beyond, advising asset owners like E.ON subsidiary E.ON Hungaria or Sweden's Vattenfall on leveraging flexible datacenters for balancing volatility.\n\nEurope has not experienced negative wholesale power prices for the past few years, but with an increase in solar installed capacity and weaker demand, negative power prices have re-emerged -- a trend datacenter developers say bolsters their business case.\n\nWhen two reactors at the Forsmarks karnkraftverk nuclear plant in Sweden went down in April, Jogg said 200 MW of flexible computing was able to ramp down as a high-frequency demand-response mechanism to balance the grid.\n\nEnerhash also works with oil and gas field owners in the Middle East who are looking for better uses for flared gas by powering data centers, as well as US oil and gas developer Allied Energy Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, datacenter demand is set to triple in the next decade thanks to AI computing power, making datacenters a promising part of the flexibility puzzle, Jogg said.\n\nThe energy companies Jogg works with are rarely interested in mining bitcoin for profit, he said. \"They are solving their problems. They are entering this business because they have the best synergies with datacenters. 95% of the time, they say, 'Do what you want with the bitcoin stuff, we need the datacenter'.\"\n\nStigmatized cryptocurrencies\n\nIntegrated behind-the meter applications do not face the long grid connection queues that standalone miners would, DPO's Webber said.\n\nDozens of utilities and independent power producers in the US are keen to invest in such capabilities, Webber said, but refrain from disclosing early pilots and investments because of the \"stigma\" attached to cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"It is an interesting proposition, but it is just such a risky market,\" said Jonathan Schroth, a research analyst on the datacenter infrastructure and services team for 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPart of the challenge is the price of devices used to mine bitcoin via proof-of-work technology, which cost between $13,000 and $15,000 per unit, Schroth said. A pivot away from proof-of-work mining is possible, but Schroth said it bears a risk of stranded assets.\n\nInvestors who are uncomfortable with cryptocurrencies are eyeing other segments such as AI computing, which also requires large amounts of electricity, Webber said."

        "content": "Institutional-scale bitcoin investment in America \u2014 the dream of many early digital gold asset backers \u2014 is becoming a distinct possibility.\n\nBut for some, an institutional move into bitcoin is nothing more than a dystopian nightmare, where a noble battle against the corruption of the fiat monetary system ends with the rich, once again, getting richer.\n\nThe application for an ETF by the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, could not have happened at a stranger time in cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory history.\n\nJust as the SEC is hunting down Coinbase for allegedly flouting securities laws, BlackRock is requesting the SEC\u2019s approval for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 with Coinbase as its custodial partner.\n\nIt should be no surprise that BlackRock would choose to work with Coinbase for its ETF, as they have long been strategic partners. Still, the entry of old-world wealth into the bitcoin realm is raising red flags in the community.\n\nOn a recent On the Margin podcast (Spotify/Apple), Mark Yusko expresses some of the fears of handing over the keys \u2014 both figuratively and cryptographically \u2014 to the institutions.\n\nBitcoin community seems unenthused\n\nWhile the notion of large-scale, heavily regulated investment entering bitcoin appears on the surface to be highly bullish for the industry, not everyone is enthused. Concerns about some sort of hostile takeover are swirling in the community.\n\nThe founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management says Xapo, the institutional-scale crypto custody tool that Coinbase acquired in 2019, could come into regulatory play.\n\n\u201cWhat if,\u201d he asks, BlackRock can \u201ctake over this storage unit?\u201d\n\nBlackRock would then hold a significant portion of crypto assets in America, he says. \u201cAnd if they have the bulk of it,\u201d regulators could then shut down the Coinbase exchange as an SEC-alleged \u201cunlicensed casino\u201d and hand the Xapo unit over to BlackRock.\n\nHost Ippolito adds that the response from the Bitcoin community has been \u201cpretty roundly negative\u201d regarding the ETF application.\n\n\u201cIn the filing, there\u2019s a little paragraph about what BlackRock would do in the event of a hard fork,\u201d Ippolito says. \u201cBlackRock is going to have to make a decision.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cIn the event of a hard fork,\u201d Ippolito explains, \u201cthere will be two different copies of Bitcoin.\u201d As has happened in previous forks, one of the two will be selected as the canonical chain.\n\n\u201cAnd BlackRock\u2019s gonna have to make a decision about that.\u201d\n\nFears swirl around the possibilities of BlackRock closing off access to what some would perceive as the preferred fork, but Ippolito is concerned with \u201cthe Bitcoin community\u2019s pushback.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me think that they don\u2019t really understand social consensus,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want Bitcoin to keep going up and be widely adopted you need larger and larger buyers.\u201d\n\nYusko responds to the community\u2019s backlash against undesirable money entering the scene, \u201cYou want any and all fiat of any kind in any variety to convert to bitcoin because the bigger the network, the bigger the safety, security, the more adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way the value of a network goes up.\u201d\n\nShort the future, long the physical\n\nHaving said that, Yusko admits it\u2019s \u201chypothetically possible that since November of last year, when the futures-based ETF was issued,\u201d that large institutions like JPMorgan and Blackrock have been \u201cshorting the shit out of bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s highly likely,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have proof in the gold market that they do. Every year, they make billions of dollars shorting the future and going long the physical.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan can pay a billion dollar fine for market manipulation, Yusko says, but make $20 billion in the process. \u201cSo that\u2019s 5%. Who cares? It\u2019s the cost of doing business.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not all dark clouds for Yusko. He sees the BlackRock filing as a potential turning point in the market from bearish to bullish. \u201cWe said on this show that crypto summer would start on June 15.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd BlackRock files the papers on June 15. That is just dumb luck. And it\u2019s possible we made the bottom.\u201d\n\nYusko remains confident in bitcoin\u2019s future, although he expects things to be messy for a while.\n\n\u201cJPMorgan, BlackRock and all of the controllers of the money and power felt threatened \u2014 as they should have \u2014 by a disruptive innovation that will replace them. The infrastructure of trust will be replaced by the infrastructure of truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut man, the war is gonna be bloody.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

By positioning itself as a \"non-custodial\" exchange, EDX aims to cater to the needs of major financial institutions seeking crypto exposure but harboring reservations about centralized crypto service providers.\n\nA non-custodial platform means it doesn't hold its customers' crypto-tokens and instead, it ensures that customer assets will be held at third-party banks that act as a crypto custodian, removing concerns regarding potential fund misappropriation.\n\nFor example, Coinbase acts as a custodian for their customer's crypto, unless they opt for a self-custody Coinbase wallet. While it's simple to start trading crypto with an exchange that holds your tokens, risks include losing your assets in case the exchange is hacked or lower profits due to custodial fees.\n\nThe exchange operates as a platform connecting a network of firms for executing and settling trades between crypto assets and fiat currencies. However, it does not help settle those trades just yet. EDX hopes to launch a clearinghouse business later this year, that will enable it to carry out settlements.\n\nThe launch of the exchange comes shortly after BlackRock's filing for the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, indicating sustained institutional interest in the long-term crypto market despite recent industry setbacks and regulatory concerns.\n\nEDX has also closed a second funding round, attracting new investors such as Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR, and Hudson River Trading.\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin now represents more than half of the crypto market for the first time since April 2021, suggesting the most valuable cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a pre-halving bull market.\n\nAccording to TradingView, Bitcoin accounts for 50.06% of the combined market cap from the top 125 digital assets, evidence of BTC\u2019s resilience amid the recent altcoin rout.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Rises To Highest Level In Over Two Years\n\nBitcoin\u2019s share of the market crashed from nearly 70% at the start of 2021 and has since oscillated between 40% and 48%.\n\nBitcoin Halving Approaches\n\nBitcoin\u2019s relative outperformance comes as its next halving looms in ten months\u2019 time. The rate of new BTC issued to Proof of Work miners is cut in half every four years, with the event historically foreshadowing new all-time highs for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe Bitcoin network currently issues 6.25 BTC per block or roughly 900 BTC daily. After the next halving, predicted to take place in late April 2024, 3.125 new Bitcoin will enter circulation with each block.\n\nBTC is the 20th-best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 digital assets by market cap over the past seven days, with a 2.7% gain. Only 29 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies gained more than 1% in a choppy week for markets.\n\nBTC is up 68% since the start of the year, according to The Defiant Terminal.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Rises To Highest Level In Over Two Years\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action also follows BlackRock's filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a surge in on-chain activity surrounding digital tokens, and heavy accumulation from whales.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $8.6T in assets, filed for a Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 15. Coinbase, the top U.S.-based centralized exchange, would provide Bitcoin custody and price data services for the ETF, while BNY Mellon will be its cash custodian.\n\nShares in a Bitcoin ETF would be traded on a traditional exchange, offering retail investors exposure to BTC through a regulated platform. However, the SEC is yet to approve a Bitcoin ETF despite receiving numerous previous applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin Activity Trends Higher\n\nIn April, the number of daily transactions processed by the Bitcoin network surged to all-time highs above 350,000 amid a spike of activity driven by interest in digital tokens.\n\nOrdinals, an inscription method used to create assets resembling NFTs, launched in January, followed in March by the BRC-20 token standard, which drew inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens, giving rise to new use cases for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOn-chain activity peaked at more than 682,000 transactions per day in May and has since cooled off to 415,000 per day.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Rises To Highest Level In Over Two Years\n\nWhale Accumulation\n\nAccording to Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC added 131,600 Bitcoin worth $3.5B since April 4. The sum of BTC held by these whales is now at a seven-month high.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Rises To Highest Level In Over Two Years\n\nETH Posts Modest Inflationary Week\n\nETH posted a modest gain of 2.3% in the past seven daysafter dipping down to $1,630 on Friday. The price of ETH is up 44% since January.\n\nOn-chain activity remains low on Ethereum after the recent wave of memecoin trading appears to have subsided. NFT activity on Ethereum has also fallen 80% since March.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn rate fell just shy of offsetting new supply issuance over the past seven days, with 23 Ether added to ETH\u2019s circulating supply, according to Ultra Sound Money. Ethereum\u2019s supply is down 281,909 Ether ($487M) since The Merge went live 10 months ago."

Since then, it has reached -50%.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcement of a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing by BlackRock appeared to induce a change of mood, and as of June 17, the premium had decreased to -36.6%.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the changes came despite arguments over the true status of BlackRock\u2019s offering, with some claiming that it would not be a spot ETF, which remain banned in the United States.\n\nGBTC premium vs. asset holdings vs. BTC/USD chart (screenshot).

        "content": "A crypto exchange backed by financial giants Charles Schwab , Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities has officially launched trading in four crypto assets, the company said Tuesday.\n\nEDX Markets first announced its launch plans for a \"non-custodial\" exchange in September, about two months before the collapse of FTX. Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Virtu Financial are among the other early backers.\n\nThe announcement comes days after BlackRock filed an application to launch what would be the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., confirmation that despite the crypto industry's black eye from FTX and other bad actors in 2022, and the chill from U.S. regulators this year, long-term institutional interest has not diminished.\n\nThe EDX exchange allows trading of bitcoin , ether , litecoin and bitcoin cash , none of which were named \"crypto asset securities\" in the lawsuits the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought against Binance and Coinbase two weeks ago.\n\nEDX has said it strives to \"meet the needs of the world's largest and most sophisticated financial institutions,\" many of which remain crypto curious but skeptical of centralized crypto services providers, if not because of the failures of many in 2022, then because of the regulatory uncertainty the remaining players now find themselves in.\n\nTo quell any fears about misuse of funds, EDX plans to operate as a \"non-custodial\" exchange, meaning that rather than handling customer assets directly, it will act as a platform on which a network of firms can execute and settle trades between crypto assets and fiat currencies.\n\nEDX also has plans to launch a clearinghouse business this year to facilitate the settlement process but will keep customer assets held at third-party banks and a crypto custodian.\n\nThe company also announced it has closed a second funding round with new investors, including the options-exchange operator Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR and Hudson River Trading."

        "content": "One day after BlackRock made a splash last week by putting forward a plan to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, crypto-focused asset manager Bitwise re-upped its own similar bid.\n\nThe filings are the latest of their kind in a decade-long saga as the SEC has never allowed a spot bitcoin ETF to hit the US market \u2014 despite efforts from the Winklevoss twins, Fidelity and a slew of other would-be issuers.\n\nBut the latest proposed products by BlackRock and Bitwise are a bit different from one another.\n\nBitwise filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in October 2021 \u2014 a proposal ultimately rejected by the SEC in June 2022.\n\nThe Friday filing by NYSE Arca \u2014 the would-be listing exchange for the Bitwise product \u2014 added more legal analysis around the surveillance of bitcoin via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures markets, according to Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the filing seems likely to jump in the queue behind BlackRock should the SEC approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF,\u201d Armour told Blockworks.\n\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told Blockworks in April that while a spot bitcoin ETF would be \u201cwonderful\u201d for investors in the long term, the firm would likely wait for more regulatory clarity before pursuing another.\n\nA Bitwise spokesperson on Tuesday confirmed the firm\u2019s bid but declined to comment.\n\nSumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, said Bitwise\u2019s move is \u201cpretty clearly a direct response to the BlackRock filing.\u201d\n\nBlackRock takes new step\n\n\u201cBitwise has emphasized in the past the idea that prices for bitcoin futures on the CME lead spot bitcoin prices, and therefore, having a surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME should satisfy the SEC\u2019s requirements,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt did so again in this filing but with even more data to back up its case.\u201d\n\nBoth the Nasdaq and NYSE filings \u2014 related to the BlackRock and Bitwise proposals, respectively \u2014 cite the SEC\u2019s approval of a bitcoin futures fund by firm Teucrium.\n\nThat ruling noted that the CME \u201ccomprehensively surveils futures market conditions and price movements on a real time and ongoing basis in order to detect and prevent price distortions, including price distortions caused by manipulative efforts.\u201d\n\nRead more: SEC ruling on Teucrium\u2019s bitcoin futures ETF could impact spot funds\n\nIn BlackRock\u2019s case, the listing exchange is willing to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for bitcoin,\u201d the document states.\n\nThis would supplement its surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME.\n\n\u201cIs that enough to get this ETF over the finish line?\u201d Roy said. \u201cOrdinarily, I would argue no, especially since the spot trading platform in question \u2014 if it\u2019s Coinbase \u2014 is being sued by the SEC for operating as an unregistered exchange.\n\n\u201cBut because BlackRock is involved, there is hope that they have the inside scoop and will get this done,\u201d he said. \u201cThrow in the impending Grayscale verdict and things are getting pretty complicated.\u201d\n\nA decision in Grayscale Investments\u2019 case against the SEC \u2014 launched after the regulator blocked the company\u2019s proposed conversion of its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to an ETF \u2014 is expected in the coming months.\n\nRead more: Grayscale win over SEC might not change much, industry watchers say\n\nIn the wake of the BlackRock and Bitwise filings, GBTC is up 30% in the last five days, and up roughly 14% on the day.\n\nIndustry watchers say they expect more to re-join the spot bitcoin ETF race. Though eyes have been on Fidelity \u2014 another TradFi giant that previously sought to launch a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 the fund titan has not yet re-filed for such a fund.\n\nA Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares re-filed for their spot bitcoin ETF in April. Other hopeful issuers such as VanEck, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, Global X and Invesco could do the same, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts said last week.\n\n\u201cThere tend to be clusters of filings as issuers take a new approach or see increasing odds of acceptance by the SEC,\u201d Armour said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be among the initial ETFs on the market, so I would be surprised if more didn\u2019t follow suit.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Read preview\n\nRomanian prosecutors asked to seize 15 properties, 15 luxury cars, 14 watches and bitcoin worth $560,000 from Andrew Tate as part of indictment on rape and trafficking charges.\n\nRomania's Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism announced Tuesday that Tate had been charged with rape and human trafficking, per a press release.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe announcement moved forward the case which burst into view in late last year with Tate's arrest. The requested asset seizures are a window into the wealth amassed by Tate, which is a key part of his online person and has loomed large in the criminal case against him.\n\nTate, a social media influencer best known for his misogynistic messaging, was arrested in December and placed in a Romanian jail while officials investigated human-trafficking and sexual assault allegations against him. He has been under house arrest since March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe indictment includes Tate, his brother Tristan Tate, and two associates, all of whom face the same charges. The indictment also names seven victims who were recruited through the \"loverboy method,\" the BBC reported \u2014 the method of using promises of love and marriage to manipulate women into sex work. All four maintain their innocence.\n\nReports of charges against the group describe a bleak world in which women made pornography for Tate under duress, with Tate's associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, threatening to beat the women if they did not comply. Per Reuters, a 61-page court file said Naghel and Radu took half the money the women made via OnlyFans accounts, and also fined the women if they were late or sniffled on camera.\n\nThe file, made by Romanian prosecutors, also allege these women were transformed \"into slaves,\" and one was raped by Tate twice.\n\nTate's assets that DIICOT has asked to seize includes just over 21 bitcoin, a DIICOT spokesperson confirmed to Insider. That amount of bitcoin is worth around $560,000 as of June 20. The assets could be used to compensate victims if he's convicted, Romanian authorities previously told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome auto-translate software, including Google Translate, erroneously suggested that a much larger amount of Bitcoin worth $384 million had been seized, due to an error in interpreting the original Romanian.\n\nTate's wealth has been part of the investigation since the beginning. He was denied bail by a judge several times between January and March, because he was deemed a flight risk.\n\nThe judge in the case explained his decision to force the Tates to stay in jail, arguing that their wealth meant it was possible they would try and escape.\n\n\"The possibility that the suspects would evade investigation, leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition given their financial possibilities and public comments to that regard cannot be ignored,\" the judge said, according to Euro News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTate's boasting about his money are just some of the public statements he's made that could work against him in court. Over the years he has willingly described his tactics recruiting women, came close to endorsing rape, and said he moved to Romania because \"corruption is far more accessible.\"\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Tate continued communicating with his fans \u2014 most of whom are young boys and men \u2014 through his newsletter, complaining of poor conditions, including lice and cockroaches in his cell.\n\nThe BBC reported that the trial is expected to last several years, and a Romanian judge has 60 days to view all the evidence before then.\n\nTate's spokesperson told the BBC: \"We embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence.\""

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $5 Million? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It may sound strange or even silly to ask this now, in the midst of a long and painful crypto winter, but it's still a fair question.\n\nCan Bitcoin ever reach the incredible price of $5 million per coin?\n\nThis is, of course, a question with a long and complex answer. Read on to see my detailed analysis. But the short answer is pretty simple: \"Maybe, but not anytime soon.\"\n\nWhat will it take to raise Bitcoin's price that high?\n\nRight now, Bitcoin prices are hovering around the $27,000 mark. The $5 million price target stands more than 18,000% away.\n\nThat's a long way off.\n\nMoreover, there are about 19.4 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation so far, out of a possible maximum of 21 million. If you multiply $5 million by 19.4 million, you get $97 trillion. By comparison, all the gold in the world is currently worth about $10 trillion. The U.S. gross domestic product reached a record high of $25 trillion last year, as part of a $104 trillion global economy.\n\nThe value of all cash and consumer-grade cash equivalents such as checking and savings accounts adds up to roughly $83 trillion . The only monetary figure that makes $100 trillion look small is the $300 trillion of global debt, including every country's national debt.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin would need to become the de facto currency of record for a dominant chunk of the global economy. I'm talking about an economic revolution on a worldwide scale, probably involving political unrest and maybe even wars along the way.\n\nWhat stands in the way?\n\nExisting economic forces are putting up an active fight against Bitcoin and other crypto names. Nobody steals this massive lunch on a whim.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with that resistance. Central banks and regulators are responsible for the financial health of every citizen, corporation, and government agency. It makes sense to defend the status quo, even if cryptocurrencies might offer real advantages over gold-based or fiat currencies. At the very least, these economic gatekeepers must manage the transition from one monetary system to another in an orderly fashion. A crypto revolution that triggers economic crises around the world is not a pleasant idea, even for the most bullish cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nOn a more practical level, there is no simple way to drop in Bitcoin as the replacement for every currency on the planet. Keep in mind that not even the most influential currencies, like the dollar or the euro, are legal tender in more than a handful of countries today. Standardizing everyone on a single monetary platform looks impossible.\n\nAnd Bitcoin's blockchain network is not set up to handle a worldwide system of payments and financial transactions. Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network can increase transaction processing speed to some degree, and the actual Bitcoin platform is always under active development, but the currency can only handle approximately seven transactions per second right now. That's nowhere near enough to support a worldwide economy with billions of Bitcoin users.\n\nHow long could it take to get there?\n\nSo there is no quick and easy way from $27,000 to $5 million per Bitcoin, but there may be some tricky backroads into that territory.\n\nThe oldest and largest cryptocurrency has gained 29% against the inflation-stricken U.S. dollar over the last year. It rose 180% in three years and has quadrupled since June 2018. Drop back to the summer of 2015, and the gain balloons to 10,500%.\n\nIf Bitcoin maintains its compound average growth rate (CAGR) from the last eight years, it could reach $5 million per coin in another nine years. That's a highly unlikely scenario, though. It is much easier to score enormous annual gains when you're starting from a smaller financial platform and a lower price, like the $248 price tag and $3.5 billion market cap Bitcoin sported in June 2015.\n\nLet's say the CAGR slows down to a (still fairly improbable) 35% instead. At that speed, it would take roughly 18 years to hit $5 million. And if I may remind you, the end of that rainbow is Bitcoin as the only currency on Earth that matters in any practical sense.\n\nThe calculation changes a little bit if you also account for inflation. Bitcoin is largely immune to that effect due to its lifetime cap of 21 million coins, only leaving room for an 8% increase in the token count over the next hundred years or so.\n\nThe dollar is not immune to inflation. Monetary policymakers generally aim for an annual inflation rate of roughly 2%, with the occasional dip or spike. Eighteen years from now, that effect would boost the effective dollar value of Bitcoin by approximately 40%. So if you're looking for a cash value of $5 million in 2041, that amounts to a $3.5 million price tag in 2023 dollars. In other words, Bitcoin could take over just half of the global money supply and reach $5 million per coin -- as long as we are looking at inflation-adjusted dollar values.\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin could also hit that $5 million mark quickly if America experiences actual hyperinflation in the next decade or two. Fairly recent examples of hyperinflation include Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Zimbabwe in 2016, and the current crisis in Venezuela. Mirroring any of these examples would be enough to make Bitcoin worth $5 million or more -- but you'd also spend millions of hyperinflated dollars on everyday necessities like bread and eggs. Yes, Bitcoin's immunity to inflation is a major selling point for the cryptocurrency, but nobody wants or expects this ultragloomy future. In reality, this is not happening.\n\nBitcoin can go up, but $5 million is an unreasonable goal\n\nSo Bitcoin could perhaps be worth $5 billion per coin, but only if you are ready to wait two decades for an unrealistically optimistic scenario to play out, or adjusting a still-lengthy return period for dollar-based inflation. You're better off setting lower price targets and more modest expectations for Bitcoin, even in the long run.\n\nTo be clear, I expect Bitcoin to gain value over time, serving as a solid hedge against inflation. Just keep an eye out for signs of wider Bitcoin adoption, clearer cryptocurrency regulation, and technical upgrades to the underlying blockchain system. We Fools will keep you posted."

        "title": "Bitcoin gains ground, Ether rises, Solana leads winners, BNB little-changed to lower - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Tuesday morning trading in Asia to hold above support at US$26,000. Ether also logged gains along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Binance\u2019s BNB token was little changed to lower on signs the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange may be winding down its expansion in Europe amid widespread regulatory woes. Equity futures in the U.S. edged lower after the long weekend break, recent mixed signals on the state of inflation, and speculation about more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.41% over the last 24 hours to US$26,765 at 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 3.21% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a weekly high of US$26,984 early Tuesday to test resistance at US$27,000.\n\nEther gained 0.86% to US$1,734, but has flatlined over the past seven days to log a weekly loss of 0.48%. Solana led the winners in the top 10, rising 3.76% to US$15.95 and up 4.95% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens moved higher in early morning trade. However, Binance\u2019s BNB posted a dip of 0.25% to US$242.87, though the token is still holding onto a weekly gain of 5.38%. The Binance exchange seems to be reining in its global expansion plans amid growing regulation challenges.\n\nBinance Markets Ltd, the U.K. subsidiary of Binance, can no longer \u201cprovide regulated activities and products\u201d for non crypto-related activities in the country, according to a Monday posting on the website of the country\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). According to reports, Binance had permission to provide such services in the U.K. but had requested to the FCA it be withdrawn as they were unlikely to be used.\n\nApart from the ongoing lawsuit with U.S. regulators, Binance is also facing challenges in Europe. The company on Friday said it will withdraw from the Netherlands after being unable to secure a virtual asset service provider registration in the country. The crypto exchange is also reportedly under an anti-money laundering probe in France.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$5.1 million last week, according to data tracked by Europe-based cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares on Monday. The data marks the ninth consecutive week of outflows, while the number is smaller than US$88 million in the previous week after the world\u2019s biggest asset manager BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201c(BlackRock\u2019s) move also conveys a compelling message to the SEC, implying a firm stand on the importance and role of cryptocurrencies in future financial innovation in the U.S,\u201d Rachel Lin, the co-founder and chief executive officer of crypto derivatives exchange SynFutures, said in an emailed comment.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF efforts could be a sign of a major crypto trader migration, according to Markus Thielen, Head of Crypto Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cThere are now 420 million cryptocurrency holders; migrating them to regulated entities might be the most significant task in 2023 mainly because fighting those crypto companies with deep pockets is also very time-consuming for regulators,\u201d said Thielen in an emailed comment. \u201cRipple Labs has spent $200m on its lawsuit with the SEC, while Coinbase, especially Binance, could spend billions. So why not approve the Blackrock ETF and let nature play is part?\u201d\n\nCoinShares indicated the slump in prices of many tokens had brought in some bargain-hunting. \u201cThe prior week crash in altcoin prices prompted investors to add to positions (in altcoin-linked investment products),\u201d wrote CoinShares in its Monday report, \u201cwith XRP, Cardano and Polygon being the focus.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 0.86% to US$1.07 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 35.69% to US$26.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT transactions rise\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.17% to 2,868.69 in the 24 hours to 09:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 3.36% for the seven days.\n\nNFT transactions on Ethereum rose 6.74% in the past 24 hours to US$13.16 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain surged 135.38% to US$3.43 million, while the Polygon and Cardano networks also logged two-digit gains in NFT transactions.\n\n\u201cForkast 500 NFT Index along with Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano are all close to even, which may be a sign that the market has finished reacting to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cSneakerhunt\u201d, a teased collaboration between Nike\u2019s NFT platform .SWOOSH and online video game Fortnite is set to be unveiled on Tuesday, which might bring more public exposure to NFTs.\n\n\u201cThis may be a huge week for NFTs after Nike\u2019s tease about an incoming in-game sneaker event in Fortnite,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cMany speculate that it\u2019s Nike\u2019s .SWOOSH shoes that may be the prize at the end of the hunt, titled Airphoria. With Fornite\u2019s 242+ million strong userbase, this could end up being another mass onboarding event for NFTs.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, CryptoPunk #8611 of the Ethereum-based CryptoPunk NFT collection was sold for around US$95,000 on Saturday and immediately burned and \u201crevived\u201d as an Ordinal inscription on the Bitcoin network, with the process directed by NFT enthusiast NatanStein.\n\n\u201c(The action) may be a vote of confidence in the value of assets existing on Bitcoin, but this asset now loses any potential benefits it would have received from Yuga Labs if they were to incorporate it in their Otherside Universe,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cYuga Labs famously had thousands of $APE Coin claimable for each BAYC NFT, along with land in their Otherside game, and some have speculated that CryptoPunks may one day see their own rewards.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures lower\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11.00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.37%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures both lost 0.22%.\n\nAll the three major U.S. stock indexes logged gains last week as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the June 14 meeting, but this was tempered by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, noting \u201cnearly all Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe Fed projects the interest rate to reach 5.6% in 2023, indicating two more rate hikes within the year. New York Fed President John Williams will be speaking on Tuesday in the U.S. and may make further comments on the Fed\u2019s fight with inflation.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. housing market index, a measurement of homebuilder sentiment, reached an 11-month high of 55 in June to beat analysts\u2019 expectations, according to Bloomberg on Monday. Readings above 50 indicate more housebuilders see the market condition good than bad.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 25.6% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 74.4% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 71.9% on Monday.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank lowered its one-year and five-year loan prime rates to 3.55% and 4.2% on Tuesday as economists expected, as the country seeks to boost its slow post-Covid recovery, according to the Financial Times on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faces up to one-and-a-half years of \u201cboredom\u201d as the bull market gathers steam, a new prediction says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode predicted an \u201carduous\u201d period for BTC hodlers next.\n\nGlassnode: Bitcoin hodlers set for 12 months\u2019 \u201cgradual accumulation\u201d\n\nAfter gaining 70% in the first quarter of 2023, but struggling to hold its ground recently, Bitcoin is dividing opinions when it comes to future price action.\n\nWith the 2024 block subsidy halving in sight, some believe a dramatic uptick will characterize the coming year, while others think it will take longer \u2014 perhaps until 2025 \u2014 for a new all-time high to hit.\n\nFor Glassnode, there are signs that a classic pre-bull market phase is playing out, but long-term holders will still need considerable patience.\n\nInvestigating the \u201cliveliness\u201d of the BTC supply, which it describes as \u201cthe propensity of Bitcoin holders to spend or hold their coins,\u201d researchers revealed mass accumulation.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Liveliness is in a multi-year macro downtrend, having peaked in May 2021 when bear market first set in. We can see a similar structure has formed to the 2018-20 cycle, as coins slowly but surely migrate into cold storage and are removed from the market by the HODLer cohort,\u201d it explained.\n\n\u201cThese HODLers are currently accumulating coins at a rate of around 42.2K BTC/month, suggesting that the price insensitive class are absorbing a non-trivial portion of the currently available supply. If we compare this behavior to prior cycles, we can see that this regime of steady and gradual accumulation commenced just over 2-years ago, and suggests that another 6 to 12-months may be ahead of us.\u201d\n\nBitcoin hodler net position change annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode added that decreasing exchange balances indicate the supply is becoming increasingly illiquid, that is, out of reach in private cold storage and not for sale.\n\nBitcoin wealth transfer \u201cuninterrupted\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the more speculative end of the hodler base \u2014 so-called short-term holders \u2014 is also in focus currently.\n\nRelated: Most \u2018fear\u2019 in 3 months as $26.4K becomes key \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nThese investors have hodled coins for a maximum of 155 days, and their aggregate cost basis, which sits at around $26,400, is on the radar as a short-timeframe support zone.\n\nContinuing, Glassnode noted that based on wallet entity size, not everyone is in accumulation mode, with whales \u2014 the largest-volume cohorts \u2014 currently \u201cnet distributors.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, the market appears to be in a period of quiet accumulation, which suggests an undercurrent of demand, despite the regulatory headwinds of late,\u201d it stated, referring to the recent United States regulatory pressures impacting major exchanges.\n\nBitcoin supply absorption rates chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nFor a seismic trend shift to occur, researchers believe it will take another halving to come and go.\n\n\u201cAcross most measures of market energy, digital asset markets are displaying excitement in few of them. Volatility, volumes, and realized value are all at multi-year lows, as liquidity and excitement give way to investor apathy,\u201d they concluded.\n\n\u201cHowever beneath the surface, the classic pattern of wealth transfer towards the price insensitive HODLer cohort remains uninterrupted. If past cycles are any guide, it it suggests that a period of apathetic sideways boredom may well define the road ahead, potentially lasting between 8 to 18-months in duration.\u201d\n\nBitcoin pre-halving price performance comparison (screenshot).

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, CleanSpark, and Hive Blockchain Technologies Rose Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies and crypto mining companies moved higher today due to developments on the regulatory front and as mainstream financial companies continued to show support for digital assets.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), traded roughly 4.8% higher as of 4:20 p.m. ET today.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of the Bitcoin-mining companies CleanSpark (CLSK 3.76%) and Hive Blockchain Technologies (HIVE -0.32%) rose 12.1% and 11.2%, respectively, today.\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin specifically seems to be benefiting as its market share increases. As of Tuesday, Bitcoin's market cap as a percentage of the market cap of all cryptocurrencies grew to 48.5% and briefly surpassed 50%, according to CoinMarketCap. That's the highest amount Bitcoin has consumed since May 2021.\n\n\"The Bitcoin dominance grows when investors do not feel confident about the short-term market trend and adjust their position toward a less speculative portfolio, increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, which is commonly known to be the less volatile digital asset,\" Fineqia International analyst Matteo Greco said, according to Barron's.\n\nOn the regulatory front, lawmakers in the United Kingdom have passed a bill that would further clarify how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the country, something that many proponents believe is needed to allow the industry to move forward.\n\nYesterday, Parliament's upper chamber approved the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB), which would regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, digital assets pegged to a commodity or currency, under Britain's payments laws, paving the way for regulators to potentially implement laws they have been considering. Now, the FSMB will enter the final stages before being officially approved and put into law. More specific crypto regulation could come over the next year.\n\n\"This bill delivers the outcomes of the future regulatory framework review, giving the regulators significant new rule-making responsibilities, while balancing that additional responsibility with clear accountability, appropriate democratic input, and transparent oversight,\" said Baroness Joanna Penn, a member of the House of Lords.\n\nIn other news, a new exchange called EDX Markets that trades Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies and is backed by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel revealed this morning that it is live and has raised new funding. This comes just after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith some of the largest, most well-known crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase recently being sued by the SEC, this is welcome news for crypto investors to see mainstream financial companies further supporting the industry.\n\nNow what\n\nAll of this is good news for Bitcoin. Its dominance in the industry shows that investors are flocking to Bitcoin as a safe haven, and more regulatory clarity and acceptance among the mainstream financial system will only legitimize the world's largest token.\n\nBitcoin miners like CleanSpark and Hive are of course going to do well when Bitcoin goes up because that is the token they mine and hold, but overall they tend to be more volatile.\n\nUltimately, I prefer to own Bitcoin itself and believe it's worth having exposure to Bitcoin, as the token continues to become more legitimized."

        "content": "A wind farm in Norway. Rich in cheap hydro and wind power, the country is among Europe's last crypto hubs.\n\nSource: dmathies/iStock via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nOwners of datacenters and crypto-mining operations are claiming that their businesses, far from being a drag on electric systems, can help integrate renewables and balance grids.\n\nWith its Renewable Bitcoin Quarq Spread Index, S&P Global Commodity Insights tracks the profitability of mining bitcoin, accounting for the costs of renewable certificates using Platts Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) and Platts Guarantee of Origin (GOs) data.\n\nWhile mining is in the money in key markets, according to the index, during times of low crypto prices and high electricity prices, miners have profited from opting out of consumption from the grid, sometimes earning more than from the mining activities themselves.\n\nSome sector pioneers now point to crypto mining's ability to capture energy from renewables that otherwise would have been curtailed, improving project economics and enabling more development in low-price regions.\n\nPart of this trend is a pivot to smaller-scale behind-the-meter installations, according to the founders of a US mining startup.\n\n\"Our view isn't that you should throw up a bunch of generation assets so that you can mine bitcoin,\" said Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization Inc. (DPO), an energy services startup developing behind-the-meter computing solutions for renewables assets.\n\n\"When you really pencil out that math, it's very hard to make that work,\" Webber said. \"It can't be the only thing that you're doing with that energy asset.\"\n\nInstead, Webber and business partner Alex Stoewer, COO of DPO, see co-located mining behind the meter as an optimization tool that reduces curtailment or sales into a low power price environment, as well as an enabler for fresh renewables in regions where power is cheap.\n\nDPO has also been able to fund maintenance for an old hydroelectric plant in central Wisconsin after acquiring it and adding computing capacity on-site. Built in 1908, the 6.8-MW Hatfield Hydro Project would have otherwise eventually been decommissioned, Stoewer said.\n\nNorwegian official: Mining seizes valuable resources\n\nSimilar concepts could work in unlocking more development in regions in Africa that anticipate population growth, the startup founders say. Meanwhile, Europe \"has better uses for [its] power,\" said Stoewer.\n\nIndeed, the energy crisis only reinforced European lawmakers' attention on energy efficiency and potential drains on supply, and regulatory winds are changing for bitcoin miners as a result.\n\nOne of Europe's more active mining markets is Norway, which offers affordable and clean power due to large hydroelectric and wind reserves. About 250 MW of capacity is estimated to be powering mining in the country, mostly in the northernmost price zones where electricity remains comparatively affordable.\n\n\"We see the energy situation as demanding and that crypto mining is seizing valuable power resources,\" Norway's state secretary, Elisabeth S\u00e6ther of the Labour Party, said in an email to S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nWhile grid operators are obligated to connect new power end users to the grid \u2014 as well as to award increased capacity to existing end users \u2014 on a nondiscriminatory basis, queues for grid connection have lengthened in Norway due to rising demand from various sectors, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nTo tackle this, the government laid out an action plan earlier in spring that proposes introducing new prioritization criteria for grid connections based on the maturity of projects that request grid connections.\n\nThese criteria also include financing and plans for load usage, and the minister stressed that this filter will not discriminate against any particular sector.\n\nHowever, in an upcoming revision of the Norwegian Act on Electronic Communications, the government is expected to propose new obligations for all datacenter operators, including crypto miners. The bill is set for a vote in mid-June. The government is also revising its national Data Centre Strategy, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nNeighbor Sweden, also a hub for mining in Europe, has also indicated that it is prioritizing resources for other ventures such as hydrogen-based steel or chemicals production.\n\nBitcoin passes baton to artificial intelligence\n\nWhile major miners may be relegated to the back of the queue, Sweden remains a hub for flexible datacenters joined with renewables projects, Hungarian startup founder Daniel Jogg said.\n\nHis flexible datacenter startup, Enerhash Technologies, has developed projects across Europe and beyond, advising asset owners like E.ON SE subsidiary E.ON Hung\u00e1ria Zrt. or Sweden's Vattenfall AB on leveraging flexible datacenters for balancing volatility.\n\nEurope has not experienced negative wholesale power prices for the past few years, but with an increase in solar installed capacity and weaker demand, negative power prices have reemerged \u2014 a trend datacenter developers say bolsters their business case.\n\nWhen two reactors at the Forsmarks k\u00e4rnkraftverk nuclear plant in Sweden went down in April, Jogg said 200 MW of flexible computing was able to ramp down as a high-frequency demand response mechanism to balance the grid.\n\nEnerhash also works with oil and gas field owners in the Middle East who are looking for better uses for flared gas by powering datacenters, as well as US oil and gas developer Allied Energy Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, datacenter demand is set to triple in the next decade thanks to AI computing power, making datacenters a promising part of the flexibility puzzle, Jogg said.\n\nThe energy companies Jogg works with are rarely interested in mining bitcoin for profit, he said. \"They are solving their problems. They are entering this business because they have the best synergies with datacenters. 95% of the time, they say, 'Do what you want with the bitcoin stuff, we need the datacenter.'\"\n\nStigmatized cryptocurrencies\n\nIntegrated behind-the meter applications do not face the long grid connection queues that standalone miners would, DPO's Webber said.\n\nDozens of utilities and independent power producers in the US are keen to invest in such capabilities, Webber said, but refrain from disclosing early pilots and investments because of the \"stigma\" attached to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe 6-MW Hatfield hydro plant in Wisconsin, restored by DPO and partner Wiconi Hydro.\n\nSource: Cascade Digital Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an interesting proposition, but it's just such a risky market,\" said Jonathan Schroth, a research analyst on the datacenter infrastructure and services team for 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPart of the challenge is the price of devices used to mine bitcoin via proof of work technology, which had peaked between $13,000 and $15,000 per unit, Schroth said. A pivot away from proof of work mining is possible, but Schroth said it bears a risk of stranded assets.\n\nInvestors who are uncomfortable with cryptocurrencies are eyeing other segments such as AI computing, which also requires large amounts of electricity, Webber said.\n\nTexas remains attractive as crypto bill fails to pass\n\nMuch of the mining activity behind bitcoin is based in the US, where conditions for mining remain more favorable.\n\nAbout 38% of bitcoin's global hashrate, the computational power used by the blockchain network, is generated in the US, according to December 2021 data \u2014 the most recent available \u2014 from the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Within the US, the state of Georgia had by far the largest share of activity, at nearly 31%, according to the index.\n\nThe majority of US-based crypto mining relies on fossil fuel-derived electricity, said David Shargel, a partner at law firm Bracewell in New York, adding that miners are increasingly hunting for new ways to tap into renewables. \"They recognize they may not be welcome within the traditional grid,\" Shargel said.\n\n\"What we mostly see are folks artificially elongating the lifespan of a fossil fuel-powered plant,\" said Schroth, pointing to the example of beleaguered miner Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., which made headlines for using a coal plant in New York later converted to run on natural gas to power its activities.\n\nIn January, New York became the first state to ban crypto mining derived from fossil fuels, and even some Texas lawmakers have recently tried to chip away at the state's mining cohort.\n\n\"For a couple of years now, Texas has been extremely attractive. Part of the incentive was providing a monetary reward for crypto mining operations that were able to shed load, stop their operations when load was at peak,\" Shargel said.\n\nTo limit this, Texas state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican, told a state Senate committee hearing in March that Texas' booming digital mining industry is planning to add 37 GW of additional load to the state and no longer needs state incentives to thrive.\n\nS.B. 1751, a bill sponsored by Kolkhorst, proposed that miners should only earn credits for demand response services if they comprise less than 10% of services procured by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc.\n\nThe bill progressed through the Texas Senate amid strong pushback from the industry but ultimately did not pass after being halted by the House of Representatives in late May.\n\nShargel does not expect interventions to reduce mining activity in the US. \"The mining industry will be here to stay for at least some time. The miners are going to continue to find the optimal locations and sources of power,\" Shargel said.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights reporter Maxim Grama produces content for distribution on Platts Dimensions Pro.

        "content": "In the latest episode of ETF Prime, VettaFi\u2019s head of research Todd Rosenbluth discusses iShares\u2019 bitcoin ETF filing and the increasing number of launches and filings for active ETFs. Later, Charles Schwab\u2019s senior investment portfolio strategist D.J. Tierney discusses ETF flows, standout ETFs, and their direct indexing platform. Plus, T. Rowe Price\u2019s global head of ETFs Tim Coyne talks about the firm\u2019s expanding actively managed ETF suite.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Saga Continues\n\nJust when you think the bitcoin ETF saga is dragging, something new comes along. That something new is BlackRock\u2019s iShares arm filing for a bitcoin ETF . Rosenbluth admitted to podcast host Nate Geraci that the filing caught him by surprise.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Rosenbluth said. \u201cThe SEC has been consistent with concerns about fraud and manipulation for a spot bitcoin ETF.\u201d He cited the SEC\u2019s battle against Grayscale as an example of the agency fighting against a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nRosenbluth said the Nasdaq may do surveillance to support the effort but is unsure if that will make a difference. And while \u201cBlackRock doesn\u2019t launch products just to launch products,\u201d Rosenbluth remains \u201cskeptical that we\u2019re going to see any spot bitcoin ETF in 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regulatory environment isn\u2019t favorable towards such a product,\u201d he added.\n\nSo, why would BlackRock file if the idea is getting such pushback from the SEC? Rosenbluth agrees with Geraci that it feels like BlackRock may know something. Whether what they know will \u201clead to a spot bitcoin ETF being approved this year\u201d remains to be seen. But if BlackRock is successful in getting the ETF approved, \u201cit\u2019ll be tremendously successful because it\u2019s BlackRock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re smart to get in line early in case the SEC shifts their stance,\u201d Rosenbluth said.\n\nSee more: \u201c VettaFi Honored As Finalist for 2023 \u201cWealthie\u201d Award In Research Innovation \u201d\n\nAn Exciting Time for Actively Managed ETFs\n\nPrior to Geraci speaking with Coyne from T. Rowe Price, Rosenbluth discussed the firm\u2019s newly launched T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF (TCAF) and four additional active transparent funds. Unlike T. Rowe Price\u2019s other launches, TCAF is not a clone . Rather, it\u2019s a fully transparent equity-only portfolio with the same approach as the equity sleeve of the mutual fund.\n\nRosenbluth noted that, in addition to T. Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Investments, and J.P Morgan have also thrown their hats into the active ETF ring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really exciting to me when asset managers bring their best into the ETF space,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a really exciting time for actively managed ETFs.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs Introducing Eagle Capital to the ETF Party\n\nEagle Capital is another issuer that\u2019s thrown its hat into the active ETF ring. And it\u2019s done this with the help of the Goldman Sachs ETF Accelerator business. The Eagle Capital Select Equity ETF will likely trade under the ticker EAGL in the second half of 2023. Per the filing, the ETF \u2013 the firm\u2019s first \u2013 will be actively managed and fully transparent.\n\nBut the Goldman Sachs ETF accelerator is different than Alpha Architecture or Tidal. \u201cWhat Goldman is doing is leveraging more of its institutional expertise,\u201d Rosenbluth explained. Goldman Sachs is leveraging its new institutional expertise to set the new ETFs up for success. It\u2019s acting more like a consultant than as a white labeling service.\n\n\u201cGoldman is not helping manage the fund,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are really using all of their relationships within the broader ETF ecosystem to support a firm like Eagle Capital.\u201d\n\nOr, to put it another way: \u201cIf you\u2019re showing up to a party 30 years late, it helps of have a friend introduce you around to the right people.\u201d\n\nVettaFi Honored as Wealthies Finalist\n\nRosenbluth also gave a shout-out to the VettaFi team for being a finalist for WealthManagement.com\u2019s 2023 Industry Awards (a.k.a. the \u201cWealthies\u201d). VettaFi is one of two firms to be recognized for outstanding achievement in research innovation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the recognition,\u201d Rosenbluth said. It\u2019s an honor to be a finalist.\u201d\n\nThe Wealthies honors companies, organizations, and individuals supporting financial advisor success.\n\nETF Flows, Active Funds\n\nLater in the episode, Charles Schwab\u2019s Tierney kicks off his segment by talking about ETF flows so far this year.\n\n\u201cI think we all have to take note of the large flows that we\u2019ve seen into the fixed income category this year,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cThey really are significant.\u201d\n\nTierney added that overall, flows are a little lower, particularly within equity ETFs.\n\nFor Coyne\u2019s segment, the global head of ETFs for T. Rowe Price discussed the firm\u2019s rapidly expanding ETF suite. T. Rowe Price entered the ETF space about three years ago. Now, the firm has a lineup of 15 actively managed ETFs.\n\n\u201cWhen we entered the active ETF market, we really committed to putting our best foot forward for our clients,\u201d Coyne said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to developing a comprehensive suite within ETFs to really better service our clients.\u201d\n\nListen to the entire episode of ETF Prime Featuring Todd Rosenbluth:"

In drawing inferences from the indicator readings, Glassnode analysts say this suggests a significant contraction in the actively tradeable supply, resulting in both a decline in liquidity as well as a constrained supply side.\n\nThe #Bitcoin Highly Liquid Supply has recorded a stark decline across our cycle, currently residing near a cycle low of 2.94M BTC, a -620K BTC decrease since Jan 2022.\n\n\n\nThis suggests a significant contraction in the actively tradeable supply, resulting in both a decline in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/H9PJV3fWC8 \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 19, 2023\n\nBitcoin posted a rebound earlier this year, making it the best-performing asset in the first quarter. However, a growing U.S. regulatory crackdown recently tempered some investors' enthusiasm.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC launched charges against the two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The declines in liquidity might be due to crypto trading platforms losing access to dollar payment systems.\n\nAn instance is seen when BinanceUS announced the suspension of USD deposits after its banking partners paused fiat (USD) withdrawal channels.\n\nThe drop in liquidity might also point to a waning appetite for Bitcoin at its recent higher levels as crypto regulation returns to the spotlight.\n\nImpact on price\n\nThe impact on price might be thus: there is little support for not only the downside but the upside as well. Also, the market might be subject to volatility swings until the needed injection of liquidity is achieved.\n\nBitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are putting up lackluster performance at the start of the week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was marginally higher in the last 24 hours, at $26,526.\n\nThis week, investors will be paying close attention to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee to get a grasp of the next direction for the U.S. economy.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, the measure of how much Bitcoin makes up of the total crypto market cap, has breached the 50% mark.\n\nOn June 19 at 6 pm UTC, Bitcoin dominance hit just above 50% and has since settled to 49.9% at the time of publication, according to data from TradingView.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin alone accounts for half of crypto\u2019s total $1.1 trillion dollar market capitalization. Bitcoin\u2019s current market capitalization stands at $519 billion, according to data from Coingecko.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance has surged by more than 10.5% since Nov. 27, 2022, an increase driven in large part by investors looking to the flagship crypto asset as a safe haven in the wake of the FTX crisis and amid mounting regulatory scrutiny of crypto assets in the United States.\n\nBitcoin market dominance over the last 4 days. Source: TradingView.\n\nWhile Bitcoin dominance increased significantly over the last eight months, Ether\u2019s (ETH) market dominance has been holding steady around the 20% mark for the better part of a year. Currently, the combined value of Bitcoin and Ether now accounts for roughly 70% of the entire crypto market.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder and outspoken Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor believes that Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance will top 80% in the coming years, as increasing regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission causes stablecoins and the majority of other crypto assets to \u201cgo away.\u201d\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream. pic.twitter.com/Foq4lpderj \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) June 13, 2023\n\n\u201cThe entire industry is destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other Proof of Work tokens.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Saylor blamed the lack of any \u201cmega institutional money\u201d entering the crypto space on the \u201cconfusion and anxiety\u201d brought about the by the 25,000 other cryptocurrencies that have positioned themselves as alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: Why Cathie Wood is bullish on Coinbase stock and believes Bitcoin will reach $1 million\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the universally, globally-acknowledged digital commodity in this industry,\u201d Saylor added, making a nod to the fact that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency SEC Chair Gary Gensler has labeled a commodity. The SEC has now declared a total of 68 cryptocurrencies to be securities.\n\nBitcoin is currently changing hands for $26,746 an increase of 1.5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph Price Index. The value of Bitcoin has grown more than 3% over the course of the last week despite \u201cfear\u201d in the crypto market reaching its highest point in three months.\n\nCrypto research firm Santiment also points to investment colossus Blackrock\u2019s filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF as one of the major drivers of Bitcoin's upwards price action over the last few days.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "4 things that can spark the next Bitcoin bull cycle - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin has dropped nearly 15% from its yearly high of around $31,000, with the recent regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance and the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish forward guidance accelerating its sell-off.\n\nStill, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 60% year-to-date, holding above a technical support level of $25,000. Moreover, there are a few reasons a new bull cycle could begin.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving, a preprogrammed event that slashes the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply rate by half every four years, is coming up in April 2024.\n\nThe previous three Bitcoin halvings (in 2012, 2016 and 2020) have all preceded massive BTC price rallies and new all-time highs. For instance, BTC is up 276% since the previous halving in May 2020.\n\nBitcoin price performances since the last three halvings. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe market will likely be in an accumulation zone until the halving, according to analyst Lark Davis, who anticipates Bitcoin to test its record high of $69,000 in the next 18 to 24 months. One analyst even sees the price hitting $160,000 by April 2024.\n\nVolatility, volumes, and realized values are at multi-year lows, indicating that Bitcoin investor apathy is firmly in play.\n\n\n\nHowever, under the surface, HODLers continue their classic slow and steady accumulation, with the halving now less than 1yr away.\n\n\n\nTo find our more,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1w2gMTRWCC \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 19, 2023\n\nRelated: Why Cathie Wood is bullish on Coinbase stock and believes Bitcoin will reach $1 million\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has also boosted confidence in a potential BTC price rally in the days leading up to the halving.\n\nThe investment firm, which manages $8.5 trillion in assets, has a near-perfect ETF approval record with the SEC. The SEC\u2019s deadline to respond to BlackRock\u2019s application is around March 2024, a month before the halving.\n\nAn SEC approval could double Bitcoin's bullish prospects after the halving, several analysts argue.\n\n\u201cYour are watching game theory at work,\u201d analyst Crypto Tea stated, noting:\n\n\u201cBlackRock understands the bitcoin halving is less than a year away. New supply will decrease while demand continues to increase from worldwide hyperinflation. They are asset managers and need to capture Bitcoin\u2019s performance before their competitors do.\u201d\n\nBitcoin dominance rising\n\nThe latest SEC crackdown on Binance and Coinbase has left many top altcoins under stress, particularly those deemed \u201cunregistered securities.\u201d That has coincided with the Bitcoin\u2019s crypto market dominance crossing 50% for the first time in two years.\n\nBitcoin market dominance index. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, capital is moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, as the latter is not considered a security by the SEC. Therefore, BTC may be seen as the \u201csafe\u201d bet when compared with the 60-plus cryptocurrencies deemed securities by the regulator.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has predicted this will push BTC\u2019s market cap to 80% of the total crypto market in the coming years. He said:\n\n\"Regulatory clarity is going to drive Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream.\"\n\nBTC price \u201cbull flag\u201d\n\nTechnicals show Bitcoin painting a clear bull flag pattern on its longer-timeframe charts, suggesting an upside continuation of its overall recovery rally.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA bull flag gets resolved after the price breaks above its upper trendline and rises by as much as the height of the previous uptrend. As a result, Bitcoin\u2019s bull flag target comes near $35,500 \u2014 a level that served as strong support in May 2021 and May 2022.\n\nStill, Bitcoin will need to close decisively above $35,500 to begin a bull cycle, given that it would still be a lower high compared with the cryptocurrency\u2019s previous bear market peaks.\n\nInterestingly \u2014 and simultaneously to the bull flag pattern \u2014 BTC price could be on the cusp of a breakout in its prevailing inverse-head-and-shoulders (IH&S) pattern, as shown below.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAn IH&S is a bullish reversal pattern, confirmed by the formation of three troughs under a common neckline resistance. The middle trough comes to be deeper than the other two, which have more or less the same height.\n\nAs a rule, an IH&S pattern is resolved after the price breaks above the neckline and rises by as much as the distance between the middle trough\u2019s lowest point and the neckline. Sometimes, the price returns to retest the neckline as support after the first breakout attempt.\n\nRelated: 31% of young Aussies hold crypto despite being \u2018risk averse\u2019 \u2014 ASX survey\n\nThus, a rebound from the IH&S neckline could have BTC price rally toward $40,500, up more than 60% from current price levels and confirming a new bull cycle.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin dips after reclaiming US$26,000, Ether falls; XRP only gainer in the crypto top 10 - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia after reclaiming the US$26,000 support level over the weekend. Ether also fell back, but held above US$1,700. XRP, Dogecoin and Litecoin were the only gainers among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Tron\u2019s TRX led the losers. The U.S.-based crypto exchange Bakkt reportedly joined other trading platforms in delisting Polygon, Solana and Cardano after the U.S. regulator this month labelled them illegally issued financial securities. U.S. equity markets are closed Monday for a public holiday, but they could gain in the week ahead as economic data on Friday pointed to slowing inflation, while the first visit to China in almost five years by a top U.S. diplomat could be a positive for capital markets.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; XRP rises\n\nBitcoin fell 0.97% over the last 24 hours to US$26,308 at 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held onto a weekly gain of 1.58%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency breached the US$26,000 level on Saturday to reach a seven-day high of US$26,769. The token had slumped to three-month lows at the end of last week.\n\nEther edged down 0.82% to US$1,716, logging a weekly loss of 2.18%.\n\nWith the exception of XRP, other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower in the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, slumping 3.22% to US$0.5971 and down 5.88% over the past seven days.\n\nNew York-based crypto exchange Bakkt has suspended trading of Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens and plans to delist them, according to Fortune on Friday. Trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro have also decided to delist multiple cryptocurrencies after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits this month against Coinbase and Binance.US and named a long list of cryptocurrencies as securities that were issued and sold without SEC approval.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were affected by increasingly changing sentiment toward crypto as traders could limit their risk-taking in the crypto market due to limited upside catalysts and particularly considering the legal risks in the US,\u201d said Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at trading platform Exness Group, in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe legal actions could scare away some investors from the market but could be relatively positive for Bitcoin\u2019s dominance against other cryptocurrencies. In this regard, Bitcoin has also been gaining ground against Ethereum,\u201d said Makarem.\n\nThe Bitcoin balance on crypto exchanges reached a three-month low of 2,281,978.198 tokens on Sunday, according to blockchain data tracker Glassnode, which reduced some selling pressure as investors normally move tokens to exchanges when they plan to sell.\n\nXRP logged gains for the past 24 hours, rising 1.01% to US$0.4859, but losing 6.34% for the week.\n\nFinTech firm Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment platform is powered by XRP, announced on Friday a partnership with Columbia\u2019s central bank to explore the use of blockchain technologies in the country\u2019s digital payment system.\n\nLast Friday, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin Dai replaced Binance USD (BUSD) as the third largest stablecoin by market cap. BUSD has seen its market cap falling over 10% in the past seven days, after the SEC issued charges against Binance on June 5, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap dipped 0.53% to US$1.07 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.47% to US$19.69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum NFT sales fall, Nike teases deal with Fortnite\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.16% to 2,878.56 in the 24 hours to 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.80% for the seven days.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 20.61% in the past 24 hours to US$11.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Sales on the Bitcoin blockchain slid 44.71% to US$882,550.\n\n\u201cSales across Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lose steam, and it\u2019s hard to say when this could turn around due to uncertainty with regulations and legal matters up in the air,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nDespite the decline, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction saw Ringers #879, an Ethereum-based NFT created by Canadian artist Dmitri Cherniak, sell for US$6.2 million on Friday, the second highest sale of a piece of generative art, or created using autonomous systems.\n\n\u201cSotheby\u2019s auction concluded and saw $10.9m in sales, over half of which was from the Ringers grail,\u201d said Petscher, \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the supposed buyer already a major NFT trader, so this auction didn\u2019t seem to draw attention from the traditional art world. Is it bullish still for NFT art? Yes, but there\u2019s still always concern that the NFT ecosystem is largely an echochamber.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. sportswear giant Nike released a teaser on Saturday which appears to be an NFT collaboration with online video game Fortnite, which will be unveiled on June 20. .SWOOSH, Nike\u2019s Web 3.0 platform that issues NFT sneakers, also announced a partnership with sports video game publisher EA Sports earlier this month.\n\n\u201cA new innovation has reached Ethereum called ethscriptions, inspired by inscriptions on Bitcoin. This new process allows you to inscribe tiny images (under 96kb) on mostly any Ethereum transaction, thus allowing cheap on-chain image storage,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe innovation here is the ease of storing an image on-chain, which is typically avoided in standard contract storage due to the high cost. In just a few days nearly 200ETH of secondary volume has been transacted, most from a sold out 10k collection of Ethereum Punks.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures trade mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.10%, the S&P 500 inched up 0.01%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.16%. The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for a public holiday and will open on Tuesday.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes all closed lower on Friday but logged gains for the week, as investors sorted through mixed signals from economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials on Friday.\n\nA survey by the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers expect annual inflation of 3.3% over the next year, the lowest since March 2021, but still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of annual inflation below 2%.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that more interest rate hikes might be required to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing policy rates having some effects on parts of the economy. The labor market is still strong, but core-kind of inflation is just not moving and that\u2019s going to require probably some more tightening to try to get that going down,\u201d said Waller in his Friday speech.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nMeanwhile in China, analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to make a 10 basis-point cut to its one-year and five-year loan prime rates on Tuesday, lowering the rates to 3.55% and 4.20% as the country struggles with a slow post-Covid recovery, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

Meanwhile, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has again clarified that he views Bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nIn a lawsuit against Binance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called the exchange\u2019s native token BNB a security. The token\u2014the fourth largest crypto by market cap\u2014has plummeted 20% since the start of the month.\n\nBitcoin Retakes $29,000 Amid First Republic Bank Uncertainty\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance metric has often been criticized for under-representing Bitcoin\u2019s true market share by including stablecoins within its calculations, which are effectively dollars trading on the blockchain. However, even the stablecoin market has receded this year after Paxos was forced by the SEC to start winding down BUSD in February, erasing billions of dollars in tokens from circulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast Tuesday, MicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor predicted that Bitcoin dominance will rise above 80% as regulators continue clamping down on other digital assets.\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors.

        "title": "Carl \u201cThe Moon\u201d Runefelt: Bitcoin Will Never Go Below $10K Again (2022 Interview) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Carl Runefelt, better known within the crypto community and perhaps beyond it for his social media name \u2013 The Moon \u2013 is one of the most popular entrepreneurs in the field. He has over 500K subscribers on YouTube and has recently crossed the one million followers milestone on Twitter.\n\nFrom wild Bitcoin predictions to million-dollars NFT buys, to his recent payment app Kasta, and what he thinks about the criticism he received from his community after showing his new Bugatti while the market was starting to crash in December 2021.\n\nFrom Sorting Groceries to The Moon in Four Years\n\nRunefelt started his Youtube channel in 2017. Before diving into crypto, he was working at a groceries store in Sweden \u2013 where he\u2019s originally from.\n\n\u201cI was working at a groceries store in Sweden. I wasn\u2019t very happy with my life \u2013 I thought it was a bit boring. I felt that I wasn\u2019t doing what I was supposed to do.\u201d\n\nIt was the Law of Attraction and how visualizing his goals helped him achieve the lavish lifestyle that he lives today \u2013 in Dubai.\n\nBefore getting into crypto, he was investing the money he had in physical gold and silver. As a 22-year old who was starting his career, it was the inefficient banking system that had him looking for an alternative.\n\n\u201cI was looking for ways to make money on the stupidity and the corruption of the central bankers and I thought that was gold. But then I saw one YouTube video \u2013 someone had made a video about YouTube and I saw it and I just immediately thought it was extremely interesting.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when TheMoon\u2019s channel was born. Now, he\u2019s an investor in crypto, but he\u2019s also doing anything imaginable in the industry, from providing liquidity and farming yields to investing in multiple projects, including Kasta, which is a payment app. Kasta comes as an alternative to traditional payment solutions that are part of the system that Runefelt wanted to stand against.\n\nBitcoin Will Never Go Back Below $10K\n\nIn December 2019, CryptoPotato had an interview with The Moon. He then predicted that BTC\u2019s price would go to $200,000 as a great hedge against inflation. Back then, the price was hovering around $7,000.\n\nSince 2019, and especially around the COVID-19 March 20 crash, we saw Bitcoin trading heavily in correlation with the global markets, putting the narrative to question in many people\u2019s view.\n\nNowadays, he maintains that Bitcoin is still a \u201cfantastic hedge against inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the scarcest asset in the whole universe. There is nothing out ther that can compete. However, in the short-term, if you have the stock markets completely collapsed, obviously everything will crash. It\u2019s just how markets work. I think that long-term, Bitcoin is uncorrelated to the stock market and other markets out there.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the possibility of bitcoin going to zero, TheMoon strongly refuted it and even said that he thinks BTC is \u201cnever going back down below $10,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would suggest that it\u2019s very likely that Bitcoin is going way above a million dollars. I think that even $10 million is where BTC is going.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his 2019 prediction, Runefelt believes that $200K in the next three years is \u2018very possible.\u2019\n\nBuying a CryptoPunk Was a Stupid Mistake\n\nRunefelt has been very vocal about spending $1 million for his CryptoPunk NFT.\n\n\u201cThe CryptoPunk I did buy, kind of at the top of the market, and that was a stupid mistake. I kind of regret that I bought it because first of all, I paid a million dollars for it which is way too much for a JPEG, you can say. I have no clue of what its value is right now and I try to maximize its value by at least trying to do some promotion out of it.\u201d\n\nThe Controversy and Criticism After Buying His Bugatti\n\nAt the end of 2021, while the crypto markets saw sharp declines, Runefelt shared on his Twitter profile that he bought a new Bugatti \u2013 his dream car \u2013 after selling some of his ETH. Many people criticized the move and hinted that it was done to brag.\n\nI just bought my dream Bugatti with #Ethereum \ud83d\ude0d pic.twitter.com/aPjFXaY9WX \u2014 The Moon (@TheMoonCarl) December 29, 2021\n\nIn response to this, he explained that the decision came after seeing how much money he made out of Ethereum and that it was time to take some profits and buy his dream car.\n\n\u201cI had a bunch of money that was stored in Ethereum and I thought \u2013 why not take some profits, why not buy something that I\u2019ve been dreaming of for years now?\u201d\n\nHe argued that none of it is to brag but rather to inspire other people. Did he convince his followers? Time will tell."

        "content": "After a momentary retest of the $25,000 support on June 15, Bitcoin gained 6.5% as bulls successfully defended the $26,300 level. Despite this, the general sentiment remains slightly bearish as the cryptocurrency has declined by 12.7% in two months.\n\nThe dismissal of Binance.US\u2019s temporary restraining order by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States district court is somewhat related to investors\u2019 sentiment improving. On June 16, the exchange reportedly reached an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), avoiding the freeze of its assets.\n\nOn a longer timeframe, the global regulatory environment has been extremely harmful to cryptocurrency prices. Besides the SEC trying to unilaterally label exactly which altcoins it views as securities and litigating with the two leading global exchanges, the European Union signed the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations into law on May 31. This means crypto businesses have set timelines to implement and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements.\n\nCuriously, while Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) performance has been lackluster, on June 16, the S&P 500 Index reached its highest level in 14 months. Even with this recovery, JPMorgan strategists expect the rally to come under pressure in the second half of 2023 \u201cif growth stalls in absolute terms.\"\n\nInvestors will keep their focus on the U.S. central bank, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell set to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on June 21 and the Senate Banking Committee on the morning of June 22 as part of his semi-annual testimony before lawmakers.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid weaker macroeconomic perspectives.\n\nBitcoin margin and futures show mild demand for leverage longs\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio has been declining since June 10, indicating the overwhelming dominance of longs is over. The present 23:1 ratio favoring stablecoin lending still favors bulls but sits near the lowest levels in five weeks.\n\nInvestors should also analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, as it excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders' Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nTop traders at OKX vastly decreased their shorts on June 15 as the Bitcoin price plunged to its lowest level in three months at $24,800. However, those traders were not comfortable keeping a ratio that favored longs, and it has since moved back to a 0.80 ratio, in line with the two-week average.\n\nThe opposite movement happened at Binance, as top traders reduced their long-to-short ratio to 1.18 on June 15 but subsequently added longs, and the indicator stands at 1.25. Albeit an improvement, Binance\u2019s top traders' long-to-short ratio is presently in line with the previous two-week average.\n\nRelated: Hawkish Fed, stocks market rally, and crypto falling behind\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price gains are capped despite resilience in derivative metrics\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls lack the confidence to leverage long positions using margin and futures markets. BTC lacks momentum as investors\u2019 attention has shifted to the stock market after the Fed decided to pause its interest rate hikes, improving the outlook for corporate earnings.\n\nDespite the extremely negative regulatory pressure, professional traders did not flip bearish, according to Bitcoin derivatives metrics. However, bears have the upper hand as the 20-day resistance at $27,500 strengthens, limiting the short-term upside to a mere 3.8%.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The new administration would confidently spark further innovation and assist with the expansion of the crypto space within the United States.\u201d\n\nNew York-based crypto exchange Bakkt has suspended trading of Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens and plans to delist them, according to Fortune on Friday. Trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro have also decided to delist multiple cryptocurrencies following the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 2.36% in the past 24 hours to US$0.2601, followed by Polygon\u2019s Matic token that lost 1.62% to US$0.5983.\n\nThe XRP token saw the biggest gain, rising 0.95% to US$0.4884. The token saw some upside momentum since last week after the release of internal SEC documents showing former director William Hinman saying that Ether was not a security. Investors hope this would prove that XRP was unfairly targeted by the regulator, in the SEC vs XRP lawsuit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.33% to US$1.07 trillion and market volume decreased 1.2% to US$19.92 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum NFT sales drop as Bitcoin ordinals sales gain ground\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched down 0.11% to 2,878.67 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and declined 4.39% during the week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales fell 19.8% to US$10.51 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 47.76% to US$665,168.

The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for a public holiday and will open on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.24% to 102.5 points, while the euro fell 0.23% to US$1.09. The U.S. dollar fell 1.2% last week after the Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes for the first time in over a year.

        "title": "Why Cathie Wood is bullish on Coinbase stock and believes Bitcoin will reach $1 million - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In an interview with Bloomberg, ARK Invest CEO and chief investment officer Cathie Wood recently discussed why her flagship fund, Ark Innovation (ARKK), is adding to its position in shares of Coinbase (COIN) after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, one of Coinbase\u2019s biggest competitors.\n\nARKK purchased nearly 330,00 shares of COIN on June 6, 2023, worth about $17 million at the time, according to disclosure statements. Two other exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ark Fintech Innovation ETF and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF, also added 35,700 shares (worth $1.8 million) and 53,900 shares (worth $2.8 million), respectively.\n\nAcross all three funds, Ark\u2019s average entry price is $272.75 to $282.93, with the firm\u2019s total position currently valued at $1.77 billion. At the time of writing, COIN is trading at $53.90. Needless to say, the fund is deeply in the red on this trade so far.\n\nAs far as why she\u2019s still bullish, her reasoning boils down to this: SEC enforcement will lead Coinbase to become the only game in town when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. Of course, this assumes that Coinbase will triumph in its own legal battles with the SEC.\n\nWood explained that she sees a difference in the accusations being brought against the two exchanges. While both are facing lawsuits by the SEC over the alleged trading and staking of unregistered securities, Binance may also be facing more serious charges.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao, or CZ for short, was faced with a civil enforcement action filed by the U.S. regulator for derivatives in March. The action alleges that CZ and three of the exchanges affiliates violated the Commodity Exchange Act and several regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThese types of allegations \u201chave nothing to do with Coinbase,\u201d according to Wood. Therefore, she believes that Coinbase will survive the storm and emerge victorious, with its biggest competitor out of the picture.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether or not Wood\u2019s conviction on COIN can be considered well-justified. While some analysts share her view, others do not. The analyst consensus on the stock is a Hold rating, with an average price target of $58.49, or roughly 12% to the upside from current levels.\n\nSeveral notable analysts have come forward with more bullish price targets of $70, including John Todaro and Atlantic Equities.\n\nA 3-month chart of COIN. Source: TradingView\n\nThe relative strength index is almost perfectly neutral at a reading of 49.7, suggesting no decisive direction for COIN at this time.\n\nIt could be that COIN is the best and soon-to-be-only option when it comes to U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges. But this alone may or may not lead to COIN price appreciation.\n\nWhen evaluating the future prospects of an equity, most analysts tend not to look at one factor in isolation. Basing an investment thesis on the sole premise that a company\u2019s competitors may be doomed can lead analysts to ignore other, and perhaps even more important, factors.\n\nCould Coinbase also face criminal charges going forward?\n\nIt\u2019s worth repeating that Coinbase is also facing a lawsuit from the SEC regarding the trading and staking of unregistered securities. This could eventually lead to the exchange being deemed to have participated in illegal activities.\n\nBut perhaps even more concerning than SEC enforcement actions is the allegation that Coinbase may have invested in projects it planned to list on the exchange before they became available to the public.\n\nAfter Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke with The Wall Street Journal on June 10, rumors started circulating that the company may have done just that. In the interview, Armstrong gave no adequate answer to a question concerning whether or not Coinbase invests in tokens listed on the platform.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that almost every single time a new token gets listed on Coinbase, the price tanks.\n\nIf this was, in fact, due to an orchestrated pump-and-dump scheme, it could constitute a financial crime of epic proportions.\n\nThe question is: Does any potential evidence exist for such a serious accusation?\n\nWell, yes and no.\n\nLooking at Coinbase Venture\u2019s portfolio, it does appear that as many as 30 projects that appeared in the company\u2019s investment portfolio were also listed on the exchange. However, Coinbase Ventures claims that it does not \u201ccoordinate with review and listings teams\u201d and is \u201crun and staffed separately from the main business.\u201d\n\nFactcheck: @brian_armstrong dodged the question on whether @Coinbase invests in tokens on the platform.\n\n\n\nI went through Coinbase Venture's entire portfolio, and found that these 30 projects were both part of their investment portfolio, as well as traded on @Coinbase exchange https://t.co/UCqy6kGpvK pic.twitter.com/ltPlhAh74x \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 10, 2023\n\nWhile this does not necessarily mean that Coinbase used its exchange as a giant pump-and-dump scheme, it may point to one more thing for financial authorities to consider investigating. Needless to say, news of such an investigation would probably not bode well for the share price of COIN.\n\nRelated: SEC asks for more time to respond to Coinbase call for crypto clarity\n\nBitcoin to $1 million?\n\nIn her conversation with Bloomberg, Wood reiterated her view that \u201cBitcoin is a hedge against inflation.\u201d Yet she also noted that she sees deflation as a substantial risk going forward. Despite this, she remains bullish on the Bitcoin price, holding firm to her $1 million target.\n\nYear-to-date chart of BTC/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin experienced a golden cross back in February, with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) moving above the 200-day EMA. Volumes have been declining, along with the Chaikin money flow, suggesting the potential for sideways trading for the time being.\n\nEven in a deflationary environment, Bitcoin can still outperform due to it being \u201can antidote to counterparty risk in the traditional financial system,\u201d according to Wood.\n\nGiven that three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history have occurred in the last three months, she could have a point.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving event is less than one year away. Investors are currently in the \u201caccumulation\u201d phase of the cycle, as seen in the graph below.\n\nBitcoin halving cycles aligned with investor sentiment phases.

In a tweet, Binance mentioned its ongoing efforts to enable BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, recognizing its potential in such situations.

It allows participants to create payment channels, conduct off-chain transactions quickly and inexpensively, and settle the channels on the Bitcoin blockchain when necessary. The Lightning Network aims to enhance the speed, scalability and privacy of Bitcoin transactions, making it more efficient for microtransactions while reducing fees and congestion on the main network.\n\nRelated: Binance\u2019s BNB Chain introduces layer-2 testnet powered by Optimism\n\nRecently, Binance has been entangled in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), causing a period of uncertainty for the company.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBlackRock files for Bitcoin exchange-traded fund\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager will use Coinbase Custody as a custodian\n\nBitcoin proponents predict a positive market impact\n\nAmerican investment firm BlackRock, which is rated as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is looking to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund to give clients indirect exposure to the preeminent cryptocurrency.\n\nA filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust would tap Coinbase Custody as its custodian partner. The firm previously launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the U.S. in 2022.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move comes at a precarious time for the cryptocurrency space in the U.S., with the SEC pursuing legal recourse against the likes of Coinbase and Binance.US for what it deems as unregistered securities offerings relating to a number of cryptocurrencies listed on the exchanges.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF, and why does it matter?\n\nETFs are a type of investment fund that allows investors to buy and sell shares that represent underlying securities, such as stocks, bonds, commodities and in this case Bitcoin.\n\nETFs are designed to track the price performance of specific stocks or baskets of assets. ETF are typically traded on stock exchanges alongside individual stocks\n\nPerhaps most importantly, ETF are described as passively managed, in that they replicate or mirror the performance of an underlying asset without an investor having to buy the asset itself.\n\nIn this case, investors would buy shares of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or holding BTC. As outlined in the SEC filing, Coinbase Custody would be the custodian of the underlying BTC of the ETF.\n\nWhen Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBlackRock is the latest investment firm to file for approval to offer its clients a Bitcoin ETF. It joins a fairly long list of investment firms and financial institutions that have sought clearance to offer a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. since 2017.\n\nGlobal investment firm VanEck looked to launch the first-ever Bitcoin spot ETF back in 2017 which was initially denied by the SEC. Van Eck would apply two more times, with a second application ruled out in November 2021 by the Commission.\n\nThe agency\u2019s reasoning was that the Van Eck Firm had not met standards to protect investors as well as prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. VanEck persevered with a third Bitcoin ETF application in June 2022, imploring the SEC to reconsider its previous decisions.\n\nAgain the SEC denied VanEck\u2019s attempts to request a proposed rule change that would permit the listing of VanEck Bitcoin Trust shares in March 2023 .\n\nGemini, owned by the tech mogul Winklevoss twins, also saw its applications for Bitcoin ETFs barred by the SEC alongside SolidX. The SEC would also deny nine separate ETFs submitted by ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares for approval in 2018.\n\nWhile the SEC has continuously denied Bitcoin ETF moves, its northern neighbor Canada adopted a different approach. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) permitted Purpose Investments to launch a Bitcoin ETF in February 2021.\n\nPart of VanEck\u2019s argument in their third filing centered around American investors gaining exposure to the Bitcoin ETF being offered in Canada. The question still remains, when will the U.S. see a fully-fledged Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBullish for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency proponents have painted an optimistic picture of the potential effect that a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could have on the markets.\n\nFun being on @LizClaman show!! And yes, @BlackRock getting a $BTC ETF through would be the best thing that could happen to $BTC . https://t.co/2fFBeB9eyo \u2014 Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) June 16, 2023\n\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said the move \u2018would be the best thing that could happen to $BTC\u2019 as he shared his insights given in an interview with Fox News.\n\n\u201cI say a Hail Mary every night that Larry Fink and BlackRock pull off a Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nThe Blackrock #Bitcoin ETF that was filed for this week is an ETF \u2013 some call it a trust but it\u2019s different than a vehicle like GBTC \u2013 more like GLD and the many well known ETFs by iShares.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a big deal that a company the size of Blackrock is signaling such a\u2026 \u2014 Bruce Fenton (@brucefenton) June 16, 2023\n\nA tweet from Satoshi Roundtable host Bruce Fenton suggested that the move by BlackRock signals renewed institutional interest in cryptocurrency markets.\n\n\u201cEither way, it\u2019s a big deal that a company the size of Blackrock is signaling such a major interest in this asset at this time.\u201d\n\nBlackRock did not file for a bitcoin ETF. \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) June 15, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, renowned podcast host Anthony Pompliano highlighted the technicality of the filing, explaining that BlackRock had actually filed for a Bitcoin Trust. While there are similarities between an ETF and a Trust, \u2018Pomp\u2019 explained why BlackRock went the route of the latter.\n\n\u201cThe products are technically different, especially around regulatory approvals, but the end result for investors are similar. GBTC is a trust. You can\u2019t redeem from the fund. BlackRock is a trust, but you can redeem it appears. That is a big win for investors if it happens.\u201d\n\nPompliano said that BlackRock would not have filed with the SEC \u2018without having confidence it will be approved as trust.\u2019 He added that \u2018Bitcoiners are inside the castle\u2019 of BlackRock, having met members of its team.\n\n\u201cWill be interesting to see how the public markets play out in the next bull market for investors who want BTC exposure but don\u2019t want to (or can\u2019t) hold the asset directly,\u201d Pompliano added.\n\nThe venture capitalist added that the possible approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF would lead to other Wall Street firms following suit, which would then lead to Bitcoin inflows.\n\nBlackrock is controlling the SEC, not the other way around. Therefore, an approval for the #Bitcoin ETF is very likely this time. Stack sats, keep them in self-custody, and enjoy the ride!\ud83d\ude80 \u2014 Julian Liniger @relai.app (@julian_liniger) June 16, 2023\n\nJulian Liniger, CEO of Bitcoin self-custodial wallet Relai, summed up the inherent irony of BlackRock\u2019s application with the SEC just as it takes the crypto industry to task in American courts. Nevertheless, the move could change the trend of Bitcoin\u2019s market price:\n\n\u201cBlackrock is controlling the SEC, not the other way around.

        "content": "SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in the past that holds futures contracts of Bitcoin, but there are no spot crypto ETFs as of now.\n\nUS-based asset manager BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, has filed for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). If approved, this could be the first such product in the crypto market, and it is expected to infuse fresh life into the depressed virtual digital assets.\n\nThe filing by the world\u2019s biggest asset manager has come at a time when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a tough stance against some of the world\u2019s biggest crypto firms, such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nNotably, BlackRock picked the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase to serve as custodian for its Bitcoin product.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s move testifies the fact that Bitcoin is gaining the attention of leading financial institutions. It remains to be seen if SEC will approve the application but the digital asset ecosystem has received the much-needed push to enter the next phase of growth and mass adoption,\u201d said Shivam Thakral, Chief Executive Officer of BuyUcoin, a crypto exchange.\n\nIs it really an ETF?\n\nThe first point to note here is that there are many crypto-based investment products in the market. In fact, SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in the past that holds futures contracts of Bitcoin, but there are no spot crypto ETFs as of now.\n\nAlso read | Higher pension calculation: Should you opt for higher pension per EPFO\u2019s new formula? It\u2019s complicated\n\nThe first Bitcoin-based ETF, called the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), started trading in October 2021. BITO was one of the most sought-after funds after its launch as it became the fastest ETF across all categories, and hit the $1-billion mark in assets under management (AUM) in history.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nSince then, many other crypto-based ETFs, such as one on Ethereum, have come up in the market, but they have all been futures-based.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust application for establishing a \u2018Trust\u2019 is not an ETF in the traditional sense.\n\nWhat is an investment trust?\n\nIn crypto, an \u2018Investment Trust\u2019 is a closed-ended fund set-up as a company, which can buy and sell shares on an exchange. The trust invests in a portfolio of assets, and hence the value of the share of the fund is tied to the value of the underlying assets it holds.\n\nGiven that it is a closed-ended fund, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each share can decouple from the asset\u2019s market price, and can show a huge divergence.\n\nGrayscale's Bitcoin Trust Product (GBTC) is the biggest crypto-based product available in the market, with AUM of more than $15 billion as of May end.\n\nUnlike GBTC, the BlackRock\u2019s Trust, if approved, will allow redemptions, which could be a big win for investors.\n\n\"The true difference in BlackRock\u2019s application is two-fold. BlackRock's involvement with Coinbase, particularly at this state of the market, is a confidence-inspiring move, and, secondly, to avoid previous criticism around spot-pricing feed. BlackRock plans to use the CF Benchmarks Index, created by a UK FCA-regulated firm. It is the same benchmark that is used by the CME to settle Bitcoin futures,\u201d said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\nAlso read | Using AI, Income-Tax department sends notices to tax evaders for fake donations\n\nIt is worth highlighting that this is not BlackRock's first foray into crypto. Last year, in August, the asset manager launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the US.\n\nTo be sure, the BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin product is technically a \u2018Trust\u2019 and not an ETF in the traditional sense. But its Trust is proposed to work like an ETF.\n\nChances of approval\n\nIn the past, applications for launching spot crypto ETFs by asset managers, such as VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, have all been rejected by the regulator.\n\nThe SEC has maintained that spot Bitcoin is not safe enough to be offered to retail investors. The rejections were based on the ETFs\u2019 inability to meet SEC rules, which are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\n\nThe issue was so contentious that, last year, Grayscale sued the SEC after it rejected the application to convert GBTC into an ETF. While a trust is a preferred medium of institutional investors, an ETF is a favourite vehicle for retail investors, which increases penetration and depth of an asset class.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s success in getting SEC approvals inspires confidence among sceptics and investors alike. In its history, the fund manager has applied for 576 ETFs with the SEC, with just one being disapproved so far.\n\nBlackRock has included a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges in its application, which will help allay SEC\u2019s concerns about market manipulation and potentially tipping the odds in favour of the asset manager\u2019s application.\n\nImplications if ETF is approved\n\nDhruvil Shah, Vice-President of Technology at Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said: \u201cBlackRock's move to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the face of regulatory scrutiny shows that it is committed to adopting digital assets and offering alternative investment options. Despite the SEC's latest actions, BlackRock's action demonstrates its confidence in the future of digital assets.\u201d\n\nAlso read | Sovereign Gold Bond 2023-2024 Series I opens today: Should you invest?\n\nBlackRock's Bitcoin ETF differs from earlier ETFs as it would be a spot ETF, meaning it would hold actual Bitcoins on its book.\n\n\u201cBlackRock ETF would actually have to buy the spot BTC and as a result, demand will go up, at least for the amount Bitcoin is removed from circulation. There is no doubt that it will lead to a price rise and significant sentiment rise,\u201d said Ajeet Khurana, Founder and CEO of Reflexical, a crypto advisory firm.\n\nFurther, a Bitcoin-based spot ETF, with a redemption option is expected to bring the price of the fund close to the asset class. At present, the units of the GBTC, which is a Grayscale BTC Trust, is trading at a 40 percent discount to the price of Bitcoin itself, a major drawback of an Investment Trust.\n\nMinal Thukral, Executive Vice President, Growth and Strategy, CoinDCX, added: \u201cThis could lead to more institutional investors investing in Bitcoin, which could have a significant impact on the price of the crypto. Though it is still too early to say the impact of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF on the market, it could be a major step forward for the overall crypto industry.\u201d\n\nTakeaway for investors\n\nBitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is currently trading around the $26,500 level, which is a far cry from its all-time high of $69,045, hit on November 10, 2021.\n\nAlso read | Motilal Oswal\u2019s Nifty Microcap 250 Index fund aims to pick tomorrow\u2019s multibaggers today. Should you invest?\n\nIn the past, the crypto market has reacted in a much more enthusiastical manner to the positive developments in the market.\n\nFor example, when the first Bitcoin-based ETF -- ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2013 was approved in October 2021, the crypto market had jumped more than 10 percent. Today, on a seven-day period, Bitcoin is up around 3 percent.\n\nWhile BlackRock is the biggest asset manager in the world and has an excellent track record in getting product approvals, it is yet to be seen whether the SEC will give the go-ahead to a spot Bitcoin ETF at a time when it has sued major crypto exchanges for trading unregistered securities, and alleged poor practices."

        "title": "This L1 network creates a secure and efficient interoperable network with Bitcoin, Ethereum and more - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a world of different blockchains, interoperability is becoming an increasingly important issue. While many solutions are already connecting the numerous chains, they don\u2019t come without risks.\n\nDifferent layer-1 blockchains aim to solve this interoperability problem by creating a network with integrated bridges between chains and asynchronous message passing. Using a cross-chain bridge, it\u2019s possible to move value from one chain to another. However, this raises several issues for developers and users. One major issue is the potential for bridge hacks, which have caused billions of dollars in damage in recent years.\n\nIn addition, a fragmented blockchain landscape leads to inefficiencies and complexity, exposing additional vulnerabilities. Trading across chains can be costly with rising gas prices and slippage risks. What\u2019s more, bridging solutions can take anywhere from minutes to hours to get a transaction through.\n\nAttacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022. Source: Chainalysis\n\nOne blockchain to connect them all\n\nZetaChain, a decentralized layer-1 chain, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to make the blockchain industry more interoperable by natively supporting cross-chain bridging of assets, data and liquidity.\n\nZetaChain\u2019s approach makes it possible to build omnichain decentralized applications (DApps) that allow users to access all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on. The increased interoperability and ability to create omnichain DApps could improve user experience, which could, in turn, benefit the adoption of blockchain technology in general.\n\nFurthermore, ZetaChain not only supports smart contract chains like Ethereum but can also integrate non-smart contract blockchains like Dogecoin and Bitcoin using the cross-chain toolkit for developers. The network effectively allows for Bitcoin smart contracts giving developers the tools and infrastructure to merge their BRC-20 projects, for example. Overall, however, the network is blockchain agnostic.\n\nSource: ZetaChain\n\nGaining momentum\n\nZetaChain is a new project and therefore is working hard to gain a foothold within the crypto industry. The project recently published its white paper, available in 17 different languages. The document highlights the focus on interoperability between chains and developers worldwide.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s testnet has attracted more than 1.5 million users from over 100 countries while its community continues to grow. In addition, ZetaChain\u2019s social media channels have built a follower base of over 1.7 million people in the short time they have been live.\n\nOn the developer side, the momentum is visible as well. The project has partnered with many big names in the crypto industry, including an infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain ecosystem Ankr, blockchain security company Halborn, and bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. DApp development ranges from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to NFTs and universal and private identity platforms, all to expand the reach of the ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers interested in building DApps on top of ZetaChain can apply for funding through the ZetaChain Grants Program. Hundreds of developer teams have already applied for this funding, hoping to receive a kick-start from the project.\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Announcing $5 million in ZetaChain grants to power the next generation of Omnichain dApps. Learn about the program and apply here:https://t.co/ISA1vorcbP \u2014 ZetaChain (@zetablockchain) April 13, 2023\n\nNot stealing from other chains, but growing with them\n\nA key aspect of ZetaChain\u2019s mission is to grow with other networks rather than at their expense. Brandon Truong, chief product officer at ZetaChain, emphasized this aspect: \u201cZetaChain is in a unique position as a new L1 that connects other chains agnostically. Instead of trying to steal liquidity and users from other ecosystems and chains, it can grow with them. The growth of ZetaChain goes hand in hand with the growth of crypto in general.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s founders began their journey by exploring the different types of architecture that exist to connect other chains. They quickly discovered many issues, from the aforementioned vulnerabilities to async messaging-based and centralized approaches. By developing an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain, ZetaChain aims to be a solution that works for users and developers while keeping security concerns in mind.\n\nZetaChain empowers developers to create easy-to-use DApps that onboard non-crypto natives to the crypto space. Moreover, the network allows developers to create DApps that are cross-chain by default and take out the unnecessary burden of reworking code to make a product work on several chains. With its comprehensive omnichain interoperability features, ZetaChain connects all blockchains, including non-smart contract chains, lowering the barriers to building cross-chain applications to interact with any chain.\n\nLearn more about ZetaChain"

It allows developers to extract security from Bitcoin to secure their applications and blockchains by deploying Babylon smart contracts.\n\nThe community has been eagerly anticipating this upgrade ever since Babylon's initial testnet launch four months ago. During this period, Babylon's testnet has drawn significant interest and integrated with 28 of the top Cosmos SDK chains, including Osmosis, Akash, Sei Network, Injective, Evmos, and Stride, thereby demonstrating traction for its technology. The integration arguably makes these Cosmos chains the most secure PoS chains in the world, as the solution combines the best of both worlds, Proof of Stake (PoS) & Proof of Work (PoW) security mechanisms. Additionally, channeling the value of PoS ecosystems into the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade extends Babylon's capabilities beyond the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling it to cater to a broader range of applications. It positions Babylon as a robust platform for developing decentralized applications for all verticals, especially DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, where security is top priority.\n\nDavid Tse, Co-Founder of Babylon, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to announce the launch of Babylon v0.7.1, introducing the integration of smart contracts. This marks a crucial milestone for Babylon, turning it into a powerful platform for deploying a wide range of protocols, thereby facilitating the development of decentralized applications secured by the strength of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade also paves the path to a spectacular Bitcoin-centric ecosystem. Babylon is leading the R&D of advanced scaling and security sharing protocols to fully unleash the potential of Bitcoin. Through Babylon smart contracts, the mighty power of Bitcoin will be readily at the disposal of the applications built on Babylon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBabylon recently announced the pioneering Bitcoin Staking Protocol, which enables Bitcoin the asset to be staked and used to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains. This is achieved without altering the Bitcoin blockchain nor any bridging. In return, participating Bitcoin holders can earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a research paper about Bitcoin security co-authored by co-founder of Babylon David Tse, a professor at Stanford and Ethereum 2.0 researcher, and the founder of EigenLayer Sreeram Kannan, and their colleagues. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world,. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nLearn more: https://www.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nShalini Wood\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-v0-7-1-goes-live-with-smart-contract-capabilities-and-bitcoin-security-for-dapps-728634553"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Ordinals continue to inspire new products to enter the market. The latest entrant is dubbed Bitmap Theory, an innovative\u2013and exciting\u2013way to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and the metaverse.\n\nMuch like Ordinals, which allows users to permanently inscribe individual satoshis (the minimal unit of account in a bitcoin), Bitmap offers a way for individuals to claim ownership over Bitcoin blocks. According to its pseudonymous creator, Bitoshi Blockamoto, the open-source standard could integrate any block into a part of the metaverse.\n\n\u201cBitmap is a revolution. You can now claim ownership of blocks on Bitcoin,\u201d tweeted Blockamoto. \u201cThat\u2019s prime real estate on digital gold.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea, Blockamoto said, is that not only can any Bitcoin block be inscribed, but platforms can also parse this data into the 3D realm, allowing for owners to distribute fractionalized transactions to others. This translates into users building on top of Bitcoin blocks, becoming contributors to the metaverse, and ultimately creating a vibrant community-driven space.\n\nAnnounced June 13, Bitmap Theory has already sparked an inscription frenzy in the Ordinal community over the past week, with some rushing to grab historic blocks, like the first mined by Binance, or a block that contains Silk Road transactions.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d tweeted Mark Shaw, known as 3ms.btc on Twitter. He said \u201c66924 bitmap inscriptions now. No sign of an ease off. Folks seem to get it. It\u2019s super low cost, super easy to do, available to all, all you need is an imagination.\u201d\n\niDclub, a domain service platform for Ordinals, tracks name types and the number of inscriptions made on the Bitcoin blockchain both in total as well as over a seven day period. According to the service, it took six days for .bitmap to go from non-existence on their list to reaching number two today, displacing .btc domains with over 190,000 inscriptions over the past week.\n\nThe excitement surrounding Bitmaps has some selling blocks for as much as 0.1 BTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the Bitmap landscape\u2013pun intended\u2013can be difficult to navigate, Mark Shaw has users covered, with an insightful and in-depth Twitter thread. He includes information about which blocks to inscribe, useful websites, possible use-cases, implications of the new theory, and more."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe NASDAQ-listed Bitcoin mining firm Iris Energy (IREN) announced plans on Tuesday to boost its hash rate capacity by 63% to 9.1 exahashes per second (EH/s) by early 2024.\n\nIris is in the process of building 80MW of data center space to finish off phase 1 of its 600MW site in Childress, Texas.\n\n\u201cNear-term focus remains on data center construction, whilst retaining flexibility on timing for miner purchases, which is subject to funding and market conditions,\u201d the company wrote in a press release.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince publishing its expansion plans, the company\u2019s shares have popped 21% on the day from $3.55 to $4.14, and puts Iris a whopping 247% in the green year to date.\n\nIris\u2019s current hash rate capacity is 5.6 EH/s, in line with projections from February when the firm planned to nearly triple its capacity from a relatively meager 2.0 EH/s. The firm was forced to slash its capacity by 3.6 EH/s in November, after being forced to turn off numerous machines used as collateral for $103 million in loans.\n\nThe lender behind those loans is still seeking remedies, according to Iris. During a hearing with the Supreme Court of British Columbia last week, the lender sought to ensure any profits generated by Iris through additional Bitcoin mining are used as collateral to secure its lending facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Company believes these claims are without merit,\u201d Iris said.\n\nThe mining firm is also waiting on \u201cadditional long-lead items\u201d for phase 2 of its infrastructure buildout, which \u201cis expected to \u201cunlock about 13.6 EH/s1 of data center capacity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the company\u2019s access to cheap, renewable energy and large data center capacity, Iris is even considering branching out into \u201cenergy intensive compute applications,\u201d such as artificial intelligence. Iris claimed to have put \u201csignificant time\u201d into exploring this strategy 3-4 years ago, including through a memorandum of understanding with Dell Technologies in March 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cRecent discussions with market participants have further validated this previous work and that the time may be right to expand into this sector, utilizing Iris Energy\u2019s four existing operating sites,\u201d said the firm.\n\nIn addition to Childress, Iris Energy has 3 datacenters located in British Columbia, and one in Childress, Texas, where its new expansion efforts are being focused.\n\nOther mining companies including Blockstream and CleanSpark have also announced major investments into mining capacity this year as Bitcoin\u2019s price rebounds from its post-FTX lows."

        "content": "A massive Bitcoin transaction was spotted on the blockchain recently, indicating a whale may be moving their funds into self-custody. Data shows a Bitcoin whale has withdrawn $395.8 million from Binance to an unknown wallet, a sign that may be bullish for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nMassive Bitcoin Transaction Spotted on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to the data provided by Whale Alert, a cryptocurrency transaction tracker, a whale recently transferred 15,000 BTC away from Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. At the current market price, these Bitcoins are worth around $395.878 million.\n\nThis is one of the largest single transactions involving Bitcoin that has been reported so far this year. Although the recipient address is unknown, the amount of the transaction suggests that it was likely an institutional investor or high net worth individual also known as a \u201cwhale\u201d who wanted complete control of their digital assets.\n\nHow Self-Custody Is Good For The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nIt is no new revelation that when dealing with digital assets, self-custody is the best way, especially on a large scale. By transferring from an exchange wallet into a private wallet, the whale now has sole control and responsibility over the private keys that can move the funds.\n\nFor many long term holders, this is a safer option than keeping large amounts of crypto on an exchange which could be at higher risk of hacks or scams.\n\nBTC recovers above $26,000 resistance | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhen whales make significant transactions, it can frequently cause price volatility. If this whale plans to hold their BTC long-term, it could signal confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s future value. On the other hand, if they were to sell a significant percentage of it, there would be an oversupply on the market, which would bring the price down, at least temporarily.\n\nAlso, when big players move their BTC off exchanges into self-custody wallets, it\u2019s usually a good sign for Bitcoin\u2019s price. Removing hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin from exchanges means less supply available for trading. This increases scarcity on exchanges, thereby increasing the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is now trading above $26,000 after breaking the $26,000 resistance during the weekend. With the next Bitcoin halving less than a year away, whales moving their assets into self-custody may send some ripples of bullish sentiment into the wider crypto industry.\n\nFeatured image from Coingape, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How Many Bitcoins Are There? - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Have you ever thought about how many Bitcoins exist? In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at how many Bitcoins are currently available, how the amount of Bitcoin increases over time and the implications for both miners and investors.\n\nShort Summary\n\n19.4 million Bitcoins already exist, with the remaining 8% to be released over time at a decreasing rate due to the halving process.\n\nLost and inaccessible wallets have caused a decrease in available supply, making existing Bitcoins more valuable.\n\nInstitutional investors view Bitcoin as digital gold due to its limited supply and potential for price appreciation.\n\nContents\n\nCurrent Bitcoin Supply: A Snapshot\n\nBitcoin Supply and Price over time (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/total-bitcoins, 2023)\n\nAt present, 19.4 million Bitcoins have already been mined and there are roughly 1.6 million left to go until reaching the total cap of 21 million Bitcoins. Once this ceiling is met, no new coins will be generated. The limited supply plays a major role in influencing Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nPercentage of Total Supply Mined\n\nWith approximately 92% of the Bitcoin supply now mined, these Bitcoins are held by miners, everyday users and investors alike. The remaining 8%, will be released gradually through mining rewards and will continue to be released at a decreasing rate due to the \u2018Bitcoin halving\u2019 process.\n\nFactors Affecting Bitcoin Supply\n\nThe Bitcoin halving process is an essential event that influences its supply. Every four years, the amount of Bitcoin that enters circulation through mining rewards is halved. In addition to this however, there are unclaimed and locked away wallets that hold large amounts of Bitcoin which in turn also decrease the total supply.\n\nLost Bitcoins\n\nThe total Bitcoin supply is limited due to a considerable number of Bitcoins being irretrievably lost from forgotten passwords, hardware failures and other factors. Around 20% of the world\u2019s circulating Bitcoins are estimated to be out-of-reach.\n\nBitcoin Mining Landscape\n\nThe mining landscape of Bitcoin is constantly changing, primarily due to the fluctuations in block rewards and difficulty adjustments. These dynamics have a significant impact on miners\u2019 profitability as well as the security of the Bitcoin network. As more Bitcoins are mined, the rewards decrease over time.\n\nMining Difficulty and Adjustments\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty is designed to adjust and keep a stable inflow of producing new Bitcoins based on the total computing power across its network. This means that regardless of how much fluctuation there might be in hash rates, miners are still given being rewarded for verifying transactions and securing the blockchain.\n\nBlock Rewards and Their Impact on Miners\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is sustained by block rewards and transaction fees, which are essential to miners\u2019 profitability. Bitcoin halving events can lead to a decrease in mining rewards but an increase in the digital currency\u2019s value. Hence, Bitcoin miners must tweak their business strategies to maintain profitability when their earnings from these rewards drop. Eventually, what miners earn will largely come from transaction fees instead of just Bitcoin block rewards. This shift could bring about major changes not just in the whole Bitcoin network, but also in the companies that keep it running.\n\nImplications for Bitcoin Investors\n\nBitcoin is often compared to digital gold and its limited supply means that it isn\u2019t vulnerable to the inflationary pressure of traditional fiat currencies. Many investors view Bitcoin as a store of value, providing them with an effective hedge against increasing prices (inflation) due to traditional currency devaluation. This has made it an attractive option for those looking to safeguard their wealth over time. The capped total number of coins gives added potential for price appreciation, which makes Bitcoin particularly interesting as an investment asset today.\n\nBitcoin as Digital Gold\n\nDue to its limited supply and fixed amount, Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a safe haven. Unlike central banks or governments who control physical currency, this digital resource cannot be altered making it a valuable asset seen by institutional investors as a hedge against inflation.\n\nBeyond the 21 Million Cap: The Role of Transaction Fees\n\nBitcoin transaction fee cost and price over the last 3 years (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/fees-usd-per-transaction, 2023)\n\nAs Bitcoin approaches its 21 million cap, transaction fees will become increasingly important in the system. Since block rewards are diminishing, miners must discover other means of income so that they can continue verifying transactions and providing security for the network. Transaction fees paid by users to miners motivate them to prioritise those with higher payments for faster transaction times. As these block rewards decrease over time due to a limited supply, it is even more important that alternative incentive tools are developed in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nCurrent State of Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, although currently a small portion of miners\u2019 revenue, are expected to play an increased role as block rewards decrease. The cost for Bitcoin transactions can vary wildly from being mere cents up to over $20 depending on the amount of congestion in the network and how quickly a user of the network wants their transaction be processed.\n\nAs supply dwindles for new Bitcoins, it is likely that these fee costs will become more substantial sources of income for miners instead.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin\u2019s supply of 21 million coins significantly impact, investors, traders and miners alike. Its potential for price appreciation (similar to a digital gold asset class) along with the growing impact of transaction fees due to the havening events are key components in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is essential to remain informed about these factors and their implications, so investors can benefit from what opportunities Bitcoin presents.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy can only 21 million Bitcoin exist?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin purposefully set a limited amount of this digital currency to be produced when it was first established. That total is 21 million. This serves to make sure there will always be demand for these units and adds scarcity value to them.\n\nWhat happens when 21 million Bitcoins are mined?\n\nAround the year 2140 is when all 21 million Bitcoins will be mined, bringing an end to new Bitcoin creation. From that point onward, miners\u2019 revenue streams from block rewards will halt and they must instead depend on transaction fees and other revenue sources for income.\n\nWho owns the most Bitcoin?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous inventor of Bitcoin, is believed to have the most substantial quantity of BTC. It\u2019s estimated he has 1 million coins with a total value of $27.13 billion. This makes him number one on the list when it comes to cryptocurrency whales by holdings.\n\nHow long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThe process of Bitcoin mining takes around 10 minutes for a single Bitcoin. It requires specific software and hardware, but this can be shared amongst many multiple miners, making it more accessible to everyone who wants to participate.\n\nCurrently each new block produced is awarded with 6.25 Bitcoins as a reward.\n\nHow many Bitcoins are there?\n\nThere are a whopping 19,410,450 Bitcoins in circulation as of writing this article."

        "title": "Bitcoin has reached 50% of its market dominance for the first time in 2 years - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin has reached 50% of its market dominance for the first time in 2 years\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tickers are down $26,743. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, which measures the proportion of the entire crypto market value made up of Bitcoin, has surpassed 50%.\n\nAccording to TradingView statistics, Bitcoin dominance peaked at just over 50% on June 19 at 6 p.m. UTC and fell to 49.9% at the time of publishing. This indicates that the price of Bitcoin alone accounts for half of the cryptocurrency\u2019s overall market capitalization of $1.1 trillion. According to Coingecko statistics, the current market valuation of Bitcoin is $619 billion.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s supremacy has grown significantly over the past eight months, Ether\u2019s (ETH) tickers are down $1,724. Market dominance for Ether has remained stable at around 20% for most of the year. The combined value of Bitcoin and Ether currently represents nearly 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nMichael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin supporter, expects Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance to exceed 80% in the coming years due to increased regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may lead stablecoins and other crypto assets to \u201cgo away.\u201c\n\nFurthermore, Saylor attributes the lack of significant institutional investment in the crypto market to the \u201cconfusion and anxiety\u201d caused by the presence of 25,000 other cryptocurrencies positioning themselves as substitutes for Bitcoin. He emphasizes that Bitcoin is universally recognized as the digital commodity in the industry, being the only cryptocurrency designated as a commodity by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The SEC has classified 68 cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nAccording to the Cointelegraph Price Index, Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,746, representing a 1.5% increase in the past 24 hours. Despite the \u201cfear\u201d in the crypto market reaching a three-month high, the value of Bitcoin has risen by over.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Why Petronas should start mining Bitcoin - Free Malaysia Today",
        "content": "Petronas has a problem.\n\nIts CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik didn\u2019t pull any punches when he said that Petronas\u2019 golden days of oil refining profits are over, saying its financial performance will fall short of last year\u2019s.\n\nIn addition to its projected profitability, Petronas also reported that it achieved a 10.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 18.7% reduction in flaring and venting emissions. This might sound good, but it is not nearly enough to meet its net zero goals.\n\nWhat if in one fell swoop, Petronas could boost profitability and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Let\u2019s see how Petronas can achieve this.\n\nWhen a company drills for oil, it often doesn\u2019t just find an oil well that can be tapped into. There is usually an abundance of trapped natural gas that accompanies the oil. However, in most instances, it is not economical to capture this natural gas as, unlike oil, which can be packed in barrels and transported across the world, natural gas requires a pipeline.\n\nAnd since many oil wells are in remote locations or off-shore, especially Malaysia\u2019s, it makes little economic sense to build an infrastructure of pipelines to route this natural gas. So to get rid of this natural gas (which if unvented, could result in explosions due to the high pressure it exerts), most oil wells flare it, meaning they burn it off. This is an obscene waste of natural resources.\n\nHere\u2019s a highly combustible, energy-rich stream of gas that could power the homes and lives of millions. But instead of using it, oil companies around the world are burning it off. They burn it instead of letting it vent as natural gas is methane-rich, a greenhouse gas 80 times more detrimental to the environment than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.\n\nThe World Bank, which thinks this problem is acute, estimates that the roughly 10,000 gas flares around the world can power all of sub-Saharan Africa. To mitigate this, it has started a Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative to end all flaring activities by 2030.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s realistically no way this is going to happen with how things are progressing now, as the chart below illustrates:\n\nAs can be seen, even as flaring intensity has decoupled very slightly from oil production, we\u2019re nowhere near close to ending flaring, and especially not before 2030.\n\nAnd Malaysia is one of the largest contributors to this flaring, as can be seen from the chart below from The World Bank:\n\nBut what if there was now a way to put all this wasted natural gas to good use? What if we could end flaring once and for all while creating economic value?\n\nEnter Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol uses energy to create monetary value. It is energy agnostic, meaning it is happy to gobble up any and all types of energy, irrespective of its origin and source. And most importantly, the machines needed for Bitcoin mining are modular, mobile, can be scaled up and down depending on need and can be placed right at the source of the energy.\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin mining is a fantastic solution to the problem of gas flaring. Instead of wasting the gas by just venting or flaring it, it can be fed into a generator and used to power Bitcoin mining rigs, which will convert it into Bitcoin. And with one Bitcoin worth around RM120,000, this is a lucrative activity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a novel idea.\n\nBrent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh, two Texas collegemates, were so gripped by the potential of Bitcoin to solve the problem of flared gas that they created a company called Giga Energy to address it.\n\nGiga does exactly what this article outlines \u2013 it places a shipping container full of thousands of Bitcoin miners on an oil well and routes the natural gas into generators that convert the gas into electricity to power the miners.\n\nAccording to Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems, this process reduces carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions by a huge 63% compared with flaring. Additionally, Bitcoin mining is a boost to the bottom line of the company\n\nIn 2021 alone, Giga Energy, still a startup in its infancy, made US$4 million, thanks to striking deals with more than 20 oil and gas companies to supply them with Bitcoin mining rigs to solve their gas flaring problem. Thanks to its continued success and traction, it raised a US$10 million Series A funding round just a few months ago.\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of time before many oil and gas companies wake up to the fact that Bitcoin mining is great for the environment, their ESG rating and their bottom line. So, Petronas has the opportunity to be a pioneer in the industry in the region if it starts now, and not wait to follow others.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that Petronas has the foresight and fortitude to strike a bold new path for itself.\n\nThe writer can be contacted at [email protected].\n\nStay current - Follow FMT on WhatsApp, Google news and Telegram WhatsApp Google News Telegram\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT."

        "content": "As Andrew Tate currently faces accusations of rape, human trafficking, and organized crime for the purpose of sexual exploitation of women in Romania, information has leaked that the country\u2019s prosecutors have seized a substantial amount of his assets in Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAlthough the original reports said that the seizures reached $300 million, this information has now proven to be incorrect and the result of a Google Translate error used in translating a press release from the Romanian authorities in which they shared the details of Tate\u2019s indictment and which many news outlets shared on June 20.\n\nHalf a million in Bitcoin seized\n\nSpecifically, the prosecutors did, in fact, seize a large amount of Bitcoin belonging to the social media personality and former professional kickboxer, but this amount was not in the hundreds of millions but closer to $560,000, or approximately 21 BTC, in addition to 15 luxury cars, 14 watches, as well as 15 properties and shares in four companies.\n\nFurthermore, according to a press release from the Office of Information and Public Relations within the Romanian Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, the indictment covers four defendants, including Tate\u2019s brother Tristan, who now face trial under house arrest.\n\nMr. Blockchain\n\nAs Finbold reported in March, there is currently no precise information on Tate\u2019s crypto possessions, but two months after his widely publicized arrest in Romania in December 2022, the local police had seized nearly $500,000 worth of Bitcoin from him and his brother Tristan\u2019s crypto wallets, which is close to the amount seized recently.\n\nShortly before his arrest, Andrew Tate appeared on Anthony Pompliano\u2019s Bitcoin podcast, where he touted the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset as removing the disadvantages of fiat transactions, declaring he was \u201cgoing fully crazy mister blockchain now\u201d and boasting of turning \u201c600 grand to $12 million,\u201d as Finbold reported in December."
