        "title": "Why Did Bitcoin Drop 12% This Week? - Investopedia",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin dropped below $26,000 this week amid decreased activity in the market, the growing crisis in China's property sector, and a report that SpaceX has sold at least some of its bitcoin holdings.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS The bitcoin price has become susceptible to wilder price swings as trading volumes on exchanges have declined and large trades are able to have a greater impact.\n\nSpaceX, of which Elon Musk is CEO, reportedly sold at least part of its bitcoin holdings.\n\nConcerns over the issues with China\u2019s property market leading to a greater economic decline indicate bitcoin may still be viewed as a risk-on asset.\n\nHeightened Price Volatility On Decreased Trading Volume\n\nReports from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode and crypto firm Coinshares point to a general lack of interest in the crypto market as a contributing factor to this week's bitcoin price decline. While bitcoin opened the week trading around the $29,400 level, it was down to roughly $25,697 by mid-Friday.\n\nTradingView\n\nNotably, the report from Glassnode covered the extreme level of apathy and exhaustion in the bitcoin market on Monday, three days before the majority of the price decline took place. The report also warned, \u201c[O]n a shorter timeframe, it could be argued to be a slightly top heavy market, with many price sensitive investors at risk of falling into an unrealized loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the report from Coinshares, which was released on Friday, the connection between lower trading volumes on trusted exchanges and increased price volatility for bitcoin was explained.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, volatility has decreased, reaching levels comparable to the all-time lows observed at the start of the year,\u201d wrote Coinshares head of research James Butterfill in the report. \u201cHistorically, such levels have often marked turning points for significant price swings, either upward or downward,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Coinshares indicated the sharpness of the decline in the bitcoin price on Thursday night was amplified by the unwinding of a large number of long positions in the bitcoin futures markets on various exchanges.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, bitcoin traders liquidated about $1 billion in bets over the past 24 hours alone.\n\nDid Elon Musk Have Something To Do With Bitcoin's Drop?\n\nThere could have been another trigger\u2014the perception that Elon Musk's space exploration company was getting out of bitcoin. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX had marked down its bitcoin holdings to $373 million and sold the crypto asset.\n\nIn the past, the Tesla (TSLA) CEO's tweets have impacted prices of certain cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins such as Dogecoins.\n\nCoinshares also cautioned investors to keep an eye on Musk's moves as they tend to impact the bitcoin market.\n\n\n\nIs Bitcoin Still a Risk-on Asset?\n\nIn terms of specific events that may have led to increased downward pressure on the bitcoin price, some market commentators have pointed to China\u2019s Evergrande Group filing for bankruptcy. \u201cUnrelated risk-on assets such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are feeling the impact [from the Evergrande fallout],\u201d said crypto trading platform PrimeXBT.\n\n\n\nWhile bitcoin is commonly referred to as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and an aspirational hedge against economic turmoil, the reality is the crypto asset often falls along with other risk-on assets at times of uncertainty, as was the case at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThat said, Coinshares views a potential full-blown economic crisis as a possible boon for bitcoin. \u201cWhile we consider a full financial meltdown unlikely, should it transpire, it might bolster Bitcoin, especially if the repercussions permeate the broader financial sector,\u201d wrote in its recent report.\n\n\n\nBut the week was not all rough. Coinbase\u2019s regulatory approval for offering crypto futures trading in the U.S. was a bright spot for the crypto markets this week.\n\nCoinshares also stated that the market may be coming to terms with the fact that an approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, most notably from BlackRock (BLK), may not be arriving as quickly as the market originally anticipated."

        "content": "A new wave of volatility is rippling through the crypto world, ending a period of recent summer slumber for investors in digital currencies.\n\nThe price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled as much as 9% Thursday and briefly dropped below $26,000, the biggest one-day change in the world\u2019s largest digital currency this year. It is down 8% over the last 24 hours as of 11:30 a.m. ET time Friday.\n\nInvestors sold $489 million in bitcoin futures over a 24-hour period, the largest single-day liquidation since June 2022, according to data provider Coinalyze.\n\nMarket watchers grasped at several theories for the sudden downward movement. Some pointed to news from The Wall Street Journal that Elon Musk's SpaceX had reportedly written down the value of its crypto holdings in 2021 and 2022 and sold those holdings.\n\nOthers pointed to fears of a worsening macroeconomic outlook that might dampen appetite for riskier assets, citing the bankruptcy filing of Chinese property developer Evergrande as well as the possibility that the Federal Reserve could hold interest rates higher for longer.\n\n\"The next week or two is going to be extremely important for this asset class,\" Matt Maley, chief market strategist with Miller Tabak + Co., said in a Friday note, pointing to both the \"higher-for-longer\" outlook at the Fed and \"forced selling\" in the crypto derivatives market as contributors to bitcoin\u2019s sharp drop.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high point came in 2021 when it surged to $68,789 during an industry boom triggered by a period of low interest rates and fiscal stimulus that put excess savings in the pockets of investors. The market crashed in 2022 as the giant crypto exchange FTX collapsed, before making a surprise comeback during the early half of 2023.\n\nBitcoin surged to a record high in 2021 before crashing in 2022. It staged a comeback during the first half of the year and is now entering a new period of volatility. (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx) (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\nInvestors will be watching to see whether bitcoin can remain above its next key support level of $25,000. Such a move below that point would prove \u201cbearish\u201d for the crypto market and possibly \"something that could be signaling some more declines in other risk assets in the days and weeks ahead,\" Maley said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe industry still faces legal and regulatory scrutiny that could also influence prices. Since the beginning of 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged 17 different crypto actors with violating securities laws, including several exchanges that allow investors to trade digital currencies as well as individual issuers of digital tokens.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s core assertion in many of these cases is that cryptocurrencies are securities, and therefore should be registered with the agency.\n\nThe courts thus far have not been clear on how digital currencies should be treated.\n\nAnalisa Torres, a US judge in the Southern District of New York, said on July 13 that a digital token issued by Ripple Labs was a security only when it was sold to institutional investors, and not when it was purchased by the general public. The SEC had also sued Ripple for selling unregistered securities.\n\nThen July 31, US judge Jed Rakoff disagreed with that specific view in his case, in which the SEC has alleged stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs sold unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC is expected to file its motion to appeal the ruling by Torres as early as today.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization came back into rare, volatile form on Thursday evening, dropping off a cliff\u2014and pulling the rest of the crypto market with it.\n\nIn the past day, Bitcoin is down almost 8%, nose-diving from just above $29,000 to a low of approximately $25,400. At the time of publication, the cryptocurrency has partially rebounded, trading above $26,000.\n\nBitcoin, though, was not the hardest hit in the crypto selloff. Among the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, XRP, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash stood out for even greater drops. XRP was down about 13%, Litecoin 13.6%, and Bitcoin about 10% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market has declined about 6.6%, more than either the Nasdaq or S&P 500, which are down 2.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Approximately $60 billion has evaporated from the total cryptocurrency market cap in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe sudden floor falling out of the crypto market follows an unusual period of stability, as Bitcoin traded near $30,000 for more than a month after rallying in the wake of a flurry of applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs, most notably from BlackRock, in June.\n\nWhile the reasons for Bitcoin\u2019s drop aren\u2019t immediately apparent, the larger macroeconomic outlook has looked queasy in the past week, especially given recent concerns over the spiraling of China\u2019s state-owned property developers. The selloff is not, per initial reports, the result of hundreds of millions in Bitcoin sales from Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\n\u201cWhile the dip might appear sudden, it was precipitated by a combination of events that contributed to the decline,\u201d James Butterfill, head of research at digital assets investment firm CoinShares, recently wrote. He pointed to a number of probable causes, including concern over China\u2019s economic outlook, low Bitcoin trading volumes, and the continuing weight of regulatory actions on the market.\n\nDespite the recent downturn in the crypto market and Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is still riding high after starting the year at less than $17,000. Even after its sudden dip, Bitcoin is still up more than 56% year to date."

        "content": "On this week's episode of The Crypto Mile, our host Brian McGleenon spoke with Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin expert and co-founder of the digital asset security firm, Casa. The conversation centred on the longstanding concerns about the concentration of Bitcoin's mining hashrate within China. The hashrate is a measure of the amount of computational power that Bitcoin miners are utilising to process transactions and safeguard the network. A higher hashrate value signifies more processor chips are being used to mine new bitcoin and verify transactions on the network. Lopp discussed the potential risk of a \"51% attack\" if China gained control of over half the global mining power. He discussed the possibility of the Chinese government launching such an attack, which could effectively shut-down the Bitcoin network.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: Today on \"The Crypto Mile,\" I am joined by Jameson Lopp, respected Bitcoin expert and co-founder of Bitcoin security firm, Casa. Today we're going to chat about the significant concentration of Bitcoin mining output within China, and the possibility of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network emerging from the country. Imagine someone going into a bank and having the power to rewrite whatever figures they wanted in to everyone's bank account. Jameson, welcome to this week's episode of \"The Crypto Mile.\"\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Glad to be here.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: So Jameson, can you explain to us the present situation for Bitcoin and crypto within China? I thought using Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining were both banned in the country, but that may not be so.\n\nJAMESON LOPP: The general sentiment and agreement seems to be that participating in exchange and trade activities around Bitcoin and crypto seems to be banned. Mining also seems to be banned. The last I heard and my understanding is that it is not outright illegal to actually own Bitcoin, but most of the activities around Bitcoin are considered to be illegal.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: OK, so if we're talking about Bitcoin mining, that has a connection with the hash rate, and the hash rate is the amount of calculations that go into keeping the consensus mechanism of the blockchain intact. And if the hash power goes up that means more miners are mining to try and acquire new Bitcoin to put onto the network. What is the market share of hash rate that China has at this moment in time?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Right. It's been all over the place. If I recall correctly, I think it peaked in 2019, and there was around 75% of global hash rate in China. Now, in 2021, that's when we saw the biggest crackdowns and I think the harshest proclamations by government entities basically saying, you know, you need to stop doing this.\n\nAnd 2021, that summer was actually very interesting because over the span of a few weeks, the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network actually got cut in half. And over the next 6 months, the latter half of 2021, we saw that hash rate come completely back online. And what it seemed to be happening was that a large portion of those miners that were operating in China basically turned off their machines, moved them to other more friendly jurisdictions, turned them back on.\n\nLast I checked at the moment, the United States seems to be doing pretty well. I think probably has around 40% of the global hash rate mainly as a result of our more friendly jurisdictions and having a lot of cheap energy in places like Texas and the Northwest with a lot of hydropower.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: Should we be concerned that China has such-- has this kind of majority of the hash rate?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Pretty much all of the silicon manufacturing, the actual chips that are used in miners are produced in China. So while, you know, China currently doesn't have an overwhelming hash rate, if something changes and it becomes, you know, slightly more friendly again for miners in China, it would not be at all difficult for the hash rate in China to reach new highs.\n\nAnd that's just because they have that direct supply. And when it comes to mining, time is money. If you have to ship your hardware to other countries, you know, every day those machines are in transit, you're essentially losing potential profit. Could China come back and be a dominant force? Sure. But I think for the same reasons that we haven't seen any aberrant activity on the network, even when China had a super majority of hash rate is the same reasons why we wouldn't have to worry about that in the future.\n\nAnd it really comes down to incentives. And that really is know why would miners attack the network? That would cause, you know, massive undermining of confidence in the network and it would probably greatly reduce the current value of the Bitcoin holdings of those miners who tend to hold a lot of Bitcoin and also, of course, effect the future potential profits of it.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: It would be very difficult because of that decentralized nature that you spoke about for the Chinese government to kind of seize mining operators across the country. But let's dive into the potential of the 51% attack. Can you kind of explain the possibility and the severity of such an attack on the network, and what does a 51% attack mean?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: It basically means that if you have even slightest majority of global network hash rate, then you really get to decide which blocks are added to the blockchain. Now, you don't get to decide arbitrarily what the rules of the protocol are. You still have to follow the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Otherwise, the tens of thousands of validating nodes around the world will simply reject whatever block that you put out on the network.\n\nBut it does mean that you can do a few things that would be extremely annoying. You could, you know, consider it like a denial of service attack. From an incentives perspective, if it was sort of a profit motivated 51% attack, then generally what you would want to do is re-spend your own money.\n\nYou know, you can't spend other people's money, you can't create money out of thin air that the protocol doesn't allow, but what you can do is you can send a transaction, get something in return, and then you can basically roll back that block. You can kind of undo the transaction history and make it as if that transaction never happened, therefore getting your money back into your wallet and then being able to spend it elsewhere.\n\nNow, the other thing that you could do is simply not allow any transactions to go through, or you could say only whitelisted transactions that I approve of can go through. And so you know, that's what you would probably expect from a more authoritarian nation state attack, where they probably are not as motivated from a profit perspective, but they just want to try to kill the network and make it unusable.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: So like looking at Bitcoin at the moment, there's been a lot of institutional interest. We've got the different spot Bitcoin ETF filings. Do you see the institutional interest as a good thing or a bad thing when it comes to crypto and just decentralization, and I suppose the tenants of Satoshi's Whitepaper, in general?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: The vast majority of wealth in the traditional financial system is pretty concentrated, and it's generally in the hands of the institutions that seem to be making a play for these ETFs and trying to grab market share from this new financial industry. So you know, I would expect that the result of this, you know, sure, it will help, you know, mainstream this sector of the economy, but it will also result in the ownership wealth and potentially power dynamics becoming more centralized.\n\nSo this is something that I've been fighting against for the past eight years now. Trying to promote self-custody with individuals holding their own keys is that it's quite clear to me the convenience of letting a trusted third-party like a financial institution hold your money for you, for most people that outweighs the idea of being able to manage your own assets and, of course, all of the responsibility that comes along with that.\n\nSo I've just been-- I've been trying to increase the convenience factor for people to be able to hold their own keys, to be sovereign. You know, take advantage of the unique attributes of these systems that I expect most people will throw out the window, either because they just don't understand them or because it's not presented to them as an option because the incentives are not really there for these large financial institutions to promote people to hold their own money and to not use the institution itself.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: I suppose we're conditioned to trust custodians to look after our wealth. Is there not a liquidity concern here if we're going to use Bitcoin as an equivalent to fiat currencies?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Yeah, it's kind of the question of, you know, will Bitcoin ever get to the point where it's actually usable as a unit of account? And that's, you know, a big open question. You know, myself as a technologist, I've said for a long time that price stability or lack of volatility or whatever, that is not even a goal of the Bitcoin protocol. It has no knowledge of its own value. It is a, you know, fully self-contained system. And the value that we ascribe to it is, of course, happening on markets and in other places, where we're tying Bitcoin to other assets and trading them.\n\nSo I think a lot of people would say if it becomes big enough, it will become stable. There will never be any guarantee of stability, and the really tricky thing and I think what people-- some people are starting to realize over the past few years is there really is no such thing as stability. You know, every asset, every currency, the value of everything is relative to everything else. And there's so many different variables at play that I think even the idea that you can, quote-unquote, \"stabilize\" the value of anything is pretty ridiculous.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: I suppose we have a precedent anyway we can go back to, and that was the gold standard. But looking at Bitcoin, is it truly decentralized or, you know, considering that the amount of hash power is controlled by such a small group of mining operators worldwide, can we really say that that's a decentralized network?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Decentralization can be measured in many different ways. As I mentioned earlier, there are tens of thousands of nodes that are validating, essentially auditing the protocol, the blockchain, making sure that everybody is following the rules. They in a sense counterbalance the miners to make sure that the miners are following the rules.\n\nIt is distributing the power so that no one has control over the network. You know, this is the problem with the fiat system with a lot of traditional hierarchical-based systems is that power concentrates at the top. You know, we literally create these pyramid-type structures, but that just doesn't apply to Bitcoin. It's actually this system of anarchy, where there are rules, but there are no set rulers.\n\nAnd it's trying to understand the power balance and how things can change or, you know, who can stop who from doing what turns into a really lengthy discussion that we actually spent many years arguing about during the scaling wars. All that we really know is that Bitcoin seems to be decentralized enough for the current state of the world and the various powers that would like for it to cease to exist.\n\nAnd we can never really know for sure if it is decentralized enough to withstand the next level of attack. We should expect that attacks will continue to happen, especially, you know, if this ecosystem continues to go more mainstream and threatens more of the authorities around the world. And as those attacks come in, those of us like myself who are paying attention and who care and who want to protect the system will come together and discuss, you know, what needs to be done to try to fight against this attack.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: Well, Jameson, thanks very much for coming on this week's episode of \"The Crypto Mile.\" It's been great talking to you.\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Thanks for having me.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"

        "title": "Stocks today: Bitcoin tumbles, options expiration - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is continuing to tumble following a selloff that started Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, options expiration is adding some volatility to the trading day. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the market action.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Bitcoin has recovered slightly after briefly dipping below the $20,000 mark, following reports that Elon Musk's SpaceX had offloaded the cryptocurrency. Another event you need to keep your eye on today, a major options expiry. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins us from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to really connect the two and break it all down for us. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I think the big question in crypto is is there a whale selling right now? It would appear so. Bitcoin has been relatively quiet recently. And let's go to the YFi Interactive and chart the recent price action. Here, we can see Bitcoin down 7.44% over the last 24 hours. And here is a three month chart. And I was standing here yesterday afternoon close to the close, just remarking how it had come down to the bottom of this channel.\n\nAnd we were looking for a potential rebound that did not happen. There was just a washout all the way down to about $25,000, which happens to be above the three-month low. Let's take a look at the year to date chart. We had what could be considered a bullish flag here, but that is out the window. We just have more choppiness inside this range. And there are a lot of expectations when Bitcoin first headed north of $30,000 and then again thinking, well, we're going to get some continuation to the upside.\n\nBut there's just huge overhead supply there. And apparently, it was too much for the market. I will show you the high coincided with this overhead supply-- this giant, giant top right here. So still got some things to work through. And now, the onus is on the bears to prove the case because the bulls apparently have given up a little bit. But one of the things I've been tracking this week, and in fact over the last two weeks, has been the fringier parts of the market, including Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm going to go to my leaders page here on the YFi Interactive. You can see for the day, BITO, that's the Bitcoin ETF. That is down the most, followed by Chinese internet ETF, KWEB. But over the last five days, we've seen meme stocks and Bitcoin really be two of the big losers this week. Why is that? I think because August was expected to be and it has turned out to be a relatively bearish month. We're expecting this to go sideways for the next few months. We also have increasing volatility into September and October.\n\nSo given the gains that we've seen year to date, we were ripe for this situation. The big question is, what happens next? And that kind of leads me into the next topic you mentioned, which was options expiration. What's going on in the options market? Here, I have the S&P 500. You can see we're in the midst of this 5% correction right now. By the way, that's not even-- well that is more than half of the correction we saw due to the regional bank crisis. That was about 9% or so. And we're just looking at 5% right here.\n\nBut you take a look at the VIX. The VIX is picking up. And an analysis by Jefferies out today or yesterday said the pain trade now is decisively to the downside. We saw the Bank of America fund manager survey come out this week, where we saw the least amount of bearishness since February of last year. That was before the Fed kicked off its huge interest rate raising campaign.\n\nAnd so you put all this together, it looks like the bulls have something to prove in this market. And they really haven't for some time. It's been more or less a glide path on the way up. So for substantial correction in a while, we have OpEx this morning. Index options have expired on the open. And now we're waiting until after the close, those last prints of the day, for individual options to expire. There is a lot of put buying, a lot of protection buying coming into this.\n\nPut-to-call ratios, they soared this week. So so much for those zero days to expiration, that phenomenon, and so much for those calls that everybody was buying before. It's all about protection now, guys.\n\n- I'm sure that's what everyone is enthusiastically talking about behind you on the floor here this morning.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: I have no idea what's going on here but--\n\n- I don't know. People are glad it's Friday. I know I am. Maybe that's what's going on. Jared, thank you so much. Appreciate it."

But as the applications piled up, US regulators repeatedly declined to approve one, citing the risk of fraud and market manipulation in cryptocurrency markets.\n\n\n\nBut with the entrance of BlackRock Inc. into the race, many market watchers are hopeful that one or more spot-Bitcoin ETFs will finally get the go-ahead. After all, the world\u2019s largest asset manager has a strong track record of getting funds past regulatory roadblocks. On this week\u2019s episode of the What Goes Up podcast, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence join to discuss how BlackRock\u2019s application dramatically changes the outlook for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen they filed, it was a whole different ballgame in my opinion,\u201d says Balchunas. \u201cThe fact is they generally like to bring a gun to a knife fight. This is a firm who doesn\u2019t like to lose, who knows what they're doing, and they must see something.\u201d"

Before a more meaningful rally started, Bitcoin finished the year +59% from the level of the devaluation,\u201d explained Thielen.\n\nWhale's selling big\n\nWhile there were many other news events that could bear responsibility, pseudonymous derivatives trader TheFlowHorse told Cointelegraph that the sudden move down could have resulted from a single large actor making a big sell, which then resulted in further pressure on derivatives.\n\n\u201cIt was not just a natural cascade. Someone big bailed for a purpose and set it in motion. Spot volume barely compared to perps.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from the crypto analytics platform Coinglass, more than $427 million in Bitcoin long positions were liquidated in the four hours to time of publication. Over the course of the last 24 hours, there had been more than $822 million in liquidations for traders with open long positions \u2014 a bet that the price of crypto assets would move upwards.\n\nMore than $427 million worth of Bitcoin long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. Source: Coinglass\n\nDescribing much of the explanations for the decline as \u201cpure speculation,\u201d Horse suggested that since the reports of the SEC hinting its approval of an Ethereum Futures ETF came moments after the dump \u2014 a large fund may have offloaded their Bitcoin position to \u201ctrigger a cascade to buy ETH.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price briefly dips below $26K, falling to two-month lows\n\nBitcoin had recovered slightly since the crash, gaining 1.2% in two hours, according to data from TradingView. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was changing hands for $26,619.\n\nIts price seems to have been buoyed by news that the SEC may look to approve an Ethereum Futures ETF product as soon as October.\n\nDeposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

The bullish case for Bitcoin is that positive developments with an US Bitcoin ETF breakthrough could help prices make a run back towards the $30,000 region. Bitcoin\u2019s current downtrend however could get uglier if some of these rulings suggest a US ETF still remains distant or if the bond market selloff continues.\n\nBitcoin is once again acting like a risky asset and next week should be critical for Bitcoin.

Last year, the company disclosed that it sold most of its bitcoin holdings after acquiring it in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the WSJ report, which cited SpaceX financial documents, the price of bitcoin plunged about 8% to about $26,500, and has since further decline to about $26,200.

        "content": "Watch: Could China shut down the Bitcoin network? | The Crypto Mile\n\nChina-based cryptocurrency miners have the potential to regain dominance over the bitcoin network. Yahoo Finance talked to an expert about the risks this would present for the world's largest digital asset.\n\nOn this week's episode of The Crypto Mile, Yahoo Finance UK spoke with Jameson Lopp, bitcoin expert and co-founder of digital asset security firm Casa. The conversation centred on the longstanding concerns about the concentration of bitcoin's (BTC-USD) mining hash-rate within China.\n\n\"An authoritarian nation-state, like China, could conduct an attack that would kill the bitcoin network and make it temporarily unusable,\" Lopp told Yahoo Finance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Sovereign agents: Your own personal AI assistant? | The Crypto Mile\n\nSuch an attack would manifest as a \"51% attack\", where a single entity gains control of over more than half of the bitcoin hashrate, enabling them to control the verification of transactions and the mining of new bitcoins.\n\n\"An authoritarian style 51% attack on the bitcoin network, from say the Chinese government, could come in the form of not allowing any transactions to happen on the network, or only allowing white-listed transactions to go through,\" Lopp added.\n\nThe bitcoin hashrate\n\nThe hashrate is a measure of the amount of computational power that bitcoin miners are utilising to process transactions and safeguard the network. A higher hashrate signifies more processing chips are being used to mine new bitcoin and verify transactions on the network.\n\nChina recently dominated the world's share of the bitcoin hashrate. And, according to Jameson Lopp, this dominance is something they could quickly regain.\n\nRead more: Institutional investment brings new momentum to crypto\n\n\"In 2019, about 75% of global hash-rate was coming out of China. But, 2021 saw the Chinese government's biggest crackdown on bitcoin mining. The hashrate was cut in half, and many miners went to friendlier jurisdictions,\" Lopp said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe added that despite the Chinese government ban, there are still many miners spread across the vast country. According to recent data from Statistica, Chinese miners still control 21% of current bitcoin mining output. The US maintains the largest share, at 35.4%.\n\nCould China regain mining dominance?\n\nThere are still concerns over China's ability to regain its former dominant position. \"Nearly all of the silicon chips used in bitcoin mining are produced in China,\" Lopp said. Re-routing this supply to domestic miners would deny those overseas access to new hardware, giving Chinese miners a competitive advantage.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin rallies to $30,000 after BlackRock's ETF filing\n\nThese silicon chips are called ASICs, and are tailored for a single, specific task. In the case of bitcoin mining, this is solving the cryptographic puzzles required to mine the digital asset and verify transactions.\n\n\"While China doesn't have an overwhelming hashrate, if something changes and it becomes a slightly more friendly place again for miners, China could dominate the network,\" Lopp said.\n\n\"If regulations ease in China, they have the tools at hand to quickly reach new zeniths in mining,\" he added.\n\nWatch: Institutional investment brings new momentum to the crypto-space | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "After bottoming out at a two-month low of around US$25,400, Bitcoin recovered some losses on Friday morning in Asia to trade around US$26,800. Ether also fell dramatically to a low of around US$1,550 before rebounding to just under the US$1,700 line. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos logged losses as macroeconomic factors \u2014 including the depreciation of the Chinese yuan and the bankruptcy of Chinese property giant Evergrande \u2014 hit investor sentiment. Overall, investors liquidated US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, driving the total market capitalization to the edge of the psychologically important US$1 trillion threshold.\n\nXRP led the losers, after a U.S. judge granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to file a motion to appeal the recent favorable ruling for Ripple Labs regarding retail sales of token XRP. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped but a rise in transactions continued. U.S. stock futures steadied after Wall Street closed lower on Thursday. The release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting continues to fuel concerns of more monetary tightening ahead\n\nBitcoin, Ether slide after giving up key support levels\n\nBitcoin slid 7.02% in the last 24 hours to US$26,819.27 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 8.88%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on early Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDuring late US / early Asia trading volumes, Bitcoin prices broke the critical support level at US$28,000. We knew a crash (or sharp decline) could be coming,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of crypto research at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cRealized volatility had hit 18%; the last time volatility was this low, in November 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day realized volatility spiked to over 100% as prices crashed by 46%. In Bitcoin, sharp price declines have often followed low volatility periods. We are not predicting such a significant decline but expected, at least, a -13% decline (so far, prices are down -10%).\u201d\n\nThere is also the looming shadow of macro risks to consider, added Thielen.\n\n\u201cThe biggest is a potential devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, trading at the weakest level since 2007. In August 2015, when China devalued the Yuan for the last time, Bitcoin prices declined by -23% during the two weeks following the devaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding to the bearish sentiment in Bitcoin, a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal showed Elon Musk-founded rocket company SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by a total of US$373 million in the past two years.\n\n\u201cThis is really a past event (but) it is still news and investors understandably saw this as a bearish catalysis on top of macro moves,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 5.64% to US$1,706.22 and lost 7.80% for the past seven days, after reaching a five-month low of US$1,551.71 on early Friday morning.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower.\n\nCryptocurrencies saw a total liquidation of US$1 billion over the past 12 hours, with US$812.67 million of long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise \u2014 wiped out, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers, plunging 12.52% to US$0.5136 for a weekly loss of 18.85%.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC\u2019s request to appeal an earlier summary judgement in favor of Ripple.\n\nIn June, Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws, while its sales to institutional investors did. The ruling was seen as a partial victory notched by Ripple. The SEC first sued the company in December 2020 for offering unregistered digital asset securities \u2014 an allegation Ripple denies.\n\n\u201cThe request for appeal (even if granted) doesn\u2019t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s not up for debate / trial,\u201d said Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nReminder \u2013 the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn\u2019t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s not up for debate / trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That\u2019s utter nonsense. 1/2 https://t.co/pG7z0jsjlt \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 16, 2023\n\nAccording to Thursday\u2019s court filing, the SEC will file a motion for appeal on Friday, and Ripple has until September 1 to file its opposition papers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 5.69% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion \u2014 close to the psychologically important US$1 trillion threshold \u2014 while trading volume surged 78.91% to US$60.58 billion.\n\nA bad day for NFTs despite all time transactions high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.37% in the past 24 hours to 2,445.03 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 2.28% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana NFT indexes logged gains, while the indexes for Polygon and Cardano dropped.\n\nWreck League, an NFT video game backed by Hong Kong-based gaming company Animoca Brands, launched its NFT mint on early Friday in Asia. But the collection has unperformed, struggling to sell more than a third of its offerings so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good day for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cIf anyone is wondering if traders are out of liquidity or conviction in the space, this just might be the answer.\u201d\n\nThe collection\u2019s struggles will impact on the wider market, Petscher added, as traders will look at Wreck League and lose confidence in other collections\u2019 ability to sell.\n\nDespite Wreck League\u2019s struggles, total NFT trading volume rose 30.97% in the past 24 hours to over US$18.69 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum and BNB Chain rose, while Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains posted declines.\n\nDaily NFT transactions on Thursday surpassed Wednesday\u2019s record to hit another all-time-high of over 649,000. Those totals eclipsed the previous high of 595,000 logged on Feb. 25, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the average NFT sales price stood at US$26.26, about one tenth of the average price for NFTs on Feb. 25, 2022. That crop signals \u201ca major change in the NFT ecosystem,\u201d according to Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe NFT space is in the midst of having a shift in its identity, moving to high volume, low dollar sales, and this is exactly what will eventually lead NFTs to mass adoption,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cWill this be enough to start attracting mainstream attention though? I think not quite yet, but we\u2019re getting much closer to that with realistic prices and recognizable brands,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the rise in transactions, NFT sellers lost over US$1.91 million in Thursday trading, the biggest loss since July 20.\n\nAs NFTs attract more institutional interest, McDonald\u2019s Corporation\u2019s Singapore branch has teamed up with local entertainment company Bandwagon Labs for an NFT project based on the fast food chain\u2019s Grimace character.\n\nAnd it's live! #GRIMACE, a classic McDonaldland character brought into the modern world of digital collectibles. Minted within the @McDonalds app which millions call their happy place. Powered by Bandwagon Labs with artwork from @TheHiddenWalls. Stay tuned for the mint! \u26a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Z5U5T2sE8Z \u2014 Bandwagon Labs (@BandwagonLabs) August 17, 2023\n\nThe mint of 2,000 Grimace-themed NFTs will go live on August 21. The NFTs are free to claim using the McDonald\u2019s mobile app in Singapore, but cannot then be transferred to other wallets.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 367.71% to over US$2.22 million as its floor price dropped 11% in the past seven days.\n\nEthereum-based DeGods and Mythos Chain-based DMarket took the second and third places in terms of daily sales volumes.\n\nUS rate hike murmurs as China strife deepens\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 2:00 p.m. in Hong Kong with the Dow up and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logging gains. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower at close of trading on Thursday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nIn the U.S., jobless claims fell 4.4% to 239,000 for the week ending August 12. The weekly figure is lower than economist expectations, pointing to a consistently tight labor market. That could open the door to further interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cThe labor markets are not imploding,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at financial market research firm FWDBONDS, told Reuters. \u201cThe economy may be heating up instead of cooling down as the monetary medicine of higher 5.5% interest rates is not slowing aggregate demand like the economics textbooks say it should.\u201d\n\nThe hot labor market data arrived after the U.S. Federal Reserve released its July meeting minutes on Wednesday.\n\nThe minutes show that \u201cmost participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\u201d Two participants indicated they \u201cfavored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal.\u201d\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nMeanwhile, China Evergrande Group filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court on Thursday. The Chinese real estate developer first defaulted on U.S. dollar bond repayments in December 2021 amid China\u2019s property debt crisis.\n\nBeyond the ailing property industry, Chinese authorities reportedly told state-owned banks to ramp up currency market intervention this week. That followed a slide in the value of offshore Chinese yuan to below 7.30 per U.S. dollar on Wednesday \u2014 the lowest level since November 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of uncertainty about the Chinese economy,\u201d Hebe Chen, analyst at London-based online trading provider IG Markets, told Bloomberg. \u201cThe market is now standing at a crossroads about whether or not we can continue to talk about the Chinese recovery story or should we shift the narrative to China slowing down or even entering a recession.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 10.44% from Aug. 11 to Aug. 18 to US$26,324 as of 9:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since last Wednesday. Ether fell 9.16% over the week to US$1,678.\n\nBitcoin dipped to US$25,409 on Friday, its lowest price in two months, after Evergrande, a Chinese property developer with over US$340 billion in liabilities, filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., as part of its prolonged restructuring agreement with international creditors. Evergrande defaulted on its dollar-denominated debts in 2021.\n\nAdrian Fritz, a senior research associate at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, said that Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price fall, along with the usual \u201csummer trading lull.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s first key support level was the 200-day moving average at US$27,200, which it wasn\u2019t able to hold. The next major support level to watch would be around US$25,000,\u201d said Fritz, in an email response to Forkast.\n\nCoinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., announced on Wednesday that it obtained regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading services to eligible clients in the country.\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) token launched its layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium, on the Ethereum blockchain on Thursday, but US$1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck on the Shibarium bridge, according to on-chain intelligence firm PeckShield, leading an over 7% drop in SHIB\u2019s price.\n\nAdding to the negative investor sentiment, Binance announced the shutdown of its crypto payment service, Binance Connect, on Wednesday. Previously known as \u201cBifinity,\u201d Binance Connect was a fiat-to-crypto payment ramp for the exchange, allowing users to buy cryptocurrencies through Mastercard and Visa.\n\nBinance\u2019s announcement came a day after Europe\u2019s first Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was listed on Euronext Amsterdam, nearly two years after it was first approved.\n\nLucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said that the ETF listing could inspire other European countries to follow suit and pressure the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to hasten its approval process for pending ETFs.\n\n\u201cIf Europe demonstrates that such products can operate safely within existing regulatory frameworks, it may force the SEC to reevaluate its cautious approach towards cryptocurrency-related investment vehicles,\u201d wrote Kiely, adding that the surging demand may also move Bitcoin prices higher.\n\nHowever, Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, doesn\u2019t expect the European ETF to significantly boost Bitcoin prices or accelerate the SEC\u2019s decision-making process.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will likely maintain its independent pace and judgment, regardless of the actions of its European counterparts,\u201d Betz told Forkast.\n\nNotable Movers: LTC & XRP\n\nSome of the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrencies were put on the spotlight in the loss column this week.\n\nXRP, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped 20.09% to US$0.505 after the SEC was granted the request to file an interlocutory appeal in its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.\n\nLitecoin, the world\u2019s 15th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 21.65% to US$65.12, as part of a broader downward movement in the crypto market. The global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.06 trillion on Friday at 9:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, down by more than US$100 billion over the past week, CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin close the week above US$27,000?\n\nOn Tuesday, investors will be anticipating speeches from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee and U.S. Federal Open Market Committee Member Michelle W. Bowman.\n\nDespite Bitcoin falling to a two-month low on Thursday, Yield App\u2019s Kiely said that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\n\n\u201cWith Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF now finally approved, if Bitcoin closed the week around US$27,000 it would be well within the range to regain momentum,\u201d Kiely said.\n\nSee related article: Hackers hit Curve, China announces blockchain link & is FTX back?"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices plunged as investors liquidated more than $1 billion worth of digital coins on Thursday after it was reported that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX sold off its bitcoin holdings.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin fell 7.2% in its biggest one-day drop since November 2022 when top exchange FTX collapsed. Bitcoin then slipped to a two-month low of $26,172 during Asian trading hours on Friday, its lowest since June 1.\n\nAnalysts said cryptocurrencies also appeared to be getting hit as rising interest rates slammed riskier assets across the board including stocks. By early Friday Eastern time, bitcoin was changing hands at $26,441, down 0.8% on the day.\n\nEther, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, was steady at $1,685.20, having also dropped sharply on Thursday.\n\nSpaceX, which is owned by crypto enthusiast Musk, wrote down the value of its bitcoin holdings by $373 million in the past two years before selling them off, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited internal financial documents from the privately owned rocket-launching company.\n\nMusk\u2019s electric car maker, Tesla, sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings last year \u2014 another move perceived as a vote of no confidence from the tech mogul who in years past has touted the meme coin dogecoin.\n\n3 Crypto investors sold off $1 billion worth of digital assets such as bitcoin and ethereum on Thursday. REUTERS\n\nThe SpaceX report was the \u201cimmediate catalyst\u201d for bitcoin\u2019s sell-off, Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe broader driver is that crypto assets are not immune to the deepening risk-off selling pressure seen across all asset classes,\u201d Laidler said.\n\nJoseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, attributed the bitcoin price move to low volatility and a lack of enthusiasm from retail investors.\n\nAfter a pandemic era boom that saw the value of bitcoin skyrocket past $60,000, cryptocurrency has been mired in a slump.\n\n3 The sell-off came on the heels of a report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX sold off its bitcoin holdings. AP\n\nAt its height, the cumulative worth of digital coins reached nearly $3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nAs of Friday, the total market capitalization of all crypto assets including stable coins and tokens was hovering just over $1 trillion.\n\n3 Tesla, the electric car maker run by crypto enthusiast Musk, sold off most of its bitcoin portfolio last year. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe crypto community has been hit with a series of legal and regulatory setbacks that have spooked investors.\n\nFTX, which at one point was the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world with an estimated market capitalization of $32 billion, was thrown into bankruptcy after its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was alleged to have used customer deposits to cover risky bets made by his hedge fund, Alameda Research.\n\nBankman-Fried, who is in jail awaiting trial on fraud and money laundering charges, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCoinbase, the largest crypto exchange platform in the US, has been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for operating illegally because it failed to first register with the regulator.\n\nThe SEC has also targeted the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, for allegedly operating a \u201cweb of deception.\u201d\n\nWith Post wires"

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nJudge grants SEC request to file motion for appeal in Ripple case\n\nJudge Analisa Torres has granted a request from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against Ripple Labs. The decision allowed the SEC to file a motion, on Aug. 18, requesting permission to bring a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ripple will also be able to file an opposition to the motion. Torres ruled, on July 13, that Ripple\u2019s XRP token is not a security when distributed in public sales, but the ruling considered XRP a security in institutional sales. The case against Ripple has been ongoing since December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple and its executives over allegations of offering an unregistered security.\n\nBitcoin, Ether price slump leads to crypto bloodbath with $1B in liquidations\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ether price slide on Aug. 18 saw the top two cryptocurrencies fall to a two-month low and triggered a series of liquidations for thousands of derivative traders. The crypto bloodbath led to billions of dollars worth of hedged positions being liquidated, and several traders lost millions of dollars in a single trade. According to CoinGlass data, a total of 176,752 traders got liquidated within hours, indicating a rapid rise in price volatility just days after BTC and ETH recorded their lowest daily volatility in several years. The price function in the crypto market was attributed to several factors, including the SpaceX Bitcoin write-down and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBitcoin-friendly El Salvador sees bond returns soar to 70% in 2023\n\nEl Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, has seen its dollar bond outperform the majority of the emerging markets with a 70% return in 2023. The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Apart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April. El Salvador paid $800 million in debt in full within the due maturing time at the start of this year, raising confidence in the country\u2019s bonds again.\n\nFirst EU spot Bitcoin ETF hits Euronext Amsterdam exchange\n\nEurope welcomed its first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF after the long-awaited launch of Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF. The London-based digital asset management firm announced that its new investment product was going live on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on Aug. 15, more than a year later than its planned launch in 2022. The new ETF is trading under the BCOIN ticker. Its launch marks a milestone for Europe, while United States regulators are yet to approve a number of similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity. The new ETF is trading under the BCOIN ticker.\n\nCoinbase wins NFA approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether futures in US\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has obtained approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to offer investments in crypto futures to eligible customers in the United States. The approval enables Coinbase to introduce Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts through a derivatives exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Following the decision, the exchange\u2019s website displayed a link for joining an early access waiting list. Coinbase claims the global crypto derivatives market accounts for 75% of crypto trading volume worldwide.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,031, Ether (ETH) at $1,660 and XRP at $0.50.

        "content": "SpaceX\u2019s Bitcoin write-down report on Aug. 18 sparked confusion among the crypto community.

I think @BitcoinMagazine is wrong here\n\n\n\nYes, the report claims that SpaceX marked down the value of their bitcoin by 373m (btw, that doesn't mean they SOLD 373m) and sold *some*, but selling some doesn't necessarily mean they have no bitcoin left https://t.co/rLgwA0N8Zi pic.twitter.com/GSrOio7zku \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) August 17, 2023\n\nElon Musk revealed in 2021 that SpaceX holds Bitcoin, as does Tesla, on its balance sheet. While Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were made public, there were no estimations around SpaceX\u2019s BTC holdings, which has been key to the ongoing confusion. Tesla once held $1.5 billion worth of BTC purchased during the bull market but revealed it had sold 72% of its holdings in Q2 2022.\n\nThe SpaceX write-off claims were also believed to be one of the key catalysts behind the $2,000 BTC price drop, although several others denied it being a cause. Musk hasn\u2019t addressed the issue yet, but the market FUD made him a target of Bitcoin proponents who questioned his strategy of buying high and selling low, while a few others called it market FUD.\n\nBuy High & Sell Low - Elon Musk's #Bitcoin strategy for Dummies https://t.co/yBKsPdg59B \u2014 Matt C\u26a1\ufe0f (@mithcoons) August 17, 2023\n\nOne Reddit user wrote that Musk is running out of cash across all his companies, suggesting that Musk might sell \u201call of his Bitcoin and doge within the next 6 months.\u201d\n\nRelated: Elon\u2019s \u2018not afraid of blowing things up\u2019 \u2014 Ex-Twitter exec on working under Musk\n\nUsers on X (formerly known as Twitter) also called out Musk for his \u201cpaper hands,\u201d a term used for those who sell their BTC holdings prematurely.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin declined by 13% at its lowest wick from yesterday, August 17\n\nThe crash was caused by a long squeeze\n\nA bounce to $28,000 is expected shortly\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been in the red today, August 18, with a major crash happening across the crypto space. Bitcoin\u2019s price came down by 8.8% from its August 17th open and reached $25,244 on its lowest wick, according to Coinbase data.\n\nMany have speculated as to why the market started crashing suddenly, and there are some factors that stand out. In this analysis, we are going to cover these reasons but also point out where the market could be headed next.\n\nReasons Behind The Crash\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares , has taken it to Twitter to discuss his reasoning behind the crash.\n\nOur thoughts on what\u2019s behind the recent Bitcoin price crash: \u2013 Prompted by the market realising that the SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US isn\u2019t imminent. \u2013 Fears over the economic downturn in China gathering pace as deflation sets in, although this could ultimately\u2026 \u2014 James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) August 18, 2023\n\nHe highlighted the market\u2019s adjusted expectations regarding the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF, indicating that approval wasn\u2019t immediately expected. He also pointed to concerns over China\u2019s economic downturn and its potential deflationary effects.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume has reduced significantly, making the market more reactive to larger trades. Historical data also suggests Bitcoin\u2019s low volatility often precedes sharp price changes.\n\nThough SpaceX\u2019s recent BTC financial move played a part, other factors, such as rising 30-year rates, may indicate an impending broader asset class crash. In essence, Bitcoin\u2019s price is influenced by various global and market factors, not just headline-grabbing events.\n\nLooking at some key on-chain metrics, we can say that the real reason behind this crash comes from the derivatives market, namely a large leverage flush and long position liquidations \u2013 long squeeze.\n\nFirst, looking at the Bitcoin balance held on major exchanges, we can see that there wasn\u2019t any significant inflow to exchanges. This means that on-chain holders haven\u2019t put back their BTC on exchanges in order to sell, so the selling pressure hasn\u2019t come from this side.\n\nBut looking at the open interest chart, we can see a different picture. Open interest stands for the number of open positions (both long and short positions) currently on a derivative exchange\u2019s trading pairs.\n\nA sharp decline occurred here, meaning that many traders have closed their positions. The closed positions are definitely the vast majority of longs.\n\nThis event marked the highest long liquidation we have seen this year, with 5694 long positions closed yesterday. The last time we saw this high of a number was November 9, when this number was even slightly higher, and the price of Bitcoin crashed by 27%.\n\nIn comparison, the number of short positions closed was insignificant, as seen in the chart above. From these charts, we can conclude that long-position traders were stopped out, forcing them to sell, which caused a cascading effect known as the long squeeze.\n\nPrice Analysis\n\nThere are two scenarios on a macro level ahead, but both point to the same near-term price action.\n\nAs we have seen the completion of the five-wave impulse from November 21, now we are either seeing the first major bull market ABC correction, or the larger five-wave move that is going to lead the price of Bitcoin into its final bear market low.\n\nIn the short term, a recovery will be expected starting at the current level, and most likely back to $28,000. This recovery would be either a B wave in a bullish scenario or wave 2 in a bearish scenario. With the RSI signaling extreme oversold conditions on the daily chart, we could expect this recovery to start anytime soon.\n\nNext, we would be expecting the third descending move from which we can further validate which scenario would be the primary one. If the bullish one is in play, then the price is headed toward 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $21,500.\n\nAlternatively, if the price goes below the 0.618 Fibonacci level it could indicate that we are seeing wave 3 from the five-wave pattern and the ultimate target for the completion of this pattern could be at the next most significant support zone around $11,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe whole market has been in a freefall since August 17, but as the sharp decline was made, a bounce would be expected shortly. However, this bounce can only take the price so far as the market structure implies the starting downtrend.\n\nThe first optimal target for the completion of this decline would be $21,500 in a bullish case, but the next one is much lower, at the $11,000 zone, in a bearish case.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "No, Elon Musk didn\u2019t spark the Bitcoin selloff - Fortune",
        "content": "Volatility is back. After months of relative calm in the crypto markets\u2014so much so that some were declaring Bitcoin to be downright boring\u2014prices plunged on Thursday with the flagship currency falling nearly 10%, to about $25,000, before recovering slightly. Ethereum, XRP, and other big currencies likewise buckled.\n\nThe cause for the sudden tumult is hard to pinpoint, but for now, it\u2019s possible to say what didn\u2019t cause Bitcoin to crash. Namely, contrary to a flurry of excited tweets and headlines, Elon Musk is not to blame.\n\nThe theory got traction yesterday after the Wall Street Journal published a scoop about the finances of Musk\u2019s privately held rocket company, SpaceX. While the piece focused on the company\u2019s revenues and research costs, it included this line at the end: \u201cThe documents also show SpaceX wrote down the value of Bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe story coincided with a broad selloff of Bitcoin, leading some to conclude that SpaceX was the catalyst. Even the normally reliable Bloomberg published a headline (since changed) that read, \u201cBitcoin Plunge Spurs Liquidations as SpaceX\u2019s Token Sale Weighs.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of problems with this assessment beyond the basic one that correlation doesn\u2019t always equate to causation. The biggest one lies with the quirky accounting rules surrounding crypto that require companies to record losses (\u201cimpairments\u201d in accounting speak) when token prices fall, but that don\u2019t let them record gains if tokens rise. So if a firm holds one Bitcoin and the price drops from $30,000 to $25,000 on Monday but then climbs to $35,000 on Tuesday, it must show a $5,000 loss on its balance sheet.\n\nWhile the Journal\u2019s report says SpaceX sold cryptocurrency, we don\u2019t know if the company sold all of it or if the sale occurred as one or multiple transactions. In any case, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $500 billion, so it\u2019s unlikely that SpaceX selling all or part of its holdings would be enough to trigger a drop like the one we saw on Thursday.\n\nSo what did cause Bitcoin to plunge? There are a few likely explanations, most notably yesterday\u2019s news that U.S. interest rates could keep climbing. While crypto price patterns can still be unpredictable, it\u2019s become accepted in the past two years that investors regard Bitcoin as a \u201crisk-on\u201d asset to buy in bullish conditions\u2014and that they will rapidly dump it in the face of macroeconomic headwinds.

        "content": "On the latest episode of Macro Markets, analyst Marcel Pechman explains the impacts of the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, breaking down how the Fed inflated its assets by $5 trillion between December 2019 and April 2022. Pechman notes that the expansion period coincides with a 38% crash in the S&P 500 index. Moreover, the Federal Reserve balance sheet surpassed the $8.9 trillion mark right as the stock market index reached its 4,800-point all-time high.\n\nThe problem, according to Pechman, is that the U.S. Treasury Department has a huge deficit, as the government spends more than it gets from revenues and taxes. Consequently, it needs to start rolling some of the debt instead of letting it expire, so odds are it won\u2019t be able to continue reducing the balance sheet any longer \u2014 something that has been a huge contributor to lowering inflation.\n\nUltimately, inflation will feel the biggest impact once the Federal Reserve is forced to expand its balance sheet again, Pechman argues. He advises that those holding scarce assets such as Apple shares, land, gold and Bitcoin (BTC) should hang on tight and not be fooled by the momentary period of reduced inflation.\n\nIn the show\u2019s next segment, Pechman covers deflation in China, which economists believe is an issue. Domestic consumption is decreasing, and it seems investors expect a miracle from their central bank\u2019s expansion of the balance sheet.\n\nIn essence, Pechman argues there are many red flags coming from China. If you want to know whether Pechman believes this is a risk for international economies and what will happen to stock markets and Bitcoin, watch the latest episode of Macro Marke on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin fell by 11.5% from Aug. 16 to Aug. 18, resulting in $900 million worth of long positions being liquidated and causing the price to hit a two-month low. Before the drop, many traders expected a breakout in volatility that would push the price upward, but that was obviously not the case. With the substantial liquidations, it\u2019s important to address whether professional traders gained from the price crash.\n\nBitcoin just saw one of its largest daily liquidations by volume in history.\n\n\n\nStarting at 4:30 PM yesterday, #Bitcoin fell 7.5% in 20 MINUTES, erasing $42 billion in market cap.\n\n\n\nThis mass-liquidation event involved more outflows in 1 day than during the FTX collapse in November\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KmVNkXoOLw \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 18, 2023\n\nThere\u2019s a common belief among cryptocurrency traders that whales and market makers have an edge in predicting significant price shifts and that this allows them to gain the upper hand over retail traders. This notion holds some truth, as advanced quantitative trading software and strategically positioned servers come into play. However, this doesn\u2019t make professional traders immune to substantial financial losses when the market gets shaky.\n\nFor larger-sized and professional traders, a majority of their positions may be fully hedged. Comparing these positions with previous trading days allows for estimations on whether recent movements anticipated a widespread correction in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMargin longs at Bitfinex and OKX were relatively high\n\nMargin trading lets investors magnify their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the funds to acquire more cryptocurrency. Conversely, traders who borrow Bitcoin (BTC) employ the coins as collateral for short positions, indicating a bet on price decline.\n\nBitfinex margin traders are known for swiftly establishing position contracts of 10,000 BTC or greater, underscoring the involvement of whales and substantial arbitrage desks.\n\nAs depicted in the chart below, the Bitfinex margin long position on Aug. 15 stood at 94,240 BTC, nearing its highest point in four months. This suggests that professional traders were entirely caught off guard by the abrupt BTC price crash.\n\nBitfinex margin BTC longs, measured in BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nUnlike futures contracts, the equilibrium between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t inherently balanced. A high margin lending ratio signifies a bullish market, while a low ratio suggests a bearish sentiment.\n\nOKX USDT/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe chart above shows the OKX BTC margin lending ratio, which approached 35 times in favor of long positions on Aug. 16. More importantly, this level aligned with the preceding seven-day average. This implies that even if external factors skewed the metric previously, it can be deduced that whales and market makers maintained their position on margin markets before the Bitcoin price collapse on Aug. 16 and Aug. 17. This information supports the argument that professional traders were unprepared for any form of negative price movement.\n\nFutures long-to-short data proves traders were unprepared\n\nThe net long-to-short ratio of the top traders excludes external factors that may have exclusively influenced the margin markets. By consolidating positions across perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, a clearer insight can be gained into whether professional traders are leaning toward a bullish or bearish stance.\n\nOccasional methodological disparities among different exchanges exist, prompting viewers to track changes rather than fixate on absolute values.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders' Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nPrior to the release of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee minutes on Aug. 16, prominent BTC traders on Binance exhibited a long-to-short ratio of 1.37, aligning with the peak levels observed in the previous four days. A similar pattern emerged on OKX, where the long-to-short indicator for Bitcoin\u2019s leading traders reached 1.45 moments before the BTC price correction commenced.\n\nRelated: Why did Bitcoin drop? Analysts point to 5 potential reasons\n\nIrrespective of whether those whales and market makers augmented or diminished their positions post the initiation of the crash, data stemming from BTC futures further substantiates the lack of readiness in terms of reducing exposure prior to Aug. 16, be it in futures or margin markets. Consequently, a reasonable assumption can be made that professional traders were taken by surprise and did not profit from the price crash.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Hong Kong introduced new regulations for exchanges in June, following years of uncertainty about crypto.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the creation of a vibrant crypto culture.\n\nThe metropolis teems with crypto storefronts offering over-the-counter trading in Bitcoin, Ether, and altcoins.\n\nSome days it seems like everyone in Hong Kong has a crypto story.\n\nThe son of the security guard in my apartment block bought three restaurants with money made from Bitcoin investments. I tell a Romanian importer at a bar that I write about crypto and he pulls up the leg of his jeans to reveal a Bitcoin tattoo on his calf. A medical student at Hong Kong University tells me her friends made \u201cso much money\u201d trading tokens \u2014 but she knows little about crypto herself.\n\nSigns of Bitcoin and its ilk are, quite literally, everywhere in this metropolis of 7 million. An environmental group advertises its NFT collection on a billboard by the Star Ferry terminal where you cross to Hong Kong Island from Kowloon.\n\nCrypto crazed\n\nThe crypto scene in Hong Kong these days is striking, given the existential levels of angst now rippling through the industry.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIt\u2019s true, Bitcoin is up more than 60% this year and ETH has jumped 40%, but with US regulators clamping down on the likes of Coinbase and Binance, and DeFi regularly roiled by hacks and heists there\u2019s an unmissable vibe that the revolution is in trouble. So why is Hong Kong so crypto crazed?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum ATMs still abound in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Shutterstock\n\nHard to say, but the evidence is ample. Walking through Central, the city\u2019s business district, on a Saturday night, there\u2019s a sign by the mid-level escalators for Bitcino, \u201cwhere Bitcoin meets casino and drinks.\u201d\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s ApeFest is coming to Hong Kong later this year. Convenience stores stock an NFT magazine created by local enthusiasts. The app I use to top up my phone credit shills the metaverse at me.\n\nNOW READ: Why Lebanon just can\u2019t quit Justin Sun\u2019s Tron \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018100% mixed up\u2019 with Tether\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn contrast to other cities, where it isn\u2019t easy to find crypto-related things, in Hong Kong they\u2019re hard to avoid. You might find the occasional cafe in Singapore with an Azuki on the wall or countries like Thailand that give you NFTs when you visit certain tourist spots, but Hong Kong is next level.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2021, Henri Arslanian, former chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, told The Financial Times that every large crypto company in the city had \u201calready started a contingency plan to relocate their business due to the uncertainty.\u201d He moved his firm, Nine Blocks Capital, to Dubai last year.\n\nThen the Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission announced plans to regulate exchanges. In June, the city launched a task force for promoting web3. Politicians including Johnny Ng are staking their reputations on this being the future in the city.\n\nCreative mashups of Bitcoin and other forms of recreation are plentiful in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nWhy Hong Kong changed its mind about crypto is still not clear. Some put it down to improved understanding among regulators. Some say the government got a case of FOMO as Singapore and Dubai started trying to coax away their companies.\n\nStill others say it\u2019s the guiding hand of Beijing \u2014 though, given China\u2019s hard line on crypto, this raises more questions than it answers. Beijing, after all, has banned speculating on tokens and mining Bitcoin.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing you may notice in Hong Kong is how many over-the-counter crypto shops there are.\n\n\u2018Call Me Bitcoin Queen\u2019\n\nForeign exchange outlets on Nathan Road now sit side by side with booths bearing names like Crypto King. The T symbol for Tether hangs at the entrance to Chungking Mansions, a notorious 60-year-old tower block that houses an eclectic collection of hostels, rent-by-the-hour rooms, phone repair shops, currency traders, fake watch sellers, doss houses, and cheap curry kitchens. Now it\u2019s added crypto to its list of amenities.\n\nThe forex and remittance shops are still more popular than their crypto counterparts \u2014 one shopkeeper rolls his eyes when I ask about his crypto neighbour \u2014 but occasionally a person saunters over to one of the crypto desks.\n\nWant some USDT and fast food? Bored Garden sells both. Photo credit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nThe crypto shops are far more audacious than their forex counterparts. The crypto shop Coiner ran an ad campaign in 2021 featuring photos of the founder, Priscilla Ng, and the caption \u201cCall Me Bitcoin Queen\u201d (perhaps an unfortunate choice of title given the \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d moniker often attached to OneCoin fraudster Ruja Ignatova).\n\nLaunched three years ago, Coiner has three branches in Hong Kong, one of which also doubles as an art gallery for NFTs. It\u2019s not even the biggest player in terms of branches. Another competitor, One Satoshi, has nine.\n\nBitcoin orange\n\nMeanwhile, Bored Garden is probably one of the only businesses in the world that sells both Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoins and hamburgers. The Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed restaurant in Central doubles as an over-the-counter shop. Like Coiner, it has a fondness for using Bitcoin orange.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto in Hong Kong, it\u2019s hard to pin down your typical user and their motivations, a staff member at one shop tells me. But they can offer some insights. Tether is more popular than Bitcoin and Ether. Customers aren\u2019t necessarily tech savvy \u2014 several shops have run educational programs in the past to teach people about crypto.\n\nNOW READ: Hong Kong regulators say crypto firms lie about submitting licence applications\n\nAnd a lot of customers come from mainland China, particularly since the border opened earlier this year.\n\nHong Kong has long been the first port of call for Chinese citizens wishing to get their money out of China. In theory, you can only move out $50,000 per person, per year. This has led to some convoluted schemes for moving money involving gold, jewellery and even strapping wads of cash to your body to pass through customs.\n\nCoiner is one of many OTC shops that are doing business in Hong Kong's revived crypto scene. Photocredit: Coiner\n\nTen years ago, I used to hear stories about taking money through the border by buying necklaces in Shenzhen and then trading them for cash at a sister shop in Hong Kong. It might have been an urban legend, but it demonstrates the desire a lot of people have to get their funds out of the country. Despite the ban in China, crypto remains a popular way to do so.\n\nThis popularity with mainland visitors may become an issue for storefront crypto businesses. Some now refuse to take mainland customers, citing the crypto ban in China. Scrutiny of crypto is ramping up: From January to April, more than 675 crypto scams were reported to police, involving some HK$416.6 million ($53.2 million).\n\nRegulatory changes\n\nAs exchanges face regulatory changes that will allow them to operate compliantly in the city while servicing retail customers, little has been said about OTC trading. Yet facilitating the purchase of cryptocurrency for mainland citizens is unlikely to be allowed to continue long-term.\n\nFor now, the crypto party is back in full swing.\n\nAt the Central Market, I get to chatting with someone who runs an NFT fashion company. A devotee of Hedera Hashgraph, a crypto network, chews my ear off for 30 minutes about how it\u2019s a superior technology to traditional blockchain.\n\nInvariably, people ask me what token they should invest in next. I reply that I don\u2019t have a clue.\n\nCallan Quinn, DL News\u2019 Hong Kong correspondent, covers the crypto industry in Asia. Have a tip? Contact the author at callan@dlnews.com."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin had been sitting relatively still for weeks until yesterday, when it quickly dropped to lows not seen in two months.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap at the time of writing was trading for $26,060 per coin, CoinGecko data shows, marking an over 11% dip in the past seven days.\n\nIt\u2019s still up from the lowest point it touched on Thursday, $25,649, but still well below the highs above $31,000 it hit in June.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, after a period of little volatility from mid-June into August, what caused the flash crash yesterday?\n\nA lot of it has to do with the wider economy\u2014including American regulation and institutional investors being unsure\u2014as well as low liquidity, experts told Decrypt.\n\nAccording to data firm Kaiko, liquidity in the Bitcoin market has been dropping for some time now on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. This means that when big holders want to shift their holdings, the rest of the market will feel it. And feel it they did: at one point yesterday, Bitcoin shed 7% of its value in 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who dumped Bitcoin and triggered this cascade liquidation, but it's less likely OG miners or U.S. investors,\u201d CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said.\n\nThe \u201ccascade liquidation\u201d of over $1 billion was caused by spooked investors\u2014major ones too\u2014wanting to shift risk following the news that China\u2019s Evergrande Group property developer filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMassive property developers' movements and problems in real estate could move into other parts of the economy,\u201d Bob Bodily, CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq, said.\n\nHe noted that \u201cmarket illiquidity, and prices moving sideways for a while\u201d also contributed to the flash crash. Meanwhile, he categorized a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings as a rumor\u2014\"but pretty soon everybody was talking about it.\" He said that it may have helped contribute to the drop in prices.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, helped spur a June market bull run when it submitted an application for a spot Bitcoin crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nInvestors were optimistic. But the SEC doesn\u2019t appear to be in a rush to approve any of the firms applying to it for such a product.\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said \u201cmarkets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely,\u201d and so investors are more likely to want to shift their crypto holdings.\n\nHe added that this, combined with China\u2019s woes and investors being \u201chighly attuned to regulatory decisions,\u201d impacted the price of the biggest digital asset. Bodily, meanwhile, suggested that \"high volatility\" for Bitcoin will continue amid the \"fairly shaky\" macro environment.\n\nIn other words, despite a relatively sleepy summer of late, Bitcoin's wild price swings may be here to stay in the short term."

Bitcoin's recent drop below $27,000 indicates a bearish move with the potential for further declines to $26,000. A break at $26,000 could lead to a deeper decline towards $24,840. Conversely, a positive rally above $30,000 could push the price of Bitcoin to $31,700.Payments giant PayPal will stop allowing UK customers to buy cryptocurrencies through its platform from October as it works to comply with new rules on crypto promotions.Britain's financial regulator is due to bring in tougher rules to limit how crypto is advertised to British consumers, including requiring crypto firms to carry warnings about the risk and scrapping \"refer a friend\" bonuses.PayPal will \"temporarily pause\" the ability for customers to buy crypto on its platform from Oct. 1 as it works to satisfy the new regulations, which come into effect on Oct. 8, it said in an email to customers on Tuesday. It said it expects to re-start in \"early 2024\"."

        "title": "Bitcoin nosedive jolts crypto market out of its summer stupor - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Bloomberg\n\nGlobal Concerns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has had a sleepy summer. This week, it was shaken awake. For the past several months, the hallmark volatility that previously attracted hordes of investors to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has been absent, with the rate of its swings reaching its lowest point since 2016.That lull snapped Thursday, when Bitcoin plunged more than 8% in the space of a few hours to a two-month low of $25,314 late in the New York day. The slump sparked a broad decline across all of crypto, leading to more than $1 billion in liquidations and putting Bitcoin on pace for its worst week since November and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse.The carnage \u2014 fueled by the prospect of prolonged high interest rates and exacerbated by thin crypto trading \u2014 was a reminder of the various threats that continue to stalk digital assets, from hostile regulators to a broader rout in risk assets. And even as Bitcoin has recovered smartly from last year\u2019s lows, many investors are still sitting out, depriving the market of the breadth and depth that are key ingredients for a sustained bull run.\u201cThere are still significant amounts of macro uncertainty keeping investors away, and liquidity is still thin,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter and former head of market insights at Genesis Trading. \u201cBottom line, there\u2019s not yet enough conviction.\u201dThursday\u2019s activity marked another entry in an emerging trendline for Bitcoin in 2023, with the token having already crashed to two similar low points in January and March. But every sharp decline this year has been followed by recovery, said FRNT Financial\u2019s Stephane Oullette.\u201cThe next few days should give more clues to whether the selloff will continue and we\u2019ll see a reversal of this year\u2019s trend,\u201d Oullette said in an email on Friday. Signs that Bitcoin is making a major divergence would be if the token were to make a decisive break below the $25,000 mark, he added, or conversely, a sustained push beyond $30,000. Its high for the year was $31,818 in July.Part of the reason behind this week\u2019s plunge was the market\u2019s outsize exposure to larger trades. The last four months have had the lowest average daily volume of spot crypto transactions since October 2020, according to Riyad Carey, a research analyst for blockchain data firm Kaiko. At that time, Bitcoin was worth around $10,000, while the second most popular cryptoasset Ether, now at $1,670, was valued at $350.The sector is also overly reliant on narrative to prop up prices, with hype around crypto\u2019s next buzzy project or a Wall Street firm buying cryptocurrencies among the things that spur on investors. A Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had sold Bitcoin holdings worsened Thursday\u2019s decline.But the narrative is unlikely to improve when these days, many of the biggest announcements to rock the world of digital assets come either from regulators in Washington or judges in the courtroom. The hangover from 2022\u2019s run of bankruptcies and fraud scandals continue to play out on the world stage, dampening optimism on crypto\u2019s recovery.Just this week, former FTX co-founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was escorted to a Brooklyn penitentiary after his bail deal was revoked by a judge. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the multiple criminal charges he faces.Recent price declines can be partly attributed to US enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, CoinShares\u2019s James Butterfill said in a blog post on Friday, adding that a recent survey saw fund managers rank regulatory decisions as their key concern. The lingering threat of further lawsuits or penalties haunts the market, leaving investors wary of the safety of some of crypto\u2019s top venues.Despite this, Bitcoin has displayed a general resilience over the last few months when compared to global risk assets. Post crash, it\u2019s still up 58.1% so far in 2023 \u2014 far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 13.6% gain. And while Bitcoin is likely to experience further downside if monetary conditions continue to deteriorate, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Jamie Douglas Coutts reckons that hype around a potential US spot crypto ETF may help it maintain that value.BlackRock Inc.\u2019s surprise filing in mid-June for a Bitcoin ETF prompted a flurry of firms to follow suit and led to a mini-rally as investors bet that approval of the funds would spur a wave of fresh buying. And it\u2019s not just Bitcoin. A Bloomberg report late Thursday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to allow the first ETF based on Ether futures helped to reverse some of the token\u2019s initial plunge \u2014 and a confirmed approval will likely cause an Ether bounce that drives up other tokens with it, Acheson said.Still, absent a catalyst like an ETF approval, the market is likely to drift. And unfortunately for traders who thrive on price swings, Friday\u2019s sharp spike in price activity across Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to be short-lived, at least until liquidity improves among both digital assets and more traditional markets.As central banks continue to raise or maintain high interest rates, the appeal of traditional financial investments like short-dated US Treasuries and other bonds have drawn focus away from crypto bets as investors chase a risk-off attitude.\u201cGlobal macro is going to continue to weigh in,\u201d said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at crypto custodian Copper Technologies Ltd.Some crypto bulls say the sector could benefit from situations such as China\u2019s deteriorating property sector, which has become a primary concern from a macro perspective. Stimulus measures implemented by the government have so far failed to provide enough economic relief, and Bitcoin\u2019s positioning as an alternative financial system has some believing it might benefit from any shocks. \u201cWhile we consider a full financial meltdown unlikely, should it transpire, it might bolster Bitcoin, especially if the repercussions permeate the broader financial sector,\u201d said Butterfill.Ultimately though, what\u2019s bad for the global economy is likely also bad for crypto.\u201cIf the stock market drops accelerate, crypto is also likely to suffer in sympathy as investors choose to lock in profits with whatever they can and sit in high-yielding cash until the dust settles,\u201d said Acheson. \u201cThe dust will settle, however, most likely sooner in the crypto market than in the stock market as investors recalibrate the relative risk of each asset group.\u201d"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies took another downturn this week after briefly inching upwards the week before.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) posted a mild overnight drop of 2% to below $29,000 on Thursday, after minutes of the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting were released the day before. The document indicatesthat the U.S. central bank will continue its conservative monetary policy in an ongoing effort to rein in inflation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater that day, Bitcoin dropped below $28,000 for the first time in two months. By the afternoon, it appeared to be in the midst of a flash crash, reaching a bottom of $25,649 before rebounding a little.\n\nAnalysts told Decrypt that market liquidity has been in decline for a while now, leaving the entire market vulnerable to a sudden big sell-off.\n\nAnd a huge sell-off is just what occurred. News that Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in a Manhattan court prompted institutional investors and big holders to dump riskier assets, like stocks and Bitcoin, causing the sudden drop.\n\nAll told, Bitcoin ends the week at $25,935, posting a seven-day drop of 11.9%.\n\nClosest contender Ethereum (ETH) fared similarly, with an intraweek drop of 10.2% to $1,662.\n\nBroadly speaking, these were some of the lightest price movements. Altcoins generally tumbled harder, with most other leading cryptocurrencies posting losses of between 10% and 20%, including BNB, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLosses of over 20% were felt by holders of Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LTC), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which dropped over 23%.\n\nThe most resilient cryptocurrency in the top twenty by market cap was TRON (TRX), which only fell 4.8% and currently sells for $0.073810.\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nThe regulatory uncertainty around crypto continued apace as the news cycle in the U.S. and beyond gave crypto hopefuls very little to chew on.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2013a leading U.S. bank regulator\u2013dedicated two out of ninety pages to crypto in its annual report. Insignificant as it may seem, this was a first for the FDIC, which used the slim space to point out that crypto may pose \u201cnovel and complex\u201d risks to the financial system.\n\nArgentinian Bitcoin fans enjoyed a different week than the rest of us. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency reached its Argentine all-time-high of 10.2 million Argentine Peso (ARS) on Wednesday, piggybacked by a surprise victory in the country's presidential primaries by hopeful Javier Milei, a professed libertarian known for his pro-Bitcoin stance."

        "title": "Bitcoin is giving a bearish signal. Here's what chart analysts say happens next - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin tumbled to finish the week after many weeks of stillness in the market, and chart analysts say it's possible this could be just the beginning. The cryptocurrency breached the $26,000 level on Friday, hitting a two-month low and dipping to $25,533.70 at one point. The big drop, which began Thursday evening, appeared to be set off by speculation around Elon Musk's SpaceX writing down the value of and selling its bitcoin. However, the virtual currency was already under pressure from rising rates and a stronger dollar \u2013 and chart analysts it could have further to fall still. Bitcoin also broke its 200-day moving average of $27,300, which could signal an impending downtrend. \"Unfortunately, the setup for bitcoin still looks pretty ominous to me,\" as do most risk assets, Wolfe Research's technical analyst Rob Ginsberg told CNBC. \"You never know what the impetus will be, but as we discussed in our note earlier this week , deteriorating trend and momentum were both suggesting a significant break lower for bitcoin.\" BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin lost as much as 9% Thursday night and continued falling Friday. \"Now oversold, with key support in the $24,750 to $25,000 area, we're close to finding some relief. [We] might need one more flush first,\" he added. \"Looking out, following a dead cat bounce, I wouldn't be surprised if it tested $20,000 before year end.\" A range emerges between $25,000 and $30,000 Bitcoin has been here before. The $25,000 level was a key resistance threshold from last summer through March of this year after bitcoin briefly touched $30,000 in its banking crisis-fueled rally. That $25,000 threshold was in focus again in June and July as bitcoin made another attempt to sustain $30,000 \u2014 this time it was fueled by speculation around the BlackRock bitcoin ETF filing. All this price action is now establishing a clear trading range between $25,000 and $30,000, said Julius de Kempenaer, a technical analyst at StockCharts.com. \"These levels are fairly rough as bitcoin tends to over or undershoot easily by $1,000 or more, but the range on the chart is clear,\" he said. \"This also means that we can get fairly reliable follow up signals when bitcoin leaves this range.\" Should bitcoin extend its losses, de Kempenaer said to watch its March 2023 low of $19,500 as the next target. If it rises, however, the March 2022 high of $48,000 is within the realm of possibility. \"With the upper and lower boundary getting more and more defined, the most likely scenario in the near term is for BTC to keep bouncing between 25k and 30k,\" he said. Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said similarly that the drop is \"indicative of a trend changing from an uptrend to a sideways range.\" He's looking at $24,770 as his next support level to watch. His upside target is the 200-day moving average of $27,300. Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton puts the next downside target a little higher at $25,200, with a secondary target level of $20,600. \"Our short- and intermediate-term gauges point lower, whereas long-term indicators remain improved (but, not positive),\" Stockton said. \"The setup supports a breach of $25,200, which would further increase downside risk for bitcoin.\""

If the U.S. SEC approves Bitcoin ETFs, the parent cryptocurrency could see its price cross the $150k mark. Among other key factors favoring this trend, he also states the interaction of cryptos with the general monetary climate.\n\nApproval of Bitcoin ETFs (BTC): the main catalyst\n\nTom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, set out a potential direction for the bitcoin price on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d. He stated that Bitcoin could break the $150k barrier, explaining the key factors that could guide this trajectory. The most notable factor is the possibility of the U.S. SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs. According to Tom Lee, such a decision could tip the balance in favor of Bitcoin reaching $150k to $180k.\n\nThis potential trajectory depends, however, on SEC approval. Indeed, while Bitcoin ETFs have found their place internationally, this is not yet the case in the USA. US SEC approval is thus a cornerstone for the crypto industry. Some believe that only a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election could lead to the approval of the Bitcoin ETF (BTC).\n\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicted that if the US SEC approves the spot bitcoin ETF, it may push the price of bitcoin to break through $150,000, or even close to $180,000. One view is that a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election would lead to ETF approval.\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 17, 2023\n\nThe undeniable interaction between crypto and inflation\n\nTom Lee also highlighted the interaction between cryptos and the general monetary climate. Indeed, stabilizing inflation rates could lead to an easing of financial conditions. This would encourage central banks to loosen their grip, creating a favorable environment for cryptos, particularly bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Fundstrat co-founder added that current core inflation of 0.16% is anchored by robust real estate figures. However, he expects inflation to soften and fall below 2% by the middle of next year. In an environment favorable to cryptos, Bitcoin (BTC) could finally take off after its consolidation at the $30k level.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has crashed dramatically, amid what seems to be a broader worry in the financial markets.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency has fallen more than 7 per cent over the last 24 hours, and almost 12 per cent in the last week.\n\nOther large digital currencies saw similar falls, though not as stark. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost around 10 per cent of its value in the last week.\n\nThe troubles mean that the crypto market as a whole is down 5.7 per cent over the last 24 hours, according to tracking website Coinmarketcap. Trading volumes increased sharply, too, and were up almost 80 per cent over the last 24 hours.\n\nThursday\u2019s drop in the price of the cryptocurrency was the biggest one day fall since November 2022. That happened when large exchange FTX collapsed, sending shockwaves through the crypto markets and leading to widespread fears.\n\nThis time around, there was no obvious connection to events in the cryptocurrency market. Instead, investors seemed concern about the economy more generally, and more traditional assets were also hit by falls in recent days.\n\nWall Street\u2019s main indexes fell on Friday, extending declines to the fourth session on a drag from megacap growth stocks, as evidence of a resilient U.S. economy fanned fears of interest rates staying higher for longer.\n\nThe three main US stock indexes are on track for sharp weekly losses as a spate of strong economic data, including a fall in weekly jobless claims, caused investors to dial back expectations of rate cuts and drove up government bond yields.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a ten-month high of 4.328 per cent in the previous session and came within a whisker of its highest level since 2007.\n\n\u201cThe drivers really have been of late the rising Treasury yields and that is signaling a more risk-off investor sentiment,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.\n\n\u201cInvestors are looking at (better-than-expected economic data) and saying the Fed likely isn\u2019t restrictive enough yet.\u201d\n\nTraders see a nearly 91% chance of the Fed holding rates at current levels at its September meeting, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nOn Friday, rate-sensitive big technology and growth stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia slipped between 0.7% and 2.8% even as Treasury yields took a breather.\n\nThe communication services and technology sectors housing major growth stocks fell 1.6% and 1.0% respectively.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq hit an over two-month low and is set to post the biggest weekly declines of the three major indices, down 3 per cent so far.\n\nThe CBOE volatility index hit its highest in nearly three months, reflecting rising investor anxiety.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters"

This huge crash has almost undone all the gains BTC made as a reaction to BlackRock\u2019s surprise filing for a Bitcoin ETF on June 15.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAfter surging 72 percent in the first quarter, Bitcoin has declined about 9 percent since the end of March. The token tumbled 64 percent last year amid a series of industry scandals and bankruptcies, reports indicated.\n\nAlso Read: US Treasury yields lift, Wall Street slips as rates, China loom large\n\nThe Musk effect\n\nThe rise in global yields comes as resilient economic data challenges the view that central banks rates are peaking. Higher interest rates usually make alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies less desirable.\n\nThe crash in Bitcoin exacerbated further after Elon Musk's SpaceX reportedly dumped cryptos worth nearly $373 million, which it had acquired between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Gold at 5-month low as higher yields, rate-hike bets dominate mood\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAccording to an August 17 Wall Street Journal report, the aerospace giant had roughly $373 million of BTC holdings on its balance sheet across 2021 and 2022. While neither SpaceX or Elon Musk have made any comment about this BTC offload, this move signifies a strategic shift in the company\u2019s financial portfolio.\n\nMusk had announced in 2021 that SpaceX had made BTC purchase of an unspecified amount and, in the same year, disclosed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that Tesla had plans to purchase $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. This saw Bitcoin surge to an all-time high of over $43,000 in the year.\n\nBitcoin has recovered a bit since today's dump, currently trading around $26,615, with a 24-hour trading volume of $30,978,060,365, according to data from Coinmarket.\n\nRegardless of the events of today, BTC continues to sit at the top position on CoinMarketCap with a live market cap of $5oo billion."

        "title": "SpaceX Bold Move: Why Did They Sell $373 Million In Bitcoin Holdings? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by tech mogul Elon Musk, reportedly took a significant step in reshaping its financial portfolio by recording a write-down of $373 million on its Bitcoin holdings in the past two years.\n\nAccording to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the company not only acknowledged the devaluation of its Bitcoin assets but also indicated the possibility of divestment.\n\nA write-down in the context of cryptocurrency holdings refers to the reduction in the recorded value of a digital currency asset on a company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThis reduction typically occurs when the market value of the cryptocurrency drops significantly, leading to a situation where asset\u2019s market value is now lower than its original purchase price or previously recorded value.\n\nIn 2021, Musk publicly disclosed that SpaceX had entered the world of cryptocurrencies by acquiring an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin. Simultaneously, his other venture, Tesla, made headlines by revealing its plans to invest a whopping $1.5 billion in the digital currency.\n\nA Shift In Strategy For SpaceX\n\nFast forward to the present, and it seems that SpaceX\u2019s stance on Bitcoin has evolved. The company\u2019s balance sheets for both 2021 and 2022 indicate that it valued its Bitcoin holdings at $373 million, only to subsequently record a write-down on these assets.\n\nThe move comes amidst revelations that SpaceX\u2019s expenditures for 2022 totaled around $5.2 billion, with an additional $5.4 billion directed toward property acquisition, equipment, research, and development.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Performance\n\nCoinciding with SpaceX\u2019s reported actions, Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced notable fluctuations. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value has plummeted by 7.0% in the last 24 hours alone, marking a 9.6% decline over the past week.\n\nLiterally took more liquidations than we got during the FTX collapse to flush us this low and we couldn\u2019t even break HTF bullish market structure. $BTC didn\u2019t go below 26k on most spot exchanges- went lower on perps/leveraged products because of the liquidations. Right inside\u2026 https://t.co/lKJh4M0W7E pic.twitter.com/Vdxr0Zd5Zv \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) August 17, 2023\n\nHowever, amidst the market turmoil, influential crypto analyst \u201cCredible Crypto\u201d has predicted that this downturn may signify the bottom for Bitcoin\u2019s price. He emphasizes that Bitcoin\u2019s macro bullish trend remains intact and asserts that the currency remains in a bullish position over the long term.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $26.444. Chart by TradingView.com\n\nMeanwhile, the Journal report regarding SpaceX\u2019s Bitcoin write-down has baffled cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Some questioned if SpaceX had sold $373 million worth of Bitcoin between 2020 and 2021, or simply reduced their Bitcoin activity by that amount.\n\nI actually read the WSJ report. I think @BitcoinMagazine is wrong here Yes, the report claims that SpaceX marked down the value of their bitcoin by 373m (btw, that doesn\u2019t mean they SOLD 373m) and sold *some*, but selling some doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they have no bitcoin left https://t.co/rLgwA0N8Zi pic.twitter.com/GSrOio7zku \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) August 17, 2023\n\nSocial media outlets reported conflicting information about the company\u2019s sale of its entire BTC holdings. While some claimed the sale occurred, others were uncertain because of the vagueness in wording in how the story was presented.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "(Video Transcript)\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase has been one of the big losers over the last few days, all sessions on the IG platform, it comes as the slide in Bitcoin continues. I want to show you what's happening with Bitcoin first of all. Now Bitcoin is excluded from a number of people that trade this because of the regulations around the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBut there are ways of trading this and I'll show you that on Coinbase in just a moment. I want to show you this what's happened with Bitcoin first of all. The FT reports that the sell-off coincided with a report in the Wall Street Journal stating that Elon Musk's privately held SpaceX venture had written down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million in the past two days and had sold the cryptocurrency. Digital asset traders have kept close tabs on Musk since the 2021 exposure to cryptocurrencies when his electric car company Tesla briefly accepted payments in Bitcoin.\n\nThis is Bitcoin showing us that we're just below the 76.4% retracement before recovery yesterday but it looks like with another red candle today we're going to have another tilter getting below that. In fact it has happened already today. I can see where things end up but if there is a total retracement of this mark here we're currently trading at $26,550. That would as a total retracement take us down to this line of support established back on the 15th of June this year down at $24,793.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange\n\nAs I said this is excluded for a number of people on the IG platform because of the regulations by the central authorities. So the way to get in touch with this sort of drop on cryptocurrencies is to look at the likes of Coinbase, the world's largest publicly listed cryptocurrency exchange, down heavily in yesterday's session again down 5.2% yesterday after big declines over the last couple of weeks or so because of that drop in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor more videos from us here at IGTV join us on Twitter at IGcom, Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel. you"

        "content": "The major cryptocurrency Bitcoin has experienced a significant collapse, triggering nearly $1 billion in market liquidation. This sharp decline has been accompanied by a series of unfavorable developments, raising concerns about potential ongoing market pressures.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, the cryptocurrency market has undergone approximately $1.04 billion worth of total liquidations, with a substantial $835.8 million attributed to long positions within the past 24 hours. This period saw a significant downturn in the crypto market, marked by one of the most severe sell-offs of the year, leading Bitcoin\u2019s price to hit a two-month low within the $26,100 range.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s bearish trend since the start of the week possibly influenced by the report indicating that Elon Musk led SpaceX sold its Bitcoin holdings by a total of $373 million in both the previous year and 2021.\n\nBitcoin Hits Lowest in Two Months \u2013 Where\u2019s the Rebound?\n\nThere was an aggressive sell-off in Bitcoin, causing its price to plummet well below the confines of the descending wedge channel.\n\nBitcoin encountered a substantial liquidation totaling nearly $498.6 million overnight, with a significant portion of $386.6 million attributed to the liquidation of long positions.\n\nConsequently, this led to a 7.4% decline in Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization, bringing it to $516 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price appears to exhibit a slight positive movement, currently hovering around $26,510.\n\nBuyers are displaying activity around the $26,000 support level, potentially setting the stage for a rebound. Despite this, BTC has now descended beneath both the 100 and 200 Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) due to the ongoing sell-off.\n\nShould Bitcoin\u2019s trading persist below the 200-SMA, it could prompt further selling pressure until it reaches the robust support zone at $25,000.\n\nNonetheless, the RSI has entered an exceedingly oversold territory, indicative of significant bearish sentiment prevailing in the market. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is trending downward into the negative realm.\n\nIn order to safeguard against further selling pressure, buyers need to effectively maintain the Bitcoin price above the $26,000 mark."

It wasn\u2019t clear from the Journal report when SpaceX had sold its bitcoin.\n\nWhile broader markets are seeing a pullback in the selling as the dollar weakened, the sell-off in digital tokens amid thin liquidity continued unabated on Friday.\n\nThe top 100 digital tokens gauge fell 6 per cent. Ether slipped 3.4 per cent while Cardano and Solana fell 2.7 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, and was worth $US55.92 million, Coinglass said in its website. The total amount of bitcoin liquidations was the biggest for a single day since the market turmoil of June 2022, CoinDesk reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe $US25,000 level for bitcoin has the highest level of open interest among put options for August 25 expiry, according to data from Deribit. Should it drop below that level, sellers of those puts would be forced to liquidate or hedge their positions, putting further pressure on prices.\n\nETF support\n\nThe slide has almost erased the gains registered in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s surprise filing for a bitcoin ETF on June 15. After surging 72 per cent in the first quarter, bitcoin has declined almost 8 per cent since the end of March. The token tumbled 64 per cent last year amid a series of industry scandals and bankruptcies.\n\nSome degree of optimism crept into the market after Bloomberg News reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to allow the first exchange-traded funds based on Ether futures.\n\nThe drop in bitcoin follows a period in which the cryptocurrency traded in a narrow range for months. Gauges that measure the price swings of the original cryptocurrency have been trending down, with the 90-day volatility reaching its lowest since 2016 this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThere was optimism earlier in the week that a resolution to the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF would come this week but that passed with nothing coming out,\u201d Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at crypto investment firm LedgerPrime, said.\n\n\u201cFurthermore traditional markets have been weak all week with SPX and tech selling off, 10-year rates reaching highs and the dollar catching a bid, and China credit and econ data weakness, all of which are negatives for risk assets.\u201d\n\nBloomberg"

        "content": "Explained\n\nCrypto traders are currently scratching their heads as bitcoin looks set to register its biggest weekly decline in more than three months, dropping from $29,405 on Monday to $26,457 on Friday \u2013 an enormous drop that has affected the wider crytpo market.\n\nMore than $1bn was pulled out of the crypto market in 24 hours, with the highest value of liquidations \u2013 where people sell their stakes in an asset \u2013 in bitcoin since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November 2022.\n\nQuite why the crypto market has seen such a steep decline is still not fully certain, but it\u2019s likely to be a combination of factors, according to those watching the cryptocurrency world.\n\nThe most immediate impact was a report by the Wall Street Journal that SpaceX, the space exploration company set up by Elon Musk, had sold off its stock of bitcoin as part of a wider write-off of $373m within the company. The date of the sale is unknown, with the newspaper suggesting that the sales could have been staggered over the course of the past two years. A similar sell-off of bitcoin has happened within Tesla, another company run by Musk.\n\nThe report may have helped stoke a negative sentiment about bitcoin, given Musk\u2019s previous promotion of crypto to his millions of fans. Musk has not tweeted about it, further fuelling fears about what it means for crypto.\n\n\u201cThat type of news can be taken advantage of by shorters who will sell and expect the price to drop,\u201d says Patrick McCorry, a long-time crypto expert who works with investment firm Lemniscap. Those who decided to short assets managed to fuel further drops that then spread throughout the crypto markets.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just bitcoin that saw a collapse in its value, but also Ethereum, Ripple and others that traditionally echo the movements of bitcoin in the crypto market.\n\nBeyond internal trade movements, the drop is also likely down to the wider sentiments about global finance starting to trickle through to the world of crypto, which has traditionally claimed to operate outside the restrictions and responses of fiat currency.\n\nThe United States\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week announced it had pushed back a date by which it was expected to approve a spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF), that would track crypto\u2019s worth but on the traditional stock market. A decision on the ETF is now not expected until 2024.\n\nNews that the application for an ETF had been lodged in the first place had boosted bitcoin\u2019s value to yearly highs above $31,000. The news that the application had been postponed, albeit not abandoned, meant that the value of crypto assets more widely dropped from already inflated highs.\n\n\u201cWith the SEC delaying the spot ETF decisions, buyers got exhausted once the ETF narrative hype started to die down,\u201d says Miles Deutscher, a crypto analyst.\n\nBut Deutscher says this is far from the only reason why there has been a desertion of crypto in the last week. A broader shift in sentiment towards risk assets has been fuelled by fears of a recession, and has also hit traditional stock markets.\n\nThe FTSE 100, for instance, has dropped around 3.5 per cent this week thanks to lacklustre retail sales figures and the increasing clamp of inflation on discretionary income. Similar lulls have been seen in traditional financial markets worldwide.\n\nAnd more generally, crypto traders are waiting to see how significant decisions that could shape the investment market will shake out. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crypto lull with investors eagerly awaiting an SEC spot ETF decision alongside an update in the ongoing Binance and Coinbase versus SEC cases,\u201d says Deutscher. \u201cUntil there are structural changes in either of these catalysts, crypto will likely trade alongside risk.\u201d\n\nThe issue \u2013 as with most financial markets \u2013 is that when big players start to move, the rest of the market can fall like dominoes behind them. \u201cIf the price drops enough, like yesterday, then traders with certain positions can get liquidated,\u201d says McCorry. And that can trigger a repeated response that amplifies any movements into something far bigger. \u201cWhen you get liquidated, it can lead to more coins being sold, so then the price drops more,\u201d he adds.\n\nHowever, McCorry doesn\u2019t believe this is a death spiral. The price of cryptocurrency assets has long yo-yoed up and down, with huge highs and crashing lows. Those who have been engaged in the market for the long term began making jokes about the situation, mockingly saying that the last week had caused them to lose their faith in crypto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another day in crypto,\u201d he says."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) fell around 12% on Thursday, causing the big crypto to trade under the $26,000 psychological level. The price of the most favorite crypto began the day on August 17 at $28,700 before tumbling to a low of $25,234 on Coinbase.\n\nAnalysts say that the latest crash was triggered by a number of factors including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX reportedly offloading its Bitcoin, a Chinese property giant going, and fears of more interest rate hikes.\n\nWhile there appears to be no consensus as to why the markets suddenly dropped, the dip provides an opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin at a discount.\n\nCould BTC Provide a Buying Opportunity at $24,400?\n\nData from Trading and CoinMarketCap shows that BTC is currently in hands of the bears as it hovers around $26,427. The pioneer cryptocurrency is down 7% on the day and 10% over the last seven days. More than $1 billion has been wiped off its market capitalization to $514 billion. The daily trading volume is up 110% to $34.5 billion, attesting to the increasing transaction activity as fear, doubt and uncertainty grips the market.\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index has dropped from yesterday\u2019s neutral value at 37 to the \u201cFear zone\u201d at 37. According to Alternative, the firm that analyzes \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d around Bitcoin, fear can be a sign that investors are too worried about their investments and hence sell to minimize their losses.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index\n\nThe BTC/USD daily chart below shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving within the negative region. The price strength at 20 suggested that the bears were in full control of the Bitcoin price.\n\nAs such, the price could drop further from the current position with 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level providing support at $25,975. Other levels to watch on the downside are the $25,500 support zone, yesterday\u2019s swing low at $25,234 and the $25,000 psychological level.\n\nLosing these levels would see Bitcoin drop to revisit the $24,410 level, embraced by the 123.6% retracement level. This would represent a 7% drop from the current price.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\n\n\nOn the positive side, the RSI showed that Bitcoin is oversold, meaning that a recovery could be on the cards as seller exhaustion kicks in. If this happens, BTC may rise from the current level with the first line of resistance emerging from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $25,558.\n\nAdditional barriers are found at the $27,000 psychological level, the $23.6% retracement level and the 50-day SMA at $28,397. Bitcoin has to complete the full retracement to $28,700 and climb higher to confirm a sustained recovery.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
