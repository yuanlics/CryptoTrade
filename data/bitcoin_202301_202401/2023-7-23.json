        "title": "Bitcoin falls sharply ahead of Fed meeting and as investors weigh Binance concerns - CNBC",
        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nThe reason behind the sharpness in the drop is unclear, although the move coincided with a Wall Street Journal report augmenting recent anxiety from investors around Binance. Specifically, CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao reportedly suggested in private conversation in 2019 that Binance affiliates had accounted for a portion of trading volume around the time it launched its U.S. trading arm. There are questions about whether this activity constituted \"wash trading\" aimed at inflating volume.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by more than 3% at $29,121.60, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it sank as low as $28,995.02, its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply and suddenly to start the week as investors awaited a major Federal Reserve policy decision and digested concerns around Binance.\n\nBinance is the largest crypto exchange in the world. It was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month and is at the center of a Department of Justice investigation that's likely to end with a consent decree or settlement, CNBC previously reported. Federal prosecutors have been weighing anti-money laundering violations and sanctions evasion charges, allegations that would make it difficult for Binance or founder Zhao to continue to get licenses to operate.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the big move could be put on the Binance story, however.\n\n\"You could probably chalk it up to technicals or flows,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. \"$30,000 is a big deal, and it makes sense that bitcoin investors are feeling more nervous around these levels. Recoveries aren't always a straight line up.\"\n\nElsewhere, investors are also watching what the Federal Reserve does at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bitcoin is still fluctuating within a narrow range for a little more than a week, and it will likely continue to do so until the conclusion of this week's FOMC meeting,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"The market has almost fully priced in another 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed this week and is paying close attention to whether they are going to carry out another by the end of this year as FOMC's previous economic outlook suggested.\"\n\nRate increases helped pull bitcoin's price lower throughout 2022, which was already filled with several negative catalysts for the industry. Despite the recent resilience in bitcoin and rally in equities, recession concerns remain as traders weigh the lagged effect of rate hikes and recent signals of slowing in the economy.\n\n\"We have yet to see June's personal consumption expenditure \u2026 and they will not likely hasten to make the decision to halt rate hikes until they have more data and are more confident that inflation is coming down,\" Hasegawa added. \"This means that FOMC's rate decisions henceforth will likely continue to be 'live,' and bitcoin may not successfully break out of $31,500 for another while.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed reporting."

That increase, combined with the April 2024 halving set to slash daily mining rewards to $12 million, means the price of bitcoin would have to rise substantially to meet an equilibrium among buyers and sellers.\n\n\"This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand. Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halvening,\" Fundstrat said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalving, also known as halvening, is seen as bullish for bitcoin, as cutting the reward given to miners in half is cap to limit the supply of bitcoins and has historically led to price increases.\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this month, Fundstrat's head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell, explained that a multiplier effect in the range of 4.0x to 5.0x is reasonable to assume for the bitcoin network.\n\n\"This means that $1 of demand can result in a $4 to $5 increase in market cap,\" Farrell said.\n\nFarrell sees a 75% probability that a spot bitcoin ETF is approved in the near term as a number of firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, await word from the SEC on their application filings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We anticipate [a bitcoin ETF] would attract new investors and generate increased demand for bitcoin,\" Farrell said.\n\nAnd if approved, a bitcoin ETF from BlackRock could lead to one of the biggest ETF launches on record, Fundstrat said, adding that it could ultimately break the record holder, the Invesco QQQ ETF, in its first year of inflows. The QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, attracted $36 billion in inflows in its first year following its March 1999 launch.\n\nFundstrat said bitcoin ETFs could eventually eclipse the precious metals ETF market, which holds nearly $230 billion in assets.\n\n\"Bitcoin ETF eventually could become >$300 billion category,\" Fundstrat said. And that surge in demand is what could help put a triple-digit price tag on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFundstrat isn't the only firm with a $100,000+ price target for bitcoin. Earlier this month, Standard Chartered said a positive feedback-loop could propel the cryptocurrency past $120,000 next year."

        "title": "How bitcoin ATMs are revolutionizing the remittance industry - Vending Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin ATMs have emerged as a disruptive force in the remittance industry, revolutionizing the way cross-border transactions are conducted.\n\nThe remittance industry plays a vital role in facilitating the transfer of funds across borders, connecting individuals and families separated by vast distances. However, traditional remittance methods often come with high fees, lengthy processing times and a lack of transparency. Enter bitcoin ATMs, a disruptive technology that is revolutionizing the remittance industry.\n\nIn this article, we will explore how bitcoin ATMs are reshaping the remittance landscape, providing faster, cheaper and more secure cross-border transactions. We will delve into the technical aspects of bitcoin ATMs and their impact on the remittance industry, supported by references from the field of technology and information technology.\n\nChallenges of traditional remittance methods\n\nTraditional remittance methods, such as wire transfers or money transfer operators, have long been the go-to options for sending money across borders. However, these methods come with several challenges.\n\nFirst, they often involve high transaction fees, which can significantly reduce the amount of money received by the recipient. Second, the processing times for traditional remittances can be lengthy, causing delays in urgent financial matters. Third, the lack of transparency in traditional remittance systems can make it difficult to track the progress of a transfer or verify its authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding bitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs, also known as BTMs, are self-service kiosks that allow users to buy or sell bitcoin using cash or card payments. These machines provide a physical interface for individuals to interact with the bitcoin network and access the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin ATMs are connected to the internet and facilitate real-time transactions, converting fiat currency into Bitcoin or vice versa. The technical components of a bitcoin ATM typically include a secure vault, a cash dispenser, a touchscreen interface and a connection to the bitcoin blockchain network.\n\nBenefits of bitcoin ATMs\n\nFollowing are the benefits of bitcoin ATMs for remittance.\n\n1. Reduced costs. Bitcoin ATMs offer significant cost advantages over traditional remittance methods. By bypassing intermediaries and using the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin ATMs eliminate the need for expensive currency conversions and high transaction fees associated with traditional remittances. This translates into more money reaching the intended recipient, especially in regions where even a small reduction in fees can have a substantial impact on the recipient's livelihood.\n\n2. Faster transactions. Traditional remittance methods often involve complex processes and multiple intermediaries, resulting in delays in fund transfers. Bitcoin ATMs, on the other hand, enable near-instantaneous transactions, especially when sending bitcoin from one ATM to another. This speed of transfer can be particularly beneficial in urgent situations, such as emergencies or time-sensitive financial obligations.\n\n3. Enhanced transparency and security. Bitcoin ATMs leverage the transparency and security features of blockchain technology to provide a traceable and tamper-resistant record of transactions. Each transaction is recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, bitcoin ATMs employ various security measures, including encryption, biometric authentication and tamper-evident mechanisms to safeguard user transactions and funds.\n\nDisrupting the remittance industry\n\nFollowing are disruptive factors of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry.\n\n1. Financial Inclusion. Bitcoin ATMs have the potential to promote financial inclusion by providing access to digital currencies for individuals who are unbanked or underbanked. In regions where traditional banking services are limited, Bitcoin ATMs offer a gateway to the global financial system, allowing users to send and receive funds across borders without relying on traditional banking infrastructure.\n\n2. Remittance Innovation. Bitcoin ATMs are driving innovation in the remittance industry by challenging traditional models and introducing new ways of conducting cross-border transactions. The decentralized nature of bitcoin eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and streamlining the remittance process. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology ensures transaction transparency and enhances security, addressing the pain points of traditional remittance methods.\n\n3. Market disruption. Bitcoin ATMs are disrupting the remittance market by providing an alternative that offers lower fees, faster transactions and greater control over funds. As the adoption of bitcoin ATMs grows, traditional remittance providers may face increased competition, prompting them to reevaluate their business models and embrace new technologies to stay relevant in the evolving landscape.\n\nReal-world impact\n\nIn countries like Venezuela and Argentina, where hyperinflation and economic instability have led to a surge in cryptocurrency adoption, crypto ATMs have played a crucial role in enabling individuals to send and receive remittances from abroad. These machines have provided a lifeline for people who would otherwise struggle with limited access to traditional banking services.\n\nCountries like the Philippines and Thailand, which have a significant number of migrant workers sending remittances to their home countries, are experiencing the benefits of cryptocurrency ATMs. These machines offer a more cost-effective and efficient way for migrant workers to send money back to their families, bypassing traditional remittance channels and avoiding hefty fees.\n\nRegulatory considerations and outlook\n\nThe regulatory landscape for bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry varies across jurisdictions. Governments and financial regulators are actively addressing the legal and compliance aspects of cryptocurrency transactions, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Striking a balance between consumer protection and fostering innovation will be crucial in shaping the future of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry.\n\nAs technology advances, we can expect further improvements in bitcoin ATM functionalities. Integration with mobile wallets, expanded support for additional cryptocurrencies and enhanced user interfaces are among the potential developments that will make bitcoin ATMs even more user-friendly and accessible. The continued growth of bitcoin ATMs, coupled with evolving regulatory frameworks, will pave the way for a more efficient and inclusive remittance industry.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have emerged as a disruptive force in the remittance industry, revolutionizing the way cross-border transactions are conducted. With their ability to offer reduced costs, faster transactions, enhanced transparency and increased financial inclusion, bitcoin ATMs provide a viable alternative to traditional remittance methods.\n\nThe technical foundations of bitcoin ATMs, coupled with real-world case studies and regulatory considerations, highlight the significant impact these machines are making in transforming the remittance landscape. As the technology continues to evolve and regulatory frameworks mature, the future of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry holds immense potential for driving financial empowerment and global connectivity.\n\nNaveed Ahmed, director of marketing at Localcoin, brings a decade-long experience in brand marketing and campaign performance, scaling over 40 DTC and B2B brands through paid media.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin miners are creating a virtuous circle that could propel the token's price beyond already-bullish forecasts, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick told Insider.\n\nThat's as miners often sell fewer tokens when the price climbs, a bullish tendency that led him say earlier this month that $120,000 is possible next year, representing 300% upside from current levels.\n\nIn a follow-up interview, Insider asked Kendrick: if higher prices cause miners to sell fewer tokens, further boosting prices, then would even higher prices fuel a positive-feedback loop that takes bitcoin past $120,000?\n\nYes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And so your point about this becoming self-fulfilling, I suspect is actually a very important driver,\" he said.\n\nMiners predominantly sell bitcoin to cover costs. But as the price rises and previous debt struggles in the industry ebb away, miners are letting go of less bitcoin.\n\nAnother tailwind is the coin's upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.\n\n\"Then if you add in some of the other things, like getting close to the halving cycle, et cetera, then that sort of adds,\" Kendrick said. \"And then yeah, the cycle in theory just keeps going.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiners also have little reason outside of bitcoin's price moves to sell the token, he said. Some of this is on account of the culture surrounding the industry, with many miners holding on in the anticipation that bitcoin eventually reaches stellar highs.\n\n\"So they basically want to have a company that starts out when prices are cheap, get cheaper electricity and stuff, and then hold on. It's like a super-leveraged play,\" he said.\n\nKendrick has been bullish on bitcoin this year, and in April he said it would hit $100,000 in 2024, citing a number of other factors beyond miner profitability. Examples included bitcoin's safe-haven reputation, regulatory adaptations, institutional interest, alternative currency fall-off, and less volatility.\n\nNow, he told Insider that a few of these factors also suggest more upside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, BlackRock's interest in creating a bitcoin spot ETF signals growing demand from the investment firm's clients, while the Federal Reserve's expected end on its rate-hiking cycle would marginally help bitcoin.\n\nThe one factor that Kendrick would reassess was his idea that bitcoin would gain from disinvestment in other crypto, or so-called altcoins.\n\nFor this, he noted the recent courtroom victory of Ripple over the Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the firm in 2020 over its cryptocurrency XRP.\n\nHowever, a judge recently ruled in favor of Ripple, saying XRP is not a security, meaning it's outside the SEC's regulatory reach. The news sparked a rally in altcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So the assumption is, well, if Ripple is not [a security], then these are also not,\" he said. \"So that's why you had big bounces in like Solana, as an example.\"\n\nHow long this tailwind for altcoins will last is uncertain, Kendrick said, adding that any institutional success in establishing bitcoin ETFs would prompt a renewed focus on apex tokens."

        "content": "The Bitcoin network has mined block 800,000, with just 40,000 left to mine before the network\u2019s next mining reward halving.\n\nThe 800,000th block contained 3721 transactions at 1.64 megabytes, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) trading at $29,815 on July 24, as market researcher Dylan LeClair noted on Twitter:\n\nThe milestone was widely shared across the social media platform on July 24, with Bitcoin proponents and industry commentators highlighting the milestone as an indicator of network security and resilience:\n\nThe #Bitcoin network just produced block number 800,000.\n\n\n\n800,000 blocks without a central bank.\n\n\n\n800,000 blocks without a government.\n\n\n\n800,000 blocks without a CEO.\n\n\n\n800,000 blocks without asking for permission. pic.twitter.com/hf8RpC3jlP \u2014 Walker\u26a1\ufe0f (@WalkerAmerica) July 24, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s block height refers to the location on the blockchain relative to how many blocks preceded it \u2014 back to the genesis block, which was the founding block of the network. Blocks contain transactions and data bundled into blocks by network miners.\n\nThe metric acts as a chronological order of transactions and blocks of the network, with each new block connected to the previous one in the chain. This allows users to identify the order in which transactions are recorded.\n\nBlock height also serves as a measure of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s immutability. The more blocks added to the chain, the more computing power is required for a malicious actor to attempt to tamper with previous blocks.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners still bullish despite toughest bear market yet \u2014 Hut8, Foundry, Braiins\n\nAs previously explained by Cointelegraph, a 50% attack would require an attacker to gain enough computing power to monopolize generating new blocks and receive rewards since they\u2019re able to prevent other miners from completing blocks. The attacker could also reverse transactions.\n\nBlock height also serves as a measure used to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty. Proof-of-work-based blockchain networks have their mining difficulty adjusted periodically based on the total computational power of the network and the time it took to mine a certain number of previous blocks.\n\nThe Bitcoin network generates a new block roughly every 10 minutes. If more hashing power is added to the network, it impacts this metric and automatically adjusts the mining difficulty every two weeks to maintain equilibrium.\n\nBlock height also dictates the amount of Bitcoin rewarded to miners for adding a new block to the network. Bitcoin is designed to have a block-halving event every four years or 210,000 blocks on the chain.\n\nCountdown to the next Bitcoin halving. Source: Nicehash\n\nThe initial block reward was 50 BTC back in 2009 before it subsequently halved to 25 BTC in 2012, 12.5 BTC in 2016, and the present-day 6.25 BTC in 2020.\n\nThe next halving event should occur in April 2024, with the latest block reward halving to 3.125 BTC. Halving events historically coincide with major price rallies for BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith less than a year to the next halving, macro events have impacted the price of BTC following its all-time high of $69,000 in 2021.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin network passed block 800,000 on Monday, marking another major milestone in the history of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThis also means that the next Bitcoin halving event\u2014they occur every four years, reducing miners' rewards by half, and is set to occur at block 840,000\u2014is now less than nine months away (or 40,000 blocks), according to Bitcoinblockhalf.com.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the mining of the 800,000th block, we find ourselves in a fascinating period of Bitcoin's life cycle. This is indeed a key milestone on the path to the next halving, and it certainly adds a layer of excitement to the already vibrant ecosystem,\u201d Matt Prusak, Chief Commercial Officer at Miami-based Bitcoin mining company US Bitcoin Corp told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 800,000th block was mined at a time when Bitcoin hash rate\u2014the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on the network\u2014is close to historical highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty\u2014another key metric measuring how challenging it is to find a new block\u2014hit a new all-time high at the most recent adjustment about two weeks ago.\n\nAccording to Prusak, these two metrics \u201crepresent an ever-evolving dance between technology and economy,\u201d and as the halving is approaching, the current trajectory suggests they will continue their upward trend.\n\n\u201cThis is mainly a reflection of the increased competition among miners, as well as advancements in mining technology that contribute to the overall efficiency and security of the network,\u201d he said.\n\nPhil Harvey, CEO of digital asset management consultant and data center operation provider Sabre56, shares similar views, saying we can witness similarities to the previous halving event in 2020\u2014\u201dwith only the fittest set to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cPre-halving, increased hash power is supporting the network\u2019s sustained growth and robustness. This will only rise into the halving, reaching all-time highs as miners push to get miners online,\u201d Harvey told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFocus on Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe latest milestone also came amid the increased attention to Bitcoin ETFs, with many in the industry hoping that after years of rejections the U.S. Securities and Exchange will finally approve the investment tool claimed to be highly sought after by American investors.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the effect of micro and macro events, such as Bitcoin ETFs and broader regulatory developments, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex interaction between these aspects and market dynamics,\u201d said Prusak.\n\nAccording to him, the possible approval of a Bitcoin ETF could indeed be \u201ca significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency space,\u201d resulting in a more streamlined avenue for institutional and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin, and hence potentially driving up demand and price.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is important to stress that, while these factors may have an impact, the inherent properties of Bitcoin\u2014its scarcity, decentralization, and immutability\u2014have always been its primary value propositions,\u201d added Prusak. \u201cThis is perhaps even more apparent as we move closer to the halving event, reminding us once again of the deflationary nature of this asset.\u201d\n\nWhat's in the cards for Bitcoin\n\nDespite the high expectations among investors, the price of Bitcoin plunged below $30,000 on Monday, which, according to Harvey, also bears consequences for miners\u2014the sector\u2019s key players.\n\n\u201cThe market's downturn means facility expansions are below expectations, due to capital restraints and precautionary behavior\u2014impacting deployment. Many industry players have offline equipment in warehouses, and are now scrambling to secure partners or facilities to house them,\u201d the Sabre56 CEO told Decrypt.\n\nHe also reminded that miners\u2019 profits in recent months have been supported by both price increase and a sustained transaction fee increase. However, with difficulty and hash power increasing, miners are now between a 30-50% margin at operations run at hosting costs of $0.07 - $0.05 per kWh.\n\n\u201cAs before, positive revenues from this will be curbed post-halving, until BTC increases in value, and hash power and difficulty starts to reduce,\u201d said Harvey.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUS Bitcoin Corp\u2019s Prusak also pointed out that while no one can predict with absolute certainty what\u2019s going to happen in terms of expectations for the months leading up to the halving, historically halving events have been periods of increased attention and speculation.\n\n\u201cThis, combined with the current macro events, might lead to heightened market volatility,\" Prusak said. \"As always, participants should proceed with caution, mindful of the risks associated with such periods of uncertainty.\"\n\nStill, he stressed, while the industry is \u201cindeed sailing in uncharted waters, the core tenets of Bitcoin remain robust.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt continues to be a compelling combination of technology, economics, and social dynamics. We are at the precipice of what could be another transformative period in the life of Bitcoin, one we eagerly look forward to navigating,\u201d Prusak said."

        "content": "A dormant Bitcoin (BTC) wallet holding over 1,037 Bitcoin \u2014 worth $31 million at current prices \u2014 has suddenly awoken after an 11-year slumber, transferring out its entire stash.\n\nThe 1,037 BTC was transferred amid a Bitcoin price of $29,956 and took effect at block height 799701, or approximately 10:51 am UTC on July 22, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nThe long-dormant address obtained the 1,037 BTC on April 11, 2012, when Bitcoin's price was only $4.92, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain stated on July 22. This means at the time, the stash was only worth around $5,108.\n\nA BTC whale that has been dormant for 11 years transferred all 1,037.42 $BTC($37.8M) to a new address\"bc1qtl\" an hour ago.\n\n\n\nThe whale received 1,037.42 $BTC($5,107 at that time) on Apr 11, 2012, when the price was $4.92.https://t.co/k8ZmO5vc8X pic.twitter.com/xBaw2dQfY8 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 22, 2023\n\nData from blockchain aggregator Blockchair shows that wallet address \u201cbc1qt180\u2026\u201d \u2014 which appears to be a fresh wallet \u2014 was the recipient of the $31 million.\n\nThe balance of the original Bitcoin wallet peaked at $71.6 million when BTC reached its all-time high of $69,044 on Nov. 10, according to cryptocurrency price platform CoinGecko.\n\nThe United States government has been one of the biggest BTC movers of late, having transferred out nearly 10,000 BTC \u2014 worth $299 million \u2014 in a series of transactions on July 12 in relation to the Silk Road seizure.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the transactions were sent to cryptocurrency exchanges or if it remains in the custody of the Justice Department.\n\nMore mysterious wallet movements\n\nOn June 11, another mysterious Bitcoin whale moved 1,400 BTC \u2014 worth $36 million at the time \u2014 to a Pay-to-Taproot address. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes the motive behind this transaction may have been to enhance privacy.\n\nEarlier in April, another Bitcoin address transferred 2,071 BTC \u2014 worth $60 million \u2014 nearly 10 years after catching BTC at $663, according to Lookonchain.\n\nThree months earlier, a massive $250 million transfer of 26,056 BTC was made by another Bitcoin address.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) enters the last full week of July on an uncertain footing as $30,000 becomes resistance.\n\nIn what promises to be an exciting, if potentially nerve-racking, week for traders, BTC price action is staring down a combination of volatility triggers.\n\nChief among these is the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates, this headlining an important slew of macro data releases.\n\nSome hope these alone will be enough to shake Bitcoin out of its month-long trading range, which has barely moved from the $30,000 mark. The market has so far offered little cues as to where it might head next.\n\nThat said, traders have become impatient and increasingly believe that BTC/USD will ultimately break down from current levels to head toward $25,000 or lower.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at the main factors in the debate over BTC price performance as July comes to a close.\n\nBTC price tags $29,000 in bearish start to week\n\nBitcoin delivered a classic volatility burst into the July 23 weekly close, giving bulls a glimpse of $30,000 support potentially returning.\n\nHowever, this was short-lived, and with hours left to go until the weekly candle close, BTC/USD retraced its last-minute gains to end the week at almost exactly $30,000.\n\nOvernight price action was still weaker; at the time of writing, Bitcoin was headed toward $29,000, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nOverall, however, the all-too-familiar range continues to endure.\n\nAs the weekend came to a close, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, highlighted what he called the \u201ccrucial area\u201d for bulls to break through.\n\n\u201cThe crucial level didn\u2019t break for Bitcoin, so we\u2019ll continue the sideways chop,\u201d he continued on the day.\n\n\u201cThe scenarios remain the same; - Longs above $30,200-30,400 - Longs when we get to $29,000.\u201c\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe/Twitter\n\nPopular trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that the spike to $30,300 had effectively opened up and already closed a CME futures gap.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall for the weekend deviations,\u201d he told Twitter followers.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/Twitter\n\nA cautiously optimistic take on the past month\u2019s range came from fellow trader Credible Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin could avoid more significant losses.\n\n\u201cFor the last 30 days price has been within a tight range and aggregate OI has oscillated between 2 key levels,\u201d he summarized.\n\n\u201cPrice ranges, OI builds, then we see a flush up/down which resets OI before the cycle repeats. If it continues, downside should be limited here at the lows.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFed rate hike decision leads \u201caction packed week\u201d\n\nOne event dominates the macro landscape this week \u2014 not only in crypto.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet on July 26 to decide how far to raise benchmark interest rates \u2014 if at all.\n\nUnlike last month, markets have little doubt that a hike is to come with language from Fed officials leading them to practically unanimously predict a 0.25% increase.\n\nAccording to the latest data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, the odds currently stand at 99.8%.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nThe week\u2019s macro data releases will only come after FOMC, leaving no room for these to sway a decision in time. The releases are no less important, however, and include Q2 GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print.\n\n\u201cNothing like an action packed week in the markets. 20% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings along with a Fed meeting and inflation data to top it off,\u201d financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a Twitter summary.\n\n\u201cAfter a couple weeks of low volatility, things should get interesting this week. It\u2019s a great week to be a trader.\u201d\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\n\n\n1. Consumer Confidence data - Tuesday\n\n\n\n2. New Home Sales data - Wednesday\n\n\n\n3. Fed Interest Rate Decision - Wednesday\n\n\n\n4. Q2 2023 GDP data - Thursday\n\n\n\n5.

Analyzing the hash ribbons metric, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto asset manager Capriole Investments, flagged a new \u201ccapitulation\u201d phase.\n\nWhile absent from the market since late 2022, when Bitcoin still suffered the consequences of the FTX meltdown, a capitulation is nothing for traders to fear, Edwards argued.\n\nDespite this, he called the explosive growth in the hash rate of the past seven months \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a Hash Ribbon capitulation. AKA a slowing in Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate growth after what has been an incredible (unsustainable) 50% increase in 2023,\u201d he commented last week.\n\n\u201cHR capitulation is not a sell signal, but it\u2019s also not bullish. Risk management warranted until growth resumes.\u201d\n\nBitcoin hash ribbons chart. Source: Charles Edwards/Twitter\n\nCointelegraph continues to cover the status quo among miners, with various theories emerging over recent BTC selling behavior.\n\nNVT taps highest since 2019\n\nAs Bitcoin mines its 800,000th block, a classic on-chain metric is delivering a similar signal that \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 BTC price conditions may be overheated.\n\nThe network value to transaction (NVT) ratio, which divides the Bitcoin market cap by the U.S. dollar value of daily on-chain transactions, has hit four-year highs.\n\nNVT seeks to give an indication of when the on-chain volume is out of sync with overall network value, but its implications can vary.\n\nAs explained by its creator, analyst Willy Woo, NVT spikes can occur in both bull markets and periods of \u201cunsustainable\u201d price growth.\n\n\u201cWhen Bitcoin`s NVT is high, it indicates that its network valuation is outstripping the value being transmitted on its payment network, this can happen when the network is in high growth and investors are valuing it as a high return investment, or alternatively when the price is in an unsustainable bubble,\u201d he wrote in an accompanying introduction to the metric on his analytics site, Woobull.\n\nBitcoin NVT ratio chart (screenshot). Source: Woobull\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, Capriole\u2019s Edwards argued that NVT was still in check versus extreme highs, such as those seen during 2021.\n\n\u201cNVT is currently trading at a normal level,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cgiven its normalized reading today, it doesn\u2019t tell us much; just that Bitcoin is fairly valued according to this metric alone.\u201d\n\nLong-term holders control 75% of BTC supply\n\nA silver lining in the making? Bitcoin\u2019s available supply continues to shrink behind the scenes.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin can still hit $19K, warns trader ahead of BTC price \u2018big move\u2019\n\nAs noted by various market participants, the amount of BTC on offer for purchase shows enduring conviction among its most ardent hodlers.\n\n55% of the supply has now remained dormant for at least two years, and 29% for five years or more, data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode states.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply has reached a new ATH of 14.52M BTC, equivalent to 75% of the circulating supply,\u201d additional analysis highlighted this week.\n\n\u201cThis suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the amount of BTC in the hands of so-called long-term holders, or LTHs, defined as entities hodling coins for 155 days or more.\n\nBitcoin long-term hodler supply annotated chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to rise above the overhead resistance at $31,000, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dive below the $29,500 support. This suggests that a catalyst may be needed for the price to break out from its range.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting son July 25 and 26 are important events to keep an eye on. The FedWatch Tool shows a 99.2% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in the meeting. If that happens, the markets may not witness a knee-jerk reaction as the hike seems to have been priced in. However, any surprise move by the Fed could thrust the price out of the range.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nSeveral analysts expect the range to break soon, but there is no consensus on the direction of the breakout. If the price breaks below the range, analysts expect a significant downside. Some are even projecting a fall closer to $20,000.\n\nIf Bitcoin moves higher, select altcoins could attract buyers. Let\u2019s study the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could turn positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains pinned below the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,036) for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,979).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests that the bulls have not given up and they are buying on every minor dip. The repeated failure of the bears to pull the BTC/USDT pair lower may attract buyers.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally toward the overhead resistance of $31,000. A charge above the $31,000-to-$32,400 zone could clear the path for a possible rally to $40,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that bears are making a comeback. The pair may then slump toward the support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart are flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nIf bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could attempt a rally to $30,500 and then to $31,000. The important support to watch on the downside is $29,500. If this level crumbles, the pair may decline to $27,500.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) has been trading inside a large range between $5.50 and $9.50 for the past several months. The bears pulled the price below the range on June 10, but they could not build upon this advantage.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price back into the range on June 21 and are currently attempting to drive the LINK/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance of $9.50. Both moving averages have turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in control.\n\nThe bears will try to stall the up-move in the zone between $8.50 and $8.80, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may soar to $9.50. The important support to watch on the downside is $7.50 and then the 20-day EMA ($7.05).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe correction on the four-hour chart has reached the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the pair could surge to $8.46. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then reach $8.80.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That could tempt short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price down to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to $6.50.\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.36) has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline, the FIL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $6.50 and, eventually, to the pattern target of $7.30.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the neckline and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($4.12), it will suggest that the bulls have lost their grip. The pair may then skid to $3.50 and later to $3.29.\n\nFIL/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $4.74, but if this level is crossed, the pair could retest the neckline.\n\nThe bears are expected to defend this level aggressively, but if bulls do not allow the price to slip below the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally above the neckline increases.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. That may drag the pair to $4.14.\n\nRelated: Ripple effect? Stellar (XLM) is catching up to XRP price gains\n\nSynthetix price analysis\n\nSynthetix (SNX) is attempting to break out from a basing pattern, but the bulls are facing solid resistance in the zone between $3.40 and $3.56.\n\nSNX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDuring the pullback, the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($2.56), which is a positive sign. This suggests that dips are being bought. Buyers will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the SNX/USDT pair may start a rally to the next resistance at $4.50.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the relief rally in the overhead zone and yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($2.19).\n\nSNX/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-day EMA, but the bulls are trying to guard the 50-day SMA. This suggests that lower levels continue to attract buyers.\n\nIf bulls propel the price above $3.15, the momentum could pick up and the pair could retest the resistance at $3.30. This is an important level to watch for because if it gives way, the pair may resume the next leg of the up-move and hit $3.82.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to tug the price below the moving averages. The pair could then collapse to $2.52.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nThe recovery in the Theta Network (THETA) is facing selling near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.83.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, a positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA ($0.77). This indicates that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.\n\nA break and close above $0.83 could open the doors for a further rise to the 50% retracement level of $0.91 and, thereafter, to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.99.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. The THETA/USDT pair could then descend to $0.66.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel pattern. The bulls are trying to arrest the pullback at the moving averages and resume the up-move. Generally, in a channel, the price bounces off the support and reaches the resistance.\n\nIf the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $0.85. If they succeed, the pair may climb to the resistance of the channel near $0.90.\n\nContrarily, if the price slips below the 50-day SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support of the channel. A break below this level could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Ether moved higher to near US$1,900, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains. Cardano\u2019s ADA token led the winners. In other markets, NFTs traded flat, while U.S. equity futures did the same. The week ahead brings lots more earnings in the U.S. for investors to get a picture of the state of the economy, while the Federal Reserve has a two-day meeting where it\u2019s expected to raise interest rates.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.33% over the 24 hours to US$30,059 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ether gained 1.73% to US$1,887.\n\nHowever, both tokens have yet to make up losses for the past seven days, with Bitcoin off 0.37% for the week, while Ether is sitting on a weekly loss of 1.73%. Bitcoin fell back later in the morning.\n\nTrading in Bitcoin and Ether will remain rangebound until the Fed decision on rates on July 27, Mark Wong, senior trader at Hong Kong-based digital asset platform Hashkey Group, said in a Friday newsletter. \u201cA rate hike is all but priced in with an implied probability of 99.8% from the futures market,\u201d Wong said.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also traded higher Monday, with Cardano\u2019s ADA token leading the winners with a gain of 3.01% to US$0.3169 and up 0.59% for the week.\n\nInput Output Global, one of the developers behind the Cardano blockchain, last week said Mithril \u2013 a Cardano stake-based signature scheme \u2013 was nearing its mainnet launch to improve the node syncing and security of the Cardano network.\n\nOn the regulatory front, a portion of the court\u2019s recent verdict in the Ripple case was \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday in documents filed in its on-going lawsuit against Singapore-based Terraform Labs, hinting that the SEC would challenge the Ripple ruling.\n\nThe SEC in February charged Singapore-based Terraform Labs Pte and its co-founder Do Hyeong Kwon with orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving an algorithmic stablecoin and other crypto asset securities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.14% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion, while trading volume rose 13.56% to US$24.5 billion.\n\nForkast 500 flat, OpenSea starts NFT swapping\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,674.69 as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indices moved lower, while the Cardano index logged gains.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume rose 1.30% in the past 24 hours to US$17.24 million, according to data from CryptoSlam, with the volume on Ethereum totaling US$12.02 million or more than two thirds of the total.\n\nAmong all NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the 24-hour sales volume at US$1.60 million, edging up 1.19%. Volumes traded mixed in the top five NFT collections.\n\nOpenSea, the world\u2019s second-largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, launched its \u201cDeals\u201d function on Friday, which allows its NFT holders to directly swap their collections with each other and include wrapped Ether (WETH) in their offers to sweeten up the transactions.\n\nElsewhere, the slump in value of Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s first NFT caught the attention of mainstream media including CNBC and the Economic Times on Sunday. The NFT, based on Dorsey\u2019s first Twitter post, sold at over US$2.1 million in 2021, but the highest offer for the NFT is now 1 ETH (US$1,875), according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is looking rather flat in the Forkast 500 index, (which) reflects that continued downtrend we\u2019ve been watching most of the year,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said on Friday. The Forkast 500 NFT index has dropped over 35% since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of January, the market almost completely slants right,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nUS equities await Fed, earnings\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures dipping and Nasdaq futures edging higher. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Friday.\n\nAsia\u2019s main stock indexes also traded mixed on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all gained, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve meets Wednesday and Thursday this week on interest rates and analysts overwhelmingly expect another 25-basis-point rate hike. The European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to raise its rates later this week.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise rates to the range of 5.25% to 5.5% on July 26, the highest since January 2001.\n\nWith a rate hike priced into many markets, the focus on the Fed meeting will be forward guidance on monetary policies. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde have flagged stubborn inflation as a concern, according to Bloomberg on Saturday.\n\nAlong with the Fed and ECB, Japan\u2019s central bank will also meet this week, but there is little likelihood of any change to its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nIn the U.S. this week, more than 150 U.S. corporations, including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, will release second-quarter results.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

She also admitted to saying she \"did not care\" if her ex-husband's new girlfriend \"was harmed during the murder.\"\n\nFelkins said she expected to receive a large life insurance payment after her ex-husband's death, which she requested to be made to look like an accident.

        "content": "An online carpet and flooring retailer based in the United Kingdom has bought Bitcoin (BTC) and put it on its balance sheet, following in the footsteps of Tesla, MicroStrategy and Real Bedford.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Paul Brewster, the CEO of Flooring Hut, explained:\n\n\u201cWe see it [Bitcoin] as an asset that has probably the best potential for growth of our capital reserves at the moment.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the company decided against keeping its cash reserves in a bank account, as Bitcoin could provide the greatest potential for providing returns, ultimately delivering better value for customers.\n\nAccording to Companies House, the government agency that maintains the register of U.K. companies, Flooring Hut\u2019s accounts from 2023 showed cash reserves of \u00a375,105, which at the time of writing could buy roughly 3.3 BTC.\n\nFlooring Hut\u2019s cash assets. Source: gov.uk\n\nMoreover, the company is Bitcoin-only. Brewster explained that \u201cBitcoin is an asset class in its own right,\u201d saying it is akin to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d While on a personal level, Brewster and his colleagues have an interest in the wider cryptocurrency space, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be putting those on the balance sheet at Flooring Hut any time soon,\u201d he said.\n\nFlooring Hut will not custody the coins with crypto companies such as Coinbase or the now-defunct FTX. Instead, the company will resist rug pulls and keep the Bitcoin in cold storage, Brewster added.\n\nThis bold decision by the online retailer operating in the 2 billion pound carpet industry is particularly surprising, as it\u2019s one of the \u201cvery few sectors where the application of technology has been severely lacking,\u201d Brewster explained. The Financial Times, one of the U.K.\u2019s most popular legacy finance publications, was quick to swipe at Flooring Hut on its page Alphaville.\n\nThe Financial Times pokes fun at the move. Source: FT\n\nIn the article, the FT explained that the Flooring Hut news \u201cis obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that\u2019s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\u201d The article\u2019s comments section is even more scathing, with one commenter exclaiming, \u201cThis is pure comedy!\u201d\n\nBrewster understands Bitcoin\u2019s somewhat negative portrayal in the mainstream media:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be mindful that people draw connotations from what they read in the media. When they see the word Bitcoin, they think, \u2018Oh, is this company legit?\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, businesses across the U.K. seek innovative ways to invest their capital, as cash sitting in the bank depreciates under high inflation. The U.K. and its currency, the pound, are suffering more acutely than the European Union. As Brewster explains, managing a business in 2023 in such trying economic conditions is about being \u201cprogressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvest that back into the company, which then leads to greater value for money for our customers, which gives us a competitive advantage over our competitors.\u201d\n\nThe company is heading down the path of a Bitcoin standard \u2014 building out a business with Bitcoin in mind. Next, it will explore the implementation of Bitcoin Lightning Network payments to complement its online Mastercard, Visa and PayPal payment options.\n\nPaying in Bitcoin is a small but growing trend in the U.K., particularly as the Lightning Network offers lower fees than existing payment providers.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin block 800,000 mined \u2014 What\u2019s next?\n\nThe price per Bitcoin is up more than 60% in 2023 in British pounds, starting on Jan.1 at \u00a313,700. Nonetheless, Bitcoin continues to be volatile. The price corrected 2% today, while some traders predict a price plummet to $19,000 in the near term.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

        "content": "Last month, BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest money manager, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 a fund that would invest in the digital currency directly rather than through futures markets. BlackRock joins tens of other smaller ETF providers with the same request, so far without success. But with BlackRock's heft behind growing demands for a spot Bitcoin fund, it's only a matter of time before the SEC relents.\n\nAnd it should. A spot ETF would allow investors to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin more easily, cheaply and securely than they can today. In a crypto industry awash with scams, regulatory oversight would also give investors and money managers confidence that they're buying a bona fide financial product, particularly if it has BlackRock's name on it.\n\nWhen available, spot Bitcoin ETFs will become a fixture in many portfolios, and deservedly or not, the conversation will be less about whether Bitcoin is a fraud and more about its merit relative to traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Crypto cheerleader and founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., Mike Novogratz, gave investors a preview of that conversation recently, asserting that Bitcoin has produced a higher Sharpe Ratio \u2014 a popular measure of risk-adjusted return \u2014 than any other investment over the past three years and inviting others to run the numbers for themselves.\n\nSo I did. The first thing that pops out, of course, is Bitcoin's incredible growth, owing mostly to the fact that investors had access early in its life cycle. Unlike stocks, which are offered to the public well after companies' founding and early growth, anyone could have bought Bitcoin from the start, or close to it. Those who did and hung onto their coins pocketed an unheard-of return of 176% a year since July 2010, which is as far back as the record I'm using goes.\n\nAfter accounting for risk, though, Bitcoin doesn't seem so exceptional. The Sharpe Ratio that Novogratz refers to compares an investment's excess return over cash with its volatility, a higher ratio indicating a better risk-return trade-off. While Bitcoin has far outpaced the S&P 500 Index, for example, it has also been 13 times more volatile, as measured by annualized standard deviation, so its Sharpe Ratio isn't much better. Bitcoin has generated a ratio of 0.92 since 2010, barely higher than the S&P 500's ratio of 0.89.\n\nThe Sharpe Ratio recognizes that volatility is just as important as return because the higher the volatility of an investment, the less likely it is that investors will hang around to capture the return. Nowhere is that truer than with Bitcoin. Indeed, Bitcoin's record since inception is largely irrelevant because few people bought it in 2010 and held it ever since; investors have more commonly dipped in and out along the way. Bitcoin's long-term record is no more useful to day-one investors because its pace of growth has slowed over time and will continue to as it matures.\n\nThe better question, then, as Novogratz suggests, is how Bitcoin has performed over shorter rolling periods after accounting for risk. Starting with the most recent three years, Bitcoin produced a Sharpe Ratio of 0.63 through June, well below the S&P 500's ratio of 0.8 and matching the ratio of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index, a global stock index that includes large and small companies. So, for starters, Bitcoin has not produced the best Sharpe Ratio during the past three years, not now nor when Novogratz said otherwise.\n\nBitcoin's full record is no more impressive. It has a median Sharpe Ratio of 0.94 for all three-year periods, which is less than the S&P 500's and comparable to that of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Bitcoin's median Sharpe Ratio is higher than that of the global stock index, although the period since Bitcoin debuted has been unusually disappointing for non-US stocks. Longer term, foreign stocks should produce a Sharpe Ratio comparable to that of US stocks.\n\nThere's also more variability in Bitcoin's results, which means investors have had wildly different outcomes depending on when they invested. Bitcoin's rolling three-year Sharpe Ratios are three times more volatile than those of stocks and nearly twice as volatile as bonds. Its Sharpe Ratio has beaten the S&P 500 only about 40% of the time over rolling three years. It has a better record against bonds and non-US stocks so far but still loses much of the time. So how Bitcoin fares relative to other investments is a gamble all its own.\n\nBitcoin also carries risk that the Sharpe Ratio isn't designed to detect. The ratio is most often used to size up diversified baskets of stocks, bonds and other assets, where the risk is market volatility, not permanent loss. But Bitcoin is a single cryptocurrency, and like any individual stock or bond, it can get wiped out no matter how sturdy it might seem. The same can't be said for broad market indexes, which makes Bitcoin riskier at any Sharpe Ratio.\n\nAs spot Bitcoin ETFs near, there will be more said about Bitcoin's merit relative to other investments. There's no better way to test these claims than to look at the numbers, and when you do, don't be surprised to find that much of what is said just isn't so."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe creator of the hugely popular AI bot ChatGPT has launched a controversial project that offers users a free share of cryptocurrency in exchange for their biometric data.\n\nNearly four years after founding Worldcoin, OpenAI boss Sam Altman announced on Monday that the crypto wallet and app is now available in countries where it is not banned for regulatory or legal reasons.\n\nMore than 1.5 million people signed up to the venture prior to its official launch, each receiving a share of Worldcoin tokens in exchange for scanning their iris using a silver orb developed by the startup.\n\nThe biometric data was used to verify each individual\u2019s \u201cunique personhood\u201d and ensure that no one signed up more than once.\n\nEach person will now be able to use the Worldcoin token, which is currently valued at $2.59 (\u00a32), according to CoinMarketCap, having begun trading on Monday just below $2.\n\nWorldcoin (WLD) is similar to other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, in that it uses blockchain technology to enable digital transactions. According to its website, people can use it for \u201cremittances, [to] tip artists, [and] buy and sell goods and services\u201d.\n\nThe main differentiator is the way that users sign up, with privacy advocates warning that it could lead to a black market of people\u2019s iris scans.\n\nWorldcoin uses a metal orb to capture people\u2019s biometric data, which they can then use to acquire cryptocurrency (Worldcoin)\n\nWorldcoin has defended its technology by claiming that its orb is only used to check that a person is unique and has not signed up before.\n\nThe startup\u2019s website states: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to know who you are, just that you are unique\u201d.\n\nWorldcoin co-founder Alex Blania wrote in a note published on Monday that he believed Worldcoin \u201ccould drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable democratic processes, and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded universal basic income.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWorldcoin is an attempt at global scale alignment, the journey will be challenging and outcome is uncertain. But finding new ways to broadly share the coming technological prosperity is a critical challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nWorldcoin does not list the countries in which it operates \u2013 The Independent has reached out for further information \u2013 though it is not yet available in Mr Altman\u2019s native US.\n\nThe startup founder was only able to sign up himself on a trip to Europe earlier this year.\n\n\u201cLike any really ambitious project, maybe it works out and maybe it doesn\u2019t, but trying stuff like this is how progress happens,\u201d Mr Altman tweeted following Worldcoin\u2019s launch.\n\n\u201cIn either case, we especially love our haters, it gives us energy, please keep it coming.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash price started a downside correction and tested $230 against the US Dollar. BCH might aim a fresh rally toward the $280 and $300 levels.\n\nBitcoin cash price is consolidating above the $230 level against the US Dollar.\n\nThe price is trading below $255 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $242 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair is likely to accelerate higher if it clears $255 and $265.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Prepares For The Next Move\n\nAfter a strong rally, Bitcoin Cash price faced sellers near the $300 zone. BCH traded as high as $294 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $280 pivot level.\n\nThe price even declined below $255 before the bulls appeared near $230. A low is formed near $232 and the price is now slowly moving higher. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $242 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.\n\nThe pair cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $294 high to the $232 low. Bitcoin Cash is now trading below $265 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $255 level. The next major resistance is near $265 or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $294 high to the $232 low.\n\nSource: BCH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nAny further gains could lead the price toward the $280 and $285 resistance levels in the near term. The next major hurdle is near the $300 level.\n\nDips Supported in BCH?\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash price fails to clear the $255 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $240 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $232 level, where the bulls are likely to appear. If the price fails to stay above the $232 support, the price could test the $220 support. Any further losses could lead the price toward the $200 handle in the near term.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4-hour MACD \u2013 The MACD for BCH/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n\n4-hour RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI is currently above the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $240 and $232.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $255 and $265.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Top Indicators of CoinGecko's Report Q2-2023 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Going in order, we can see that in Q2-2023, there are a lot of events in the crypto industry.\n\nLet\u2019s discover them in the latest CoinGecko\u2019s report:\n\n1) BTC Closed With a Gain of 6.9%\n\nOutperforming the market that increased by 0.14 % in capitalization from $1.238 trillion to $1.240 trillion.\n\nBitcoin, buoyed by enthusiasm dictated by various applications for a spot ETF by Blackrock and other asset management firms, has risen from $28,517 to $30,481 in the past 3 months.\n\n2) Stablecoins.\n\nOn the stablecoin front, we see how their spread in the markets decreased by 3.5%, with USDC and BUSD being the main losers: In total, the market cap of stablecoins decreased by $4.6 billion (-3.5%).\n\nTether, on the other hand, stands as the exception to the rule, as the USDT coin added 4.4% to market capitalization, an increase of $3.48 billion.\n\nRecently, the main cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar index, touched its all-time high at $83 billion closing the quarter with a 66% market share in the context of stablecoins.\n\n3) ETH Staking Growth\n\nA niche that is definitely growing, according to Coingecko\u2019s report, is ETH staking, which grew 30.3% in Q2 2023 after the Shapella update enabled withdrawals to the Beacon Chain. A total of 5.6 million ETH were added to the staking platform, for a total of 23.6 million coins.\n\nIn this context, Lido has flexed its muscles, establishing itself as the leading provider of liquid staking of ETH. The protocol now holds 31.9% of all ETH put into staking.\n\n4) Decrease in Spot Trading Volume on Centralized Exchanges\n\nAnother factor to pay attention to is the crisis in centralized exchanges, whose overall spot volume declined by 43.2% in the last quarter.\n\nDespite the small positive signs shown in Q1 2023, the number of trades and the total value transacted remains low when compared to the bull market months of 2021. Binance confirms its dominance in the industry, though it is seeing its market share drop from 61% to 52%.\n\nHuobii and Crypto.com also suffered heavy downsizing, dropping out of the top 10 exchanges by registered volume, making way for Bybit and Bitget.\n\n5) Drop in Spot Trading Volume on Decentralized Exchanges\n\nFinally, the last focal point of Congecko\u2019s crypto analysis is the context of decentralized exchanges. Total DEX volume in the last quarter decreased by 28.1% in a situation where Uniswap is still in control, with a 70% market share.\n\nWhile experiencing significant increases with the advent of PEPE that drove the meme coin craze, decentralized exchanges have not been able to overcome the obstacle of low liquidity and lack of investor attention. Better times will come for this segment of decentralized finance.\n\nCrypto Report Focus on NFT\n\nThe topic of NFTs was examined in great detail in Coingecko\u2019s crypto report.\n\nDuring the second quarter of this year, volumes in the non-fungible tokens market saw a sharp drop of 35% from $4.84 billion in the first quarter to the current $3.15 billion.\n\nThe Ordinals trend, which has also brought many benefits to Bitcoin miners who have seen their earnings increase, has failed on its own to lift the overall situation of the NFT sector.\n\nIndeed, the latter suffers from the lack of an overall positive outlook, which could boost speculation on this type of asset class, now forgotten by a large number of investors.\n\nIf we take a look at the floor prices recorded in the most popular collections on Ethereum, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, we realize the huge drop in prices compared to the values of 2021, where the market for non-fungible tokens was skyrocketing.\n\nBelow is a tweet from well-known collector Franklin and BAYC brand advocate showing how nothing has gone wrong in the last period.\n\nThis NFT was once worth $3 million. Now it\u2019s only worth $65,000. What went wrong? pic.twitter.com/DKxsmD6mgI \u2014 Franklin (@franklinisbored) July 17, 2023\n\nAgainst the disastrous backdrop highlighted by Coingecko\u2019s crypto report, the Ethereum blockchain can still boast dominance in NFT trading in Q2 2023.\n\n83% of the total volume was recorded on the main smart contract infrastructure, with several ups and downs seeing it touch 73.3% as of May 2023.\n\nMore About the Crypto Report Focus on NFT\n\nSolana, on the other hand, stands as the biggest loser in this particular niche, having lost about 78.6% of volume, falling from $184.91 million in Q1 to the current $39.66 million. The main reason for this negative flow likely relates to the migration of the chain\u2019s main NFT collections, namely DeGods and y00ts to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, whose exposure in the NFT scene was completely absent prior to the advent of Ordinals and the BRC-20 standard, it can now boast the second position in the chain ranking in terms of monthly recorded volumes. As is shown by Coingecko\u2019s crypto study, in May 2023 the trend peaked, with a total value traded on Bitcoin of $196 million.\n\nAlthough the total amount traded has now decreased, we could expect pleasant surprises in the context of NFTs on Bitcoin given the growing interest on the part of developers in making this world increasingly concrete and competitive with Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin, founding father of the quintessential decentralized application platform, also believes that the development of alternatives such as protocols for NFTs or layer 2 scaling solutions on Bitcoin (in general the \u201cbuilder culture\u201c) are excellent initiatives that can bring huge future benefits.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.
