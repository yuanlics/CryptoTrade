        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF, but that may change in the near future, according to brokerage firm Bernstein.\n\nThe firm said in a Monday report that the agency is likely to soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinDesk. Several other countries, including Brazil, Dubai, and Canada, have already approved similar ETFs.\n\nLast month, a flurry of applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs were filed after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, applied for one on June 15. But the applications, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, faced a setback last week when the SEC called them inadequate, as the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe Journal report claimed that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe, which are planning to list several of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs, that the applications didn\u2019t sufficiently outline a surveillance-sharing agreement meant to cut down on fraud and manipulation. The applications also did not specify which spot crypto exchange would be used for the ETFs and thus be subject to the surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nCboe refiled the applications for Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco, and ARK Investment Management on Friday, and specified that it would enter surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, according to the Journal.\n\nLast month, the SEC approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. The new Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, or BITX, uses debt or derivatives to try to eke out a profit from increases in the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC has also previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs from firms such as ProShares and VanEck.\n\nStill, unlike a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin futures ETFs do not invest directly in Bitcoin, and BITX, the most recently approved example, is not meant for the common investor. According to the SEC filing for BITX, investors could lose their money in a single day, adding that the fund is not meant for, \u201cinvestors who do not actively monitor and manage their portfolio.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF seems to be going well for the firm, with at least one judge reviewing its case casting doubt on the difference in manipulation resistance between futures and spot prices. This could be sign that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved soon, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe court did not sound convinced that the futures price is not derived from the spot price, and thus to allow a futures-based ETF and not allow spot sounds like a difficult pill to swallow for the courts,\u201d the report claimed, according to CoinDesk."

        "title": "Bitcoin trades flat after losing US$31,000 peg; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nStory continues\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "After a roller-coaster 18 months, bitcoin\u2014not necessarily the entire U.S. cryptocurrency market\u2014may be on the cusp of a bullish run in the second half of 2023, according to analysts from Adamant Research and Standard Chartered bank. The key driver could be greater adoption by traditional financial firms.\n\nKey Takeaways Renewed push by traditional financial firms for bitcoin spot ETFs may boost bitcoin prices.\n\nAnalysts say the worst of the bitcoin bear market is over, prices may cross $100K over the next couple of years.\n\nRegulatory developments and outcomes of important legal battles between the SEC and crypto platforms could have big impact on crypto markets\n\nA recession driven by government policy could help the crypto market if it's perceived as a decentralized safe haven.\n\nTraditional Financial Firms May Boost Bitcoin Prices\n\nA string of crypto-related bankruptcies starting mid-last year and peaking with the collapse of FTX in November, had many investors losing faith in crypto markets. However, bitcoin prices recently got a second wind as a number of companies, including Blackrock (BLK), Fidelity Investments, Invesco (IVZ) and Wisdomtree (WT) doubled down on their applications for spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs.)\n\n\n\nWorst May Be Over For Bitcoin Prices, Say Analysts\n\nAdamant Research indicates that an accumulation phase for bitcoin will continue in the $22,000 to $42,000 range before the crypto asset eventually hits a new all-time high north of $120,000 as a result of a multi-year bull run.\n\nAdamant Research was one of the first firms to put out a report on bitcoin more than 10 years ago in November 2012. Each subsequent report released by the firm in 2012, 2015, and 2019 came at a time when bitcoin and the greater crypto markets were at historically undervalued levels, and they released their latest report in April 2023.\n\nWhile potential downside risks, such as regulatory crackdowns and liquidations by large holders, are also discussed, the report points to continued high levels of inflation and a troubled bond market as two of the factors that will contribute to the coming bitcoin bull market. Additionally, the report claims investors would be better off sticking with bitcoin rather than holding a diverse set of crypto assets.\n\nAn April 2023 note from Standard Chartered Bank also predicted that the prolonged crypto winter has come to an end, and bitcoin may surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024, Reuters reported. The note suggested that several factors, including the solvency crisis in the banking sector, have restored bitcoin's reputation as a decentralized, scarce digital asset.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts expect the bitcoin price to continue climbing as the broader macro backdrop for risky assets improves, particularly as the Federal Reserve moves away from its policy of tightening. Additionally, bitcoin's upcoming halving event in 2024, when the reward for miners will be halved, is anticipated to further bolster its value.\n\nWatch Out For Regulatory Developments\n\nOver the past few months, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cracked down on a number of cryptocurrency firms such as Binance, Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken. One of the regulator's main contentions is that it considers non-bitcoin crypto assets as securities and has taken action against crypto platforms for the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nAny developments in legal battles such as the Ripple Labs v. SEC case to determine whether the XRP token is a security or the SEC v. Coinbase case on whether staking as a service construes as a sale of unregistered securities could have broader implications for the crypto markets.\n\n\n\nWhat Would a U.S. Recession Mean for Crypto?\n\nA possible U.S. recession could impact crypto asset prices and demand for high-risk assets, but it could also be bullish for crypto in a situation where the recession is caused by poor government policy while crypto is viewed as a decentralized, digital safe haven, according to a May report from S&P Global.\n\nAdditionally, the report covers the potential utility of crypto in countries dealing with heavily depreciating currencies. However, S&P analysts say there is no conclusive data available on whether crypto an act as a useful inflation hedge.\n\n"

        "content": "The Bitcoin-related ETF market has been flourishing lately, showcasing exceptional year-to-date performances. Notably, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Wisdom Tree have all recently submitted filings for Bitcoin spot ETFs. This surge in activity demonstrates that cryptocurrency has reclaimed its relevance in the world of ETFs.\n\nHowever, despite the promising YTD returns and the involvement of leading firms in filing for Bitcoin spot ETFs, the potential upside and limitations of these funds remain largely unknown. Additionally, there is a significant lack of substantial assets in many of the top-performing cryptocurrency ETFs. This likely reflects the hesitance of investors and advisors to invest in this particular space.\n\nThis article will take an in-depth look at a pair of top-performing Bitcoin-related ETFs. These two ETFs have garnered substantial assets and delivered impressive YTD returns. Additionally, we examine the highest-performing Bitcoin-related ETF, but we caution investors about solely focusing on its impressive YTD returns. Through exploring these funds\u2019 key characteristics, we aim to provide insight into whether or not these ETFs are worthwhile investment opportunities.\n\nSee More: \u201cFidelity Again Files for Spot Bitcoin ETF\u201c\n\nTwo Top Performing Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe investment world has recently witnessed a surge in the popularity of Bitcoin-related ETFs, with many of them producing impressive YTD returns.\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), has a remarkable YTD return of 137.46% and has attracted AUM of $85.0 million since its debut on May 11, 2021. Its performance illustrates the extraordinary growth potential the fund offers. The fund\u2019s top holdings include Coinbase Global, Inc. Class A, Riot Platforms, Inc., and Hut 8 Mining Corp. The stocks in its portfolio represent the ETF\u2019s strategic focus on investing in leading companies at the forefront of crypto industry innovation. The one-year net flow of $17.46 million further highlights the increasing investor interest and support for this innovative ETF.\n\nWhile BITQ offers exposure to equities of companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, the actively managed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) offers more direct exposure to bitcoin, though not the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price. The first bitcoin futures ETF launched on October 19, 2021, and currently has $1.07 billion in assets under management. It gathered its first $1 billion in just a few days after its rollout, which demonstrated the intense demand for Bitcoin-related investment vehicles.\n\nThe fact that BITO currently has more than $1 billion in AUM with Bitcoin\u2019s price at roughly half of what it was at the fund\u2019s launch indicates that interest remains strong. It has seen inflows of more than $160 million YTD. BITO\u2019s YTD return of 79.22% and one-year return of 61.01% are certainly impressive, though not the highest among Bitcoin-related ETFs.\n\nSee More: \u201cCryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Rally Continues\u201c\n\nHighest Performing Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe highest-performing Bitcoin ETF in terms of YTD return is the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). With a remarkable return of 191.05%, it has caught the attention of investors. The ETF has seen one-year net flows of $7 million and one-month net flows of $1.86 million, indicating a growing interest in the fund. However, it is worth noting that despite its impressive returns, the ETF\u2019s AUM stands at just $13.7 million, which is relatively small when compared to some other Bitcoin-related ETFs available in the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors should exercise caution when considering Bitcoin-related ETFs, given the market\u2019s volatility and uncertain longevity. The rapid and unpredictable price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency landscape necessitate a careful assessment of risk appetite and financial objectives before investing. Additionally, with the industry still evolving and regulatory frameworks yet to stabilize, careful research and due diligence, as always, are crucial to making informed investment decisions. By understanding the underlying assets, investment strategy, and historical performance, investors can navigate the dynamic world of Bitcoin-related ETFs with prudence and confidence.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

Whether such an ETF will be approved soon and which one will be the first is known only to Mr Gensler, but it is safe to say that news of an approved ETF will have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price in both the short and long term,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cAn ETF will significantly lower the barriers to exposure to Bitcoin by providing an easily accessible investment vehicle and thus boosting demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nPolkadot\u2019s Dot token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, rising 4.48% to US$5.50, followed by Ether that increased 2.43% in the past 24 hours. The XRP token was the only one in the red, inching down 0.02% to US$0.4824.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.18% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 20.72% to US$31.55 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales gain\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.16% to 2,761.68 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and dropped 5.11% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 15.56% to US$2.57 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals fell 34.38% to US$1.25 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 7.54% to US$24.96 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.76% to US$5.35 million, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales inched up 1.69% to US$2.4 million.\n\nAzuki sales decreased 19.19% to US$1.89 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original.\n\n\u201cBrutal weekend for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cIt might be easy to point to Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green, inching up 0.84% to 967.02 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise on signs of easing U.S.-China tension\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s trip to Beijing Wednesday to deepen communication between the two biggest global economies.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% and the Shenzhen Component Index inched up 0.59%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 2.06% and the Shanghai Composite strengthened 1.31%.\n\nInvestor sentiment was bolstered by comments from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who told CNN on Tuesday that U.S. inflation could fall to the Fed\u2019s 2% target by 2025. But he also cautioned of a \u201chigher probability of a mild recession.\u201d\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, after falling U.S. inflation bolstered hopes of a less hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 futures index inched up 0.061%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened 0.29% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.11%.\n\nInvestors now await the release of the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index and S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index for June, scheduled for Monday.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin climbed above US$31,000 in Tuesday morning trading in Asia after Blackrock refiled a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in the U.S. after the regulator criticised an earlier filing, suggesting the world\u2019s biggest money manager is determined to take a lead in cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum also logged gains amid institutional interest, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Polygon led the winners and Litecoin the losers.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.83% over the last 24 hours to US$31,142 at 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 2.85% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock submitted an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Monday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said BlackRock\u2019s original filing was inadequate. BlackRock indicated in the new filing that Coinbase, the custodian of the proposed ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, will provide market surveillance to support the ETF, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral other financial institutions have filed Bitcoin ETF applications despite a crackdown last month by the SEC, which filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase last month for allegedly violating securities laws in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn emailed comments, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of digital asset exchange BTSE, said the SEC criticism of the application caused some selling last week, but \u201cinvestors remain quietly optimistic about future approvals.\u201d\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,954.24, and added 5.23% for the week.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have both seen increased interest from financial institutions in the past week, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin-linked digital asset investment products saw net inflows of around US$123 million in the week ending June 30, while Ethereum-linked products had net inflows of around US$2.7 million. Digital asset investment products have seen two weeks of net inflows since June 19, after logging 9 weeks of consecutive outflows.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded higher in the past 24 hours, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally with a gain of 4.60% to US$0.7119. It\u2019s up 10.18% for the week despite the U.K.-based fintech neobank and crypto exchange Revolut plans to delist Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens for its U.S. users in September, according to a report by the Block on Monday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers in a potential price correction, falling 5.83% to US$106.69. It still logged weekly gains of 22.47% driven higher by the token\u2019s upcoming third halving event on August 2, which will make the token scarcer.\n\nLitecoin investors also received a boost after the token was selected to trade on the newly established EDX Markets exchange, which opened on June 20 and is backed by Wall Street heavyweights, including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.28% to US$1.22 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 26.34% to US$37.86 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT volumes gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.08% in the 24 hours to 09:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,750, down 5.06% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets logged moderate increases.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum rose 18.72% in the past 24 hours to US$27.29 million, according to CryptoSlam data, while Polygon\u2019s volumes surged 121.63% to more than US$1.89 million. Trading volumes also rose on the Bitcoin, Solana and BNB Chain networks.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the second largest NFT collection by market cap, saw trading volume jump 52.56% to US$4.98 million, with Ethereum-based NFT collections Azuki and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranking the second and the third.\n\n\u201cA bit of a rebound today on the ETH side, which is in the green for the first time in days. Top collections like Bean, Azuki, and MAYC have had increases in their floor prices 7-20% and even BAYC has slowed its decline,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nHowever, the floor prices of some major NFT collections are still holding considerable losses for the past week, with BAYC floor price falling over 20% in the past seven days and Azuki sliding more than 50% over the same period, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFT platforms have experienced an increase in trading volume in recent days, while the prices of blue-chip NFTs have declined,\u201d said Gracy Chen, managing director at digital asset trading platform Bitget, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is undergoing a major adjustment, but a decline does not necessarily indicate the decline of the entire industry,\u201d said Chen. \u201cAs NFT derivatives, including lending, indexes, perpetual contracts, and other products, are gaining traction, price fluctuations become more pronounced in the short term.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.01%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.04%, and Nasdaq futures fell 0.12%. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher in the regular Monday session, shortened ahead of the July 4 public holiday when the market is closed.\n\nIn Asia, mainland China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.31% higher on Monday, despite the country\u2019s softening manufacturing recovery. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 1.49%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the gainers in the region with a 1.7% increase, according to CNBC on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 46.0 in June, the lowest since May 2020, according to a Monday report by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing and below 50 a contraction.\n\n\u201cCompanies reduced production and began using layoffs to manage head counts, to a greater extent than in prior months, amid mixed sentiment about when significant growth will return,\u201d wrote ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore in the report.\n\nThe June PMI is the eighth consecutive month of contraction and is lower than the projection of 47.0, raising concerns about a recession, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed releases its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 89.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Monday.

        "content": "With the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event less than a year away, several financial giants have filed applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 a scenario last seen before the 2020 to 2021 bull run.\n\nInstitutional interest in the sector dried up after major crypto giants such as FTX collapsed amid a prolonged crypto winter in 2022. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies traded largely sideways as several crypto exchanges fell under regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHowever, on news that major financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie and others were filing applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, the price of BTC recovered to over $30,000, spurring investment into the crypto market again.\n\nBitcoin one-month price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nWhile several institutional giants have filed spot Bitcoin ETF applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the past, all have either withdrawn their applications or faced outright rejections from the regulator.\n\nThe SEC approved the first Bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021 \u2014 the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2014 which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 19, 2021.\n\nHowever, the spot Bitcoin ETF filing by the asset management giant BlackRock has increased the chances of the SEC approving the first spot Bitcoin ETF. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who gives BlackRock a 50% chance of getting its spot Bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nThe most recent spate of ETF filings began with BlackRock\u2019s filing with the SEC on June 16. WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie also filed in the days and weeks that followed.\n\nRecent: Chibi Finance $1M alleged rug pull: How it happened\n\nOn June 28, ARK Invest, which previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2021, amended its filing to make it similar to that of BlackRock. The next day, asset manager Fidelity Investments also filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In total, seven institutional giants have now filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF to date.\n\nSome industry observers believe 2023 to 2024 will be crucial for approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Robert Quartly-Janeiro, chief strategy officer of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, told Cointelegraph that the timing is right, as \u201cinflation is rampant and the money supply is a mixed picture, interest rates are high, and businesses are seeing decent revenues, which means crypto will need to perform in an economic environment where rates and inflation are key considerations.\u201d\n\nInstitutional trust in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has weathered the aftermath of 2022 remarkably well and recovered more than half of its price decline during the bear market, largely thanks to the continued interest of institutional investors in the asset.\n\nIndeed, there are significantly more institutional investors in the crypto market now compared with only one year ago. Until 2022, institutions kept a safe distance from the market, with even MicroStrategy stopping its routine BTC purchases.\n\nMany large funds and companies have become interested in cryptocurrencies and are exploring their potential to invest in them.\n\nDespite market volatility, global institutions show a steady interest in cryptocurrencies. Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin represents tremendous value in terms of its utility and unique nature as a perfectly scarce asset that cannot ever be debased. He said, \u201cThe most traditional financial institutions recognize that,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising that at a time of record inflation in both major industrialized economies, as well as emerging markets, that the value of Bitcoin is being better understood by markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent new applications for Bitcoin spot market ETFs by some of the world\u2019s most important asset managers demonstrates that there is investor, as well as issuer demand for Bitcoin, and that will only intensify. Apart from demonstrating increased institutional demand for Bitcoin, it will also attract new retail investors and encourage broader participation,\u201d Ardoino said.\n\nWhile many institutions distanced themselves from crypto over the past year, much of that was due to the public relations disaster brought on by FTX, with bank failures further exacerbating it. Richard Gardner, CEO of Modulus, told Cointelegraph that institutions foresaw the simmering of the crypto industry, and decided to lay low and sidestep the political and public response in the aftermath of FTX, thinking they\u2019d be able to revisit their decision before crypto surged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where they\u2019re beginning to weigh the risk versus reward of stepping back into the fray. Most institutions will likely be far more cautious, given the FTX disaster. They\u2019re going to largely be moved based on the regulatory environment. As governments cobble together a full regulatory regime, and as bureaucrats decide how they plan to interpret the law, institutions will gauge their response and move forward accordingly,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nMicroStrategy \u2014 the leading investor in Bitcoin and one of the driving forces behind institutional adoption of BTC in 2020 \u2014 has continued its Bitcoin buying spree in 2023. When the firm faced major losses as the BTC price plunged below $16,500, CEO Michael Saylor maintained it had no intention of selling and would continue to add more BTC to its treasury. MicroStrategy currently hodls 152,333 BTC acquired for roughly $4.52 billion at an average price of $29,668 per Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional inflow revives bull run optimism\n\nWhile the 2017 bull run was sparked by retail interest, the 2020 to 2021 bull run was sparked by institutional inflows, with the likes of MicroStrategy and Tesla, and multiple other publicly-listed companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet.\n\nGracy Chen, managing director at crypto exchange Bitget, told Cointelegraph that institutions would act swiftly once they observe \u201cstable and predictable retail interest.\u201d Chen said, \u201cThe cumulative impact of institutions outweighs that of individual investors, and, therefore, they will continue to be a driving force for the growth of cryptocurrency market capitalization.\u201d\n\nShe also stressed that growing interest from institutions could further crypto adoption, helping to spark the next bull run:\n\n\u201cAnalysts expect that in the event of the approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF application alone, there could be a twofold increase in the price of Bitcoin. Considering BlackRock\u2019s potential institutional investor base and influence, the approval of their spot BTC ETF would have a greater impact on the crypto market growth. With their BTC spot ETF application, they will likely inspire competition among relevant financial companies. This will direct more funds from traditional markets to Web3.\u201d\n\nApart from the institutional push, there have been major developments in the retail market, with Hong Kong opening the doors for crypto exchanges to offer services to retail customers. Ben Caselin, vice president at crypto exchange MaskEX, told Cointelegraph that during the previous bull run, \u201cU.S. institutions were the primary drivers of the upsurge, but they were arguably not ready to engage deeply and behaved no different than retail, essentially chasing gains and acting on hype.\u201d\n\nMagazine: How smart people invest in dumb memecoins: 3-point plan for success\n\n\u201cI expect this bull market to be Asia driven once again, perhaps with Hong Kong at the helm for the region, but based on my personal observations on the ground, I also expect a significant push to come from the Middle East, particularly from the United Arab Emirates, Saudia Arabia and other oil-rich jurisdictions,\u201d he added.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin halving scheduled for April 2024, the rising interest of institutional investors is seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin\u2019s price and the broader crypto market. Bull runs have historically started in the run-up to the Bitcoin halving event, where the amount of BTC reward per block gets reduced by half every four years. The scarcity factor drives the price surge as retail traders and institutional giants rush to add to their Bitcoin portfolios."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Recent weeks have seen a surge in interest from traditional finance for crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After the Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with its initial filing, BlackRock submitted a fresh application for a Bitcoin ETF on July 3. A week earlier, Fidelity led a crop of investment firms in lodging applications with the SEC for Bitcoin-based ETFs. Meanwhile, HSBC has become the first bank to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs to customers in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin, it is often the seemingly positive news that is harmful over the longer term; and vice versa, short-term negative news often serves to strengthen the ongoing case for Bitcoin. A good example of the latter is the 2017 \u201cBlocksize War,\u201d when the Bitcoin community split into the big block camp that launched the Bitcoin Cash fork and the small block camp that implemented the Segregated Witness upgrade in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the result was chaotic in the short term \u2014 with many a Bitcoin critic seeking to dance on Bitcoin\u2019s grave \u2014 it proved to be one of the most important lessons on decentralized consensus and paved the way for the layered scaling via the Lightning Network that we enjoy today.\n\nFor an example of good news turning negative, we don\u2019t have to go too far back into the past. Up until late 2022, FTX was the prime example of crypto going mainstream, with its Superbowl ads, stadium naming rights and glossy magazine features. But in the end, FTX proved to be a ticking time bomb that blew up in everybody\u2019s face and set back the industry\u2019s legitimacy by years.\n\nToday marks 10 years since @tyler and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The @SECGov's refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator. Here's why:\n\n\n\n-\"protected\"\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xmK1xo1iX8 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) July 2, 2023\n\nAnd again, as it goes, the seemingly bad news \u2014 FTX collapsing and losing a lot of money for its users \u2014 will become positive in the long run, as people will take better care of their Bitcoin in the future, thus limiting the systemic risk of large custodian blow-ups.\n\nEvade the fakes\n\nAs we saw with the implosion of FTX and the subsequent market contagion, centralized exchanges were never the answer for everyday investors looking to benefit from the immense promise of Bitcoin. Neither are ETFs. Bitcoin-linked ETFs are an even worse idea than centralized exchanges, as there is zero possibility of withdrawing the underlying instrument \u2014 that is, the Bitcoin. This means the holders are never able to take advantage of the single most important feature of Bitcoin: the ability to control their funds without a need to trust anyone.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nThere are also other dangers for the wider market. With ETFs, there is a risk that \u201cpaper Bitcoin,\u201d or claims not backed by actual Bitcoin, could distort the market and undermine Bitcoin\u2019s very monetary policy. Exchanges that have issued paper Bitcoin in the past \u2014 such as FTX \u2014 have been kept in check via withdrawal runs and eventual collapse, after which the fake Bitcoin claims were wiped out along with the hapless exchanges.\n\nThat likely wouldn\u2019t be the case with ETFs. Without the possibility of withdrawing the underlying asset, paper Bitcoin can be printed at will. If Bitcoin ETFs become the dominant way of investing in Bitcoin, it could very well lead to millions of paper Bitcoin flooding the market, suppressing the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWith Bitcoin, holding it means owning it\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin, ownership is very closely linked to control over the cryptographic keys associated with specific Bitcoin addresses. Now, it might be true that someone can own Bitcoin in a legal sense without having direct control over the keys \u2014 such as when owning an exchange account or holding an ETF share \u2014 but that is simply not a good idea in the Bitcoin world.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler is hurting the little guys for Wall Street\n\nBitcoin\u2019s digital nature, perfect portability and global liquidity make it especially susceptible to embezzlement, theft or just basic mismanagement. The only way to truly own Bitcoin is to control the keys.\n\nSome might welcome a possible short-term price pump associated with an approval of a major Bitcoin ETF (such as BlackRock\u2019s), but the long-term impact on Bitcoin adoption would be likely negative (including the long-term price of Bitcoin). The only adoption that actually matters involves self-custody \u2014 everything else is a trap.\n\nJosef Tetek is a Bitcoin analyst for Trezor.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, while most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. Investors remained optimistic after BlackRoc refiled its spot Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application on Monday despite criticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of an earlier filing.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip, top 10 cryptos mixed\n\nBitcoin slipped 0.54% from 7:50 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,971. Ether inched down 0.15% in the same period to trade at US$1,951, remaining above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, rose to a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest money manager, refiled its Bitcoin ETF application on Monday with Coinbase as the proposed custodian, after the SEC on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by Bitcoin ETF applications from financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry is still dusting itself off from the impact of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase after both exchanges allegedly broke securities rules. Yet BlackRock\u2019s decision to engage Coinbase as its custodian can be seen as a positive development in Coinbase\u2019s ongoing engagement with the SEC,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note the distinction between Bitcoin, officially categorized as a commodity, and most other cryptocurrencies, which the SEC considers securities. A Bitcoin ETF would fall under the security label and trade on a traditional exchange. While Coinbase and other exchanges face regulatory uncertainties surrounding the industry, Bitcoin remains separate from such concerns. Ultimately, this is a positive for the industry as it highlights BlackRock\u2019s confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s status as a commodity.\u201d\n\nLitecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 3.758% to US$107.36, followed by Binance\u2019s BNB token that fell 1.42% in the past 24 hours to US$245.23. Litecoin\u2019s decline comes ahead of its upcoming third halving event on August 2 that will make the token scarcer.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token led gains, rising 2.21% to US$0.7053, followed by the XRP token that strengthened 1.27% to US$0.489.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.36% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 17.58% to US$37.49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales rise\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.76% to 2,754.15 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and dropped 4.88% during the week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 6.03% to US$24.93 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 7.86% to US$3.23 million, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales decreased 6.42% to US$1.93 million.\n\nThe floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club declined to a two-year low, with other top blue chip NFT collections also falling. But Azuki sales recovered after a significant sell-off, gaining 90.3% to US$2.6 million.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 4.54% to US$2.49 million but sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rose 15.23% to US$1.49 million.\n\nAsian equities rise, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gains for second consecutive day\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 that fell 0.98%. The Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.35%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.57%, a second consecutive day of gains, and the Shanghai Composite inched up 0.042%.\n\nInvestors were optimistic after fresh data showed that retail sales in Hong Kong climbed 16.5% in May, marking the fifth straight month of growth.\n\nThe release of the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index in the U.S. showed that manufacturing contracted more than expected for an eighth consecutive month in June, reigniting concerns of a potential recession amid tighter monetary policy.\n\nThe index dropped to 46.0 in June, the lowest since May 2020. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing and below 50 a contraction.\n\nU.S. stock markets are closed today for the Fourth of July federal holiday.\n\nNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. Interest rates in the U.S. are currently between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 89.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Monday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 10.1%.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin ETFs, Azuki NFTs take off; India presses for crypto rules\n\nUpdates with equities section"

While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have since gotten a regulatory green light in the U.S., the SEC claims that no spot ETF arrangement thus far proposed does enough to protect investors from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, on the first filing\u2019s 10-year anniversary, Winklevoss called out the agency for supposedly dragging its feet, recognizing every other application for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF has been stifled as well.\n\n\u201cThe SEC's refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for U.S. investors,\u201d he said, adding that the agency\u2019s reluctance \u201cdemonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d\n\nToday marks 10 years since @tyler and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF.

Or, as Winklevoss puts it, keeping investors \u201cprotected\u201d from exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nAs the crypto market recoiled after the SEC\u2019s bombshell lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase on June 5, BlackRock\u2019s gambit to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF two weeks later reignited optimism on Crypto Twitter and pushed Bitcoin higher. Capping off a wave of Bitcoin ETF applications from other firms that followed\u2014including Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie\u2014Fidelity threw its hat back into the ring last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the SEC believes BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s recent Bitcoin ETF applications \u201caren\u2019t sufficiently clear and comprehensive,\u201d according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWinklevoss asserts that the complete lack of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs has \u201cpushed\u201d U.S. investors toward Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust. Shares in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust, launched in 2013, currently trade at a discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings due to shareholders\u2019 inability to redeem their shares.\n\nWhile Winklevoss called the product \u201ctoxic,\u201d he didn\u2019t mention that converting Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF would likely resolve this discount, and the firm is currently suing the SEC over repeated denials to do just that.\n\nWinklevoss has joined a chorus of critics who say SEC Chair Gary Gensler is pushing innovation offshore, and said the agency meanwhile thrust \u201cinvestors into the arms of FTX\u201d and made them victim \u201cto one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.\u201d\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX, has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges he faces for conduct at the collapsed exchange, including fraud.\n\nSending investors abroad in search of Bitcoin exposure has also led them to do business with \u201cunlicensed and unregulated venues,\u201d Winklevoss claimed.\n\nGemini and the SEC are not on friendly terms. The regulatory agency accused Gemini of violating securities laws in January, alleging that its \u201cGemini Earn\u201d product constitutes an unregistered securities offering. Retail investors could previously loan their crypto to the now-bankrupt firm Genesis\u2014which was also charged by the SEC\u2014in exchange for interest on deposits.\n\nNotably, Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group. And Genesis and Gemini have been engaged in a spat over a $900 million loan that Gemini extended to the crypto lender.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWinklevoss considered a lawsuit against DCG and company CEO Barry Silbert earlier this year, but Gemini, Genesis, and DCG reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d in February. However, Gemini said DCG missed a $630 million loan repayment this past month and risks defaulting on its obligations.\n\nWinklevoss expressed hope that the SEC will \u201creflect on its dismal record\u201d and focus on its stated duties, \u201cinstead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Winklevoss ended his post with accolades for \u201call those fighting the good fight to bring U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to life\u201d\u2014which, in practice, may preclude certain companies that have outstanding applications or lawsuits."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin's recent trading activity may be range-bound, but that doesn't diminish the impressive 84% surge it experienced in 2023. This significant recovery in Bitcoin's price has also spurred buying activity in various altcoins, causing them to rise substantially from their annual lows. After reaching above the $31,000 mark on June 23, Bitcoin consolidated at $30,000 throughout the past week. It currently remains near the strong resistance level of $31,000, with neither bulls or bears taking control in the larger time frame.To gain momentum, buyers must restore the rate to the $31,200 zone, potentially leading to a breakout above the $31,458 resistance level. This indicates that the bulls are not rushing to secure profits, as they expect further upward movement. Bulls have shown increased interest in Bitcoin recently, driven by the positive investor sentiment, which has been fueled by notable financial institutions such as BlockRock Invesco , and WisdomTree filing for Bitcoin ETFs However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said these filings were inadequate last Friday, citing a lack of clarity and the need for additional information before reconsidering approval. Despite this news, BTC has maintained a positive stance well above the $30,000 level. BTC's support level currently stands at $29,500. This week will feature significant economic events in the US, including the release of the FOMC minutes for June on Wednesday, the job openings report on Thursday, and new employment numbers on Friday, which may introduce some market volatility.Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading in close proximity to the $2,000 level. Its price has gained momentum above $1,920, with immediate resistance found near $1,960 and then $2,000. Failing to surpass these resistance levels could initiate a downward correction. The current support level for Ethereum rests at $1,930.In an exciting turn of events, on Thursday the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2023 \u2014 a reform bill in the United Kingdom \u2014 received Royal Assent from King Charles, officially transforming it into a law. With the implementation of this legislation, crypto trading is now acknowledged as a regulated financial activity, signifying a momentous achievement in the regulatory realm of the crypto industry. After the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), this progressive law in the UK aims to establish a robust regulatory framework that bolsters investor confidence and encourages innovation within the crypto sector. By introducing clear rules and guidelines, it fosters a secure and transparent environment for crypto-related activities, thereby attracting increased participation from investors and businesses alike.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing ones over the past week:As per prices on Monday.1. Compound is up by 80%2. Bitcoin Cash is up by 53%3. eCash is up by 52%4. Flow is up by 36%5. Bitcoin SV is up by 32%1. Conflux is down by 8%2. ApeCoin is down by 8%3. NEAR Protocol is down by 7%4.

        "title": "With a 83% gain, data shows Bitcoin was more profitable than every other asset in H1 2023 - Technext",
        "content": "A report retrieved from Wu Blockchain has shown that Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in the first six months of the year. The flagship digital asset rose over 80% to close above $30,000 last Friday, outmatching other major global assets like NASDAQ, British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, NYMEX Natural Gas and other stocks in the process.\n\nRecall that Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for 2023 has been with a bullish undertone. It commenced the year with a strong bullish sentiment and the price rose by 47% within the first month of the year, setting the tone for the following weeks.\n\nThe rise of the flagship cryptocurrency was characterised by typical declines, with support and resistance levels impacting the price change. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to $19,569 in March after climbing over $25,000 for the first time since August 2022. Many analysts identified the climb above $25,000 as a significant move to confirm the end of the bear market.\n\nAnother phase of the bullish trend returned to the Bitcoin market in the middle of June. The digital asset gained over 58% in about four weeks during that period, as the price surpassed the $30,000 level for the first time since June 2022.\n\nRead also:\n\nBitcoin crosses $28,000 for the first time since May; what is behind this surge?\n\nData shows that Bitcoin\u2019s price at the end of June was $30,469, marking a yearly gain of over 83%. Now, the majority of the digital asset\u2019s proponents consider this time a consolidation and accumulation opportunity with the anticipation of a bull run ahead of the next Bitcoin halving, which comes up in 2024.\n\nHow Bitcoin outpaced other major assets in H1 2023\n\nData from renowned crypto reporter Wu Blockchain shows that Bitcoin\u2019s value increased by 83.8% in the first half of 2023, ranking first and exceeding other major world assets by a significant margin.\n\nIn the second position is the Nasdaq index, whose value increased by 31.7%. Followed by Nikkei225 Index (27.19%), Germany DAX Index (15.98%), Euro Stoxx 50 Index (15.96%), S&P 500 Index (15.91%) respectively.\n\nA 37% drop in value puts natural gas in the bottom position following the fall in the prices of other energy sources.\n\nAlso, a Market Watch report says crypto-related exchange-traded funds skyrocketed in the first half of 2023, outperforming other United States-listed ETFs. In a phone interview with the Finance media, Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA, confirmed that the top 15 ETFs in terms of performance this year have exposure to crypto or blockchain.\n\nHow Bitcoin was able to outperform other assets\n\nIn the first half of the year, the crypto market dealt with the effect of the FTX collapse and last year\u2019s collapse of several crypto-related firms. However, the space soon shrugged those concerns off as the industry witnessed renewed institutional demand.\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world with around $10 trillion worth of assets under management, applied for a Bitcoin spot ETF. This move triggered other institutions like Fidelity and others to file a similar application for a spot ETF.\n\nAmid these events, BTC\u2019s price nearly doubled from around $16,000 to above $31,000, outperforming other earlier mentioned significant assets like gold, S&P 500, Nikkei 225 index, and others.\n\nAlso, the first half of 2023 has witnessed the emergence of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain network. The Ordinals Inscriptions are similar to NFTs as it allows the inscriptions of text, audio, and images into the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin, Satoshi.\n\nAt the peak of its craze, Ordinals pushed Bitcoin\u2019s average daily transactions to a record high, leading to higher network fees. This is demonstrative of the huge effect the innovation has had on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is next?\n\nExperts have predicted that despite the SEC\u2019s recent lawsuits, the crypto market will continue to push that aside and soar amidst renewed institutional investors\u2019 interest.\n\nRead also:\n\n3 cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to consider buying this July\n\nAs BTC continues to dominate the charts and media headlines, the flurry of Bitcoin ETF applications will propel more crypto whales into buying, thereby improving the general sentiment in the market."

        "content": "July 03, 2023 10:33 pm | Updated 10:33 pm IST - Bengaluru\n\nThe Karnataka government on Monday constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to reopen and probe an alleged Bitcoin scam that had surfaced during the previous BJP regime.\n\nThe SIT will be led by Manish Kharbikar, an Additional Director General of Police in the Criminal Investigation Department of the State, and will include officers from various departments with expertise in investigating cyber and cryptocurrency-related crimes, said Home Minister G. Parameshwara on Monday. The team could also take the help of technical experts since the matter relates to cybercrime, he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin scam had surfaced during the BJP\u2019s regime and the Congress, which was then in Opposition, had accused the government of trying to cover up the scandal as it involved big names. The prime suspect, Srikrishna alias Sriki, was accused of hacking the State government\u2019s e-procurement website and siphoning off over \u20b911.5 crore.\n\nHe was arrested by Central Crime Branch, Bengaluru, in relation to a drug case where drugs were bought off darknet using crypto currency. Sriki allegedly confessed to hacking several international crypto currency exchanges, including Bitfinex. His confessions of hacking and stealing of crypto currencies totalled to several thousands of crore as on the day of his confession. Some of the stolen Bitcoins from Bitfinex that were blacklisted were allegedly moved to unknown destinations when Sriki was in custody, raising eyebrows.\n\nThe Home Minister on Monday said on Monday, \u201cWe had promised to the people of Karnataka that if we come to power we will reinvestigate Bitcoin scam. Accordingly we have taken a decision to hand it over to SIT we have constituted under the CID. We hope the committee will do justice.\u201d\n\nBengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayananda had earlier written a letter to the DG&IGP demanding a further probe into the case, as the case since it has national and international ramification. Since the Congress government assumed power in Karnataka in May, Mr. Parameshwara has repeatedly said that the Bitcoin scam would be re-examined.\n\nFormer Karnataka Chief Minister and BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai said that they welcome the move of SIT probe into the Bitcoin scam."

Given we\u2019re a digitally-led beer brand [with 138,000 followers across Instagram and Facebook] why not hide some digital currency inside a can of beer?\u201d, said Better Beer CEO, Nick Cogger.\n\n\u201cWe were originally going to do this competition back in January, however Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed to $25,000 and we weren\u2019t sure if it was going to continue to drop. It has now bounced back to around $44,000 so now is the perfect time to run the promotion. We\u2019ve hidden two Bitcoins inside specially marked cases of our best-selling Better Beer Zero Carb cans, and we\u2019ll give away a third Bitcoin through a lottery, via our on-premise customers.\u201d\n\nCustomers can take part in the \u2018Find The Bitcoin\u2019 treasure hunt by picking up a specially marked case of Better Beer Zero Carb cans from participating stores, where one of two Bitcoins might be hidden inside.
