        "content": "Standard Chartered has raised its bitcoin price predictions after seeing increased miner profitability.\n\nThe bank now projects the crypto asset to reach a price $50,000 by the end of 2023 \u2014 a 65% increase from current prices \u2014 and then hit $120,000 by the end of 2024, Bloomberg reported Monday (July 10).\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of crypto research and EM FX West at Standard Chartered, said, per the report, that increased miner profitability will lead to reduced net bitcoin supply as miners can sell less while maintaining cash inflows.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d Kendrick said, according to the report.\n\nAlthough bitcoin hit all-time highs of nearly $69,000 in 2021, Standard Chartered sees more potential for growth, according to the report.\n\nThe bank has raised its forecast for bitcoin from its April expectation that prices would reach $100,000 by the end of next year, the report said.\n\nBecause bitcoin miners can cover their costs with the sale of fewer bitcoins when prices are high, they can hold on to more bitcoin in anticipation of selling them later at higher prices, reducing the availability.\n\nThis forecast comes at a turbulent time in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nOn June 5, it was reported that cryptocurrency prices fell after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed 13 charges against crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging the exchange committed a variety of securities law violations.\n\nBitcoin was among those whose price fell at the time time, as it was trading at $25,628 on the afternoon of June 5 after having hit a high of $27,093 earlier that day.\n\nAbout a week earlier, on May 30, blockchain analytics provider Nansen became the latest company in the beleaguered crypto sector to cut jobs as it reduced its staff by 30%.\n\nThe company had been rapidly scaling its staff for years but, as Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik said at the time, the past year has been \u201cbrutal\u201d for the crypto sector."

        "title": "ESG Enforcement Emerges as Risk for Oil Firms, Bitcoin Miners - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "An SEC enforcement initiative targeting misleading ESG disclosures has become a business risk for dozens of public companies, including bankrupt Bitcoin miner Core Scientific, shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources and banking giant Ally.\n\nThe Climate and ESG Task Force the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was launched two years ago, was mentioned among the risk factors in 30 companies\u2019 10-K annual reports so far this year with about six months to go, according to a Bloomberg Law review of company filings. That\u2019s double the 15 companies that referenced it in their 10-K risk factors in all of 2022.\n\nThe ramp-up in risk disclosures comes amid a seven-month lull in new cases from the task force. The unit last helped bring a case in November, when the SEC announced an enforcement action and settlement with Goldman Sachs. The matter was one of at least four cases tied to the group.\n\nThe task force is unlikely to stay quiet indefinitely, securities lawyers said. The SEC continues to emphasize environmental, social and governance reporting and is moving to require climate risk disclosures, giving companies reason to alert their shareholders to the special enforcement unit, they said.\n\n\u201cThe sense is that it\u2019s often better to have said something, pointing out a known issue, than to have said nothing at all,\u201d said Amy Greer, a former SEC lawyer and co-chair of Baker & McKenzie LLP\u2019s North American financial regulation and enforcement practice. Greer defended health insurance distributor Benefytt against a task force-assisted case last year.\n\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\u2018More Forthcoming\u2019\n\nAlly Financial Inc. , Core Scientific Inc. and another major Bitcoin miner, Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., were some of the first to bring up the task force in their risk factors when they filed their 10-Ks in February and March of 2022. They were among 15 companies that started mentioning the task force within 13 months of the SEC announcing the 22-member unit in March 2021.\n\nThe task force is an example of more scrutiny and changing expectations from regulators, investors and others on ESG issues, Greenidge and Core Scientific said in their 2022 and 2023 10-Ks. The Bitcoin miners may face additional costs if they don\u2019t adapt to expectations and rules about their electricity usage and other ESG concerns, according to their reports.\n\nBoth Greenidge and Core Scientific rely on at least some carbon-emitting sources for their mining, which requires powerful computers to crack complex equations that garner the companies rewards in cryptocurrency once solved.\n\nGreenidge\u2019s website says that the Bitcoin miner is a \u201cprotector of the environments in which we operate.\u201d The company has battled environmental activists over the natural gas-fired power plant it runs in upstate New York. The state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation denied Greenidge\u2019s renewal permit for the facility last year due to greenhouse gas emissions limits, but it remains operational as the company appeals the decision.\n\nAlly in its 2022 and 2023 10-K risk factors listed the task force as an example of how governments are increasingly focusing on climate change, while adding that a majority of its business is connected to auto loans.\n\nPioneer Natural Resources Co. and fellow oil company Devon Energy Corp. were among 19 companies that cited the Climate and ESG Task Force in their 10-K risk factors for the first time in 2023. Most of the companies adding the disclosure this year were in the oil and gas industry.\n\nGovernment officials and others are looking more closely at companies\u2019 emissions reduction targets and other climate goals for instances of greenwashing, Pioneer and Devon said in their 10-Ks. Both companies report emissions data and reduction goals in their sustainability reports. The rise of lawsuits over misleading ESG claims bring \u201cincreased litigation risks which could, in turn, lead to further negative sentiment against us and our industry,\u201d Devon said in its 10-K.\n\nThe inclusion of the task force in a company\u2019s 10-K risk factors doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the SEC is probing its ESG disclosures, said Emily Strauss, a University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, associate professor, who studies securities litigation and enforcement. But companies like oil producers and Bitcoin miners face a higher risk of ESG-related enforcement due to the carbon-intensive nature of their businesses, she said.\n\n\u201cFirms are being more forthcoming and more conscious about some of the risks that they face and connections to misstatements about those issues,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nAnd if one company reports a new risk, its peers likely will take notice, Greer said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the last one to have incorporated that general risk disclosure,\u201d she said.\n\nRepresentatives of Ally, Pioneer, Devon and Core Scientific didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A Greenidge representative declined to comment.\n\nLull in Activity\n\nThe task force would enter new territory if it pursues a case against a Bitcoin miner or an oil company. The unit so far only has helped with enforcement actions concerning Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and iron ore miner Vale S.A. , in addition to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Benefytt Technologies Inc., according to SEC press releases.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon cases both centered on descriptions of the firms\u2019 ESG funds. BNY Mellon agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve SEC claims the bank misled investors about its ESG fund labels, the agency announced in May 2022. Goldman Sachs reached a $4 million settlement with the SEC over allegations the firm didn\u2019t follow its policies and procedures for its ESG funds, the agency said in November.\n\nBenefytt and its former CEO, Gavin Southwell, agreed to pay more than $12 million to settle claims they hid tens of thousands of consumer complaints from investors when it was a public company known as Health Insurance Innovations Inc., the SEC announced in July 2022. Vale reached a $55.9 million deal with the SEC earlier this year to settle the agency\u2019s claims that the company misled investors about its dams\u2019 safety before a 2019 collapse killed 270 people after it helped bring the case in April 2022.\n\nSEC Enforcement Division Director Gurbir Grewal has said repeatedly that ESG cases are a priority. But an SEC press release hasn\u2019t mentioned any ESG-related enforcement work since the Vale settlement was announced in March.\n\nThe SEC may be trying to show its powers are inadequate to combat ESG wrongdoing and it needs regulations like its proposed climate disclosure rules in order for the task force to bring more cases, said Nicolas Morgan, a former agency lawyer and president of Investor Choice Advocates Network, a nonprofit law firm that fights what it considers to be government overreach.\n\nThe agency is looking to issue rules in October that would require companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and other risks they face from climate change. But the SEC has faced significant pushback and threats of a legal challenge from business interests and Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a distinct possibility that it is a strategic silence so that you\u2019re not feeding the critics of the proposed rule who say you already have the tools you need,\u201d said Morgan, who\u2019s also a partner at Paul Hastings LLP.\n\nAnother possibility: Some cases just take more time file, Strauss said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that an enforcement action hasn\u2019t appeared recently doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not a lot of investigative activity going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe SEC likes to bring enforcement actions that kind of give it the most signaling bang for its buck.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped in Monday morning trading in Asia but held above the US$30,000 support level. Ether edged lower along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, as anticipation of further interest rate hikes in the U.S. reduces appetite for risk across markets. Meanwhile, a JPMorgan report claims that the recent flurry of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. may not be the game changer that some expect. This is reducing some of the optimism surrounding ongoing Bitcoin ETF applications by major Wall Street names, including BlackRock.\n\nCryptos fall as ETF hype cools\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.32% over the last 24 hours to US$30,157 at 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly loss of 1.33%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency traded in the lower US$30,000 range over the weekend.\n\nEther edged 0.09% lower to US$1,862 and lost 3.71% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours. The exception was Polygon\u2019s Matic token, which gained 1.15% to US$0.6876. It added 1.07% over the past seven days.\n\nWhile multiple Bitcoin ETF applications in the past month have stirred optimism in the crypto market, their approval may not prove as transformational as some Bitcoin advocates expect, claimed a JP Morgan report on Friday. Similar products have existed in Canada and Europe but received limited inflows, the report suggests.\n\nDespite this element of doubt creeping in, Bitcoin whales remain bullish on the token. Blockchain data tracker Santiment noted in a tweet on Sunday that addresses holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin had added a further 71,000 Bitcoin totalling approximately US$2.15 billion since July 17.\n\n\ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's sharks and whales aren't showing any signs of slowing down, even with prices beginning to get \"boring\" in this $30k to $31k range. Since June 17th, 10 to 10k $BTC addresses have accumulated 71k more coins, equating to $2.15 billion. https://t.co/poBVnszbZY pic.twitter.com/XxYsHWCFRL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 8, 2023\n\n\u201cInvestors sentiment seems to \u2014 still \u2014 be slightly bolstered by Blackrock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink\u2019s comment and the prospect that such an openness to the asset class increases the chances of a spot BTC ETF,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that while far off, the pile up of ETF applications hints at the fact that, eventually, we will see one and, once we do, other ETFs like an ETH-denominated one might see the light of day,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nCrypto exchange BingX announced on Saturday it would support Polygon blockchain\u2019s Indore upgrade, which it said would improve the performance of the Polygon network. The move is likely to take effect from July 11.\n\nFounded in 2018 and headquartered in Singapore, BingX said it provides services in over 100 countries and regions, with over 5 million users, according to the press release.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap was unchanged in the past 24 hours at US$1.18 trillion, while crypto trading volume dipped 0.22% to US$19.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDead cat bounce for NFT collections\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.73% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,756.26, down 0.97% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also logged drops, while Solana\u2019s index inched higher.\n\n\u201cOver the past few days the NFT market buyers and farmers have found some value in NFT collections that had hit all-time low floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading NFT marketplace Blur launched its version 2 trading platform last Thursday. This introduced a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature that allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\n\u201cBlur\u2019s new trait offers are possibly taking pressure off of floor NFT farming,\u201d said Petscher. This could potentially lead to more price stability for Ethereum NFT projects, he added.\n\nThe floor prices of major Ethereum-based NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki and HV-MTL have all logged two-digit gains in the past seven days. However, all three are still down at least 25% for the month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment in the NFT community is that [a number of collections] likely won\u2019t recover and that this is a dead cat bounce. I expect prices to continue to bleed out until these collections find floors in the low few hundred dollar range,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 10.37% to US$26.49 million as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain edged up 1.39% to US$14.89 million, while Bitcoin volume jumped 87.65% to US$6.76 million.\n\nU.S. equities down amid rate hike concerns\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also closed lower on regular session trading Friday and logged losses for the week.\n\nMeanwhile, most main stock indexes across Asia are mixed on Monday, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edging up. South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei posted losses.\n\nThe U.S. employment situation summary by the Labor Department on Friday showed the economy added 209,000 jobs in June. That is the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years and lower than Reuters\u2019 expectation of 225,000.\n\nHowever, wage increases and a drop in the unemployment rate indicate that the labor market is still tight. That may pave the way for further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve within the year.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5% and 5.25%. However, the CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase at the Fed\u2019s meeting on July 26. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is at just 7.6%.\n\nAnalysts also give a 35.2% chance that the Fed will raise the rate by another 25 basis points in November, up from 9.5% a month ago.\n\nAll eyes are now on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) ahead of its release on Wednesday. The index will give investors more insight into U.S. inflation and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nAnalysts currently expect the annual inflation rate to drop to 3.1% in June, down from 4% in the previous month, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s own CPI posted no annual increase in June. That is the weakest monthly showing since a drop in February 2021. The results point to a weakening recovery in the country\u2019s post-Covid economy. Further weakening may lead to calls for increased economic stimulus measures.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "The Next Bitcoin Halving is Soon -- But What Happens if BTC Mining is No Longer Profitable? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe cost of mining one Bitcoin will rise to $40,000 after the next halving\n\nMiners are becoming more sophisticated with their power costs and secure the pricing from their power providers in advance\n\nA large number of less productive miners will eventually be forced out of the market\n\nCrypto fans are hoping that a once-every-four-years event, in this case \u2013 Bitcoin halving, that modifies the fundamental code of the largest cryptocurrency in the world, will prolong the recent market upswing. But the achievement could also spell the end for some Bitcoin miners.\n\nHalving Typically Followed by BTC Price Increase\n\nThe quadrennial occurrence, rather menacingly known as \u201cthe Halving\u201d or \u201cHalvening,\u201d is typically followed by exponential increases in the price of Bitcoin. According to reports , the token increased by roughly 8,450%, 290%, and 560% each of the previous three manifestations in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n\nUnder the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, a computer programmer or group of programmers created Bitcoin in 2009. As the name implies, halvings reduce by half the amount of Bitcoin that each miner can receive for utilizing specialized, high-power-exploiting computers to verify transactions on the blockchain of the digital asset. The next halving, scheduled for April 2024, will reduce miners\u2019 incentives from the current 6.25 Bitcoin per block, or $188,876, to 3.125 Bitcoin per block, or $94,438.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts believe that the limited supply will assist in keeping Bitcoin\u2019s price stable over time, or at least until 21 million tokens, the maximum amount that can ever be mined, are produced in the year 2140.\n\nDue to price spikes following each reward halving and improvements in mining rig efficiency brought about by technological developments, miners have so far been able to make up for the cash lost when payouts are reduced.\n\nHowever, the mining economy seems worse than before the next halving.\n\nAs a result of their less effective mining operations and higher expenditures, Jaran Mellerud, a crypto-mining expert at Hashrate Index, forecasted that \u201cnearly half of the miners will suffer.\u201d\n\nHe made reference to the break-even electricity price for the most popular mining machine, which is predicted to go from 12 cents/kWh to six cents/kWh following a halving. According to Mellerud, about 40% of miners still have higher operational expenses per kWh. He stated that smaller miners and those that outsource the operation of their mining rigs will find it difficult to survive, as will those whose running costs are higher than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nLess Productive Miners Will See Net Income Going South\n\nWolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, a research division of mining consultancy BlocksBridge, continued, \u201cIf you factor in everything, the total cost for some miners is well above Bitcoin\u2019s current price.\u201d Many miners with less productive operations will see a decline in net income.\n\nAlthough the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than 80% this year to over $30,000, it is still less than half of the record high of almost $69,000 set in late 2021. The cost of production for miners has increased along with the cost of electricity, and for many of them, their debt loads are now unmanageable.\n\nAccording to Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at cryptocurrency mining services provider Luxor Technologies, the worldwide mining sector has a debt of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, down from $8 billion in 2022.\n\nThis debt consists of senior debt, loans secured by mining equipment, and loans backed by Bitcoin. At the end of the first quarter, outstanding debts for 12 large publicly traded mining businesses, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms, were roughly $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion the previous quarter, according to statistics provided by Hashrate Index.\n\nAfter China\u2019s communist government banned domestic mining in the latter half of 2021, miners from that country moved to North America, contributing to the borrowing boom.\n\nThe financial market was one item the miners lacked, according to Zhao. \u201cDebt financing is much more readily available in the US.\u201d\n\nProfit margins have also shrunk as a result of increased competition among Bitcoin miners. According to data from btc.com , mining difficulty, a measure of the computational power required to generate Bitcoin, reached a record high in June.\n\nPower Costs In the Rise\n\nBitcoin will need to increase to $50,000\u2013$60,000 next year, according to Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of mining strategy at cryptocurrency mining company Foundry, which industry giant Digital Currency Group owns, for miners to maintain the same profit margins after the halving.\n\nAnd while miners had a little break early this year when electricity prices dropped and Bitcoin\u2019s price recovered following a protracted crypto winter, power costs are now rising once more. Texas, a significant crypto hub, is currently going through an early heat wave.\n\nBefore the halving, Bitcoin miners are taking a number of precautions to safeguard themselves, including locking in power pricing, increasing war chests, and reducing investment.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual halving, Zhang explained that miners are getting ready by attempting to be more intelligent with their power bills and securing the pricing from their power providers in advance.\n\nIn order to protect its Bitcoin treasury before the halving, Hut 8 Mining Corp. signed into a $50 million credit facility last month with a division of Coinbase Global Inc. Additionally, Texas-based Bitcoin miner Lotta Yotta is shoring up six months\u2019 worth of cash flow while reducing investments in order to get ready for the occasion, according to Tiffany Wang, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nRegarding new investment in Bitcoin mining facilities, Wang texted, \u201cDuring halving year, it is high risk.\u201d \u201cTo keep the business running, it is preferable to save some money in the account.\u201d\n\nAccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the halving is anticipated to ultimately double Bitcoin\u2019s production cost to around $40,000 in a June 1 note. According to data gathered by TheMinerMag, the cost of mining one Bitcoin in the first quarter varied between around $7,200 and $18,900 among a cohort of 14 publicly-traded miners.\n\nAccording to Zhao, the expenditures determined do not take into account other significant costs such debt interest payments, managerial salary, or marketing.\n\nEveryone needs to be ready, Wang emphasized. Sadly, a large number of miners will eventually be forced out of the market."

        "content": "Standard Chartered expects the profitability of bitcoin miners will play a crucial role in driving the price of bitcoin (BTC) to $50,000 by the end of this year, and to $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nIn a Monday note, Geoffrey Kendrick, StanChart\u2019s head of FX and digital assets research, highlighted the role played by miners in determining the overall supply of newly mined bitcoin.\n\nThis reduction in selling leads to a decrease in the overall supply of bitcoin, which ultimately drives up the price.\n\nStanChart\u2019s prediction aligns with an earlier forecast in April, when Kendrick said several factors would propel bitcoin toward $100,000 by the end of next year.\n\nHowever, this time he emphasized the significance of miner profitability as the key contributing factor, considering it to be more impactful than earlier believed.\n\nQ2 showed drop in miner sales, boosting prices\n\nStanChart noted that during the first quarter of 2023, the 12 largest listed miners, representing 20% of global bitcoin mining, sold 106% of the bitcoin they mined.\n\nThis selling percentage appears to have slightly decreased to below 100% in the second quarter, reducing the supply and contributing to higher prices.\n\nBy adjusting their selling strategy, miners have the potential to benefit from the anticipated price increase in bitcoin.\n\nStanChart expects bitcoin to rise to about $50,000 by the end of 2023 as the share of newly mined bitcoin sold is projected to decrease to around 20% to 30%.\n\nThis adjustment translates to miners reducing the number of bitcoin they sell per day from the current 900 to between 180 and 270.\n\nIncreased cash profits set to drive decreased selling\n\nThe bank highlighted that after speaking with bitcoin miners directly, it became evident that miners have three sources of cash: selling bitcoin, selling equity or borrowing.\n\nMiners indicated that selling equity was unlikely due to low equity prices, and borrowing money was unfavorable due to high interest rates.\n\nConsequently, selling bitcoin remains the most feasible option for miners to raise cash in the current cycle.\n\nHowever, with higher bitcoin prices and increased cash profits, selling is expected to decrease significantly over time, supporting further price increases.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our end-2024 BTC price target of around USD 100,000, with potential upside from reduced miner selling,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nNewcomers shine in cost efficiency\n\nThe bank evaluated miner profitability based on three factors: the direct cash cost of mining one Bitcoin (mostly electricity costs), the total cash costs per Bitcoin mined and whether mined bitcoins are sold or held.\n\nThey found that cash costs varied among companies, with Cipher Mining and TeraWulf as relative newcomers having the lowest costs.\n\nOn the measure of all-cash costs, Cipher Mining performed well, while larger-scale operations like Riot and Core Scientific also demonstrated favorable results.\n\nGoldman Sachs earlier predicted a $100,000 target for bitcoin\n\nVarious analysts have weighed in on bitcoin\u2019s potential trajectory. At the start of last year, Goldman Sachs said bitcoin could hit $100,000 in the next five years if investors treat it like gold.\n\nMore recently, Matrixport\u2019s head of research predicted the cryptoasset would hit $125,000 by the end of next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Seven years ago, Monday, bitcoin mining rewards were cut from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 BTC \u2014 a phenomenon that spurred a price rally industry watchers expect to repeat when the next Bitcoin halving hits in 2024.\n\nThe implications of the history of halvings repeating in bullish price terms would spill over to bitcoin traders and holders, as well as miners and other network participants. It\u2019s a pattern that has held true across a number of halvings: The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second, taking place nearly four years after the first in 2012 and four years before the third in 2020.\n\nA fourth bitcoin halving is slated for April 2024, at which point mining rewards will fall to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nBitcoin traded around $650 on July 9, 2016, Berenberg Capital Markets analysts noted in a recent report. And 524 days later, it hit a then-record of $19,712.\n\nSimilar rallies occurred after the first and third bitcoin halvings, Berenberg analysts \u2014 Mark Palmer, Matthew LaFlash and Hassan Saleem \u2014 found.\n\nBitcoin jumped from $12 on Nov. 28, 2012 to $1,164 just 367 days later.\n\nAfter mining rewards were slashed from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC on May 11, 2020 \u2014 when one bitcoin cost $8,821 \u2014 it reached its all-time high 549 days later at $69,036.\n\n\u201cIf a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025,\u201d the Berenberg analysts wrote.\n\nBut the adoption level of bitcoin now from seven years ago is distinctly different, industry participants said.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate sits at roughly 425 million terahash/second (TH/s), according to data compiled by YCharts.com. That figure was closer to 1.5 million terahash/second (TH/s) in July 2016.\n\n\u201cBack in 2016 you could solo mine with just your laptop, whereas now you need high-end, mining-specific machines and join large mining pools to compete,\u201d said Matt Lason, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital.\n\nRead more: Which bitcoin miners are growing the fastest in 2023?\n\nLason added he expects bitcoin\u2019s price to follow previous trends by spiking in the upcoming halving\u2019s aftermath, noting that the bitcoin halving cycle is set to correspond with a crypto and equity bull market.\n\n\u201cWhile past price increases don\u2019t guarantee a future increase, the bitcoin halvings serve as a great reminder for everyone of the power of bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy and the true value of scarcity in an inflationary world,\u201d Lason told Blockworks.\n\nBitcoin up 82% in 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell below $17,000 after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. But it stood at about $30,300 Monday afternoon \u2014 up roughly 82% so far in 2023.\n\nThe Berenberg Capital Markets analysts pointed out, too, bitcoin\u2019s positive price action after BlackRock \u2014 a TradFi giant with $9 trillion assets under management \u2014 filed an application with the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF last month.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink said last week during a Fox Business interview he believes the role of crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold in many ways.\u201d He also referred to bitcoin as an \u201cinternational asset.\u201d\n\nDespite an expected rise in bitcoin price, the 2024 halving presents a unique challenge for miners, Lason said. As the rewards of those companies are set to drop, their hardware and electricity costs have \u201cexploded,\u201d he added.\n\nMore miners have opted to sell at least a portion of the bitcoin they mine in recent months to cover various operating costs.\n\nGeoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered\u2019s foreign exchange and digital assets research, said in a research note Monday that he expects miner selling to decrease amid higher bitcoin prices and increased cash profits.\n\nThis could push bitcoin\u2019s price to $50,000 by the end of the year and to $100,000 by the end of 2024, he added.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Tuesday morning trading in Asia to hold above US$30,000, helped by U.K. bank Standard Chartered Plc predicting the token will reach US$120,000 by the end of 2024. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also moved higher, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally. U.S. equity futures also gained in the Asia time zone on Tuesday after Federal Reserve officials said the bank\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is drawing to a close.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin gained 0.79% over the last 24 hours to US$30,392 as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently fluctuated around the US$30,000 line but prices turned softer late last week on mixed signals about the likelihood of approval for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds. The token is still sitting on a weekly loss of 2.35%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nHowever, some optimism returned to Bitcoin\u2019s pricing outlook after Standard Chartered bank predicted in a Monday report the token would reach US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 at the end of the following year, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event to take place next April, scarcer Bitcoin supply could drive up prices and in turn prompt miners to hoard the token, the Standard Chartered report said. \u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAnother plus for prices: cryptocurrency-linked investment products saw net inflows of US$136 million in the week ending July 7, marking the third consecutive week of inflows and fully correcting the prior nine weeks of outflows, according to European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares on Monday.\n\n\u201cBitcoin remains the focus amongst investors, with inflows totalling US$133m last week, while short-bitcoin saw outflows of US$1.8m, its 11th consecutive week, further demonstrating investors favour the asset over altcoins at present,\u201d wrote CoinShares in the report.\n\nStory continues\n\nEther rose 1.00% to US$1,880, but like Bitcoin it\u2019s coming off softer prices and is still down 3.80% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains in the past 24 hours with the exception of Dogecoin and Solana\u2019s SOL, which both dipped but the declines were within 0.5%.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic led the winners, jumping 6.97% to US$0.7356 and adding 3.33% for the week. \u201cSome positive on-chain signs for the 12th ranked market cap asset include rebounding network growth, decreasing supply on exchanges, and low profit taking,\u201d said crypto data tracker Santiment in a tweet on early Tuesday, adding the token is on a \u201cmini-run.\u201d\n\nMatic\u2019s recent run up comes as Polygon Labs unveiled its Polygon 2.0 roadmap on June 30, vowing to become the \u201cValue Layer of the Internet\u201d and on Friday appointed the firm\u2019s former chief legal officer Marc Boiron as its new Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHowever, the token has had a rough ride in 2023, down about 2%, and has plenty of ground to make up on peers such as Solana, which has jumped 115% so far this year. Polkadot has gained 18% in the same period\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.81% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume surged 70.03% to US$33.54 billion.\n\nNFT volumes skid amid low floor prices\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.20% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,745.16. Forkast\u2019s Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also fell, while Ethereum\u2019s index rose.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 9.41% to US$25.36 million, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 2.39% to US$15.67 million, while Bitcoin volume fell 39.97% to US$4.22 million.\n\n\u201cPrimarily a red or even day across collections in regards to floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cTraders seem to be out of liquidity and most are accepting the idea that the NFT market will continue to decline.\u201d\n\nBy collection, trading volume in Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection topped the list, edging up 2.96% to US$2.16 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs and uncategorized Ordinals inscriptions ranked the second and the third.\n\nThe floor prices of BAYC and Mutant Ape Yacht Club edged higher in the past 24 hours, while Azuki and the Captainz moved around 1% lower. All four NFT collections have seen their floor prices slide 20% to 60% in the past month, according to data from NFT analytics platform WGMI.io.\n\nBlur Blend, the NFT lending platform of NFT marketplace Blur.io, started to support Azuki Elementals and Elemental Beans on Tuesday. The two NFT collections are spin-offs of Chiru Labs\u2019 Azuki, which have been criticized by some holders for being too similar to the original Azuki collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki Elementals and Elemental Beanz were both added to Blur\u2019s Blend lending protocol, and both saw their prices decrease as traders sold possibly to exit farmed collections,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cPerhaps they sense fear of further floor price decreases with gamified trading.\u201d\n\nAn end to rate hikes?\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, following on from gains in all three major U.S. indexes in regular Monday trading.\n\nU.S. equities received a boost from comments by several Federal Reserve officials on Monday, indicating that while more interest rate hikes are needed to curb inflation, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is drawing to an end, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMy view is that the funds rate will need to move up somewhat further from its current level and then hold there for a while as we accumulate more information on how the economy is evolving,\u201d said Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta J. Mester on Monday. The Fed was \u201ccloser to the end of our tightening phase than the beginning,\u201d she added.\n\nMost main stock indexes across Asia benefited from the optimism on Wall Street, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all moving higher on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Citigroup downgraded the outlook for U.S. stocks to neutral on Monday on expectations for a retreat in growth stocks and a recession in the fourth quarter of the year, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for June comes out Wednesday, offering the latest insight into the pace of U.S. inflation. Financial giants including BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also set to report their second-quarter earnings this week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which now sit between 5% and 5.25%, The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, and a 7.6% chance for the Fed to leave the rate unchanged.\n\nIn China, the People\u2019s Bank of China and National Financial Regulatory Administration said in a joint statement on Monday they would take measures to stabilize the country\u2019s property industry, which include encouraging financial institutions to extend property firms\u2019 outstanding loans through negotiations. The signal was welcomed by investors and drove up shares of property developers, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) will suck in \u201call prosperity gains\u201d in future and leave behind those who have no exposure as a result, a new prediction says.\n\nIn a Twitter thread on July 8, investor Luke Broyles delivered a bold vision of how Bitcoin would become \u201csociety\u2019s base money.\u201d\n\nInvestor tells would-be Bitcoin buyers: \u201cGet off zero\u201d\n\nWhat started off as a commentary on how artificial intelligence (AI) is welcoming BTC soon became a dramatic outline of how it should end up as the world\u2019s go-to currency.\n\nFor Broyles, Bitcoin\u2019s key attribute \u2014 a fixed, immutable supply \u2014 makes it unique as a future-proof asset.\n\n\u201cEvery innovation (even AI) will rush as quickly as possible to competitively force prices down. Every country will rush as quickly as possible to print currency to force prices up and sustain credit markets. Both of these forces will increase in speed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBTC, meanwhile, will remain constant in its emission, and as a result, even a tiny exposure is a world away from nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWe have less in common with the future than the past... Bitcoin is trading for hundreds of millions of political currency units in many nations already. But the ACTUAL big deal is that all prosperity gains from all future innovations will flow into society's base money- BTC,\u201d Broyles continued.\n\n\u201cThis is why it is CRUCIAL for people to \u2018get off zero.\u2019 Saying \u2018Bitcoin is digital gold\u2019 is like saying a locomotive is an iron horse.\u201d\n\nBitcoin supply dynamics data. Source: Luke Broyles/Twitter\n\nHis perspective chimes with that recently published by Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Hayes believes that AI will instinctively choose BTC as its financial lifeblood, again thanks to its unique qualities compared to other assets, including gold.\n\nAs a result, AI alone could push the BTC price past $750,000 per token.\n\nBTC supply dominance hits \u201cinflection point\u201d\n\nThe race to secure the remaining BTC supply, meanwhile, may have already started.\n\nRelated: BTC price remains \u2018undoubtedly bullish\u2019 as $30K Bitcoin buyers emerge\n\nBroyles argued that Bitcoin liquidity in fact peaked during the March 2020 cross-market crash, and will never retrace its steps since.\n\nWhen the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced a Bitcoin spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing, meanwhile, U.S. BTC activity rocketed.\n\nAs noted by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the U.S. appears to be reassessing its own exposure.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained,\u201d it commented on July 8.\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the differences in regional BTC supply ownership change.\n\nBTC Regional Year-over-Year Supply Change annotated chart.

Source: GlobeNewswire\n\nThe primary reason cited for the decline in production, which saw 979 Bitcoin produced throughout the month, was the impact of the weather conditions in Texas, where Marathon\u2019s main operations are located.\n\n\u201cThe decreased production relative to last month was due to weather-related curtailment in Texas and a significant decrease in transaction fees.\u201d\n\nThe start of June marks the transition from spring to summer in Texas.\n\nAccording to data from the National Weather Service in Dallas, Texas, there was a jump of almost 8.4 degrees fahrenheit in the average temperature between May and June. May averaged 75.6 degrees, whereas June averaged 84 degrees.\n\nOn Feb. 6, Cointelegraph reported that crypto mining firm Riot Platforms had 17,040 rigs go offline at its operations in Texas due to \u201csevere winter weather\u201d in the state.\n\nThe statement added that Marathon Digital\u2019s transaction fees fell to approximately 5.1% of the total Bitcoin earned in June, compared to 11.8% earned in May.\n\nIt noted the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals significantly increased transaction fees in May, adding that while network congestion eased in June, the company still has a positive outlook for the \u201cfuture of mining economics.\u201d\n\nRelated: Heating a home with a Bitcoin miner: Staying warm with sats\n\nThis is not the first time that Texas weather has had a major impact on crypto miners.\n\nIn July 2022, Peter Wall, CEO of crypto mining company Argo Blockchain, which operates a data center in West Texas, told Cointelegraph that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas sent out a conservation alert, forcing Argo, along with many other mining operators in the area, to shut down mining activities temporarily.\n\nIn more recent news, a July 5 report by cryptocurrency analytics platform Coin Metrics revealed that Bitcoin miners made $184 million from transaction fees in the second quarter of 2023, which is more than they made throughout the entire year of 2022.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "content": "Switzerland has long been a haven for the wealthy due to its well-established banking secrecy laws, but its citizens have warmed quickly to the self-sovereign ideals behind Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall at the Plan \u20bf Bitcoin Summer School in Lugano, Switzerland, Giw Zanganeh, head of Lugano\u2019s Plan \u20bf initiative, highlighted the growing use of Bitcoin for everyday payments in the Swiss city.\n\nZanganeh chats with Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall at the Plan B Summer School in Lugano.\n\nLugano has emerged as an adoption hub for Bitcoin, Tether (USDT) and its self-styled LVGA stablecoin, which can be used to pay for a variety of utility bills, goods and services across the city.\n\nZanganeh believes that Switzerland has shown remarkable adoption of cryptocurrencies despite its renowned traditional financial and banking infrastructure:\n\n\u201cWhat I see is a society, which makes me very bullish; a lot of people are interested in Bitcoin from a philosophical perspective as well. It aligns very well with Swiss values.\u201d\n\nZanganeh added that the Swiss are typically \u201cstrong on individual sovereignty and financial privacy\u201d, which creates overlaps between the values of Swiss culture and those of the Bitcoin movement:\n\n\u201cConsidering the amount of Bitcoin-only companies in Switzerland, it probably has one of the highest density per capita of Bitcoin-only companies around the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zanganeh, more politicians, diplomats and members of parliament and Switzerland\u2019s financial commission are becoming Bitcoiners, reaffirming a bullish outlook for BTC adoption in the country.\n\nRelated: McDonald\u2019s, pizza and coffee paid in Bitcoin: The Plan B for crypto payments\n\nA significant contributor to increased Bitcoin usage is the effort to inform and educate the Swiss populace about the merits of BTC:\n\n\u201cWe have regular articles in newspapers where we touch on different aspects of Bitcoin and financial liberty. We try to reach people interested in financial freedom and freedom of speech. Maybe they don\u2019t know how Bitcoin plays a role there.\u201d\n\nWhile the uptake of Plan \u20bf\u2019s Bitcoin adoption is a \u201cgradual process,\u201d Zanganeh said that onboarding merchants across Lugano has been crucial in opening up a new payments paradigm in the region.\n\nLikening the process of Bitcoin adoption to the initial proliferation of bank cards some 50 years ago, Zanganeh said that practical experience with novel transactional methods would continue to onboard more users to the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cIf you look at merchants over time, if more and more people go and pay with Bitcoin, you're going to learn.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dirk Klee highlighted the country\u2019s potential as a center point for institutional cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nThe Canton of Zug is another region of Switzerland that continues to attract cryptocurrency and blockchain firms due to its progressive, government-backed, crypto-friendly initiatives.\n\nThe interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about what it\u2019s like to attend a Bitcoin School.

        "title": "Bitcoin has entered a civil war \u2014 Over 'art' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In an email dated Jan. 17, 1993, Hal Finney \u2014 a developer and early contributor to Bitcoin \u2014 shared the concept of \u201cencrypted digital cards,\u201d which are now known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\u201cGiving a little more thought to the idea of buying and selling digital cash, I thought of a way to present it,\u201d Finney wrote at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re buying and selling \u2018cryptographic trading cards.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe most fascinating detail of his email lies in the fact that, by sharing this idea, Finney intended to facilitate the understanding of the concept of digital money. His vision foreshadowed what we saw in 2021 with the NFT boom. Overnight, the crypto space shifted from being solely about financial decentralization to also encompassing the decentralization of art, gaming, entertainment and more.\n\nHal Finney's email about \"encrypted digital cards.\"\n\nThe narrative that was once theoretical and pushed forcefully became practical and part of the daily culture of millions of people who had never considered buying cryptocurrencies before. And with the introduction of the Ordinals protocol in early 2023, we are witnessing the emergence of such cases.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nHowever, this movement is not being well-received by some \u201cred-eyed guardians.\u201d\n\nThe Wizard JPEG that sparked a civil war in Bitcoin\n\nIn February 2023, the Taproot Wizards achieved a notable feat using the Ordinals protocol. They generated the largest block ever recorded in Bitcoin\u2019s history at that time, reaching nearly 4 megabytes in size.\n\nEric Wall tweet about the largest block in Bitcoin's history. Source: Twitter\n\nTheir goal was clear: to challenge the existing norms and cultivate an experimental and rebellious mindset within the Bitcoin ecosystem. More than 14 million inscriptions have occurred since the \u201cWizard Block,\u201d generating something magnificent: a circular digital economy where assets are priced, bought and sold via Bitcoin (BTC). (Inscriptions inscribe sats with content, creating NFTs.)\n\nLibert\u00e9, rare sats and Fraternit\u00e9\n\nTo illustrate the rapid pace of experiments within this ecosystem, in February, traders were buying and selling Ordinal NFTs using Google Sheets since there were no available marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe are experimenters in an experimental protocol. And my goal is clear: to onboard, educate, entertain and experiment on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d a figure in the Ordinal ecosystem who goes by \u201cBitGod\u201d told me in an interview.\n\nYet, in a matter of mere months, notable corporations and projects entered the scene, providing some framework for this market. As a result, the market has witnessed over 140,000 distinct users and a trading volume surpassing $220 billion.\n\nAnd among the experiments sparking this interest, one narrative has captured the attention of the general public: rare sats.\n\nMany projects are using this narrative to tokenize their artworks. CTRL, for example, was the first project to inscribe on a \u201cRare\u201d satoshi.\n\nCTRL's tweet about inscribing the first \"Rare\" Satoshi. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cI think the image symbolizes the CTRL movement and its inflection point at the time of discovering the Rare sat,\u201d Jameson Mah told me. \u201cThe movement is diverse, humble, cypherpunk, fresh blood and energy. CTRL is quite literally replacing the vintage $2 bill that represents the old archaic systems, and the hash of the Rare sat inscription peeking out the back. Then Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s genesis block message that started it all is illuminated by the light of the power of the Rare sat in the center. It\u2019s non-violent, but it\u2019s also clearly rebellious.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nCurrently, only eight Rare sats similar to the one used by CTRL in their artwork have been found. And one of them has a bid of $600,000 in an auction. The other one is Gansy, the founder of the Rare Satoshi Society. He disclosed that RSS has already generated over $2.5 million by providing satoshis with specific attributes for more than 100 Ordinals projects. With the objective of preserving their status as the leading supplier of rare sats in the market, his team has already transacted over $3 billion in BTC, searching for the gems that constitute their current portfolio.\n\nThere are several other experiments bringing fresh blood to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Prominent Ordinals use cases that deserve exploration include BRC-20, bitmap and recursive inscriptions.\n\nWhat to expect from Bitcoin season 2?\n\nRecognizing Ordinals as a highly complementary movement to the success of Bitcoin is crucial. The ecosystem\u2019s triumph does not hinge on a single solution, but rather a combination of various factors that contribute to its prosperity.\n\nIn certain instances, such as in Argentina, the adoption of Bitcoin will be driven by necessity. For others, it will stem from their fascination with the underlying principles of Bitcoin. Institutional adoption through ETFs will contribute a significant portion to the adoption curve. Additionally, the emergence of Ordinals applications will bring a dual benefit to the network, fostering both adoption and the evolution of the ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMy first expectation is that many projects will experiment on Bitcoin,\u201d Mah said, adding, \u201cNext, with this renewed interest, the network will become a lot more expensive to use. Therefore, some of this activity logically should move to layer 2s. Many builders are already experimenting with rollup architecture on top of Bitcoin, for example.\u201d\n\nTo conclude, Mah said, \u201cIt\u2019s important among the hype to always look for true innovation, substance and creativity \u2014 and importantly, Bitcoin-native thinking.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nLugui Tillier is the chief commercial officer of Lumx Studios, a Web3 studio that counts BTG Pactual Bank, the largest investment bank in Latin America, among its investors.

        "content": "Nonfarm payrolls rose by 209,000 in June, below economists\u2019 expectations of an addition of 240,000 jobs. Although the figures show a cooling labor market, market observers remained concerned as the average hourly earnings growth held steady at 0.4% from May and 4.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe report did not alter expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike by the United States Federal Reserve in the next meeting, according to the FedWatch Tool. That kept the U.S. equities markets under pressure, with all three major indices falling for the week. The S&P 500 was down 1.16% and the Nasdaq was lower by 0.92%.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAnother minor negative for the crypto markets was a report by JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, which said that a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) may not prove to be a game changer for the crypto space. Panigirtzoglou cites lackluster interest in the spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada and Europe as the reason for a possible low impact even in the U.S.\n\nCould bulls regroup and kick Bitcoin above the overhead resistance? If they do, select altcoins could join the march higher. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that are showing signs of moving up.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains stuck between the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,854) and the overhead resistance at $31,000. This suggests uncertainty among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe BTC/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA on July 7, indicating that the bulls continue to defend the level aggressively. Buyers will again attempt to overcome the resistance at $31,500. If they succeed, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could first advance to $32,400 and thereafter sprint toward $40,000.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to protect the overhead resistance and tug the price below the $29,500 support. If this level gives way, stops of several short-term bulls may be hit. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,101).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is trading between $29,500 and $31,500. Generally, a tight range trading is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty. Hence, it is better to wait for the price to escape the range before waging large bets.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 50-SMA, the bulls will try to drive the pair above $31,500. If they manage to do that, the pair may start a new up-move. Conversely, a tumble below $29,500 could start a correction toward $27,500.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has been trading in a large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for the past several months. The failure to sustain the price below the support of the range started an up-move that has risen above the downtrend line. This suggests that the bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is a minor resistance at $22 but if this level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair may rally to $24 and ultimately to the stiff overhead resistance of $27.12.\n\nOn the downside, $18.70 is the important support to keep an eye on. A break and close below this level may open the doors for a possible drop to the strong support zone between $16.18 and $15.28.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in positive territory on the four-hour chart. This suggests that the bulls are in command. However, the bears have not yet given up and have pulled the price to the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, the bulls will make one more attempt to overcome the obstacle at $22. If they can pull it off, the pair may jump toward $24.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a drop below the 20-EMA. That will indicate profit-booking by the short-term bulls. The pair may then slide to the 50-SMA.\n\nAvalanche price analysis\n\nAfter struggling near the 50-day SMA ($12.99) for several days, Avalanche (AVAX) successfully scaled the level on July 8.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory. This suggests that bulls have an edge. The AVAX/USDT pair could rise to $16 where the bears may again mount a strong defense.\n\nIf subsequent corrections find support at the 20-day EMA ($13), it will suggest the start of an up-move toward $18. The important support to watch on the downside is $12. A break below this level may drag the price to the vital support at $10.52.\n\nAVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the price has risen above the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that bulls are trying to take charge. The up-move may face selling near the stiff overhead resistance of $15, but bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-EMA. If this support holds, the likelihood of a rally above $15 increases.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly yank the price below the moving averages. That may trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in long liquidation. The pair may then slide to the support line of the triangle.\n\nRelated: BlackRock ETF stirs US Bitcoin buying as research says 'get off zero'\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern which will complete on a break and close above the neckline near $5.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages are about to complete a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory. This indicates that bulls have a slight edge. The bulls will try to drive the price to the neckline of the reversal pattern. If bulls overcome this barrier, the FIL/USDT pair may start a new up-move. The pattern target of this bullish setup is $7.30.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the short term if the price breaks and sustains below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $3.5 and later to $3.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is in a corrective phase, but the buyers are trying to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair may then gradually climb toward the overhead resistance near $5.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the moving averages and plummets below $4.20, it will suggest that the short-term sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That may pull the price to $4 and subsequently to $3.60.\n\nEOS price analysis\n\nEOS (EOS) has been forming a higher high and higher low pattern, suggesting a potential trend change in the near term.\n\nEOS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.73) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Buyers will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $0.79 to indicate that the downtrend may be ending. The EOS/USDT pair could then surge toward $0.93.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.60 and $0.79 for some more time.\n\nEOS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair has been gradually moving up. If buyers kick the price above the 50-SMA, the pair may retest the overhead resistance at $0.79. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could soar to $0.83 and eventually to $0.90.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then slump to $0.67 and later to $0.64.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Because it is censorship-resistant and limited to 21 million coins, which establishes its worth over time, Hayes claimed that Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency for AI.\n\nStablecoins, on the other hand, can be frozen and censored by their issuer, making them less suitable for AI. Hayes dismissed Ethereum as a contender for AI's currency of choice, arguing that it has other applications, unlike Bitcoin and fiat currency, which are \"just money.\""

        "content": "The weighted average cost of purchased Bitcoin recently reached a level signifying that all investors who have consistently dollar-cost averaged into the leading cryptocurrency are now in the black, regardless of how long they have been holding.\n\nJust a reminder that every single pleb who has been dollar cost averaging #bitcoin is now in profit no matter when they first started DCA'ing. Every single one of them! pic.twitter.com/pnuIqdQznM \u2014 Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) July 3, 2023\n\nThis news comes despite the price of Bitcoin, as measured in U.S. dollars, still being down by over 50% from its all-time high of around $69,000.\n\nDollar-cost-averaging (DCA for short) is a strategy that consists of making regular purchases of an asset for a fixed dollar amount. The idea is that by spreading buy orders out over time, volatility can be mitigated. Some buys will execute at lower prices while others will be executed at higher prices. This method can be particularly appealing for an asset like Bitcoin, which has been known for its legendary volatility.\n\nAnd yet, many financial pundits in the space still cling to the notion of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) entire existence and market cap of nearly $600 billion being based on a Ponzi scheme of some sort. Others continue to deny that saving in the hardest form of money ever known has, so far, been an excellent investment thesis \u2014 one that has outperformed all others.\n\nYes, there may be risks. And yes, volatility definitely comes with the territory. But looking at such factors in a vacuum does not make for adequate analysis of any investment. The alternative strategies available must be taken into consideration, along with other variables such as:\n\nWhat is the current macro environment, and how might it change going forward? What impact might this have on different asset classes and their performance?\n\nWhat risk/reward ratio does one strategy offer in comparison to others?\n\nCan diversification lead to an optimized risk/return profile, or does YOLO\u2019ing all-in provide better returns?\n\nThese are just a few potential questions that could be worth investigating when it comes to arguments against dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into BTC for the long term.\n\nBitcoin outperforms traditional investments\n\nSome investors, like those at Adamant Research, have been pointing out the reality of Bitcoin\u2019s most favorable risk/reward ratio for many years:\n\n\u201cWe assert that the long term risk reward ratio for Bitcoin is currently the most favorable of any liquid investment in the world. We expect for it to trade in a range of $3,000 to $6,500 after which we foresee the emergence of a new bull market.\u201d\n\nThe group made similar statements during the bear markets of 2015 and 2011 as well.\n\nMany traditional investments, like gold, real estate, or a portfolio consisting of 60% equities and 40% bonds, have significantly underperformed compared to DCA'ing into Bitcoin.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the relative performance of several currencies and asset classes against BTC quite well:\n\nNeedless to say, when it comes to comparing the performance of a DCA strategy in Bitcoin versus literally any other asset, there is little comparison to be made.\n\nTo diversify or not?\n\nTraditional asset managers tend to abide by certain rules, one of them being the idea of rebalancing. When a particular asset outperforms, profits should be taken and distributed elsewhere, according to this line of thinking.\n\nIt can be considered a form of diversification \u201con the go,\u201d so to speak. But whether discussing diversifying from the onset of constructing a portfolio or as time goes on, how would such a strategy compare to going all-in on what has so far been considered one of the riskiest, most speculative assets of all time?\n\nThe answer is simple: Doing so would be \u201cselling the winner to buy the losers,\u201d as investor Michael Saylor has said.\n\nOn a five-year basis, BTC/USD is up 376%. Compare this to about 55% for the S&P 500 or gold.\n\n5-year chart of BTC, SPY and gold. Source: TradingView\n\nTaking profits from Bitcoin at any point in time and putting them into other assets would have decimated a portfolio\u2019s potential. Income from dividends doesn\u2019t compensate, except for those working with multimillion-dollar portfolios. And even then, the potential income would be dwarfed by the capital gains of holding a large Bitcoin position.\n\nWhile the concept of \u201crisk\u201d often implies volatility and potential downside, what about the risk associated with \u201cplaying it safe?\u201d Some argue that investors should also be concerned about the potential of their portfolios to barely keep pace with the rate of inflation, which has become a significant risk in recent years.\n\nRelated: CPI meets low BTC supply \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nMacro trends to consider\n\nProponents of Bitcoin and the DCA strategy have long since contended that BTC serves as the ultimate hedge against monetary inflation and overall financial market uncertainty.\n\nDespite critics\u2019 best efforts aimed at destroying this narrative, it has prevailed.\n\nLook no further than the banking collapses of 2023 and Bitcoin\u2019s resulting rally for proof. Furthermore, while the saying \u201cso much for an inflation hedge\u201d became popular in 2022 as BTC fell sharply from its all-time high, that idea strangely seemed to go by the wayside in 2023.\n\nYTD chart of BTC/USD.

More likely, it simply lies dormant for a time.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race\n\nFor many Bitcoin and crypto cynics, no amount of evidence will alter their convictions. Once a Ponzi scheme, always a Ponzi scheme, in their view. But hodlers have taken the orange pill and seen the truth while reaping the just rewards.\n\nWhile Bitcoiners can invite others to the cause, no one can force a worldview on another. Even if that view has long since become self-evident.\n\nBTC is up 87% year-to-date. Still, the price remains 44% beneath the all-time high of $69,000. The next halving is less than one year away, projected for May 2024.\n\nFollowing this event, along with the prospect of increased institutional adoption in the immediate future, it\u2019s widely anticipated that the Bitcoin price could reach six-figure territory and beyond during this cycle.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The US central bank is likely to raise them further and keep them there, ProChain Capital's David Tamil told Fox Business in a recent interview.\n\n\"It is going to crush some very interest-rate sensitive industries such as real estate,\" he said about that prospect. \"I think we're going to see a multi-year, maybe decade-long fallout, first on commercial and then we will eventually get to housing.\"\n\nHigher rates lift mortgage rates, making it more expensive to buy a home using debt. They also raise interest costs for property developers. As a result, they tend to weaken demand for real estate, pulling down prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican households have been squeezed by historic inflation and higher interest payments on their mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and other debts. Yet home prices are still up about 40% since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Index.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before higher interest rates sap demand and home values fall, at least in Tamil's view. He also spies danger in the debt-fueled commercial real estate sector, which faces the prospect of not only greater borrowing costs and lower asset values, but also a credit crunch as lenders pull back in fear of more bank runs and further declines in their bond and property portfolios.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the crypto investor is far more bullish on bitcoin. The most popular coin's price is likely to end the year up 66% at a two-year high of $50,000, he said.\n\nTamil rooted his prediction in the rising interest among asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in offering bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is going to be a tectonic shift for the use of cryptocurrencies to go ahead and represent ownership of assets,\" he said."

        "content": "Bitcoin, a name that rings bells of triumph for some while causing apprehension for others, has made its mark in the financial sphere.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Bitcoin\u2019s rollercoaster ride has raised countless eyebrows, leading many to question, \u201cWill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d This question is pivotal to both budding investors and experienced traders. Traders Union, a highly regarded entity in the trading world, has shed some light on this topic.\n\nHaving uncovered the dynamics behind the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, Traders Union revealed: will Bitcoin go back up? Indeed, the answer lies in understanding this unique asset\u2019s risks, opportunities, and market behavior.\n\nIs Bitcoin a good investment today?\n\nAccording to Traders Union experts, Bitcoin is undeniably a good investment today. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s value has soared exponentially, defying conventional market dynamics and asserting itself as one of today\u2019s best-performing assets. Its robust performance stems from its decentralized nature, limited supply, and immunity to traditional economic forces like inflation. Although the market is experiencing a correction phase after Bitcoin\u2019s price surpassed $60,000, history shows it tends to display high growth rates, making it a promising long-term investment.\n\nWhy investing in Bitcoin is a good idea\n\nTraders Union experts point to several reasons for considering Bitcoin as a good investment. First, Bitcoin\u2019s price has significantly corrected, indicating a good buying opportunity. Second, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin adds reliability and credibility to its name. The success of the Bitcoin Lightning network also contributes to Bitcoin\u2019s appeal, with lower transaction costs compared to traditional systems like Visa. The potential value of Bitcoin as a digital gold, the halving cycle that makes Bitcoin scarce, the bull cycle theory, and its benchmark status among cryptocurrencies all contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s potential as an investment.\n\nWhy investing in Bitcoin might be a problem\n\nHowever, Traders Union experts caution that potential investors must also know the risks. Regulatory concerns loom as some countries have banned Bitcoin usage. There is also the fear of a potential recession that could significantly affect newer assets like Bitcoin. The divided forecasts about Bitcoin\u2019s future price add to the risk, forcing investors to carefully analyze different opinions before making decisions.\n\nHow much should I invest in Bitcoin?\n\nAs per the Traders Union experts, the size of your Bitcoin investment depends on your financial capabilities and risk appetite. Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s recommended that investors only allocate a small portion of their portfolio to this asset class. As a rule of thumb, investing more than 10% of the total long-term investment capital in one cryptocurrency is not advised.\n\nIs investing $100 or $1000 in Bitcoin enough?\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin requires strategic planning. Traders Union suggests adopting a steady strategy by investing a fixed monthly amount, whether that\u2019s $20, $100, or $1000. Significantly, one should never invest more than they can afford to lose. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and limited liquidity mean small investments may not allow for portfolio diversification, potentially leading to riskier trading decisions. Therefore, carefully consider your financial capabilities before entering the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin forecast and whether it will go up or not, the Traders Union has also reviewed and published the XAUUSD forecast. To read the forecast and know in-depth, please visit the official website of the Traders Union.\n\nHow long should I keep Bitcoin?\n\nTU experts suggest that the duration for which one should hold Bitcoin depends on their individual situation and objectives. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, go through bearish and sideways cycles that typically last 2-3 years. During a bear market, it is crucial to exercise patience as the market may eventually rise. On the other hand, it is often recommended to consider selling when the market is euphoric.\n\nLong-term holders may benefit from holding Bitcoin for an extended period. As time progresses, more people become interested in obtaining BTC due to its limited supply, leading to increased liquidity in the form of buy/sell orders. This could potentially result in capital appreciation over the long term.\n\nAlternatively, shorter-term traders may aim to capitalize on quick market movements. By buying low and selling high with enough frequency, they can potentially generate profits from the volatility of the market. Ultimately, the decision of how long to hold Bitcoin depends on the type of investor you are and your specific investment goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe question, \u201cWill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d is complex and requires careful consideration of various factors. Bitcoin has proven its worth as an investment in the past, but like any asset, it carries potential risks. Therefore, investing in Bitcoin is crucial to understanding the market dynamics, keeping abreast of regulatory changes, and considering one\u2019s financial capabilities and risk appetite.\n\nIf you\u2019re still pondering, \u201cwill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d Traders Union could be your guide through the complex world of cryptocurrency. Encouraging you to deepen your understanding, we invite you to visit Traders Union\u2019s official website to learn more about Bitcoin and other trading opportunities."

Blockchain analytical firm Kaiko reported that this issue greatly affected Binance.US\u2019 reputation, and its market share fell to less than 1%.\n\nSince then, the exchange has experienced high volatility with its USD pairs, with BTC spiking to as high as $138,000 on June 21. Before that, Bitcoin had traded at a 3% discount in May.\n\nMeanwhile, assets paired with stablecoins like USDT and USDC are trading at regular prices, according to data from Coingecko.\n\nTether CTO addresses USDT trading on Binance.US\n\nTether CTO Paolo Ardoino addressed concerns that USDT had deviated from its dollar peg. He highlighted that the deviation is exclusive to Binance.US, where a general -8% spread appears to affect all cryptocurrencies on the platform.\n\nAccording to Ardoino, the situation was caused by the legal challenges Binance.US was currently facing. He wrote:\n\n\u201cBinance.US is going through some legal challenges so it probably doesn\u2019t have many market makers willing to arbitrage at this moment in time. On Binance.com USDt is trading 1bps above the dollar.\u201d\n\nThe Tether CTO further added:\n\n\u201cTether is in charge of its primary market (http://tether.to). Market making secondary markets (crypto exchanges) is the role of arbitrageurs and market makering professionals.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

Ethereum prices are around $200 cheaper on Binance.US, trading for $1,695 at the time of writing.

Effectively, this means that the discounted cryptocurrencies can only be bought with any USD already sitting on the account before the suspensions.\n\nConcerns that Binance.US will soon halt USD withdrawals have also led to some users trading their cryptocurrencies below market value in order to exit their positions in USD.\n\nAccording to an email from Binance.US to customers, which has circulated on Twitter, the last day for USD withdrawals will be July 20.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin priced on Binance\u200b.US crypto exchange at $700 premium\n\nIn late May, a similar situation occurred relating to the Australian dollar at the Australian branch of Binance when the company\u2019s third-party payments provider shuttered fiat on- and off-ramps.\n\nThe price of BTC on Binance fell 20% compared to global spot prices when traded against the Australian dollar.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

Geoff Kendrick, one of the bank's top FX analysts, claimed there was now 20% \"upside\" to that prediction.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is up 84% year-to-date, from $16,547 on January 1 to $30,455.The bank's forecast was based on the supposition that the price momentum of Bitcoin will contribute to increasing industry revenue since the beginning of the year, reversing negative momentum while revenue declines in 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, data from on-chain analytics company Glassnode reveals that over the past few months, a significant portion of BTC has been shifting hands from short-term holders to strong hands, which is a key element of all prior Bitcoin bull markets."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin' (BTC) hash rate hit a new all-time high over the weekend, meaning that it becomes increasingly difficult for any individual or group to control more than 50% of the network\u2019s total computational power.\n\nAccording to data from Bitinfocharts, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate spiked to 465 EH/s on Saturday from 406 EH/s on the previous day.\n\nDespite the value dropping almost 6% to 428 EH/s on Sunday, the world\u2019s leading blockchain network\u2019s hash rate is still at its highest levels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin hash rate chart. Source: Bitinfocharts.\n\nIn the world of Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the hash rate stands as a critical metric, unveiling the health and security of the network. It serves as a measure of the estimated computational power committed to supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, encompassing crucial activities like mining, key generation, and block validation. By analyzing the hash rate, one can gain insights into the network's resilience against hostile takeovers, particularly the dreaded 51% attack, where an entity gains control over the majority of the network's computing power.\n\nA higher hash rate directly correlates with a more robust and secure network, creating formidable barriers for anyone attempting to compromise its integrity.\n\nAs the hash rate escalates, the level of difficulty for potential attacks increases exponentially, making the network increasingly impervious to malicious actors.\n\nWhile bringing more security to the network, an elevated hash rate, however, comes with certain trade-offs for miners. These include increased competition and the need to allocate additional resources for more powerful mining hardware and cooling systems, which may also result in higher energy consumption.\n\nTo compensate for the growing expanses, miners can sell the coins they produce, although dropping prices means they need to sell more Bitcoin for the same face value.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at $30,164, down 0.4% over the last day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin's hash rate surging?\n\nOne potential reason for the latest Bitcoin hash rate surge is that Texas-based miners \u201care back at full (or near full) capacity,\u201d according to a Hash Rate Index report.\n\nPointing to recent heatwaves in Texas, the report says that the scorching temperatures still turned out to be \u201ctoo weak to cause substantial problems\u201d to the state\u2019s electricity grid, meaning that miners could resume their operations as normal.\n\n\"The hash rate continues to rise as miners are replacing older hardware with newer and more efficient machines in anticipation of the upcoming halving. This means hash rate is still rising without the requirement for new locations and more power,\" Henrike Christin M\u00fcller, Investor Relations Manager at Northern Data told Decrypt. \"Moreover, the YTD increase in the BTC price also drives further hash rate expansion by miners globally.\"\n\nThis development is also likely to result in the growth in Bitcoin mining difficulty, added the report, forecasting an anticipated adjustment that is due later this week above 7.5%.\n\nMining difficulty is the value representing the computational power required to mine a single Bitcoin. It\u2019s adjusted roughly every two weeks, getting more difficult as more miners enter the network and easier when they leave.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of other miners around the world who are expanding capacity when/if they can, so the growth isn't only coming from Texas,\u201d said the report's authors. \u201cWherever it's coming from, the end result is the same: the next difficulty adjustment is going to be a f** whopper.\u201d\n\nAfter three consecutive positive adjustments, Bitcoin mining difficulty fell 3.26% on June 29, according to BTC.com.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered has boosted its Bitcoin price forecast to $120,000 by the end of 2024\u2014a 300% leap from where it is today.\n\nIn a report viewed by Reuters, the bank predicted Bitcoin\u2019s rise will be driven largely by miners hoarding their coins and cutting off additions to Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\" wrote Geoff Kendrick, one of Standard Chartered\u2019s top FX analysts, in the report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin is up 82% year to date, from $16,600 on January 1 to $30,280 at writing time. Since miners are rewarded with a fixed number of BTC (6.25) per block, such bullish price momentum has helped boost the industry\u2019s revenue since the start of the year, reversing negative momentum amid declining revenue in 2022.\n\nBitcoin Miner Revenue. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe opposite trend was visible in June of 2022, when BTC's falling price forced major miners like Core Scientific and Riot to dump the vast majority of their coins on the market, only contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s free fall to under $18,000.\n\nToday, miners have good reason to believe Bitcoin is back in an early upswing. Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that a large share of BTC has been moving hands from short-term holders to strong hands over the past few months, which is \u201c a primary component of all prior Bitcoin bull markets.\u201d Long-term holders are entities that haven\u2019t moved their coins for over 155 days and are generally less likely to be active (ex. be sold) in the near term.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin \u201cShrimps\u201d\u2014small entities with less than 1 BTC\u2014appear to be stacking sats harder than at any time since the peak of the late 2017 bull market. This cohort alone is sucking up more coins each month than miners can produce in their totality.\n\nAccording to Kendrick\u2019s estimates, miners are still selling 100% of their newly mined coins to cover costs. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price rises to $50,000 by the end of the year, this share of sold coins might reduce to just 20-30%, reducing circulating supply and creating a bullish feedback loop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n#Bitcoin Shrimp (< 1 $BTC) \ud83e\udd90 are stacking sats at a rate of 33.8k $BTC per month. Issuance \ud83d\udd35 is ~27.0k $BTC/mth For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market.

BlackRock, which filed for one such product last month, boasts a regulatory approval record on such products of 575:1."

        "content": "According to Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, Bitcoin could experience a surge of up to 300%, reaching a valuation of $120,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick\u2019s previous prediction in April was that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by next year, but he now believes this estimate may be too conservative, taking into account the impact of miner profitability.\n\nYou may also be interested in reading: Cryptocurrency for Everyday Life in Latam\n\nKendrick attributes his more bullish stance to increased mining profitability. As miners find it more profitable to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell it immediately, the reduced supply of Bitcoin in the market can push prices higher. Kendrick estimates that in the second quarter, nearly 100% of all mined Bitcoin was sold, but he expects miners to gradually reduce their sales over time.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Kendrick explains that when Bitcoin\u2019s price surpasses the average all-in cash cost of mining, miners tend to sell fewer tokens. If the average BTC price in the first quarter of 2024 reaches $50,000 as predicted, the calculation of \u201cBTC minus all cash costs\u201d would rise to $30,000. Consequently, selling only 27% of the Bitcoin mined in Q1-2024 would generate the same excess cash as selling 100% in Q2-2023.\n\nReduced miner selling not only affects prices but also impacts the inflation rate of Bitcoin. By reducing the net supply of Bitcoin by approximately 250,000, the inflation rate could decrease from 1.7% to 0.4% year-over-year.\n\nThe recent increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price, with it surpassing $30,000, has been attributed to interest from Wall Street giants in creating Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has led to other bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency, such as Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee forecasting a valuation of $200,000 in the coming years.\n\nThe profitability of mining has been rising as the cost to produce new Bitcoin decreases. Large-scale miners, including Riot and Core Scientific, have been cutting corporate costs, while energy prices have also declined. Additionally, halving events, which occur when the amount of Bitcoin produced by mining is halved, tend to lead to industry consolidation and further reduction in mining expenditures. The next halving event is expected to take place in April or May of 2024.\n\nYou may be interested: Fidelity seeks Bitcoin ETF with new SEC filing\n\nCripto LatAm-Adoption\n\n\" data-image-caption=\"\n\nCripto LatAm-Adoption\n\nWhy is it relevant for investment funds in Latin America?\n\nIf Bitcoin reaches the predicted levels, it is likely to attract the attention of investors and adopters in Latin America.

This provides a vast market for venture-backed startups, either locally or as an entry point to other markets in Latin America.\n\nThe region has shown a growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly due to factors such as the volatility of local currencies, limited access to traditional financial services, and the opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective international transactions.\n\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/contxto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/63aaee6fe473f385b2a9e91b_chart-2-defi-share-country-1024x695-1.png?fit=300%2C204&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/contxto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/63aaee6fe473f385b2a9e91b_chart-2-defi-share-country-1024x695-1.png?fit=1024%2C695&ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" >\n\nWe recommend: IMF Develops Global Platform for Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nTo read the information in detail, visit: Reuters"

As Positivo explains, however, storing one\u2019s crypto as a list of 12 words is very obvious to hackers or thieves who come across the list.\n\nColors, by contrast, \"are everywhere.\" A private key could be hidden in plain sight, and a thief wouldn\u2019t be the wiser.\n\n\u201cA paper with 12 words is more suspicious than a color palette labeled like 'my new home wall colors,' for example, or inside a styles.css of your [website],\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe colors generated by the tool are expressed as a hex color code, a six-digit system that represents virtually any color as some combination of red, blue, and green.

When miners successfully add a new block, they are rewarded with a certain number of newly minted Bitcoins.\n\nIn addition to the block subsidy, miners also earn transaction fees, which are paid by users who initiate BTC transactions. According to information retrieved from TheBlock, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy dropped by 6% between May and June.\n\nDuring the same period, revenue earned by miners on the Bitcoin network from transaction fees paid to use the blockchain also declined by 15%. In the current month, miners have accumulated $173 million in revenue from inflation rewards, while their earnings from transaction fees over the past seven days have reached $177 million.\n\nWhile miner revenue fell between May and June, BTC on-chain transaction volume rallied. Per data from TheBlock, this increased by 24% during that period.\n\nInterestingly, while the total value of transactions conducted on the BTC network went up between May and June, BTC transactions count fell by 25%.\n\nBTC remains tightly positioned\n\nAfter breaching the $31,000 price point briefly on 23 June, BTC\u2019s price has since traded within a narrow range, maintaining the psychological $30,000 price region as support. At press time, the number one cryptocurrency exchanged hands at $30,212.56, logging a 50% drop in trading volume in the last 24 hours, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAn assessment of BTC\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed that a new bear cycle was underway. On 6 July, the short-term moving average of BTC\u2019s MACD indicator crossed below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential shift towards bearish momentum.\n\nThis occurrence is often interpreted as a sell signal by traders and investors. Thus, it indicated a potential downtrend in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nMoreso, key momentum indicators trended downwards at press time and have been so since the beginning of the month. This showed that while BTC\u2019s price lingers in a narrow price range, buying momentum has fallen.\n\nDespite all this, buyers remained solidly in control of the BTC market. A look at the asset\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed the buyer\u2019s strength (green) at 25.48, resting above the sellers\u2019 (red) at 14.50."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETF race heats up as crypto spot trading volumes rise\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) dropped slightly from around $30,500 to roughly $30,200 over the past week. Throughout the week BTC tested the $31,000 mark twice but failed to remain above it.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalisation, dropped steadily throughout the week, starting it off at around $1,950 and ending at $1,860.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week focused on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) updating its regulatory filings for proposed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which apply for the filings of the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThese updated filings came on the heels of reports indicating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) communicated that the recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others weren\u2019t \u201cclear and comprehensive.\u201d\n\nThe revised filings, it\u2019s worth noting, mention surveillance sharing agreements with the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, as does a revised application to list the spot Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm.\n\nJUST IN: BlackRock has re-filed for spot bitcoin ETF, the resubmission was dated 6/29, Nasdaq just posted tho. They just added Coinbase like everyone else. pic.twitter.com/UGq46DdLgu \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 3, 2023\n\nAs the race for a spot Bitcoin ETF heated up, spot trading volumes on centralized cryptocurrency trading platforms rose 16.4% to $575 billion last month, marking the first volume increase seen in three months. Trading volumes, however, remain at historically low levels, recording the lowest quarterly volumes since Q4 of 2019, according to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review report.\n\nThe report details that the combined spot and derivatives trading volumes on centralized exchanges rose 14.2% to $2.7 trillion in June. Volumes rose even as the SEC pursued legal action against leading cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance.\n\nNotably, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw a number of key executives leave the firm last week, including its Chief Strategy Officer, General Counsel, and a Compliance Official.\n\nFollowing these departures Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, co-founder of Binance, sought to alleviate public concerns about the future of the platform in light of intensifying regulatory oversight, insisting the firm continues to build and hire.\n\nBlackRock CEO sees potential in Bitcoin\n\nThe CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock, Larry Fink, has said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could transform the financial system. In an interview, Fink said tokenising assets and securities was a way to achieve this.\n\nThe CEO of the near $10 trillion asset manager had in the past shown skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, saying these were mostly used for illegal activities. During the interview, Fink also highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s role as a global asset that can hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, saying:\n\n\u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you\u2019re in \u2013 let\u2019s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it\u2019s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\u201d\n\nHis words come after BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC on June 16. The filing reignited institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space, to the point that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which uses futures contracts to provide exposure to the cryptocurrency, has seen inflows of $14.9 million on June 29, and $11.9 million on July 3 to the point its assets under management are now at $1.04 billion.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum supply on exchanges dropped in June\n\nOver the week a report from Goldman Sachs citing on-chain data revealed that the supply of both Bitcoin and Ethereum on cryptocurrency exchanges contracted in June, as investors gravitated towards self-custody solutions as regulations ramped up.\n\nThe report detailed that the supply of BTC tumbled by 4% on exchanges, to approach levels seen in December 2002, the lowest level seen since November 2020 ahead of the 2021 bull market.\n\nThe report from Goldman Sachs also observed that Ether\u2019s supply on exchanges decreased by 5.8%, attaining a level that has not been seen since May 2018. Per the bank, staked Ether withdrawals have \u201cled to investors\u2019 preference to stake ether, instead of passively holding on exchanges.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs also noted that June experienced an unprecedented volume of Bitcoin inventory sales by miners, who capitalized on the opportunity provided by the cryptocurrency\u2019s positive price performance. The total monthly inflow of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges almost doubled from the previous month, reaching $99 million\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.
