        "title": "$1 Million Bitcoin Price 'No Longer Off the Table': Max Keiser - CCN.com",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price suffered a brutal pullback yesterday, but longtime crypto bull Max Keiser remains confident that the flagship cryptocurrency could still achieve a jaw-dropping $1 million target.\n\nPerhaps even in time to save the eccentric John McAfee from having to \u201ceat [his] d**k\u201d on national television .\n\nRT\u2019s Resident Bitcoin Bull: $100,000 BTC Is \u2018Within Sight\u2019\n\nArguing that Bitcoin crossing the $1 million milestone \u2013 also known as the McAfee d**k price \u2013 is still not \u201coff the table,\u201d Keiser also added other more immediate forecasts.\n\nThe RT host says $28,000 is his short-term price target, while $100,000 \u2013 representing a nearly 800% gain from its present level \u2013 is \u201cwithin sight.\u201d\n\n$28,000 still in play. $100,000 within sight. @officialmcafee \u2019s dick price no longer off the table. #Bitcoin \u2014 Max Keiser, sr. bitcoin advisor to Pres. Bukele (@maxkeiser) June 26, 2019\n\nKeiser has long argued that the Bitcoin price could top $100,000, maintaining that lofty goal even throughout the painful 2018 bear market.\n\nLast month, he predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve launching more quantitative easing would lead to the debasing of the dollar and trigger a massive rush into BTC.\n\nWhile the Fed has shown no indication of launching another round of quantitative easing (yet ), it has signaled that it could lower interest rates. President Donald Trump has, in the past, attacked the institution for \u201clarge scale tightening\u201d and not knowing \u201cwhat it is doing\u201d while pushing for \u201crates cuts & easing.\u201d\n\nDespite a Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t know what it is doing \u2013 raised rates far too fast (very low inflation, other parts of world slowing, lowering & easing) & did large scale tightening, $50 Billion/month, we are on course to have one of the best Months of June in US history\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2019\n\nKeiser also said that Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency would benefit the Bitcoin price, along with the increasing cost of mining BTC as the coin\u2019s inflation rate declines.\n\nCrypto Rally Brings Out the Massive Bitcoin Price Targets\n\nKeiser is not the only crypto bull who contends that Bitcoin has more headroom.\n\nEarlier this month, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, indicated that once the Bitcoin price reached the $10,000 point, it would double in a \u201cfast and furious\u201d manner. BTC currently trades above $11,500.\n\nSpecifically, Lee predicted that Bitcoin would hit $40,000 in five months after passing the $10,000 mark, which he said would ignite a \u201cFOMO\u201d rally.\n\nWith Bitcoin having breached that level this week, it means that if Lee\u2019s prediction comes to pass, by late November the cryptocurrency will have hit another all-time high."

Well, BTC traded for about 6 cents at the time, and is around $22,000 now, so the relevance of this reading is a bit dubious in my opinion. What if we toss out all data before 2014? That gives a maximum NVT ratio of 98.52, which I think is more sensible. Bitcoin\u2019s lowest NVT on record was 0.22 on Jan. 24, 2016, when BTC was trading at $403. The average NVT over the time span studied was 24, which I also think has relevance."

        "title": "Bitcoin Investors Are Plotting a Major Coup - WIRED",
        "content": "A group of activist shareholders in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin investment trust, GBTC, is plotting a coup. The unlikely patchwork of hedge funds, asset managers, and amateur investors is trying to unseat Grayscale Investments, the steward of the trust, whose management they claim has cost them billions of dollars.\n\nSince 2015, GBTC has been marketed as a simple way for regular people to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with an exchange, send crypto between wallets, or figure out how to store it safely. The value of GBTC shares is linked to the price of bitcoin: For every new share created, a fraction of a bitcoin is added to a pot, anchoring its value.\n\nIn a series of adverts targeting the general public, some of which aired on major US TV networks, Grayscale described bitcoin as \u201cthe future\u201d and the ideal investment for retirees and other investors that \u201cdeserve the best.\u201d Now, GBTC shares are owned by hundreds of thousands of amateur investors.\n\nAt the start of 2021, the shares, which had consistently traded at a higher price (sometimes even double) than the underlying bitcoin for years, slumped to 52 percent of the value of bitcoin in mid-December, meaning that for every $1 in bitcoin that shareholders own through the trust, they can only claim back $0.52 by selling their GBTC shares on the market. In aggregate, the discount created a multibillion-dollar hole in investors\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cInvestors are in limbo,\u201d says Christian Gal\u00edndez Beltr\u00e1n, a shareholder who claims to hold around $200,000 in bitcoin via the trust. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about not being able to redeem the totality of my money.\u201d\n\nAnother investor, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from the brokerage at which he works, says he purchased roughly $30,000 in bitcoin through GBTC with the goal of hedging against inflation as he prepares for retirement. Although his financial situation has not been too badly damaged, he says the performance of the trust has \u201cill-affected\u201d his marriage; his wife, who \u201cfears the loss is permanent,\u201d has taken to calling him a \u201cbitcoin bozo.\u201d\n\nThousands of GBTC shareholders like these have registered their support for the activist campaign, according to David Bailey, founder of BTC Inc and hedge fund UTXO Management, and leader of one strand of the movement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this a unique situation,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThis product is sold on brokerage platforms in individual retirement accounts. This is your mom and dad thinking they are diversifying their portfolio.\u201d\n\nWIRED spoke to six GBTC shareholders, all of whom told similar stories. One person said they have the entirety of their savings tied up in GBTC, while another has taken on additional work to ensure he is able to sustain himself into retirement.\n\nBailey claims that more than 50 institutions, some of which hold several hundred-million-dollar stakes in GBTC, are also involved in the rebellion to unseat Grayscale, representing a total of at least 20 percent of GBTC shares. He claims to be unable to provide proof, citing investor privacy and legal considerations, but supplied WIRED with web traffic and form submission data that suggests at least 2,000 investors have joined the campaign."

        "content": "The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is connecting more countries as the government of El Salvador is opening a \u201cBitcoin Embassy\u201d in the United States.\n\nEl Salvador, a country that adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, is expanding its Bitcoin strategy in a new partnership with the government of Texas. The intergovernmental collaboration aims to set up a Bitcoin Embassy, or El Salvador\u2019s representative office, in Texas to work on new joint projects to promote Bitcoin adoption.\n\nMilena Mayorga, the Salvadoran Ambassador to the United States, announced the news in a statement on Twitter on Feb. 14.\n\nTexas Deputy Secretary of State Joe Esparza and El Salvador\u2019s U.S. ambassador Milena Mayorga. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cIn my meeting with the assistant secretary of the government of Texas, Joe Esparza, we discussed the opening of the second Bitcoin Embassy and the expansion of commercial and economic exchange projects,\u201d Mayorga said.\n\nEl estado de Texas, nuestro nuevo aliado.\n\n\n\nEn mi encuentro con el Secretario Adjunto del Gobierno de Texas, Joe Esparza @TXsecofstate, abordamos la apertura de la segunda Embajada #Bitcoin y de ampliar los proyectos de intercambios comerciales y econ\u00f3micos. pic.twitter.com/NcmOjeadl6 \u2014 Milena Mayorga (@MilenaMayorga) February 14, 2023\n\nThe latest Bitcoin initiative comes a few months after El Salvador opened the first Bitcoin Embassy in Switzerland\u2019s southern city of Lugano in October 2022. As part of the efforts, the two pro-crypto jurisdictions started working to establish a physical governmental presence to promote cooperation in education and research institutions related to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to former Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, the phenomenon of the Bitcoin embassy is the next step in nation-states and cities adopting Bitcoin. He said that such initiatives imply cooperation between countries to develop new initiatives like establishing alliances between places that have adopted Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s \u2018limited\u2019 use of Bitcoin prevents forecasted risks, says IMF\n\nThe news comes amid Texas lawmakers reportedly considering a new bill calling for a \u201ca master plan for the expansion of the blockchain industry.\u201d The legal initiative aims to turn Texas into the crypto capital of the country by introducing tax-free shopping with Bitcoin, among other proposals.\n\nAs previously reported, Texas has emerged as one of the crypto-friendly U.S. states, passing crypto-friendly laws aiming to better adapt commercial laws to blockchain innovation and digital asset regulations. Texas is also home to some of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, with major mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific and Genesis Digital Assets operating in the state."

His profit is worth about 23.7 bitcoins.\n\nThe punt on the underdog Chiefs to win the Super Bowl was the only one of his seven bets that proved a success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe lost a total of $265,000 on his six unsuccessful bets, which included wagering separately on Mahomes and Chiefs wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster to be the first touchdown scorers, and for the Chiefs to win both halves of the game.\n\nDrake placed his bets through his partnership with online gambling website Stake.\n\nAccording to a post from Stake, the rapper had bet $1.1 million on the Chiefs' previous game against the Cincinnati Bengals, landing a $2.1 million payout following the Chiefs' win.\n\nIt follows a set of bets last year which landed the \"God's Plan\" singer $300,000 in bitcoin winnings, per MailOnline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut bitcoin's declines in the past year, from its $42,000 valuation last February to about $21,000 this year, means last year's winnings are worth nearly half as much now.\n\nIt also means it took about 44.6 bitcoins for Drake to place his bets when it would have taken about 22.9 bitcoins last year.\n\nThe use of Bitcoin to bet on the Super Bowl appears to be a useful marketing tool not only for Stake but for the world's biggest cryptocurrency, after firms pulled out of advertising deals for the industry following FTX's collapse."

The U.S. dollar index \u2014 a measure of the U.S. dollar versus a basket of six other currencies \u2014 has surrendered a significant portion of its gains from last year. The DXY reached a 24-year high of around 114 in September.\n\nWhile there are other risk assets sensitive to a liquidity recovery, none has experienced as significant a drawdown as bitcoin \u2014 which benefits from \"long-term accumulators who see BTC as a store of value.\" The cryptocurrency also benefits from having no cash flows to discount, Acheson added, making it less susceptible to higher rates than stocks and less sensitive to adverse economic news coming down the line.\n\n\"What it has is actual, potential, and growing utility, the valuation of which will move more on narrative than data,\" Acheson said, adding, \"BTC's narrative is multi-faceted; this also lends its floor strong support. For some, it's a store of value; for others, an early-stage liquid tech investment; for many, pure speculation, partially based on narratives driven by the first two. Complicated and fascinating.\""

        "content": "00:00\n\nJamie, what do you think of this latest development in in that approach? I think it is what we expected to see it is. It's unfortunate. We had eight where a minor of an area and certainly would have would have liked to see it continue as a group work network. Mike, Mike, what do you think of the S.E.C.? Is deal with crack and the idea that staking as a service they see as a security? Echo that sentiment and the proof of stake allows concentration of larger funds just buying up simply the coin and having an influence on the networks, grassroots work is truly democratized. You have a network of miners globally contributing to networks and securing how the how of the platform performs. I'd love to double down on that with you, Jamie, because you would just kind of mention this idea where you had mined theorem as well. You know, what's the path forward? It was interesting to see a theory and prices really rebound. Even with that looming threat of greater regulatory oversight or crackdown, if you will. So what's the road ahead for assets outside of Bitcoin? I think it's really it's really difficult to say, and certainly clarity is something that the industry desperately needs in order for it to chart a more solid path forward. And you know, Michael, on that note as well to, you know, what does it do now that the book, both of your companies are put together in an industry that was so sorely bruised after last year, you are seeing this kind of price increase this year? What is that price increase in Bitcoin itself mean for the merger of both of your companies? We have a ton of synergies. We always held cuts the highest regard and with Jamie at the helm. Being able to be so disciplined throughout the bull markets, whereas the rest of the public peers were bought into the hysteria and bought very expensive hardware. The companies that come out as true winners are built in the bear markets. It's it's its it's maintaining that balance sheet and knowing how to be agile and navigate the downturns. What's your approach, Mike, to the energy usage debate? I know Jamie has long been a champion of greener mining at Hot 8. How do you approach this problem? Absolutely, it is shown within the sites that we operate out in New York. We're right at Niagara Falls, where over 90 percent hydro in Texas, we have sites that are behind the meter directly on the sites of the energy generation at the solar farms, out of wind farms. We partner with the energy companies, renewable energy companies. So, Jamie, in terms of your business, you've long benefited from the fact that you're not in the United States of America. And we just heard from Michael Shalom saying he's worried that the kind of regulation we're going to get post RTX is going to push businesses out. How do you view that in light of this combination? I think geographic diversity is is really important. We've long been exclusively in Canada really looking for the right entry point into the into the US and we believe we found the perfect partner in U.S. pick to do that. Jamie, do you think that after this merger there are more opportunities for consolidation? You know, a lot of the issues of last year was the unwillingness of capital markets to really open up to the crypto sector. A lot of nervousness around the mining sector. But you did see very interesting deals pop up. You saw interesting rescue financings. What are the capital markets and merger environments look like for you now as a bigger company? Yeah, I think we were expecting to see consolidation in this space. It was a little bit late to come, but we have seen some really interesting deals in mining in the last few months. And I think we're going to continue to see more eminent activity during the balance in 2023. Well, what about for you? I mean, is there anything that you could do to either raise more money or buy more assets as you've seen so many other companies struggle? I think our focus right now is entirely on getting this deal closed and bringing the companies together. But certainly I've been I've been on a growth trajectory and I don't see that as something that will change in a new hot post closing of the."

These can comprise JPEG images, PDFS and video and audio files.\n\nAs Rodarmor outlines in the Ordinals documentation, these digital artifacts can be inscribed to an individual satoshi that makes up a whole Bitcoin. Each BTC is made up of 100,000,000 satoshis.\n\n\u201cIndividual satoshis can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating unique Bitcoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in Bitcoin wallets and transferred using Bitcoin transactions. Inscriptions are as durable, immutable, secure, and decentralized as Bitcoin itself.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been divided over the ability to inscribe digital artifacts to the blockchain, with arguments for and against providing plenty of food for thought. One of the major talking points has been the increased use of block space to inscribe various Ordinals.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average block size has hovered between 0.7MB and 1.5MB from July 2021 to February 2023. From Feb. 5 onward, Bitcoin\u2019s average block size surpassed 2MB for the first time, currently sitting at around 2.2MB at the time of writing.\n\nThe inception of Bitcoin Ordinals has also seen the network hit a record 44 million non-zero addresses, as per data from Glassnode. Glassnode\u2019s latest newsletter notes that Ordinals compete for block space demand but have not yet significantly impacted network fees.\n\nGlassnode describes the advent of Ordinals as a \u201cnew and unique moment in Bitcoin history,\u201d whereby innovation generates network activity without the \u201cclassical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes.\u201c"

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs are growing quickly as community sees long-term potential - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Ordinals, an NFT-like project on the Bitcoin blockchain, has gained momentum over the past month, signaling a chance that a new frontier may be on the horizon for the biggest cryptocurrency. But in order to be the biggest, experts say its accessibility and security need to be improved.\n\nOver 90,000 Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain to date, according to Dune Analytics data. Ordinals hit an all-time high on February 9 for the number of mints at over 20,000 that day.\n\n\u201cIt seems foolish to say this won\u2019t be a very impactful revelation,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, told TechCrunch. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but given current trends and hockey stick growth, we\u2019re definitely headed to more Bitcoin NFT inscriptions now than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals project isn\u2019t the first to try bringing NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals stands out as a project for directly inscribing onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), without needing another chain or token. \u201cThe unique thing about Ordinals is its putting the image literally in the blockchain,\u201d Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines, said. \u201cOther NFTs usually link to the images on-chain.\u201d\n\nEven though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clunky because it\u2019s day one,\u201d said Alex Adelman, the co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin rewards platform Lolli. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West, but that\u2019s how NFTs felt back in the day, as well with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nEthereum and Solana now have a huge leg up when it comes to infrastructure, communities, and trading platforms and collections. In the past 30 days, Ethereum, the No. 1 blockchain by NFT sales volume, saw volumes increase 35.5% to $860 million across over 178,000 buyers, according to CryptoSlam data. Solana, the second-largest blockchain by NFT sales volume, fell 15.6% to $114.6 million across over 80,000 buyers during the same time period.\n\n\u201cEthereum has proven there\u2019s a market for this already and is essentially stealing market share based on demand,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nSo, inherently Bitcoin NFTs will compete with other major NFT ecosystems, Hansen said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll most likely see a lot of Ethereum NFT projects building bridges to move to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhen people build on Bitcoin, it gets a lot more attention, Ali said. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s more valuable than other chains because it\u2019s unclear if those other chains will be around, but bitcoin will likely be around in 10, 20 or 50 years from now.\u201d\n\nBut this expansion won\u2019t happen overnight, and the current infrastructure for Bitcoin NFTs is extremely clunky and still done manually on many fronts. For example, many people are legitimately completing inscriptions manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBuys are happening through Discords and Google Sheets,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cMarketplaces are very much needed; we can\u2019t be buying and selling on Google Sheets for much longer because there\u2019s going to be hacks, people will get pissed off and it won\u2019t be sustainable.\u201d\n\nLast week Gamma, a marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs, launched its Ordinals feature to help people who have a Bitcoin address inscribe their own NFTs. \u201cWe had over 2,000 people submitting inscriptions in the first two hours,\u201d Jamil Dhanani, founder and CEO of Gamma, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is an indication something is here and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to be the same as Ethereum NFTs, but the value of inscribing data resonates with people.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHow do we get a wallet and see our JPEGs? Right now there\u2019s no way to get around it, all of it is really difficult, and custodying it has been hard. The bar is incredibly high right now.\u201d\n\nAdelman agreed, noting \u201cit\u2019s not accessible at all.\u201d But in 2017, there weren\u2019t very many experiences that were accessible in the Ethereum ecosystem, either, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be services to improve all of this and the access,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs the products and services come to market, it will become more and more prevalent the amount of inscriptions being minted, inscribed and transacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin a year, we\u2019ll have full ecosystems of plug-and-play NFT projects like on Ethereum would be my guess,\u201d he added\n\nAnd more capital and developers will surely enter the space. \u201cMy inbox is overflowing with developers on Ethereum and Solana who don\u2019t know how to build on Bitcoin. The developer community in Bitcoin is getting real demand now, and people are throwing money at it,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting and a healthy thing [ \u2026 ] people realize bitcoin carries a premium, but a ton of work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nOver time, there will be \u201cmuch more use of bitcoin and a much more robust market,\u201d Dhanani said.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Adelman said."

The last time Bitcoin hit a golden cross was in June 2021, and the BTC price soared in the following months after stage 2 was reached.\n\nThis time around, however, the macro environment is quite different. After the embarrassment of the FTX debacle occurring right under its nose, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is coming after the crypto sector aggressively in the last week. Easy targets like Kraken and Coinbase are in its sights, and Kraken recently paid a $30 million fine to settle SEC charges that its staking service was actually a securities offering.\n\nUnregistered securities charges have also been levied at crypto product providers \u2014 Genesis and Gemini. In the last few days, it has been reported that the SEC is now also seeking to sue stablecoin issuer Paxos. Paxos is the issuer of two physically backed US dollar stablecoins \u2014 Paxos USD (PUSD) and Binance USD (BUSD). It also issues a gold-backed stablecoin Pax Gold (PaxG) and manages the itBit exchange.\n\nThe SEC has not yet confirmed these reports and whether there is an ongoing investigation. The initial report by the Wall Street Journal, claims that the SEC is charging Paxos for offering an unregistered security, BUSD. The price of BTC fell by 6.1% the day after the Kraken news.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s excellent beginning to 2023\n\nBitcoin and the crypto asset class, in general, have begun the year strongly on the back of cooler economic data that has hinted that interest rate increases in the United States may end soon and inflation has maxed out. Bitcoin began the year trading around US$16,500 and now trades for above US$22,000.\n\nThe first Consumer Price Index (CPI) print of the year was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on January 19th. The report, which covered consumer prices in December 2022, showed that prices rose by 6.5% in the month. This was the smallest increase in a year and the sixth month in a row when the inflation rate had slowed. The January Consumer Price Index CPI showed that prices rose 0.5% in the first month of the year, and by 6.4% on a year-by-year basis, more than economists expected.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has said many times this year that a disinflation process has begun in the USA and a softer economic landing may be possible. He told the Economic Club of Washington D.C. that the US Central Bank was succeeding in its fight against inflation, but acknowledged the battle is not over. He said if strong labor market and inflation data emerge, then the Fed will be forced to continue with interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates constrict the ability of investors to operate by increasing the cost of capital and making borrowing more favorable.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nIf the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle shows signs of ending, then Bitcoin and crypto could be set to begin a bullish flip as the shackles are pulled off investors. When the Fed finished its last tightening cycle in 2019, BTC and crypto began an extended bullish price reversal. As the chart above indicates, in the months after the Fed started to cut interest rates, the price of BTC traded sideways. Once the Fed began to aggressively drop interest rates, the price of BTC began to skyrocket. Bulls may already be backing this narrative and are buying cheaper Bitcoin in preparation.\n\nAdditionally, while more drama surrounding the FTX collapse emerged during January, markets appeared disinterested and Bitcoin prices continued to trend up. This suggests that the FTX incident has now been priced in.\n\nThe price momentum of Bitcoin has stalled, however, as new economic data suggests that the US economy is getting hotter than expected. Nonfarm payrolls, the measure of US workers excluding farm workers, increased by 517,000 for the month, This blew past analysts\u2019 expectations of a rise of 187,000. The unemployment rate in the country fell to 3.4%, the lowest since May 1969. This data is buffered by the strong January inflation data.\n\nThis suggests that a recession may be avoided in the short-to-medium and that a post-covid recovery is being undergone successfully. With macroeconomics, however, the good news is often bad news. In the shorter term, however, it means that the Fed should now have more room to continue rate hikes and use monetary policy to control inflation which sits well above the targeted 2% level\n\nOrdinals bring new utility and price surge to Bitcoin\n\nAs the charts below show, there has been a recent surge in onchain fees, active users & addresses, and miner revenue. All of this has coincided with the launch of the new Ordinals digital collectible boom on the Bitcoin network. The Ordinals protocol is a controversial, innovative new protocol that allows Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) to be stored on Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals are not the first project to try and introduce NFTs to Bitcoin. Counterparty brought Rare Pepes to the network and Stacks continues to make progress. Ordinals are different, however, because NFTs are inscribed directly on satoshis on Bitcoin without needing a sidechain or additional token. The project\u2019s growth has been parabolic since it was launched in January with daily mints now around 10,000 a day.\n\nThe Ordinals appear to be more than just a gimmick with serious money being splashed. \u2018Bitcoin punks\u2019 takes inspiration from the popular Crypto punk franchise on the Ethereum network. One sold recently for 9.5BTC or ~US$208,000.\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC Transfer volume\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC TX fees \u2013 last month\n\nSource: Glassnode \u2013 BTC miner revenue \u2013 last month\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC Active Addresses \u2013 Last month\n\nAdditionally, the Ordinals protocol utilizes Taproot. A Bitcoin transaction type that packages network transaction outputs together to make them more efficient and secure. Driven by Ordinals momentum, there has been a surge in Taproot usage over the last month.\n\nOther technical Indicators\n\nTrading volume is a measure of how much a given financial asset has been traded in a period of time. Traders look at volume to determine liquidity and the strength of conviction of a bull or bear trend.\n\nWhat may concern Bitcoin bulls is that the current surge in BTC\u2019s price has arrived with weak volume that is trending downwards. A general rule of thumb is that rising prices with lower or tepid volume are difficult to trust and the buying pressure may run out of fuel, stalling the rally.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator. It assesses the speed and magnitude of a security\u2019s recent price changes to evaluate whether it is overbought or oversold based on the veracity of the move. If a price moves too quickly too soon it is being overbought or over-sold. The general rule of thumb is that an RSI over 70 indicates that an asset may be overbought and a reading of 30 indicates that an asset is oversold.\n\nThe current RSI for bitcoin (BTC) is ~47.55 which suggests that the asset is far from oversold. It is in fact in a downtrend which suggests lagging bullish momentum.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin has reached a promised land, beyond the golden cross. The last time BTC achieved this technical bullish flag, it triggered an extended bull run that ended with new all-time highs. The bulls will be hoping for more of the same this time around.\n\nThe price push to the golden cross in 2023, has been driven by softer macroeconomic data. It has also been buoyed by a surge in usage of Bitcoin, which has been driven by an emerging use case for the network \u2014 NFTs directly inscribed onto the network.\n\nDespite the golden cross, there are some concerning flags emerging for bulls. One is major resistance at the US$24,000 price that has twice stalled price momentum for BTC in the last six months. Others include weak volume and a US Federal Reserve that may be tempted to raise interest rates aggressively again. The most concerning headwind, however, is the aggressive moves being made by the SEC, which has the potential to derail the growth of the entire sector in the United States."

        "title": "6 Best Bitcoin ETFs - Money",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of investment fund designed to track the performance of a specific market sector or index. ETFs can hold a collection of assets \u2014 including stocks, bonds and commodities \u2014 and provide portfolio diversification. ETFs are popular in part because they can be bought and sold like stocks and for their potential solid returns over time.\n\nYou can find ETFs catering to a wide variety of investment strategies and financial goals. For example, there are tech ETFs that invest in the fast-growing technology sector, bond ETFs that provide investors exposure to fixed income, high-dividend ETFs and more. Bitcoin ETFs are yet another option. These funds invest in companies and assets related to Bitcoin or in Bitcoin futures to achieve similar investment returns to Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe number of Bitcoin ETFs has increased significantly as cryptocurrency continues to gain adoption. However, crypto is still a new technology, and investors can lose money, a fact that\u2019s been apparent in recent months. To help you lower your risk and achieve your investment goals, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the best ETFs for crypto enthusiasts in 2023.\n\nOur Top Picks for the Best Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBest Bitcoin ETFs Reviews\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad. Ad Best U.S.-Based Bitcoin ETF: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Start Investing\n\nPros Highly liquid due to being one of the most actively traded crypto ETFs\n\nMade its first dividend distribution in January 2023, suggesting more will come in the future Cons Actively managed fund with relatively high expense ratio (0.95%)\n\nDividends are not guaranteed moving ahead\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $13.18 Expense ratio 0.95% Minimum investment amount $10,000 Assets under management $654 million\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF was the first Bitcoin-linked ETF approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for trading in the United States. As a result, it attracted considerable investment during its first few days in 2021 and accumulated more than $1 billion in assets in its first two years of operation.\n\nBITO seeks to mimic the price of Bitcoin as closely as possible by investing in Bitcoin futures, which allow for speculation on the price of Bitcoin without investing in the cryptocurrency itself. Like all crypto ETFs, part of the allure of BITO is that investors don\u2019t need to deal with cryptocurrency wallets and private keys but can instead invest through a broker they already use.\n\nRead our article on the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Futures ETFs for more information.\n\nBest for Daily Profit Opportunities: ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) Start Investing\n\nPros Ideal for investors who believe Bitcoin's price will fall\n\nAllows for daily profits by short selling Bitcoin\n\nIssued by the first and largest provider of Bitcoin-linked ETFs in the U.S. Cons Investors can lose the entire value of their portfolio in a day\n\nHigher brokerage commissions and expense ratios reduce returns\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $39.79 Expense ratio 0.97% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $99.48 million\n\nThe ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) is a way to invest in Bitcoin when you believe prices will drop, as it allows investors to short sell Bitcoin. Short selling means betting against an asset, in which case you profit when the price of Bitcoin goes down instead of up. However, this also means that there\u2019s no limit to losses an investor can incur, since the price of Bitcoin can hypothetically go up to infinity while it can\u2019t go any lower than zero.\n\nThe BITI ETF follows the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Index, and profitability is computed daily (before fees and expenses) as the inverse (-1x) of the index's daily performance. The fund was launched on June 21, 2022, and already has almost $100 million under management.\n\nCheapest ETF Option: Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) Start Investing\n\nPros Cheapest option among Bitcoin and other crypto/blockchain futures ETFs on this list\n\nRun by a team of experienced asset managers from the Google and Blackstone Cons More of a crypto/blockchain ETF than a Bitcoin ETF\n\nHigher expense ratio than competing ETFs\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $4.97 Expense ratio 0.85% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $50 million\n\nCurrently trading at less than $5, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is the cheapest Bitcoin ETF on our list. It\u2019s an actively managed ETF that invests in companies involved in crypto and blockchain on multiple levels, including digital asset exchanges, mining companies and others providing crypto-related services.\n\nBITQ doesn't just focus on Bitcoin but also invests in companies linked to Ethereum, DeFi and other equity indexes. Some of BITQ\u2019s top holdings include Bitfarms (a Bitcoin mining firm), Galaxy Digital (a financial services provider for blockchain and digital asset companies) and Coinbase (the cryptocurrency exchange).\n\nBest Actively Managed Bitcoin ETF: Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) Start Investing\n\nPros Digital asset investment firm manages all transactions\n\nInvestments are made through a regulated futures market Cons Not very diversified, focusing on just one type of crypto asset\n\nHigher expense ratio due to being an actively managed fund\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $6.61 Expense ratio 0.95% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $18.6 million\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) is an actively managed ETF launched in October 2021. It\u2019s listed on the Nasdaq and, like many Bitcoin-linked ETFs, does not invest directly in Bitcoin.\n\nInstead, BTF aims to deploy as much of its net assets as possible into Bitcoin futures to track the value of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures. Whatever BTF cannot deploy into Bitcoin futures contracts, it puts into U.S. treasury bills.\n\nBest Bitcoin ETF for U.S.-based Companies: Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS GBTC ETF (SPBC) Start Investing\n\nPros Great for investors seeking little exposure to Bitcoin while investing primarily in the S&P 500\n\nExpense ratio is relatively low (0.73%) Cons Trading of equity securities makes it susceptible to stock market fluctuations\n\nInvestors have little control over non-crypto asset allocation\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $20.14 Expense ratio 0.73% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $45.8 million\n\nThe Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS GBTC ETF (SPBC) is not, strictly speaking, a Bitcoin ETF. It's an ETF that invests primarily in U.S. securities (like stocks and other ETFs) but adds exposure to Bitcoin by allocating 10% to 15% of its assets to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nOutside of crypto, SPBC has most of its holdings invested in iShares\u2019 Core S&P 500 ETF. SPBC actively rebalances its Bitcoin holdings to 10% of its portfolio assets to avoid overexposure to the crypto markets.\n\nBest Expense Ratio: VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) Start Investing\n\nPros Exposure to digital asset exchanges, mining companies and crypto firms\n\nLowest expense ratio on this list (0.5%) Cons Volatile, as the technology surrounding digital assets is still in its infancy\n\nDoesn't track Bitcoin-related companies exclusively but those involved with digital assets\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $26.69 Expense ratio 0.50% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $17.6 million\n\nThe VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) tracks, as closely as possible, the price and yield performance of the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index before expenses and fees. The MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index is a set of companies actively involved in the digital assets and blockchain industries, including companies that mine digital assets, run digital asset exchanges (like crypto exchanges) and provide services for the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\nBy investing in DAPP, investors gain exposure to a diverse set of companies pushing the technological envelope in the cryptosphere. Investing in these companies can offer both greater risk and greater reward to investors. While a small number of these firms may discover and develop breakthrough technologies, others may ultimately fail. DAPP has the lowest expense ratio of all Bitcoin ETFs on this list at just 0.50%.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.

Start Investing\n\nOther Bitcoin ETFs we considered\n\nPros Top holdings invested in businesses that may perform well if blockchain fails\n\nCompetitive net expense ratio when compared to similar ETFs\n\nIdeal for long-term investors who seek consistent growth Cons Not ideal for investors solely seeking exposure to Bitcoin\n\nInvestors have little control over where their dollars are deployed\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $15.12 Expense ratio 0.71% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $357.9 million\n\nAmplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) invests at least 80% of its net assets in corporations actively linked to the development and use of blockchain technologies. This means that it invests in Bitcoin-related companies and others with the potential to earn even higher returns under favorable conditions.\n\nBLOK is a reputable general-purpose blockchain ETF but not the best Bitcoin-specific ETF, which is why it didn't make our list.\n\nPros No upfront performance or redemption fees\n\nFlexibility and options as to how investors want to manage their investments Cons High minimum investment requirement ($100,000)\n\nShares bought by clients can only be traded through a direct brokerage account\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $16.84 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount $100,000 Assets under management $21.1 million\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), similar to some other ETFs on our list, gets its exposure to Bitcoin through futures contracts. Unlike those other ETFs, though, XBTF is structured as a C-corporation, a tax-efficient corporate structure that can save investors on tax liabilities over the long run.\n\nAside from investing in Bitcoin futures, XBTF also invests in other assets, including stocks, bonds and cash. It didn't make our list mainly due to its high minimum investment ($100,000) and relatively low amount of assets under management ($21 million) compared to other similar ETFs.\n\nPros Low expense ratio of just 0.65%\n\nTop holdings include tech giants like Alibaba, PayPal and Amazon Cons Significantly less direct exposure to Bitcoin than most other ETFs on this list\n\nExposure to blockchain technology makes it susceptible to market crashes\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $34.25 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $118.9 million\n\nThe First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (LEGR) seeks to track the Inxx Blockchain Index, which invests in companies developing and selling blockchain-based technology solutions. This includes companies building decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure \u2014 think yield farming and NFTs \u2014 and those developing digital assets and other pieces of the crypto economy.\n\nWith its holdings well-diversified across a variety of technology companies, LEGR isn\u2019t nearly as exposed to the swings in the price of Bitcoin as other ETFs. As a result, if you\u2019re looking for an ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin (even loosely), LEGR isn\u2019t the best choice.\n\nPros Functions as a traditional investment vehicle, allowing for easy transfer of assets and rights\n\nShares can be held in some IRA, Roth IRA and investor accounts Cons Provides exposure to Ethereum, not Bitcoin\n\nOne of the highest expense ratios in the crypto ETF market (2.50%)\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $11.72 Expense ratio 2.50% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $3.6 billion\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) boasts more than $3 billion under management with an initial investment requirement of $25,000. However, its value is derived from the price of Ethereum, not Bitcoin, making it an Ethereum ETF.\n\nOn top of not being a true Bitcoin ETF, ETHE\u2019s high expense ratio of 2.50% made it a poor fit for the rest of our list, most of which charge less than 1%.\n\nPros Well diversified funds, with just 20% of assets in its 10 largest holdings\n\nFunds are distributed across the technology, finance and communications sectors Cons Fund has no direct link with Bitcoin\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $20.60 Expense ratio 0.68% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $87.2 million\n\nThe Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) was designed to achieve long-term growth by tracking the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. We didn't include it among our top picks because it doesn't have a direct link to Bitcoin. Instead, the index provides exposure to companies actively involved with blockchain and other ledger technologies. These include crypto mining, blockchain infrastructure and blockchain software and services.\n\nSeveral of these sectors aren\u2019t widely available through ETFs, making BLCN an option for investors seeking DLT investment vehicles. Current holdings include Coinbase, Hewlett Packard, Microstrategy and American Express.\n\nPros Exposure to blockchain technology stocks and crypto futures in a single trade\n\nInvests in innovative blockchain and digital asset providers Cons Hasn't yet proven its effectiveness\n\nSmall number of assets under management compared to other options, which may suggest lack of investor confidence\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $18.95 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $6.58 million\n\nThe Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS) is an actively managed fund that aims to provide its investors with long-term capital appreciation through Bitcoin-linked ETFs and investments in other blockchain firms. BITS is attractive to many investors due to its focus on long-term gains coupled with its below-average expense ratio.\n\nWhile BITS doesn't invest in Bitcoin directly, it does offer investors exposure to crypto companies working on next-generation technologies, creating the potential for outsized returns. BITS is down 80% since its inception, though, and with less than $10 million under management today, it still needs to prove its worth before institutional investors will take it seriously.\n\nBitcoin ETFs Guide\n\nThe following guide offers basic information about Bitcoin ETFs, from how they work to what to know before choosing one.\n\nHow do Bitcoin ETFs work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF operates similarly to any other ETF: It tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, which in this case is Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange, with the share price fluctuating with the market price of Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors can buy and sell shares in Bitcoin ETFs without having to buy or sell the underlying cryptocurrency directly. Crypto ETFs are managed by investment firms that ensure the fund's holdings match the market value of the tracked cryptocurrency as closely as possible.\n\nHow can I invest in Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nYou can purchase Bitcoin ETFs through many investment brokers like Fidelity and Charles Schwab. Some Bitcoin ETFs, such Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), are also available through platforms like Robinhood and Wealthfront.\n\nAccessibility is one of the primary selling points of Bitcoin ETFs: you don't need to open an account with a crypto exchange or crypto wallet, nor do you need to worry about losing your private keys. All you need is a regular brokerage account, just like the one you use for the rest of your investments.\n\nHow often do Bitcoin ETFs pay out?\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs don't pay dividends on any regular schedule. However, this is changing as the market matures, and some Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2013 have recently started distributing profits in the form of dividends. Still, if you\u2019re seeking regular, predictable dividend payouts, Bitcoin ETFs are probably not the right investment vehicle for you.\n\nMain things to know before choosing a Bitcoin ETF\n\nCryptocurrencies will likely continue to impact the financial markets for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often means using a crypto exchange and/or wallet. This means your money may be kept separate from the rest of your investment portfolio.\n\nIn contrast, crypto ETFs offer an opportunity for investors to invest in crypto without leaving the marketplaces they\u2019re familiar with. Still, there are a few things you should know about Bitcoin ETFs before putting your money into one.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETFs do not make you an actual owner of Bitcoin\n\nIf your ultimate goal in investing in a crypto ETF is to use Bitcoin to make purchases or transfers, investing in an ETF is the wrong path. Bitcoin ETFs do not give their investors direct Bitcoin ownership. Instead, they track the value of Bitcoin and other assets closely related to it. In other words, you become an owner of shares of the fund, not the Bitcoin it\u2019s tracking.\n\n2. You may feel safer investing in Bitcoin ETF instead of Bitcoin\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been a profitable cryptocurrency for some investors, it's still a very volatile asset. On top of that, cryptocurrency exchanges aren't regulated by financial authorities like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the same way that traditional exchanges are, and some international exchanges face almost no regulation at all. This poses a risk for investors, who can get caught up in scams or see the value of their digital assets vanish overnight.\n\nETFs act as a workaround, as they're traded on the traditional financial markets regulated by authorities like the SEC. Some brokerage accounts where you can invest in ETFs are also insured (up to a certain limit), keeping your funds safe even if your broker becomes insolvent. Additionally, some ETFs don't just track Bitcoin alone but also other assets, diversifying your investment and reducing your overall portfolio risk.\n\n3. Bitcoin ETFs are easier to understand for some investors\n\nOne reason crypto ETFs have become so popular is that, for many investors, ETFs are a more familiar investment vehicle than cryptocurrency. Buying an ETF from a broker is often easier than buying crypto from a decentralized exchange, though that may change over time.\n\nAs mobile apps like Coinbase and Venmo make the process of buying crypto smoother, more investors may be inclined to buy cryptocurrency directly from them instead of purchasing crypto ETFs. However, that means your crypto will still be sitting on a centralized platform, and moving it off-platform to a decentralized wallet may require additional know-how.\n\nBitcoin ETFs FAQs Do Bitcoin ETFs pay dividends? chevron-down chevron-up Most Bitcoin ETFs do not yield dividends, mainly because Bitcoin itself is decentralized and not a company that pays dividends to shareholders. However, some Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) \u2014 have recently started paying dividends with yields of around 1%. Some Bitcoin ETFs also invest in shares of publicly traded companies that deal with Bitcoin or keep part of their holdings in Bitcoin. If you invest in these particular ETFs, you might also receive dividends, yet they will likely be lower than if you invested in those companies directly. Some Bitcoin ETFs also invest in shares of publicly traded companies that deal with Bitcoin or keep part of their holdings in Bitcoin. If you invest in these particular ETFs, you might also receive dividends, yet they will likely be lower than if you invested in those companies directly. How safe is investing in Bitcoin ETFs? chevron-down chevron-up All investments come with risks, and this is especially true for crypto-related assets. With that said, investing in a Bitcoin ETF is generally considered safer because most brokers offering ETFs are highly regulated, much more so than crypto exchanges. For more information, read our article on For more information, read our article on whether bitcoin is safe Where can I buy Bitcoin ETFs? chevron-down chevron-up You can buy most Bitcoin ETFs through traditional online brokers, but not all brokers offer them. Depending on the specific ETF you wish to buy, you may need to shop around for the right broker. Some ETFs are also actively traded on NYSE Arca and Nasdaq. Do Bitcoin ETFs invest in Bitcoin directly? chevron-down chevron-up No, Bitcoin ETFs do not invest in Bitcoin directly. There are currently no ETFs that buy or trade BTC. Bitcoin ETFs are an indirect way to gain exposure to the crypto market because the fund invests in companies or assets related to Bitcoin (or Bitcoin futures), but not in Bitcoin itself. What is the difference between Bitcoin and crypto? chevron-down chevron-up Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency \u2014 the most popular crypto of them all \u2014 but not all cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin. Crypto is the broader category of digital currency that Bitcoin and other altcoins fall under. Put another way, Bitcoin is to crypto what the dollar or the euro are to fiat currency.\n\nHow we found the best Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThere are plenty of crypto ETFs available today, and while they can appear quite similar on the surface, not all are worth investing in. We considered the following four factors to narrow down the selection of the best Bitcoin ETFs of the year.\n\nPrice\n\nThe price of an ETF can be misleading, since a higher price doesn\u2019t necessarily mean greater overall performance. However, looking at historical price data can give investors an idea of potential volatility moving ahead.\n\nFor example, if a given ETF has endured large price swings over the past 12 months, there\u2019s a reasonable chance it will endure similarly large swings over the next 12 months. Investors looking for more stable returns should seek out ETFs with a track record of relative stability, especially through the recent market downturn.\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively volatile over the past 12 months, and almost all of them have lost money, largely due to the outflow of funds from the crypto markets.\n\nExpense ratios\n\nExpense ratios are always an important factor to look at when assessing ETFs because they can eat away at investor returns. All things being equal, lower expense ratios are better, though it may be worth paying a higher expense ratio if you can expect higher net returns.\n\nThe lowest expense ratios among Bitcoin ETFs range between 0.5% and 0.75%, with expense ratios on the high side sitting above 1%.\n\nMinimum investment\n\nBitcoin ETFs with low minimum investment thresholds open the door to smaller investors, while those with higher thresholds generally cater to institutional investors. The ETFs on our list have minimum investment thresholds between $10,000 and $100,000.\n\nAssets under management\n\nAssets under management (AUM) is an indicator of the size of a fund. A larger AUM doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a more successful fund; on the contrary, small funds may achieve higher returns because there\u2019s a lower absolute risk if they go bust, allowing them to be more aggressive in their allocations.\n\nThe ETFs on our list range from around $5 million to more than $10 billion worth of assets under management.\n\nSummary of the best Bitcoin ETFs of 2023"

        "title": "Craig Wright's case against Bitcoin SV devs reopened - The Register",
        "content": "A company owned by the man who claims to have invented Bitcoin is suing the developers of a fork of Bitcoin. Although the case was dismissed once already, it is being reopened, and a UK court will hear the Seychelles company's version of events next month.\n\nThe Court of Appeal of England and Wales has decided that the case of Tulip Trading against the developers of Bitcoin SV should be reopened. Tulip is suing 15 people and one Swiss nonprofit, Bitcoin Association, the developers behind Bitcoin SV, a fork of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nTulip is headed up by Australian doctor of theology Craig Wright (it is unrelated to another litigious company with a similar name, extinct Dutch vendor Tulip Computers).\n\nBitcoin SV, short for \"Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,\" was forked from Bitcoin Cash in November 2018. Bitcoin Cash in turn was forked from Bitcoin in 2017. As long ago as 2015, we reported that Wright owned an Australian company called Tulip Trading.\n\nAs the Appeals Court puts it:\n\nTulip Trading Limited, a company associated with Dr Craig Wright, claims to be the owner of some bitcoin with a very high total value (the value in $ expressed in April 2021 was about $4 billion). The bitcoin is held at two addresses on the blockchain called 1Feex and 12ib7. However the private keys have been lost in a hack, likely stolen. Without its private keys Tulip cannot access its assets or move them to safety. However, Tulip contends, the developers named as defendants in this case control and run the four relevant bitcoin networks, and it would be a simple matter for them to secure Tulip's assets, e.g. by moving them to another address which Tulip can control. Tulip contends that the role the developers have undertaken in relation to Tulip's property (the bitcoin) and the power this role gives them, and all the circumstances (discussed below), mean that the developers should be recognised as a new ad hoc class of fiduciary, owing fiduciary duties to the true owners of bitcoin cryptocurrency, including in this case Tulip as true owner of the bitcoin at 1Feex and 12ib7.\n\nThe developers deny they owe fiduciary or any other duties to Tulip. They contend that they have \"nothing like the power or control Tulip alleges and that duties of the kind Tulip contend for would be highly onerous and unworkable.\"\n\nThe justices said they would allow the appeal, but cautioned that \"the conclusion is not that there is a fiduciary duty in law in the circumstances alleged by Tulip, only that the case advanced raises a serious issue to be tried.\"\n\nBack in 2016, Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous programmer who invented Bitcoin. This claim is controversial, and Wright has previously sued people who have rubbished it, although he lost that case in 2020. Lawsuits over Wright's claim to be Satoshi were still ongoing in January last year.\n\nIn 2019, Wright was instructed by a Florida court to hand over Bitcoin then valued at approximately $5 billion. As we reported in January 2022, Wright said that he was hacked and lost access to two wallets containing the money, and was suing the developers of Bitcoin SV for them to change the code to give him access to two wallets: one with 449 coins and another with 155.\n\nWe note that Bitcoin SV is currently valued at some $40. Thus, BSV604 might be sold for as much as approximately US $25,500. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto really is, they mined about 5 percent of all Bitcoin, and hold somewhere between 750,000 and 1.1 million BTC. Even though the value of Bitcoin has been dropping sharply for some years, currently that holding is valued at $17 billion to $24 billion. \u00ae"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Really Reach a $1 Million Price Tag? Here's Why Cathie Wood Thinks So. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Known for their love of innovation and disruptive technologies, Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest are natural fans of Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%). They believe the world's first cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize financial markets and even the idea of money itself.\n\nTheir confidence in Bitcoin is so strong that analysts at Ark Invest released a report claiming that its price could be worth more than $1 million by 2030.\n\nBut for Bitcoin to get to that level, it would need to increase by more than 4,000% in just seven years. Although Bitcoin is no stranger to massive runs, this prediction seems outlandish at first glance. Fortunately for us, Ark's analyst provided a detailed synopsis of just how Bitcoin could get to the million-dollar mark.\n\nThere's more to Bitcoin than just its price\n\nOne of the primary reasons Ark believes Bitcoin will continue to ascend in price is due to its consistent growth in its network's fundamentals. Similar to earnings reports for companies, data on Bitcoin's blockchain can be evaluated to gauge health and growth.\n\nTo capture this, analysts evaluated blockchain metrics on three different occasions when Bitcoin's price was at $15,800. This price is important because it was the lowest price Bitcoin fell to in the current bear market, reaching that bottom price in November 2022.\n\nThe other two times were on December 2017, which was an all-time high at that point, and then after a bear market that spanned most of 2018 and 2019. That downturn sent Bitcoin prices down as low as $3,100 before climbing back to $15,800 in November 2020.\n\nArk evaluated metrics like hash rate (a statistic that quantifies Bitcoin's computing power), the total supply of Bitcoin that hadn't moved in the past year (a gauge to measure investor behavior), and the number of Bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance (a figure that helps assess network growth).\n\nDespite reaching this $15,800 price on three separate occasions, these metrics were shown to have grown significantly. Here is a breakdown of each of those metrics at these different points in time:\n\nMetric Dec. 2017 Nov. 2020 Nov. 2022 Hash Rate (EH/s) 12.6 127.8 262.4 Supply of BTC Last Moved >1 Year Ago (%) 44.1% 61.8% 66.5% BTC Addresses With Non-Zero Balance (Millions) 24 32.6 43.5\n\nWhen analyzing Bitcoin from this angle, rather than just its price, a few things become clear. First, Bitcoin's network computing power continues to strengthen, a sign that it is becoming more decentralized and secure with time. Second, investors are holding Bitcoin for longer, and this trend is typically viewed as an indication of their confidence that prices will increase in the future. And lastly, the number of addresses has nearly doubled in just five years, which shows that the network has been experiencing exponential growth. Ark believes this combination of the Bitcoin network's resilience and growth, even in the midst of bear markets, will continue into the future and provide the fuel for it to reach new all-time highs.\n\nGood, better, and best-case scenarios\n\nBut how high can Bitcoin actually go? To quantify just how explosive this growth could be, Ark presented three separate scenarios for Bitcoin's journey up to 2030. They divided the three into a bear case (the worst scenario), a base case, and a bull case (the best scenario).\n\nFor the bear case, Ark believes Bitcoin could be worth around $258,500. The base case projects a value of $682,000. And the bull case, a whopping $1.48 million.\n\nJust because Ark thinks a $1.48 million price tag is in the cards doesn't guarantee it will happen. Even though it would be nice to see, the firm doesn't have a crystal ball that predicts the future. But their analysis of Bitcoin's network at three different points provides a compelling case that bear markets and crypto winters are just minor obstacles in Bitcoin's path of price ascension.\n\nOnly time will tell if Ark's analysis proves to be true. With its hash rate, supply last moved more than a year ago, and the number of non-zero balances all sitting at near all-time highs, purchasing Bitcoin today looks as alluring as ever, as the price remains down more than 65% from its peak of $68,000."

        "title": "'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs via Ordinals are the buzziest thing in the space lately, with more than 100,000 such media assets committed to the blockchain in barely two weeks. Surprisingly, that tally includes 535 NFTs from DeGods\u2014the most valuable Solana NFT project.\n\nDeGods revealed the move on Monday as word circulated that the profile pictures (PFPs) had all been inscribed on Bitcoin in a single block. (\"Inscribing\" is the process by which NFT-like assets are created on the Bitcoin blockchain, akin to \"minting\" on Ethereum.) The 535 particular images were originally released via Solana in 2021, but were \u201cburned\u201d (or permanently destroyed) to cut down the supply in the early days of the project.\n\nProject creator Rohun Vora, who goes by the pseudonym Frank, told Decrypt that he and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson (who simply goes by Kevin) are longtime Bitcoin aficionados who relished the opportunity to bring the project onto the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s network in the early days of Ordinals momentum.\n\nAesthetics matter a lot to my team @DeGodsNFT. It was an honor working with @hash_bender to make sure there was no random trashy Ordinals minted in between all 535 DeGods. All in one block. Simple. Beautiful. Inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain forever. pic.twitter.com/Yfuvc8IDuT \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the best brand in crypto\u2014just as pristine as it gets,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt's the most well known, and truly as simple but powerful as it can get. And the mission statement is it's never been corrupted, right? It's like global sound money. That is so powerful. Aligning ourselves with the best brand in crypto is a no-brainer at any given point in time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNow those 535 PFPs have gained a second life on Bitcoin with never-before-seen upgraded artwork. DeGods previously provided holders refreshed \u201cDeadGods\u201d artwork last year, and created upgraded artwork for the burned NFTs as well, plotting an eventual revival.\n\nNFT Sales Jump 38% in January as Bored Apes Drive Trading Surge\n\n\u201cWe always had this notion of \u2018What is dead may never die,\u2019\u201d Kevin explained, echoing the familiar refrain from the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \u201cAnd it was this idea, like: Holy shit, this is so perfect. We can literally bring these back, mint them as Ordinals on BTC, and it's permanent,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to life\n\nOrdinals is a unique way of inscribing NFT-like media and assets to the Bitcoin blockchain by connecting them with a single Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000th of one BTC. The media is fully stored on-chain and the Ordinal can be transferred, although there\u2019s still a need for a lot more infrastructure and platforms for transacting and handling the assets.\n\nIt has quickly given rise to CryptoPunks clones and playable web games on Bitcoin. OnChain Monkey, an Ethereum project, also put its entire 10,000 NFT original collection into a single inscription. However, Ordinals has also drawn considerable backlash from Bitcoin maximalists, plus it has boosted network congestion\u2014and transaction fees in tandem.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nKevin said that they dove into Ordinals as soon as it started gaining steam. But with the DeGods inscriptions, they didn\u2019t just want to mint them in the typical way and have the inscriptions added to the network across potentially multiple Bitcoin blocks.\n\nInstead, they worked with a Bitcoin miner, Luxor Technologies CEO Nick Hansen, to arrange for all 535 of the NFT inscriptions to be etched onto the blockchain in a single, exclusive block. The block was processed by DMG Blockchain Solutions\u2019 Terra Pool, which claims to be a carbon-neutral mining pool powered by renewable energy solutions.\n\nOver 1 year ago, 535 DeGods were burned. Many have speculated on their return. What is dead may never die. pic.twitter.com/fmP1FhZI6F \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 13, 2023\n\n\u201cIt was a deal-breaker for us if we couldn't do it as a custom block, because we had to do something special,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s the DeGods way, right? You can't just do it in the basic way. You\u2019ve gotta do something that feels really fresh.\u201d\n\nUltimately, to fit the 535 images into a single Bitcoin block, they had to be seriously compressed. Each was resized down to a low-resolution 210x210 pixels\u2014a nod to the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC\u2014and in the .webp file format to conserve space. But now they\u2019re all inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain for future use.\n\nWhile many NFTs on Ethereum and other platforms store their artwork externally on either centralized servers or decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS), Ordinals fit the artwork or asset entirely within the on-chain block. That proved to be a key part of the appeal for the DeGods team\u2014that these assets will live potentially forever on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI've run a [Bitcoin] node, and the idea that every single node on the planet is now verifying and backing up this image is so powerful,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat is what got us really excited.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nMeanwhile, the broader DeGods project is already set to be bridged from Solana to Ethereum sometime this quarter, as announced in December\u2014with sister project y00ts bridging from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s still happening for the rest of the project\u2019s 10,000 total NFTs, and Frank tweeted this week that \u201chaving a presence on all blockchains is important.\u201d However, these 535 specific DeGods NFTs, which were previously burned on Solana, will only live on Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nHow they roll out remains to be seen, however. The official DeGods account tweeted Monday that details on how to mint the Bitcoin NFTs will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Kevin told Decrypt that they\u2019re currently being held in private wallets, and that they\u2019re waiting for more tooling to be deployed to make Ordinals safer to handle and transact. Once that target is hit, Kevin said that they have plenty of ideas on how to launch the NFTs in an effort to \u201ccome back to our holders and support the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're gonna essentially sit on them,\u201d Kevin said, \u201cuntil we are comfortable that the tooling will support the proper custody of these for a reasonably sophisticated crypto connoisseur.\u201d"

The company explained that inscribing NFTs through its software involves \u201cno need to run a node, complex software, or anything else,\u201d merely some Bitcoin to pay a transaction fee, which can be bought directly through the app.\n\nInscriptions are made via Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that rolled out \u201cno-code ordinal inscriptions\u201d last week. According to Xverse, roughly 5% of Bitcoin inscriptions so far have been made using Gamma\u2019s tool.\n\nAfter uploading an image and sending a transaction to their provided Ordinals address, users can find their inscriptions inside their Xverse NFT collection within 20 to 30 minutes\u2014and embedded in the blockchain forever.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nThis comes just a day after Hiro, another Bitcoin focused Web3 wallet, rolled out inscriptions to its testnet on Tuesday. Both wallets interact with Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d blockchain with its own NFT economy that settles its transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nXverse, too, lets Bitcoin users interact with Stacks, with plans to introduce instant payments via the lightning network.\n\nBitcoin recently logged its 100,000th Ordinals transaction, continuing a trend of exponential growth. Given that NFTs on Bitcoin were not a feature envisioned by its original developers, their existence has naturally sparked controversy, with many people unsure of whether they will hurt or help the network.\n\nStacks co-creator Muneeb Ali said he welcomes the new protocol, stating that it marks a \u201cnew chapter in Bitcoin history\u201d on Tuesday. The following day, he said that Xverse\u2019s Bitcoin wallet now has the \u201ceasiest on-ramp to ordinals.\u201d\n\nKen Liao, the founder and CEO of Xverse wallet (aka Secret Key Labs), said that the ability to send out one\u2019s ordinal from the wallet will be available soon.

In the recent rally, bitcoin is doing the same, tailing indexes like the Nasdaq 100 as it moves higher amid the anticipation of fewer rate hikes.\n\nThat remains to be seen, however, as the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse course if it senses that it doesn't quite have inflation under control. If that's the case, more volatility could be ahead for the stock market, which could translate to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"On days when technology stocks trade higher, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), are likely to do the same,\" a Coindesk article noted. \"Conversely, a decline in technology stocks could drag the crypto market lower.\"\n\nThat said, macroeconomic catalysts like inflation reports and interest rate decisions are likely to move cryptocurrencies again this year. A peek at the Nasdaq 100 may offer market-watchers an idea of what the cryptocurrency market might be doing.\n\n\"The renewed positive correlation implies increased sensitivity of cryptocurrencies to macroeconomic data releases like the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which injects volatility into stock markets,\" the article added further. \"The CPI days were among the most volatile for U.S. stocks last year, according to MarketWatch.\"\n\nGet Bitcoin Exposure on a Regulated Exchange\n\nGetting bitcoin exposure doesn't mean that investors must trade digital currencies by opening a separate account on an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that could potentially open them up to potential risk. That said, investors have options in regulated markets in order to get cryptocurrency exposure to major coins like bitcoin.\n\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) can allow investors to get in on thebitcoin priceaction without investing directly in the digital currency itself. Consider the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nFor the bulls, BITO builds capital appreciation through its bitcoin futures contract use, allowing investors to get exposure tobitcoin priceappreciation within the regulatory framework of a traditional financial exchange.

The amount raised by an AI-meets-crypto startup, and other key stats from the week.\n\nBTC UPDATE\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals, and why is the cryptoverse buzzing about them?\n\nBitcoin is most famous for doing one thing really well: being decentralized digital money. But while Bitcoin\u2019s core ethos involves peer-to-peer digital payments, some developers have long wondered whether the blockchain could support different functionalities like NFTs or be more programmable, like Ethereum. With the most recent craze to hit the crypto ecosystem, they may finally be getting their answer.\n\nThat craze? Bitcoin NFTs called \u201cOrdinal Inscriptions.\u201d Ordinals involve putting any kind of digital file \u2014 people have minted playable games, videos, and images \u2014 on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, and they have taken off in 2023.\n\nYet, this trend has also generated controversy among some of Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent supporters. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nOrdinals are essentially NFTs, but for the Bitcoin blockchain. Like NFTs, they represent digital assets. But instead of being minted, Ordinals are \u201cinscribed\u201d onto a single satoshi (the lowest denomination of BTC, similar to a penny vs. a dollar). Inscribing is the process of putting a piece of data onto the blockchain, where it will remain forever accessible and unchangeable.\n\nOrdinals began rising in popularity at the end of January, and to date more than 160,000 inscriptions have been created, including a playable version of the 1993 video game Doom and a picture of a Bored Ape morphed with a CryptoPunk.\n\nHow are Ordinals different from NFTs on other blockchains?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain isn\u2019t smart-contract compatible like those of Ethereum and Solana, so it\u2019s more difficult to create applications like games and NFTs via BTC\u2019s network.\n\nOrdinals are also far more technologically limited than traditional NFTs. While they can inscribe most forms of digital content, Ordinals are limited by the size of data that can fit in a BTC block, which is about 4 MB at maximum. Additionally, the barrier to create an inscription is high \u2013 typically one must be running a Bitcoin node to be able to inscribe into a satoshi.\n\nIn an effort to make Ordinals more accessible, however, BTC marketplace Gamma.io recently launched a tool to create a 60kb inscription for 21,000 satoshis (or, sats) which is about $5. And on Wednesday, crypto wallet maker MetaMask released an Ordinal wallet available to its 30 million users.\n\nWhat does the Bitcoin community think of Ordinals?\n\nDetractors in the Bitcoin community, like Adam Back, a prominent developer, believe that inscriptions are a \u201cwaste\u201d because they are consuming blockspace that should be used for financial transactions, which is Bitcoin\u2019s founding, primary purpose. Because inscriptions can contain audio or video files, creating them has increased the cost of transacting on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nOthers argue that because inscribing into satoshis can alter their value, it would cause Bitcoin to lose an important trait that money has \u2014 fungibility \u2014 since all satoshis would no longer have equal value.\n\nAlex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a developer for the Bitcoin smart contract platform Stacks (which has seen its native STK token jump by more than 100% in the last week amid the Bitcoin NFT hype) believes that inscriptions being fundamentally different from traditional NFTs will help spur their adoption \u2014 even if Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain wasn\u2019t originally intended to be used for things like preserving digital versions of housing deeds of government documents.\n\nWhy it matters\u2026 It\u2019s still too early to tell if Ordinals are the beginning of new use-cases for Bitcoin, or just a short-term fad. Will their functionality ultimately be eclipsed by Ethereum\u2019s dominance as a programmable blockchain? Or will they usher in a new era for Bitcoin? People like Miller argue that Ordinals have a real future. \u201cThe Stacks community [has] been saying for so long that things should be getting built on Bitcoin,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBecause it is the most trusted thing that\u2019s been around the longest, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nTAKES\n\nKeanu Reeves praises crypto, the SEC\u2019s Hester Peirce criticizes her agency, and other key soundbites\n\nOrange pill\u2026 \u201cTo pooh-pooh crypto, or the volatility of cryptocurrency, it\u2019s only going to make it better in terms of how it\u2019s safeguarded,\u201d was how \u201cJohn Wick\u201d star Keanu Reeves described crypto technology amid the negative headlines of recent months.

        "content": "There\u2019s little love for bitcoin this Valentine's as sentiment around the cryptocurrency remains \u2018slightly negative\u2019, three months after the fallout from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nGBBC Digital Finance (GDF), an industry body advocating for best practices around digital finance, has partnered with CMI Analytics to create a \u2018Bitcoin Love Index\u2019 \u2013 a daily score that uses a machine algorithm to assess the \u2018sentiment\u2019 behind mentions of bitcoin in the media. Mentions of the word \u2018bitcoin\u2019 are harvested from a wide sample of sources, not just crypto-specific publications.\n\n\n\nThe index shows that, in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse, sentiment around bitcoin fell from being mainly \u2018neutral\u2019 to \u2018very negative\u2019. There was an instant rebound over the following days but it was not until the end of November and beginning of December, GDF figures suggest, that bitcoin sentiment consistently returned to \u2018neutral\u2019 levels.\n\n\n\nBitcoin sentiment is lingering around \u2018slightly negative \u2019 today \u2013 which is also Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 having cooled off slightly since the beginning of the year. The index appears to show that there is not much love for the poster-child of digital assets, even on today of all days.\n\n\n\nLove affair fades as bitcoin trades 60% lower\n\nIn the longer term, GDF notices that there has been no \u2018positive\u2019 sentiment score since the FTX fallout \u2013 the longest streak in the last two years. However, the price of bitcoin, though still volatile, has recovered this month to nearly $20,000 \u2013 similar to the price prior to the FTX collapse.\n\n\n\nOver the entirety of 2022, the price of bitcoin lost more than 60%; it fell from a price of $35,275 at the end of December 2021 to $13,660 at the end of last year. The price of bitcoin had already fallen considerably by the time the FTX story broke, as you might expect \u2013 but that incident alone temporarily wiped 25% off the price of the currency virtually overnight. It wasn\u2019t until the end of January 2023 that the price of bitcoin had recovered to pre-FTX levels.\n\n\n\nThe statistics appear to show that retail investors, whose household budgets are being squeezed anyway, have been spooked by the volatility in the crypto market. But that isn\u2019t really affecting institutional confidence in the market, and there are still those who have full belief in bitcoin.\n\nNigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group, says cryptocurrencies \u201cstill have all the pluses of being digital \u2013 speed, efficiency and convenience \u2013 but they are fundamentally different as they run on an open, immutable blockchain\u201d.\n\nIt has also seemingly not dampened the appetite for celebrity ambassadors at crypto companies; earlier today, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt joined Gamdom, a cryptocurrency casino, as its new brand ambassador."

        "title": "What Happens When the Bitcoin Blockchain Produces an Empty Block - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Accept the oddities: Bitcoin's blockchain has more empty blocks than intended.\n\nBitcoin ( BTC ) is a digital currency that is renowned for its durability, security, and dependability. A new block is added to the network on average every ten minutes, and the miner who successfully creates the block is rewarded with 6.25 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to almost $130,000.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin blockchain is known to sometimes spring a surprise on both watchers and players.\n\nNodes around the network confirmed the existence of a totally empty block at the height of 776,339 blocks. The fact that the block was uploaded to the Bitcoin network with no transactions included caused considerable consternation among those involved in the cryptocurrency industry. What precisely is meant by the term \"empty block,\" and how does this phenomenon occur?\n\nTo begin, while the presence of an empty block on the network may at first seem peculiar, this kind of thing is really rather common. Block 774486 was the location where it happened a little more than two weeks ago to the day.\n\nMiners are encouraged to mine blocks as rapidly as possible, and as a result, they may mine a block even if they have not yet received any transactions that they may include in the block. When this occurs, the block will continue to be empty.\n\nThe following justification may be found in the Bitcoin mempool, which is the primary location for doing research on the Bitcoin blockchain: \"When a new block is located, mining pools will give miners a block template that does not include any transactions. This will allow them to begin the search for the next block as quickly as possible. They immediately transmit a block template that is complete with transactions; but, a complete block template is a larger data transfer and reaches miners after a little longer period of time.\n\n\"During this interim period, which is often no more than one to two seconds, miners sometimes get fortunate and discover a new block utilizing the empty block template,\"\n\nIn essence, mining a template was a case of \"getting fortunate\" for the miners. The Bitcoin block with the height of 776,389 was added to the chain just a few seconds after the block that came before it, which had the height of 776,488. However, Block 776,388 received an additional 0.086 BTC in fees, which is equivalent to around $1,854. This amount was added to the block reward of 6.25 BTC, which is approximately $135,247.\n\nEven when there are no transactions in an empty block, the miner is still rewarded with freshly created bitcoins as part of the block reward. As a result, the reward for Block 776,389 was 6.25 Bitcoin and there were no transaction fees. The winning miner was Binance Pool, which contributed as much as 12% to the overall hash rate of the network.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize the fact that empty blocks do not provide a challenge for the network. Mining empty blocks still results in the production of the coin creation transaction, sometimes referred to as the coinbase transaction. This transaction ensures that Bitcoin is on track to meet its goal of having 21 million Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nThe proportion of vacant blocks on the network is often between between 1% and 2%, as seen by the statistics provided by BitInfoCharts. Given the proliferation of \"ordinals\" on Bitcoin, also known as the capacity to permanently carve photos, data, and marks into the blockchain, this statistic is even more shocking in light of its current state.\n\nThe increase in ordinals has led to various queries and even some anxiety among the Bitcoin community, and only lately the very first cases of pornography were documented.\n\nAs more and more image aficionados compete to have their work included in the Bitcoin blockchain, the mempool has become a more congested place, and block space has become a disputed resource."

Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 12, 2023\n\nRising demand for Bitcoin block space\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was made possible by Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Taproot, Bitcoin\u2019s network soft fork upgrades from 2017 and 2021, respectively.\n\nRelated: Ordinals protocol sparks debate over the place for NFTs in the Bitcoin ecosystem\n\nFor instance, the SegWit update effectively increased Bitcoin\u2019s block capacity to four megabytes (4 MB).\n\nSimilarly, the Taproot update helps batch and verify multiple transactions together as long as their size does not exceed 4 MB. This feature allows the inscription of data, such as images and videos, in Bitcoin blocks.\n\nBitcoin Taproot adoption in recent weeks. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nThe advent of Ordinals has coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s mean block size jumping from its typical average of 1.5\u20132 MB to between three and 3.5 MB in early February.\n\nBitcoin mean block size. Source: Glassnode\n\nSimultaneously, the number of pending SegWit and non-SegWit blocks in the Bitcoin mempool has also increased significantly \u2014 the highest since the FTX collapse, as shown below.\n\nThe number of pending blocks in the Bitcoin Mempool. Source: Glassnode\n\nOn some occasions, Ordinals\u2019 data has been comprising over 50% of Bitcoin block space, according to BitMEX Research.\n\n\u201cThis describes a growth in the user base and an upwards pressure on the fee market from usage beyond the typical investment and monetary transfer use cases,\u201d noted Glassnode in its weekly report, adding:\n\n\u201cOrdinals are a new frontier [...] to observe how it affects and manifests in both on-chain network and investor behavior.\u201c\n\nOrdinals: BTC miners\u2019 new revenue stream?\n\nBitcoin miners generate most of their revenue from the network\u2019s block subsidies, i.e., finding or \u201cmining\u201d new blocks. By comparison, the share of miners\u2019 earnings from transaction fees is only about 3%.\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin network rewards miners with 6.25 BTC per block. But this subsidy will drop by 50% to 3.125 BTC in spring 2024 in a halving event, which happens every four years. As a result, the share of miners\u2019 revenue from transaction fees is expected to rise over time as block rewards decrease.\n\nTo some, Ordinals introduce what\u2019s called miner extractable value, or MEV, which has been previously associated with mining on Ethereum.\n\nSimply put, MEV is the maximum value that miners can obtain from producing new blocks beyond the block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nIf Bitcoin Ordinals will take off (and I think it will) it\u2019s really good news for Bitcoin mining companies\u2019 revenue, something that\u2019s not reflected in their valuations yet. \u2014 Marc van der Chijs (@marcvanderchijs) February 6, 2023\n\nCritics, however, argue that Ordinals is an \u201cattack\u201d that will price out the real financial activity and thus damage Bitcoin\u2019s image as a reliable P2P payments network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is designed to be censor resistant,\u201d said Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, adding:\n\n\u201c[It] doesn\u2019t stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. At least do something efficient. Otherwise, it\u2019s another proof of consumption of block-space thingy.\u201c\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Is This Billionaire's Favorite Cryptocurrency - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ray Dalio, the billionaire co-manager of the world's largest hedge fund, is well-versed in microeconomic trends, and his long experience in tracking global economic trends has also helped him recognize growing shifts in the macroeconomic environment before they become mainstream.\n\nOne shift he predicts is coming involves the growing competition between different forms of money. And he believes Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%) will become a viable competitor among those forms -- so much so that he has allocated 2% of his own portfolio to the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut why would a billionaire take on such a large position in such a risky asset? Fortunately for those of us who are curious, he recently elaborated on his reasoning.\n\nThe billionaire's cryptocurrency of choice\n\nDuring his appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Dalio was asked a handful of questions on finance and economics, but eventually, the topic of Bitcoin arose. At this point, the discussion transitioned into a monologue as Dalio explained his expectations for Bitcoin's growing role in an increasingly digital future, how it stacks up against gold, and even delved into the concept of money itself.\n\nDalio offered several justifications to support his decision to invest in Bitcoin. At the top of that list was how far Bitcoin has come from its humble beginnings and how it has \"obtained the status of having imputed value.\"\n\nWhen the crypto launched in 2009, there were virtually no users of its network. Fast-forward to today, and the Bitcoin blockchain has become a vast decentralized network based on true organic growth. Not only has it grown exponentially, but Bitcoin's code has proven to be virtually unhackable -- a fact that doesn't get recognized enough, in Dalio's opinion.\n\nThe demise of the dollar\n\nAfter Dalio celebrated Bitcoin's monumental rise, he then dove into his reasoning as to why it has a legitimate future as a form of currency. As he put it, the coming years and decades will likely be \"an era where there will be competition of monies.\"\n\nDue to the ever-inflating supplies of government-backed fiat currencies, citizens today are getting the proverbial short end of the stick. They are seeing their paychecks dwindle in purchasing power as the circulating supply of money continues to increase. As a result, Dalio believes the idea of money itself is \"increasingly being considered\" by the citizens of these governments.\n\nAs he put it, \"money has two purposes.\" It should serve as a medium of exchange and a storehouse of wealth -- a combination of characteristics that Bitcoin possesses and that, in his view, currencies like the U.S. dollar are beginning to lack. In this future of alternative monies, Dalio sees Bitcoin becoming a formidable rival to fiat currencies.\n\nGold or digital gold\n\nDue to its use-case similarities to gold, a common approach by investors is to create a \"one or the other\" dichotomy between Bitcoin and gold. But Dalio doesn't see it this way. When asked if he prefers Bitcoin or gold, Dalio explained that he sees the two as having similar characteristics, but serving different purposes.\n\nHe noted that Bitcoin possesses a role in our digital future where the ability to send value over the internet is important, but contended that there could also be a need for people to exchange value \"offline.\" While Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, they are technically traceable.\n\nDespite gold still providing value in today's economy, Dalio believes Bitcoin is the \"younger generation's alternative to gold.\" As this generation begins to become more integrated into the economy, Bitcoin will likely benefit.\n\nAdvice for non-billionaires\n\nAs previously mentioned, Dalio is said to have allocated around 2% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. But Dalio has a net worth of more than $19 billion. His appetite for risk has likely receded as he looks to preserve his wealth rather than grow it.\n\nDepending on your investing time horizon and tolerance for risk, you might feel comfortable allocating a larger share of your portfolio to a volatile asset like Bitcoin. If you are in a wealth preservation mode like Dalio, then a 2% allocation could be a healthy level for you. But those who are closer to the start of their investing journeys are more than likely to be in the market long enough to see how Dalio's predictions about competing monies play out over the long term."

        "title": "'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin NFTs via Ordinals are the buzziest thing in the space lately, with more than 100,000 such media assets committed to the blockchain in barely two weeks. Surprisingly, that tally includes 535 NFTs from DeGods\u2014the most valuable Solana NFT project.\n\nDeGods revealed the move on Monday as word circulated that the profile pictures (PFPs) had all been inscribed on Bitcoin in a single block. (\"Inscribing\" is the process by which NFT-like assets are created on the Bitcoin blockchain, akin to \"minting\" on Ethereum.) The 535 particular images were originally released via Solana in 2021, but were \u201cburned\u201d (or permanently destroyed) to cut down the supply in the early days of the project.\n\nProject creator Rohun Vora, who goes by the pseudonym Frank, told Decrypt that he and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson (who simply goes by Kevin) are longtime Bitcoin aficionados who relished the opportunity to bring the project onto the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s network in the early days of Ordinals momentum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAesthetics matter a lot to my team @DeGodsNFT. It was an honor working with @hash_bender to make sure there was no random trashy Ordinals minted in between all 535 DeGods. All in one block. Simple. Beautiful. Inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain forever. pic.twitter.com/Yfuvc8IDuT \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the best brand in crypto\u2014just as pristine as it gets,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt's the most well known, and truly as simple but powerful as it can get. And the mission statement is it's never been corrupted, right? It's like global sound money. That is so powerful. Aligning ourselves with the best brand in crypto is a no-brainer at any given point in time.\u201d\n\nNow those 535 PFPs have gained a second life on Bitcoin with never-before-seen upgraded artwork. DeGods previously provided holders refreshed \u201cDeadGods\u201d artwork last year, and created upgraded artwork for the burned NFTs as well, plotting an eventual revival.\n\n\u201cWe always had this notion of \u2018What is dead may never die,\u2019\u201d Kevin explained, echoing the familiar refrain from the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \u201cAnd it was this idea, like: Holy shit, this is so perfect. We can literally bring these back, mint them as Ordinals on BTC, and it's permanent,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to life\n\nOrdinals is a unique way of inscribing NFT-like media and assets to the Bitcoin blockchain by connecting them with a single Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000th of one BTC. The media is fully stored on-chain and the Ordinal can be transferred, although there\u2019s still a need for a lot more infrastructure and platforms for transacting and handling the assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has quickly given rise to CryptoPunks clones and playable web games on Bitcoin. OnChain Monkey, an Ethereum project, also put its entire 10,000 NFT original collection into a single inscription. However, Ordinals has also drawn considerable backlash from Bitcoin maximalists, plus it has boosted network congestion\u2014and transaction fees in tandem.\n\nKevin said that they dove into Ordinals as soon as it started gaining steam. But with the DeGods inscriptions, they didn\u2019t just want to mint them in the typical way and have the inscriptions added to the network across potentially multiple Bitcoin blocks.\n\nInstead, they worked with a Bitcoin miner, Luxor Technologies CEO Nick Hansen, to arrange for all 535 of the NFT inscriptions to be etched onto the blockchain in a single, exclusive block. The block was processed by DMG Blockchain Solutions\u2019 Terra Pool, which claims to be a carbon-neutral mining pool powered by renewable energy solutions.\n\nOver 1 year ago, 535 DeGods were burned. Many have speculated on their return. What is dead may never die. pic.twitter.com/fmP1FhZI6F \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 13, 2023\n\n\u201cIt was a deal-breaker for us if we couldn't do it as a custom block, because we had to do something special,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s the DeGods way, right? You can't just do it in the basic way. You\u2019ve gotta do something that feels really fresh.\u201d\n\nUltimately, to fit the 535 images into a single Bitcoin block, they had to be seriously compressed. Each was resized down to a low-resolution 210x210 pixels\u2014a nod to the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC\u2014and in the .webp file format to conserve space. But now they\u2019re all inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain for future use.\n\nWhile many NFTs on Ethereum and other platforms store their artwork externally on either centralized servers or decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS), Ordinals fit the artwork or asset entirely within the on-chain block. That proved to be a key part of the appeal for the DeGods team\u2014that these assets will live potentially forever on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI've run a [Bitcoin] node, and the idea that every single node on the planet is now verifying and backing up this image is so powerful,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat is what got us really excited.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNext steps\n\nMeanwhile, the broader DeGods project is already set to be bridged from Solana to Ethereum sometime this quarter, as announced in December\u2014with sister project y00ts bridging from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s still happening for the rest of the project\u2019s 10,000 total NFTs, and Frank tweeted this week that \u201chaving a presence on all blockchains is important.\u201d However, these 535 specific DeGods NFTs, which were previously burned on Solana, will only live on Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nHow they roll out remains to be seen, however. The official DeGods account tweeted Monday that details on how to mint the Bitcoin NFTs will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Kevin told Decrypt that they\u2019re currently being held in private wallets, and that they\u2019re waiting for more tooling to be deployed to make Ordinals safer to handle and transact. Once that target is hit, Kevin said that they have plenty of ideas on how to launch the NFTs in an effort to \u201ccome back to our holders and support the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're gonna essentially sit on them,\u201d Kevin said, \u201cuntil we are comfortable that the tooling will support the proper custody of these for a reasonably sophisticated crypto connoisseur.\u201d"

Secure your seat today\n\nCanadian crypto hardware manufacturer Coinkite has designed a bitcoin hardware wallet reminiscent of an old-school BlackBerry phone straight out of the 2000s.\n\nBut the company says its new design reflects forward thinking on the tightest possible security measures and user-friendly features gleaned from customer feedback.\n\nThe soon-to-be-released device, dubbed Coldcard Q1, became available for pre-ordering on Feb. 9 and comes with a full keyboard, an LCD screen and an LED-illuminated QR code scanner.\n\nThe waffle-phone-style QWERTY keyboard gives off strong 2002 BlackBerry vibes and is supposed to cut down on so-called fat-finger errors when entering sensitive passwords, PINs and passphrases.\n\nRead more: Wasabi Wallet Will Pay You to 'Crack' a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nCoinkite added a battery compartment on the Q1\u2019s rear side that fits three AAA batteries, so there\u2019s no need for a tethered power supply, although a USB-C port is available for customers who prefer using a power cord.\n\nIt\u2019s the company\u2019s fifth iteration of a bitcoin hardware wallet, following the introduction of the MK line starting in 2018. The most-recent model, the Coldcard MK4, was released in February 2022.\n\nThe company aims to crack into the market-leadership ranks of hardware wallet makers, currently dominated by big names including Trezor and Ledger. But the overall market may be growing as more crypto investors seek out hardware wallets as an alternative to simply leaving coins on exchanges.\n\nOutsiders may scoff at the Q1\u2019s bulky, throwback user interface or UX, but Coinkite says it intentionally came up with that anachronistic design after consultations with users of its smaller, slimmer MK4.\n\nWay more ppl than I expected like the bulky-QWERTY-non-pocketable mountain-man-devices like we do. \ud83d\ude06 \u2014 NVK \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1e @nvk@nvk.org (@nvk) February 11, 2023\n\nThe exact size, weight and price of the Q1 will be confirmed in the near future, but eager users can already reserve the device with a $199 deposit. The retail price is not expected to be much higher than the deposit amount.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe Q1 was built mainly to help less advanced users,\u201d Celia Cherif, a Coinkite business development representative, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cWe gathered their feedback from the MK4 and made everything more UX friendly for them in the Q1.\u201d\n\nGrowing market for hardware wallets\n\nCoinkite\u2019s roots in the Bitcoin space go all the way back to 2011, when co-founders Rodolfo\n\nNovak and Peter Gray stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper and later built a rudimentary bitcoin hardware wallet. The pair eventually incorporated as Coinkite, and the firm now produces and sells a suite of hardware and software Bitcoin products, including the MK4, which Cherif says is Coinkite\u2019s best-selling product.\n\n\u201cColdcard sales have been higher than expected,\u201d Novak wrote in a tweet. Coinkite declined to provide CoinDesk with official sales data.\n\nLast year\u2019s implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange triggered an exodus of customers from centralized exchanges to self-custody devices.\n\nOne crypto publication reported that two of the largest players in the hardware wallet space \u2013 Trezor and Ledger \u2013 captured a significant share of those spooked customers in November. According to the publication, Trezor reported a 300% increase in week-over-week sales while Ledger saw a six-fold increase in account creations for Ledger Live, the firm\u2019s wallet management software.\n\nCoinkite also saw an uptick in sales, although it\u2019s not clear by how much. \u201cBitcoiners are so resolute on bitcoin and so many are getting off exchanges,\u201d Novak tweeted. \u201cIn all my years, I've never seen so much activity.\u201d\n\nConvenience and 'air-gapping'\n\nThe Q1\u2019s design revolves around convenience and security, especially \u201cair-gapping,\u201d which means isolating the device from potentially unsecured networks like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\n\nCherif says that some less-tech-savvy customers reported difficulties using the MK4. Many customers were fumbling to enter sensitive passphrases, struggling to scan bitcoin address QR codes, dealing with the hassle of connecting power cords and switching back and forth between microSD cards.\n\nWith that backdrop, Coinkite designed the Q1 to include two microSD slots for saving wallet seed phrases \u2013 a series of 12 to 24 random words used to \u201crecover\u201d or regain private keys in the case of accidental loss. The double microSD slots offer more secure data transfer than traditional USB-A connections (more commonly referred to as simply \u201cUSB\u201d), which Cherif says are vulnerable to all sorts of sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of vulnerabilities with USB data connectivity,\u201d Cherif explained. \u201cThere's a website created just to monitor all the known vulnerabilities. The list is never-ending. These are vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by malicious actors.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s engineers included both AAA batteries and the USB-C port as power sources for the Q1. Cherif also emphasized that the Q1\u2019s USB-C port is strictly reserved for power transmission and not data transfer.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to plug the USB-C cable into an Internet-connected device, it remains a much safer option than a USB cable because it doesn't have any data lines connected, only power,\u201d Cherif said.\n\nCoinkite added a flashlight to the Q1 so users can easily scan Bitcoin QR codes (encoded Bitcoin addresses) in dim lighting.\n\nThe wallet has an LED QR code scanner instead of a video camera-based version. Coinkite says the choice was deliberate because cameras, being more technologically complex, are more prone to malicious hacks.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, the camera is an attack vector,\u201d Cherif explained.\n\nA few Twitter users perusing details of the new device wondered out loud if the Q1\u2019s large color LCD screen is able to display Ordinals, a new type of on-chain Bitcoin non-fungible token (NFT).\n\nOrdinals will look great on that big screen. \u2014 Mike In Space! (@mikeinspace) February 9, 2023\n\nFor now, the answer is \u201cno,\u201d although Coinkite is collaborating with Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on a project that uses a different Coinkite product \u2013 the Satschip \u2013 for Ordinals provenance (using a Bitcoin private key to prove ownership of an Ordinals NFT).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals"

        "content": "Bitcoin was the only top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrency to gain in Tuesday morning trading in Asia in a market unsettled by regulators in the U.S. targeting digital asset companies. Paxos Trust Co. was ordered on Monday to stop issuing its U.S. dollar-pegged Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin by New York authorities and it reportedly faces an SEC investigation. BNB, the native currency of Binance the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, had the biggest drop on the list.\n\nSee related article: Paxos ordered to stop issuing Binance USD stablecoin: report\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 0.1% in the past 24 hours to US$21,800 at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is down 4.2% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Ether dropped 0.56 to US$1,506, posting a 6.8% weekly loss.\n\nBNB fell 5.9% to US$294.40, bringing weekly losses to 9.3%.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos to stop issuing the BUSD stablecoin and the company received notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it may face an investigation as the regulator regards BUSD as an unregistered security, according to a Monday press release.\n\n\u201cPaxos categorically disagrees with the SEC staff because BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws,\u201d the firm said in the release.\n\nA stablecoin is a crypto token pegged to the value of an asset, in this case the U.S. dollar, and collateralized by the underlying asset. BUSD was co-developed by Paxos and the Binance exchange. The Ethereum-based stablecoin is issued and managed by Paxos.\n\nPaxos said the BUSD it issues is fully backed with U.S. dollar-denominated reserves and is fully segregated. Paxos reported about $16 billion in collateral backing BUSD as of Jan. 31.\n\nThe moves on Paxos by regulators follow the SEC slapping a US$30 million fine on the Kraken U.S.-based crypto exchange last week for what it called the illegal operation of a crypto staking program.\n\nThe actions by regulators unnerved some investors, with Polygon dropping 4.3% to trade at US$1.19, a loss of 0.3% for the past week. Solana fell 3.3% to US$20.78, a weekly loss of 8.4%.\n\nU.S. equities rose on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index both gained 1.1% while the Nasdaq Composite Index closed the day 1.4% higher.\n\nThe gains come ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January, a key measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve uses to set interest rates. Economists expect an 0.4% increase in the CPI for January from December, however, the year-on-year pace is slowing.\n\nThe CPI in December showed prices rose 6.5% year-on-year from the 7.1% recorded in November, which in turn declined from October\u2019s 7.7% and 8.2% in September.\n\nThe Fed, which has said it wants inflation back in the 2% range, has raised interest rates multiple times since last March to reverse the inflation surge. Analysts at the CME Group predict a more than 90% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a further 25 basis points at its meeting next month. U.S. interest rates are currently at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years, and Fed officials have repeatedly indicated they could raise rates to as high as 5%.\n\nSee related article: UAE central bank to issue CBDC, promote digital asset growth"

        "content": "In brief Bakkt is a custody service that stores Bitcoin in cold storage.\n\nThe platform provides a way for traditional investors to get involved in Bitcoin with US federal regulatory oversight.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe owner of the New York Stock Exchange wants to make Bitcoin mainstream. What counts as mainstream? Traditional and financial institutions. If you can get the old money to feel comfortable trading new money, you can bring a huge new wave of investors to the cryptocurrency game\u2014and maybe even stabilize it. That\u2019s the promise of Bakkt, which hopes to become the on-ramp of the institutional investor.\n\nWe learn more about it below.\n\nWhat is Bakkt?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt its core, Bakkt is a custody service that stores Bitcoin in a secure form, known as cold storage. It looks after large amounts of Bitcoin on behalf of institutional investors. Originally, the company serviced retail customers as well; they ceased this offering in February 2023. They said they will instead focus on direct interaction with businesses, providing them \u201cwith crypto and loyalty experiences for their customers through SaaS and API solutions.\u201d\n\nBakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). ICE then offers a Bakkt-branded Bitcoin futures product. This is where traders are able to bet on the rising or falling price of Bitcoin. All the Bitcoin used to back the trades is stored in Bakkt's secure custody.\n\nBakkt is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange. Image: Shutterstock.\n\nSo, Bakkt looks after the Bitcoin on behalf of ICE, which enables institutional investors to speculate on it in the form of futures trading. The combination provides institutions with the chance to buy and sell digital assets in a US federally regulated environment. That means they can experience the ease, volume, and security for Bitcoin that they already enjoy on traditional exchanges.\n\nWhat's relatively unique to Bakkt is that it allows for trades to be physically settled in Bitcoin, as opposed to cash. That means when a trade is finished, traders receive Bitcoin to their account. All of this Bitcoin is stored by Bakkt\u2014and it uses a separate ledger to record who owns what, rather than having to move the Bitcoin around all the time.\n\nWhen did Bakkt launch?\n\nBakkt was announced in August 2018, but didn't launch until September 23 2019. ICE, which created it, is run by Wall Street giant Jeffrey Sprecher, who also serves as the chairman of NYSE. Sprecher noticed that many traditional investors were itching to get involved in cryptocurrency, but they needed it to be packaged and regulated in the right way. So ICE created Bakkt to meet investor demand.\n\nHe originally appointed Kelly Loeffler as CEO of Bakkt, formerly the CMO of ICE, who left to become a US Senator in late 2019. She was succeeded by former PayPal vice president of engineering Mike Blandina, then ICE's associate general counsel David Clifton (as interim CEO), and finally former head of technology at Citi Gavin Michael.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBakkt's launch got off to a slow start. On its first day, the Bakkt Bitcoin futures offering saw just 71 Bitcoin traded, worth around $700,000 at the time. Trading has built up over time; during the last week of 2020\u2014a golden period for crypto in general\u2014Bakkt's Bitcoin futures reached a trading volume of $286 million.\n\nA brief history of Bakkt\n\nAugust 2018 \u2013 The Bakkt platform is announced by parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\n\n\u2013 The Bakkt platform is announced by parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) December 2018 - Bakkt raises $182.5 million in funding round\n\n- Bakkt raises $182.5 million in funding round September 2019 - Bakkt Bitcoin futures go live, trading is now open on ICE.\n\n- Bakkt Bitcoin futures go live, trading is now open on ICE. December 2019 - Bakkt launches Bitcoin monthly options and cash-settled Bitcoin futures.\n\n- Bakkt launches Bitcoin monthly options and cash-settled Bitcoin futures. January 2021 - Bakkt announces that it will go public.\n\n- Bakkt announces that it will go public. March 2021 - Bakkt receives a BitLicense in New York.\n\n- Bakkt receives a BitLicense in New York. February 2023 - Bakkt ceases its retail business.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?\n\nBakkt is still the new kid on the block, but it\u2019s already labeled as the way to make Bitcoin mainstream. Even titans Microsoft and Starbucks have thrown their weight behind it.\n\nThe platform provides a way for traditional investors to get involved in Bitcoin with the oversight of US federal regulation. The company is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for approval \u2013 which will bring requirements like compliance, anti-money laundering rules, and strict reporting standards.\n\nThat could be the assurance that big-time institutional investors need to finally dive in to crypto. The company has said its goal is to turn Bitcoin into the world\u2019s first worldwide currency.\n\nHow does Bakkt work?\n\nBakkt is a platform for institutional investors to buy, sell, and store digital assets on a global network. The idea is that Bakkt gives investors the chance to trade assets and futures based in Bitcoin the same way they would traditional currencies and commodities.\n\nBakkt also offers warehouse storage for the safekeeping of Bitcoin. Storing a customer\u2019s private keys \u201coffline\u201d adds layers of security and thwart hackers \u2013 bringing more peace of mind to traditional investors.\n\nThe platform has also come up with a way to tackle blockchain\u2019s biggest drawback: slow speed. Since a lot of the transactions will happen between customers with assets already stored in the warehouse, it isn\u2019t necessary to put every single movement on a blockchain. Anything that happens within the warehouse is recorded on Bakkt\u2019s own separate ledger. Only assets coming in or leaving the warehouse need to be on the blockchain.\n\nIn that sense, parent company CEO Sprecher says it operates \u201con a layer above the blockchain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat can you do with Bakkt?\n\nBakkt is a way for institutional investors to embrace Bitcoin in a way they\u2019ve never been able to before.\n\nBakkt claims to solve two fundamental problems that prevent Bitcoin from widespread acceptance.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Infrastructure - Bakkt\u2019s platform provides regulated infrastructure for buying and selling Bitcoin.\n\n- Bakkt\u2019s platform provides regulated infrastructure for buying and selling Bitcoin. \ud83d\udd0d Price discovery - Bakkt wants to create trusted, regulated price discovery\u2014finding a clear price across multiple exchanges\u2014so investors can have full confidence in buying and selling. If they do manage to crack it, Bakkt stands a high chance of luring the traditional investors they seek.\n\nThe future\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the New York Department of Financial Service (DFS) granted a BitLicense to Bakkt. This enables it to start operating in New York, opening up its custody services to a wider audience.\n\nBakkt is also planning to become a publicly-traded company. On January 11, it announced plans for a merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings in a deal that will result in a combined company called Bakkt Holdings, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This deal will value the newly created company at $2.1 billion."

        "title": "Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card Review - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Top perks\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card provides an interesting mix of benefits.\n\nBitcoin rewards\n\nThe main appeal of the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is right there in the name. It earns Bitcoin on your payments toward purchases you've made.\n\nBitcoin's price has skyrocketed many times over the years, so there's the possibility that your rewards will increase in value. It's worth mentioning the opposite is also true. Since Bitcoin is so volatile, your rewards could very well decrease in value.\n\nAll things considered, Bitcoin rewards are a great way to ease into the world of cryptocurrency. You can build a Bitcoin balance without needing to invest your own money.\n\nCOMPARE TOP PICKS: Best Crypto Credit Cards\n\nUnlimited 1.5% back\n\nThis card earns 1.5% back in Bitcoin when you make payments on your purchases. This is different from most rewards credit cards, which earn rewards when you make purchases. With an Upgrade card, you need to pay for a purchase first before earning rewards on it.\n\nUpgrade takes the cash value of your rewards and uses that to buy Bitcoin. For example, if you pay off a $100 purchase, it buys $1.50 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin purchase doesn't happen right away. After you make a payment, Upgrade will purchase the Bitcoin within one to two statement periods.\n\nNo card fees\n\nThere are no card fees to use the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card. That means:\n\nNo annual fee\n\nNo draw fee, including for purchases and direct deposits to a bank account\n\nNo foreign transaction fee\n\nNo prepayment penalty\n\nThere is a 1.5% transaction fee when you sell your Bitcoin rewards. Since that's the only way to use your rewards, this fee is unavoidable.\n\nREAD MORE: Best No Annual Fee Credit Cards\n\nFixed APR\n\nThis Bitcoin rewards card has a fixed APR (annual percentage rate). Credit cards normally have a variable APR that can change with interest rate trends. With Upgrade, your card's interest rate stays the same. Another nice thing about Upgrade is that it typically offers lower interest rates than credit card issuers.\n\nLEARN MORE: What Is APR?\n\nLenient approval requirements\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is intended for consumers with average to excellent credit. There aren't many rewards card options for fair/average credit, so if your score is in that range, this Upgrade card is a great choice.\n\nSend money to your bank account\n\nOne of the advantages the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card has over credit cards is that you can use it for cash, not just purchases. If you're ever in need of a loan, you won't need to apply with a lender. You can get a direct deposit to your bank account from your Upgrade card for no additional fees.\n\nIt's not so easy or cheap to get cash from a credit card. Although many credit cards allow you to get cash as a cash advance, it carries an additional fee, and the credit card issuer normally charges a higher interest rate.\n\nLEARN MORE: How Does a Credit Card Cash Advance Work?\n\nFixed payments\n\nAt the end of the billing cycle, Upgrade takes your card's balance and gives you a fixed monthly payment. By paying at least this amount, you'll have the balance paid off by the end of your draw length.\n\nThis is much different than credit cards, where you can make small minimum payments and your balance doesn't have a set end date. Some people prefer the structure that fixed payments provide. If you're one of them, then you'll probably like the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card."

If your answer to both questions is positive, then you should hurry to buy a cryptocurrency, say, Bitcoin. The Bitcoin rate should be much higher than what it is now.\n\nBitcoin Rate Will Grow A Lot\n\nKiyosaki thinks that \u201cfaith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed.\u201d He also called gold and silver \u201cthe money of the gods\u201d and the first cryptocurrency \u201ca dollar for the people.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder, in November 2022, when Bitcoin\u2019s rate was low, Kiyosaki reaffirmed his commitment to it. In other words, this author believes that Bitcoin will become one of the main currencies in the future.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin analyst Willy Wu predicts that the number of owners of the flagship cryptocurrency will increase over the next three years. He says that by 2026, more than one billion people will own Bitcoins. As a reference, now, there are more than 300 million people who own the digital gold around the world.\n\nAlso Read: To Compensate For Bitcoin Mining Damage, We Need To Plant 431.6 Million New Trees\n\nWilly Wu reminded his followers on Twitter that it took Bitcoin six months to build an audience from its first 1,000 users. It took another five years for this number to grow to 1 million. It took 13 years and 8 months after the formation of the genesis block to reach the current indicators.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\n\nWhen comparing with other tech bigwigs, the audience of PayPal is 430 million people, and Twitter\u2019s is 400 million. The crypto expert also believes that the lion\u2019s share of social network users are bots.\n\nThe CEO of the blockchain tech firm Blockstream, Adam Back, said that since 2013, the Bitcoin rate has doubled. So if this trend continues, in about nine years, the price of Bitcoin will reach $10 million by 2032. If so, its market capitalization will reach $200 trillion.\n\nBy the way, ChatGPT has predicted the Bitcoin rate to reach $50,000 in the next six months.\n\nBitcoin shows a minimal 2% increase compared to a day before.

        "content": "On-chain analysis revealed that BTC has the potential to rally to $42,000 before the year runs out.\n\nIn the meantime, coin distribution exceeds accumulation.\n\nCurrently trading at its September 2022 level, CryptoQuant analyst Oinonen_t has opined that Bitcoin [BTC] \u201chas a significant chance to reach its fair price of $42K this year.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oinonen_t, an assessment of two on-chain indicators, namely BTC\u2019s exchange stablecoins ratio (ESR) and exchange reserves, confirmed the potential for a further price increase.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe analyst noted that BTC\u2019s ESR has surpassed a technical inflection point and is diverging from the spot price, which is a positive sign.\n\nAdditionally, BTC\u2019s exchange reserves have been in a long-term downtrend, reflecting entities holding their assets off-exchange, which the analyst referred to as a \u201chealthy development\u201d for the market.\n\nThese factors, along with the approaching 2024 halving event, indicate that BTC is moving toward a new pre-halving accumulation cycle, Oinonen_t concluded.\n\nAlso sharing a similar belief in a continued rally in BTC\u2019s price, another CryptoQuant analyst operating under the pseudonym Yonsei_dent assessed BTC\u2019s Supply in Profit metric and found that the current market has passed the Bottom Discovery phase and entered the Transition phase, which often precedes a potential for a bull market.\n\nHe found further that BTC\u2019s Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) on a 400-day moving average has reached the previous cycle\u2019s low, suggesting that further declines are unlikely.\n\n\u201cCompared to the time of entry into the 2019 bull market, it seems a bull transition is in the process of passing through the bottom. However, in the case of the 2015-2016 Bottom, Supply in Profit (%) went down after entering the Transition phase, and the Bottom period became longer. Since aSOPR 400MA reached the previous cycle\u2019s low, further declines are unlikely. However, there is a concern that the current situation will be prolonged unless it changes to a positive (+) slope,\u201d Yonsei_dent noted, adding a caveat.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nStay at alert\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC\u2019s price decreased by almost 5% in the last week. At press time, the king coin exchanged hands at $21,885.\n\nA daily chart assessment of price movements revealed a significant decline in BTC accumulation in the last week. At 1.74 million at the time of writing, the coin\u2019s On-balance Volume (OBV) had declined by 1% since February began.\n\nA steady fall in an asset\u2019s OBV indicates that there is decreased buying pressure and increased selling pressure, suggesting that market participants are becoming more bearish on the asset. This can signify potential downward price movement, as there is less demand for the asset.\n\nThe position of BTC\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) confirmed where market sentiment rested. At negative -0.07 at press time, more investors took to distributing their BTC holdings rather than holding on to them. A continued downtrend in BTC\u2019s CMF might be followed by a price drawback. Hence, caution is advised."

        "content": "Australia-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Iris Energy has revealed it will nearly triple its mining capacity with the addition of thousands of mining rigs.\n\nOn Feb. 13 the firm said it purchased an additional 4.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) worth of Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro ASIC miners, bringing its self-mining capacity to 5.5 EH/s from 2.0 EH/s.\n\nBased on the S19j Pro\u2019s maximum hash rate of 100 terahashes per second (TH/s), the purchase adds an estimated 44,000 miners to its fleet, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s calculations.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Iris\u2019 co-founder and co-CEO, said the purchase \u201cis a significant milestone\u201d for the company, adding it has been a \u201cchallenging period for both the industry and markets more generally.\u201d\n\nIris said the new miners will be installed in the company\u2019s centers but did not mention in which locations.

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies That Are Down 33% to 71% and Ready to Pop - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market is back to its volatile old ways again. The relentless downtrend of 2022 gave way to some strong gains in January, but the market's general trend is headed sideways these days. The leading crypto names are up one week and down the next.\n\nThat being said, I am convinced that digital currencies will disrupt many industries over the next few years, from banking and financial services to online games and insurance. Therefore, I see this dip as a great time to separate the wheat from the chaff and pick up high-quality cryptocurrencies on the cheap.\n\nSo let's push through the throng of lesser lights and wannabes to find some top cryptocurrencies on fire sale in February 2023. The crypto names below are down by at least 33% over the last year. Still, they have some seriously valuable real-world use cases, and with a bit of patience, they're sure to regain their worth in the long run.\n\nBitcoin: The massive granddaddy\n\nLet's start with the digital elephant in the room. Bitcoin (BTC 1.56%) set the standard for what a cryptocurrency can be, and it remains the largest and most respected crypto name 14 years later.\n\nBitcoin's price is down 50% in the last 52 weeks but also up 38% from last year's rock bottom in November. Many experts agree that the long-term price target is far above today's modest price.\n\nFor example, noted growth investor Cathie Wood and her ARK Invest firm recently reminded investors that Bitcoin should be worth nearly $1.5 million per coin in the year 2030. The reason for that parabolic price gain is that Wood expects demand for Bitcoin to skyrocket while the lifetime supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoins. Nearly 92% of that limited supply has already been minted by Bitcoin miners, so there is not much room for inflation.\n\nAnd if you look to MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) chairman Michael Saylor, you'll get not a firm price target but a pretty solid analysis of what's next for the largest cryptocurrency. Over the next four to eight years, Saylor expects the regulatory framework around crypto to be straightened out, allowing large-scale institutional investors to get involved.\n\nBased on this projection, Saylor's MicroStrategy is going all-in on Bitcoin. The data analytics company has converted essentially all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin, taking out loans and selling stock in order to grab more digital tokens. The company even took out a $205 million loan from Silvergate Capital (SI), collateralized by some of MicroStrategy's existing Bitcoin holdings, for the sole purpose of purchasing another bunch of Bitcoins.\n\nWhether you call it \"skin in the game\" or \"bias,\" Saylor's company is voting with its wallet.\n\nThe company now holds approximately 132,500 Bitcoin tokens, worth roughly $2.88 billion at today's price. That's 55% of MicroStrategy's enterprise value and almost more than the company's current market cap. If Bitcoin goes bust in the future, so will MicroStrategy. But if it reaches Cathie Wood's 2030 target price, MicroStrategy's current tokens would be worth $196 billion (and I'm sure the company will buy more Bitcoin along the way).\n\nSo two smart people agree that Bitcoin has a bright future. They can still be wrong, and some other cryptocurrency might steal Bitcoin's thunder over the next few years, but it's not easy to disrupt a first mover with this much of a head start. The \"digital gold\" looks ready to live up to its nickname in the next few years, and this dip seems like a good time to pick up tokens at a low price.\n\nLitecoin: A more practical take on Bitcoin\n\nWhere Bitcoin goes, Litecoin (LTC -1.52%) will follow. Litecoin started out in 2011 as a tweaked clone of Bitcoin. Some of the key differences are:\n\nLitecoin generates new data blocks more often than Bitcoin does.\n\nAs a result, new transactions on the blockchain ledger are validated faster and with lower transaction fees.\n\nIts mining algorithm was explicitly chosen for its high processing rate using consumer-grade graphics cards instead of specially designed cryptomining chips.\n\nLitecoin's quick and cheap transactions make it more useful for everyday retail use than Bitcoin. It's like whipping out a quick-and-easy debit card instead of Bitcoin's proverbial gold nuggets. As a result, the smaller Litecoin community has drummed up payment support from more than 5,000 e-commerce stores and services. That's fewer than Bitcoin's 12,000 merchants but far ahead of most other altcoins.\n\nThe coin crashed hard last year, partly due to a controversial privacy upgrade known as Mimblewimble. The code change led to regulators banning Litecoin in markets like Thailand and South Korea. However, most of the crypto world is still comfortable with allowing Litecoin trades, and the coin is widely available on popular exchanges such as Coinbase Global and Robinhood Markets.\n\nThe South Korean panic did not trigger a wave of Litecoin bans in other markets, and investors are starting to relax those tightly bunched nerves. All told, the Litecoin token is down 33% over the last year and should see stellar returns from this low point.\n\nPolkadot: Knitting a Web3 fabric from other cryptos\n\nI can't end this list in good conscience without including Polkadot (DOT 3.88%). It's the cryptocurrency at the heart of the Web3 sea change, destined to soar as the next-generation version of the internet takes over from the mishmash of ad-supported social networks you see in the current Web 2.0 model.\n\nWith smart contracts, bankless peer-to-peer value-exchange transactions, and transparent content-publishing systems, Web3 is ready to turn the online publishing and e-commerce worlds upside down. As the official blockchain network of the Web3 Foundation, giving developers easy ways to tie the strengths of many different cryptocurrencies and blockchains into a cohesive application, Polkadot will surely gain boatloads of value as the revolution plays out.\n\nYet the Polkadot token's price is down by 70% in 52 weeks. It is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of $7.06 billion, just ahead of Litecoin at $6.56 billion but far behind Bitcoin's dominant $419 billion footprint. Thanks to Polkadot's special and uniquely useful place in the Web3 ecosystem, I expect the token to start rubbing shoulders with Bitcoin and friends over the next couple of years. The opportunity for outsized growth is too obvious to ignore, and I take every chance I get to help you see it.\n\nSo if I could suggest only one cryptocurrency in today's market, my choice would depend on what you want your investment to achieve.\n\nBitcoin is the safe-as-houses (in a digital sense) bet on long-term value storage.\n\nLitecoin is more of a digital dollar, to be used in everyday shopping transactions -- more liquid but perhaps more volatile in the long run.\n\nAnd Polkadot plays a completely different game, serving up a brand-new vision of what the internet can be.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've been holding on to my Litecoin and Bitcoin lately while buying several batches of additional Polkadot. I can't wait for Web3 systems to go mainstream in a big way, so I'm doing what I can to take advantage of that upcoming metamorphosis."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe sudden and explosive rise of Bitcoin NFTs via the new Ordinals project has sparked plenty of creativity from Web3 builders. Chainspace is one of the most vibrant examples to date\u2014an experimental art project that connects Bitcoin and Ethereum through a lo-fi video rendering app that\u2019s tied to both chains.\n\nThe project spans 800 total on-chain apps, each a unique portal that pseudonymous co-creators Timshel and el-ranye describe as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d Put simply, each web app\u2014which lives entirely in an Ordinals inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014is like a Snapchat filter that manipulates the image coming from your computer or device camera.\n\nEssentially, it takes your detailed selfie cam footage and renders it like old-school ASCII art, using letters and symbols to depict your real-time video view in a more abstract, stylized manner. Each Chainspace portal gives a different effect, and some are inspired by the look and vibe of notable Web3 projects like Loot and Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project \u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf \ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e inscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi will be minting via @ourzora mega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nTimshel, who\u2019s a key figure in the emerging \u201cLootverse\u201d gaming community and involved in on-chain publishing efforts, told Decrypt that Chainspace provides a way for Web3 users to share a bit of their humanity with communities without fully doxxing themselves. Timshel showcased Chainspace-derived screenshots that users shared in the project\u2019s Discord.\n\n\u201cThis is beautiful because this \u2018GM\u2019 is much more essential and resonant and human than [a] random Pepe emoji,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cThere's something really cool and special to see how people are using this, sharing their feelings, their selves, and their faces.\u201d\n\nThe NFT or inscription is not an \u201caccess pass\u201d to an experience hosted elsewhere. Because Ordinals can hold a lot more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, the complete web app is inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain as a digital artifact. Each Chainspace portal exists as its own unique Ordinals inscription that can be transferred between owners.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals innovation, and the idea of inscribing up to now 4MB of content onto a single Satoshi on Bitcoin\u2014it just immediately clicked to me,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cIt opened up a whole blossom of ideas in my head about things you can do that are higher fidelity than what's possible on ETH, but still create a token on ETH that's tradable and ownable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross chains\n\nHis comment hints at the Ethereum component of the Chainspace equation, but there are layers to it. Thursday\u2019s NFT mint will actually take place on Ethereum, with each portal represented by an Ethereum NFT that can be minted through Zora and traded through major marketplaces.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT is connected to the Bitcoin-based Ordinal on-chain through a smart contract\u2014which holds the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT projects\u2014developed by Zora software engineer Iain Nash. The Ethereum NFT artwork you see on a marketplace like OpenSea is actually a screenshot generated from the Ordinal inscription.\n\nBut they\u2019re also paired in the sense that the NFT buyers can choose to trade in the Ethereum version and take custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal instead. Right now, that requires a manual process that Timshel and el-ranye can handle, but they aim to make it an easier, automated process as more and more Ordinals infrastructure comes online.\n\nAs such, Timshel describes Chainspace as being \u201c200% on-chains\u201d\u2014yes, plural\u2014since there\u2019s a part of the experience on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they\u2019re intertwined.\n\nBut the swap of the Ethereum NFT for custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal is a one-way process; they won\u2019t let users swap back and forth or hold both versions at the same time. He also cautioned that the ability to swap is dependent in part on the status of Ordinals, a fast-evolving space that has proven contentious to some Bitcoin aficionados. It\u2019s all an experiment for now.\n\nChainspace portals are publicly accessible, again reinforcing the idea that NFT owners are not buying an exclusive access pass. Anyone can use one of the portals and capture a still image from the manipulated video feed, and then they can do whatever they want with those\u2014share them through social media, mint them on-chain, generate derivative art, etc.\n\nThey\u2019ll put 620 of the NFTs on sale on Thursday, with an allowlist of active Discord users\u2014people who have already shared their Chainspace screenshots and creations\u2014able to mint one of the Ethereum NFTs for 0.33 ETH (about $550). Another 100 NFTs will be airdropped to Web3 builders who helped or influenced the project, with 60 NFTs reserved for the team.\n\nAnother 20 Chainspace apps, called X-portals, will have no Ethereum NFT counterpart and will live exclusively on Bitcoin. Those will be reserved for future auctions, as well as for the community around Ethereum NFT art project, Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Smashed penny\u2019\n\nGiven that they\u2019re publicly accessible, why would someone want to buy and own a Chainspace portal that isn\u2019t exclusively available to them? It doesn\u2019t come with any future promised utility or benefits, for example. A handful of the portals are available to play with via the project\u2019s website, while others can be accessed via each Ordinal\u2019s own page.\n\nTimshel cited the growing buzz around Ordinals and early on-chain inscriptions, and bets that people excited about on-chain media and Web3 experiments will want to own a portal. He likened it to public art installations that are open to all but ultimately still owned by someone, and compared an inscribed Satoshi to a souvenir flattened penny from an amusement park.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane. Experimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 - in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nAlready, they\u2019re seeing people turn Chainspace still images into derivative projects, such as Ethereum NFTs of screenshots of hand gestures or AI-assisted generative interpretations. People are free to do what they want with the portals, even if they don\u2019t own them.\n\nBut ultimately, the goal is to explore new frontiers in experimental on-chain art tools while giving each user a totally unique experience. It loops back to the phrase that the co-creators have been using since the project was unveiled last week: \u201cYou are the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery portal is public and inscribed on Bitcoin for anybody to render, forever. But every viewing is a private one-of-one,\u201d Timshel explained. \u201cI don't think there ever will be another time where somebody's pixels and Chainspace look exactly like what's on my screen right now. It\u2019d be like finding a grain of sand in the universe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

The company explained that inscribing NFTs through its software involves \u201cno need to run a node, complex software, or anything else,\u201d merely some Bitcoin to pay a transaction fee, which can be bought directly through the app.\n\nInscriptions are made via Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that rolled out \u201cno-code ordinal inscriptions\u201d last week. According to Xverse, roughly 5% of Bitcoin inscriptions so far have been made using Gamma\u2019s tool.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter uploading an image and sending a transaction to their provided Ordinals address, users can find their inscriptions inside their Xverse NFT collection within 20 to 30 minutes\u2014and embedded in the blockchain forever.\n\nThis comes just a day after Hiro, another Bitcoin focused Web3 wallet, rolled out inscriptions to its testnet on Tuesday. Both wallets interact with Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d blockchain with its own NFT economy that settles its transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nXverse, too, lets Bitcoin users interact with Stacks, with plans to introduce instant payments via the lightning network.\n\nBitcoin recently logged its 100,000th Ordinals transaction, continuing a trend of exponential growth. Given that NFTs on Bitcoin were not a feature envisioned by its original developers, their existence has naturally sparked controversy, with many people unsure of whether they will hurt or help the network.\n\nStacks co-creator Muneeb Ali said he welcomes the new protocol, stating that it marks a \u201cnew chapter in Bitcoin history\u201d on Tuesday. The following day, he said that Xverse\u2019s Bitcoin wallet now has the \u201ceasiest on-ramp to ordinals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKen Liao, the founder and CEO of Xverse wallet (aka Secret Key Labs), said that the ability to send out one\u2019s ordinal from the wallet will be available soon.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), once explained why he believed the digital currency was unlikely to fail in comparison to previous similar products.\n\nHis explanation, posted on the Nakamoto Institute website exactly 14 years ago today, outlines the unique features he envisioned would set Bitcoin apart from earlier attempts at creating digital currencies.\n\nSatoshi acknowledged that many people dismissed \u2018e-currency as a lost cause\u2019 because of the failures of centralized systems in the 1990s, arguing that they were centrally controlled, an aspect that doomed them to failure. In contrast, he believed Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized, non-trust-based system makes it more resilient to failure.\n\n\u201cA lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990\u2019s. I hope it\u2019s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we\u2019re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system,\u201d Satoshi wrote.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s plan\n\nNotably, the quote by Nakamoto has gained prominence in the crypto circles as it highlighted the anonymous creator\u2019s plan to establish a system that can act as an alternative to traditional finance.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, Nakamoto was also involved in Bitcoin transactions. In particular, 14 years ago, the first Bitcoin transaction was initiated by Nakamoto, who acted as the sender.\n\nThe transaction on January 12, 2009 saw Nakamoto transfer 10 BTC to computer scientist Hal Finney, the first-ever recipient on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn line with Satoshi\u2019s projection, Bitcoin has evolved to become a global phenomenon at one point, controlling a market cap of about $1 trillion. Indeed, Bitcoin\u2019s features have made it an attractive alternative to traditional currencies and payment systems while getting use cases such as an investment product, or more recently, also offering DeFi utility.\n\nWith that being said, Bitcoin\u2019s journey has been hampered by various obstacles, including regulatory uncertainty and high price volatility. However, the asset has still managed to stand out among the best-performing assets over the past decade."

        "title": "Public mining companies boost Bitcoin production and hash rate in January - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nA recent analysis by Hashrate Index has shown that the first production update for 2023 from publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies reveals an upward trend in their hash rate and a significant increase in their production of BTC compared to the previous month.\n\n\n\nMost public miners raised their production of Bitcoin in January, with CleanSpark leading the way with a 50 percent increase and a record production of 697 Bitcoins. The biggest producer of BTC was Core Scientific, who mined 1,527 coins in January, followed closely by Riot, who produced 740 Bitcoins in the same period.\n\nMarathon and Cipher have experienced substantial growth in their production of Bitcoin, with 687 and 343 Bitcoins produced, respectively, compared to their previous month's production of 475 and 225 Bitcoins in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Jaran Mellerud, a Bitcoin mining analyst, the favourable weather conditions in January, and stable electricity prices played a role in the increase of production by miners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud explained that a winter storm in December affected North America and led to high electricity prices, which forced many mining companies to reduce their operations. However, with the improved weather in January, the electricity prices stabilised, allowing the miners to maintain higher levels of operation and produce more Bitcoins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hash rate of most public miners increased in January, but the pace of increase was slower than anticipated. The only exception was Cipher, a Texas-based company, which significantly increased its hash rate by over 50 percent to 4.3 EH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud noted that Cipher has been working hard during the current bear market, and he predicts that the company will reach its target of 6 EH/s of self-mining capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanSpark also increased its hash rate to 6.6 EH/s, up from 6.2 EH/s in December, due to a number of acquisitions made in late 2022. Hive also showed growth in January, with its hash rate rising nearly 30 percent from 2.1 to 2.7 EH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud explained that Hive is continuously replacing its GPU fleet with ASICs, particularly with its in-house designed Buzzminers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Scientific also saw an increase in its hash rate, reaching 17 EH/s in January from 15.7 in December. However, the company's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings are expected to have an effect on these figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proceedings include an agreement with the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) to pay off a debt of $38.6 million by transferring over 27,000 mining machines used as collateral, which represents 18 percent of Core Scientific's rigs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

Because Ordinals lack smart contract support and programmability, many in the Stacks community see its rise as an overall benefit to Bitcoin sidechain developers.\n\n\"There's a lot of limit to how much data you can put in an Ordinal store, and that's really where we see Stacks is going to come in and really expand,\" Miller said, adding that Ordinals has proven that there's massive demand to be able to use NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals is also still in its early stages, and lacks several key features for long-term growth. These include a seamless way to inscribe Ordinals without the need to sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain, marketplaces to buy and sell digital artifacts, and wallets that allow collectors to see their Ordinals\u2014something Hiro and other developers are working furiously to launch.\n\nWe\u2019ve begun rolling out support to Hiro Wallet for Bitcoin, NFTs and Ordinals for a truly cross-protocol Bitcoin Web3 experience. https://t.co/OAVriTraFq \ud83e\uddf5 A thread with details\u2026 #bitcoin #web3 #stx #nfts #ordinals pic.twitter.com/SiWrIluFhk \u2014 Mark Hendrickson | mark.btc | Hiro Wallet (@markymark) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cThe Stacks community have been saying for so long that things should be getting built on Bitcoin,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cBecause it is the most trusted thing that\u2019s been around the longest, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nDespite the excitement around Ordinals, Miller did acknowledge that the Bitcoin blockchain was not meant to be used this way, noting the lack of programmability of the blockchain, as opposed to Ethereum, which has programmability built in.\n\nEthereum NFTs are still early in their lifecycle as well, Miller notes, and says he does not see Ordinals as a challenge to Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the NFT space. However, he does say that the on-chain data storage will make the Bitcoin blockchain a popular place to inscribe important information like deeds, real estate transactions, or government documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that [Ordinals] are going to be a one-for-one replacement for Ethereum NFTs,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t think the fact that they\u2019re different is going to be an imposition for it\u2014I think it\u2019s going to be an asset.\u201d"

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the famous book \u201cRich Father Poor Father,\u201d shared in a tweet his prediction that they see Bitcoin at $500,000 by 2025, due to a giant collapse coming that will put the Fed in trouble.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki\u2019s Bitcoin prediction: $500,000 by 2025 because of the Fed\n\nBusinessman Robert Kiyosaki launched his financial prediction on the social network of crypto-lovers, indicating that Bitcoin will come to be worth $500,000 because of the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nGiant crash coming. Depression possible. Fed forced to print billions in fake money. By 2025 gold at $5,000 silver at $500 and Bitcoin at $500,000. Why? Because faith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed. Gold & Silver Gods money. Bitcoin people\u2019s $. Take care. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 13, 2023\n\nIn essence, Kiyosaki predicts that the Fed will be forced to print trillions of fake dollars to deal with a gigantic coming crash and that this will destroy faith in the US dollar.\n\nTo survive over time will be those who take refuge in gold, silver and Bitcoin. That is why by 2025, Kiyosaki predicts BTC at $500,000, gold at $5,000 and silver at $500.\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s predictions that have come true\n\nKiyosaki has also become famous on the globe thanks to his \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d manual that has become a best seller in finance for more than six consecutive years.\n\nIn this regard, from the moment he decided to enter the crypto world, he has been studying the market with his analysis, sharing his predictions before.\n\nThe last one was shared in May 2022, when BTC had just touched $29,000. Even at that time, Kiyosaki predicted that the crypto queen would begin its descent, reaching a low around $11,000 to $9,000.\n\nAgain, the entrepreneurial economist had cited the behavior of the Fed, which failed to understand the rise in inflation that was already occurring at that time.\n\nIn any case, Kiyosaki\u2019s prediction was not entirely wrong. On the contrary, Bitcoin has been falling in price since that May 2022, hitting its low of $15,000 in November, just after the collapse of the FTX crypto-exchange.\n\nHence, it was neither $11,000 nor $9,000, but yes the predicted drastic drop in BTC\u2019s price from $29,000 to $15,000 did occur.\n\nThe latest news on BTC\n\nRecently, Bitcoin has been mentioned in several countries and projects. Among many, there is the case of Russia rumored to be ready for the legal use of BTC and mining.\n\nEven Dubai, already pro-bitcoin, appears to have seen the introduction of a new school that will be able to accept BTC and ETH for payment of its fees.\n\nNot only that, famous Bitcoin influencer Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has launched an online summer internship on open source development on the Bitcoin protocol at his Saylor Academy.\n\nThe project is called Saylor Academy\u2019s Summer of Bitcoin, and is an initiative of the Constitution Foundation, founded by Michael Saylor in 2008, even before Bitcoin was born"

        "content": "Bitcoin today made headlines for something that has never happened before: it experienced its first \u201cDeath Cross\u201d on the weekly chart.\n\nWhat is the Death Cross and what does it mean for Bitcoin?\n\nIn technical analysis, a Death Cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average, signaling a potential change in trend.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the 50-week moving average crossed the 200-week moving average downward, triggering the Death Cross.\n\nThe Death Cross is considered by many traders and analysts to be a bearish signal, indicating a potential decline in the price of the asset. This is because the crossing of the moving averages suggests that the recent price decline is not just a short-term fluctuation, but rather a long-term trend reversal.\n\nIt is important to note that the Death Cross is not an infallible indicator and that other factors can influence the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Death Cross is not unique to Bitcoin and has been observed in other financial markets, including stocks, commodities, and forex.\n\nIndeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the stock market experienced a Death Cross in March 2020, during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, the Death Cross on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart is significant because of the growing interest in cryptocurrency and its impact on the broader financial landscape.\n\nBitcoin has had a turbulent history, with its value fluctuating wildly over the years.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created in 2009 as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies and gained popularity among early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\n\nAttention of the general public\n\nHowever, it was not until Bitcoin\u2019s 2017 bull run that it came to the attention of the general public, reaching an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December of that year.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has experienced several booms and busts, with notable increases and decreases in value.\n\nIn 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s value plummeted along with the rest of the financial markets during the pandemic-induced recession, but rebounded stronger than ever in 2021, reaching an all-time high of more than $64,000 in April.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin\u2019s value has trended downward, with the cryptocurrency losing more than half its value in just a few months.\n\nThe so-called \u201cdeath cross\u201d on the weekly chart is seen as a sign that this downward trend may continue, and many analysts predict further declines in the coming weeks and months.\n\nBitcoin still on a downward trend?\n\nThere are several factors that could be contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline. A major driver of Bitcoin\u2019s value is investor sentiment, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent volatility and regulatory restrictions have caused some investors to lose confidence in the asset.\n\nIn addition, concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining have led to increased scrutiny and criticism of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline may not be all bad. The cryptocurrency has always been known for its volatility, and its recent decline could be seen as a correction after a period of excessive growth.\n\nIn addition, many long-term investors and supporters of Bitcoin see the recent decline as an opportunity to buy the asset at a lower price.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline is not necessarily indicative of the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term potential. Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade, and its value has continued to rise over the years despite the many challenges it has faced.\n\nBitcoin death cross\n\nThe Death Cross on the weekly chart is just one data point in a complex and dynamic ecosystem, and it is important to consider other factors when assessing Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nWe can therefore infer that the recent Death Cross on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart represented a significant development for the cryptocurrency. Highlighting the potential change in its long-term trend.\n\nEven though this bearish signal has caused concern among some investors and analysts, it is important to remember that the Death Cross is just one of many data points in a complex and evolving ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin has faced numerous challenges throughout its history, but has continued to grow and evolve as a viable alternative to traditional currencies.\n\nWhile its recent decline has prompted criticism and skepticism. It is important to recognize that volatility and corrections are natural components of any financial market and can provide opportunities for long-term investors.\n\nAs the world continues to face challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. The role of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may become even more significant in the years ahead.\n\nAlthough the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, it is clear that it will continue to be a topic of discussion and debate among investors, analysts, and enthusiasts for years to come."

        "content": "GoingParabolic, the owner of BAYC 1626, one of the most valuable Bored Ape NFTs, inscribed his BAYC on Bitcoin using TeleBurn, a creator platform for making Bitcoin NFTs using ordinals.\n\nThe NFT in question last sold for 105 ETH, or approximately $432,000 at the time, in November 2022. At the press time, the NFT is worth roughly $165,000, according to OpenSea.\n\nThe Rowdy owner argued the NFT community is moving to Bitcoin, where ordinals have brought true scarcity to collectibles. GoingParabolic claimed they had \u201cburned\u201d the NFT off Ethereum by removing it from circulation and transferring it to a unique \u2018burn address.\u2019\n\nGoingParabolic asserted that their Bitcoin NFT is legitimate because the inscription points to a unique burn location.\n\nHowever, despite the owner\u2019s claims, Crypto Twitter, including Yuga Labs\u2019 co-founder, had mixed reactions to the owner\u2019s feat. Founders and native users debated the legitimacy of the unconventional mechanism.\n\nAs symbolic as it may be, the experiment has spotlighted Bitcoin NFTs and the ambiguity of burning mechanisms and NFT licensing, leading to more questions than answers."

        "title": "Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2030: How will upcoming halving affect BTC performance? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Experts in the cryptocurrency market are attempting to predict where Bitcoin (BTC) will go in the next months and years, especially as the leading digital asset has climbed back above the the $20,000 psychological threshold since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe next halving event for the flagship digital currency is scheduled for 2024 and is one of the events that might dramatically \u2018push\u2019 the price of Bitcoin, according to many experts and proponents, which could have a considerable impact.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fourth halving event, or the fourth protocol-designed 50% reduction in block rewards happens every 210,000 blocks or around every four years. By estimation, the next halving event will occur around May 4, 2024, when Bitcoin reaches 840,000 blocks.\n\nWhy investors are bullish for the next Bitcoin halving\n\nFollowing the third halving event on May 11, 2020, miners have been paid 6.25 Bitcoins for each Bitcoin block mined. With an average of 144 blocks generated every 24 hours, this equates to roughly 900 Bitcoin being issued and rewarded every day.\n\nBy design of the Bitcoin blockchain, this reward will be \u201chalved\u201d and reduced to 3.125 BTC per block at the fourth halving event. If the average number of blocks mined each day stays around the same, then about 450 BTC will be created each day.\n\nWhen attempting to forecast how Bitcoin\u2019s price will move in the future, history may be a valuable tool for determining the future direction of prices, which is particularly true when taking into account the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s value has increased by almost 1,000 times since the initial halving.\n\nIn this line, Finbold analyzed industry experts on their Bitcoin outlook and fundamentals likely to define the asset\u2019s performance looking to 2025 and beyond.\n\n21 million BTC\n\nWith the mining of block \u2018730002\u2019 by SBI Crypto on April 1, 2022, it became evident that just 2 million BTC (out of a total of 21 million) remained to be issued. In turn, price increases may occur as a natural outcome of decreased supply and increased demand.\n\nAt the same time, positive developments, such as payment giant VISA (NYSE: V) partnering with leading crypto payments platform Wirex to launch crypto-enabled debit and prepaid cards for Bitcoin and other cryptos in more than 40 countries, are expected to have a positive impact on digital asset prices in the future.\n\nBitcoin halving to pump BTC price\n\nRenowned pseudonymous crypto trading expert PlanB announced back in October that \u201cthe next Bitcoin halving is coming, and IMO it will (again) pump BTC,\u201d while posting the chart analysis of the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset\u2019s previous price movements and future predictions.\n\nThe chart adheres to a stock-to-flow (S2F) live model, which employs the concept of scarcity in order to measure Bitcoin\u2019s worth and speculate on its potential future price. After Bitcoin\u2019s third halving event in May 2020, the chart model advocated by PlanB has received a significant amount of attention from many sources.\n\nPlanB expects Bitcoin to pump after halving. Source: PlanB\n\nPlanB\u2019s forecast is consistent with that of cryptocurrency trader and analyst Josh Rager, who has predicted a massive Bitcoin surge after the halving in 2024. Rager has said that \u201cthe real party won\u2019t start until 2024.\u201d\n\nReminder that Bitcoin likely ranges for the next year\n\n\n\nThe real party won't start until 2024 post Bitcoin halving\n\n\n\nThere will be some nice opportunities before with both Bitcoin and alts from bounces\n\n\n\nStay vigilant and take the market week by weekhttps://t.co/kQuXqckwDC \u2014 Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Rager) September 14, 2022\n\nThe analyst was referring to his tweet on August 25 in which he predicted Bitcoin\u2019s growth trajectory after the halving events will be replicated in the 2024 surge.\n\nWhy do these predictions matter?\n\nAfter a halving occurrence, prices tend to rise steadily and significantly over the following years, reaching a high about a year and a half later. In the event that the same thing takes place with the subsequent one, this would be good news for Bitcoin investors.\n\nInterestingly, the above analysis goes in hand with the predictions of Bloomberg\u2019s senior commodity expert Mike McGlone, who earlier said at the end of January that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 sometime around the next halving or by 2025.\n\nMcGlone keeps his well-known optimistic attitude for the long term, previously stating that Bitcoin could outperform gold as its top competitor in the future. According to him:\n\n\u201cI fully expect Bitcoin in the next couple of years, by probably around the halving, maybe 2025, to get to $100,000.\u201d\n\nBTC price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $22,117, as it looks to hold support above the $22,000 price level on February 15. The total market capitalization is $420.8 billion, with a $20.7 billion trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBitcoin\u2019s technical analysis on TradingView is primarily bearish, with the summary aligning with the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at nine while moving averages are for the \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 8. Oscillators are pointing at \u2018neutral\u2019 with 8.\n\n1-month Bitcoin gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite the dip in price in February, it is worth noting that one of Bitcoin\u2019s key technical indicators, the Rainbow relative strength index (RSI), had turned green for the first time on February 12 after an extended correction, suggesting long-term bullish momentum.\n\nPrice prediction 2025\n\nNotably, Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 Kiyosaki labeled Bitcoin one of the three \u201chottest subjects on earth\u201d alongside silver and gold, predicting BTC to reach $500,000 by 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in an exclusive industry report by Finbold where experts weighed in on what to expect for Bitcoin in 2023, Stefan Ristic, a crypto miner running BitcoinMiningSoftware.com, expects Bitcoin halving in 2024 to act as a major catalyst for a possible bull run in late 2024 to 2025.\n\nPrice prediction 2030\n\nAs per the average price prediction provided by Finder\u2019s panel of fintech specialists in their January 2023 report, they predict BTC will hit $77,492 by 2025 and $188,451 by 2030.\n\nBitcoin 2025 and 2030 price predictions. Source: Finder\n\nThere are those in the cryptocurrency industry that are optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s valuation in 2030. The Winklevoss twins, who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, predict that Bitcoin\u2019s value will reach $500,000 by 2030. According to the brothers, the flagship cryptocurrency will replace gold as the store of value.\n\nAccording to NDAX CEO Bilal Hammoud, Bitcoin\u2019s price will reach $500,000 by 2030. He thinks that the aim may be set higher, but he forecasts that increasing interest rate rises will affect the trajectory.\n\nLastly, Finbold asked ChatGPT to share Bitcoin\u2019s possible price by 2030 based on various metrics, such as traditional price movement, and technical analysis, amongst others.\n\nIn light of the considerable market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, the tool concedes that it is difficult to estimate the price of Bitcoin in the long term. The AI-based platform, however, argues that Bitcoin still has the capacity to grow in the years ahead due to developing markets and widespread acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cAs the cryptocurrency market matures and more people become aware of the potential of digital currencies, Bitcoin will likely become more widely accepted, and its value will continue to rise,\u201d said ChatGPT.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is still anticipated to rise, as shown by the price estimates provided by the aforementioned experts and observers, which provides investors with a cause to keep their confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin has remained one of the most popular choices for long-term investments in the cryptocurrency market, even though its price is subject to significant swings due to its high degree of volatility.\n\nTaking into consideration that no one can predict with absolute certainty where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will end up by the end of this year, it is even more difficult to make predictions about the next seven years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Top 10 Ways to Make Money with Cryptocurrency in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The top ways to make money with Cryptocurrency in 2023 are mainly from investing, trading, and staking\n\nIntro: Cryptocurrency has been around for more than a decade and is rapidly becoming a popular way to make money online. The cryptocurrency market is extremely lucrative. There are numerous ways to make money in cryptocurrency, ranging from investing to active trading to staking.\n\nCryptocurrency is a decentralized payment method that can be used to conduct online transactions. The market, on the other hand, is flooded with the top cryptocurrencies to invest in, ranging from the well-known Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. With the recent increase in the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, an increasing number of people are seeking ways to profit from this new digital asset. The blockchain is the digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions. Transactions are processed on a blockchain network comprised of thousands of machines, and owners can earn cryptocurrencies in exchange for the efforts of these machines.\n\nHere are top 10 Ways to make money with Cryptocurrency in 2023:\n\n1. Investing\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is an excellent way to profit from it. You can buy individual coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or you can buy a cryptocurrency index fund. This is an excellent method for diversifying your portfolio and spreading your risk. When investing in cryptocurrency, make it a point to thoroughly research and comprehend the risks involved.\n\n2. Lending\n\nAnother way to monetize cryptocurrency is through lending. It entails lending your cryptocurrency to another person in exchange for interest. The interest rate you receive will be determined by the type of cryptocurrency you lend and the amount you lend. There are different types of lending platforms such as Decentralised lending platforms (DLP), Centralized, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending.\n\n3. Trading\n\nInvesting is a long-term endeavour based on a buy-and-hold strategy, whereas trading takes advantage of short-term opportunities. The cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. In a nutshell, asset prices can rise or fall dramatically in a short period of time. To be a successful trader, you must have strong technical and analytical skills.\n\nAnother way to make money is by trading cryptocurrency pairs such as BTC USDT based on market trends and technical analysis. This involves studying charts and using indicators to predict future price movements.\n\n4. Mining\n\nMining is the most common way to make money with cryptocurrency. Mining validates blockchain transactions and adds new data blocks to the chain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency as a result of their efforts. Mining can be done with either specialised hardware or cloud mining services. Cloud mining does not require the purchase or maintenance of hardware, but the rewards are typically lower than with hardware mining.\n\n5. Staking\n\nCrypto staking is a method of investing in cryptocurrency that entails keeping a set number of coins in your wallet for a set period of time. As a result, your crypto investments can generate passive income. The amount of interest you can earn is determined by the cryptocurrency and the number of coins you stake.\n\n6. Traditional Buy and Hold\n\nGetting crypto assets of choice from a crypto exchange and purchasing more when prices drop traditionally are called \u201cBuying the dip\u201d. The asset may be sold months or years later at a significant overall profit compared to the purchase price. Coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin rise and fall on a daily basis. Because of the hype, new coins like Chia are more likely to debut at a higher price. It later loses value and takes a long time to recover.\n\n7. Earning Interest\n\nCryptocurrency can help you earn interest on your investments. It is accomplished through a \u201cyield farming process,\u201d in which you lend your cryptocurrency to a platform in exchange for interest. While potentially risky, yield farming can be a great source of passive income. The amount of interest you earn is solely determined by the platform and the type of cryptocurrency you lend.\n\n8. Affiliate Programs\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges have affiliate programmes that allow to earn commissions on customers you refer. This is an excellent way to profit from cryptocurrency without having to engage in any trading or investing. Affiliate programmes can be extremely competitive.\n\n9. Dividends\n\nDividends are another way to make money with your crypto assets. If you\u2019re familiar with investing in stocks or bonds, you\u2019re probably aware of the concept of dividends. Dividends are small cash payments made to shareholders, to put it simply. If a company makes profits for a quarter, those profits are split and returned to the company\u2019s ownership (shareholders).\n\n10. Airdrops\n\nAirdrops are an excellent way for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to obtain free tokens without investing any money. Airdrops, unlike traditional sales and token launches, do not require users to make a deposit or spend any money upfront. Sharing project information on social media, joining an online community, or completing simple tasks like watching an educational video are examples of these steps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Investing in well-known cryptocurrencies is a popular method. Blue-chip cryptocurrencies are the most trustworthy investments since they typically generate profits during strong periods. Most blue chip companies are presently down by double digits, and it may only be a matter of time until they return to previous lofty heights.\n\nInvestments in cryptos might be dangerous, but they can also be profitable. For investors, stock investing continues to be the most secure and reliable alternative, while crypto investing remains the most rewarding. Despite the hazards, there are several advantages to utilising bitcoin. Superior security, simple transactions, and generous bonuses are just a few of the benefits. Keeping a broad variety of cryptocurrencies in one wallet may be helpful due to the distinct properties that each currency gives that will almost certainly benefit its users.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) The Trendsetter\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain in 2009, after maintaining a mining network for nearly two years. The coin debuted on a proof-of-work mechanism, ushering in an age of Decentralised Finance in which crypto tokens would control a substantial chunk of the global financial market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) began as a mined token, with users mining their tokens before it was made available for trade and exchange. The mining was consistent with its decentralisation goals since users had control over the token's fate. Although mining on mobile devices is no longer economical, specialised graphic processing processors like ASICs may still mine BTC. This has significantly limited the mining process to major firms.\n\nTo raise the crypto charts, BTC thrived on scarcity rather than protocol characteristics. Its key contribution to DeFi was the invention of anonymous, secure blockchain technology to improve user security and encourage global asset movement.\n\nBlockchains also keep track of every transaction that users carry out. The data are unidentifiable and can only be retrieved for security purposes. Each user has a private key, and public keys are produced for each transaction. The public keys serve as reference points for tracing transactions on the blockchain.\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin has constantly increased in the cryptocurrency market, trading for over $23,323.91 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe Dogetti (DETI) Family\n\nDogetti (DETI) is hoping to capitalise on the current positive market environment, as the developers are working on successful presale and launch stages to properly launch the token. The protocol is appealing, with hybrid characteristics that are rare for meme coins. The protocol represents the creators' dedication to the token's long-term viability.\n\nDogetti (DETI) will deploy its protocol on the Ethereum (ETH) network, expecting that the blockchain would offer the essential atmosphere for proper token development. The Dogetti (DETI) ecosystem includes an exchange platform, an NFT marketplace, and a DAO hierarchy, all of which are designed to let consumers make the most of their crypto experiences.\n\nThe exchange system will provide an opportunity for users on the Ethereum network to swap their assets from other token types to DETI for activities on the Dogetti platform. The DogettiSwap will also contribute to the increased demand for DETI tokens, raising its chances of attaining top spots on the crypto charts.\n\nLike every other network, the NFT marketplace in Dogetti (DETI) will be involved in intensive NFT trade. Both developers and users will be able to list NFTs, both singly and in collections, for sale to other users. The platform-derived NFTs will be typically pet-themed, although any form of multimedia can be used to generate NFTs.\n\nTo learn more about Dogetti (DETI) click below\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_"

        "content": "Follow us on Image Source : FREEPIK Bitcoin Makes a Comeback: Surpasses $22k\n\nCrypto News: As of February 14, Bitcoin, which is the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization, saw a rise of 1.56% and was trading at $22,075 . Meanwhile, Ethereum had a rise of 3.67% and was trading at approximately $1,550.92 .\n\nThe value of bitcoin (BTC) dropped approximately $100 and was trading at $21,770 as of press time. In addition, the Nasdaq 100 futures saw a slight decrease of 0.25%. Traders are closely monitoring the pace of inflation, which has remained high but has shown a decrease over the past few months.\n\nAlthough a continued decrease may allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to potentially pause its rate hike cycle, this morning's report suggests that additional efforts are necessary. At present, the market anticipates that the central bank will increase its benchmark Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points during its next two meetings (scheduled for March and May), followed by a pause.\n\nAs the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, there are bound to be bumps in the road. One recent example of this is the temporary halt of Paxos' issuance of Binance USD (BUSD) on February 14, 2023. This move was made in response to an order from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPaxos is a New York-based company that offers blockchain-based financial solutions, including stablecoins like BUSD. Binance USD is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, and it is one of the most popular stablecoins in the crypto world. It is used on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and other platforms.\n\nThe reason for the SEC's order is not yet clear, but it is likely related to concerns about the regulation of stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are pegged to the value of another asset, such as the US dollar or gold. They are designed to be stable and less volatile than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are trading as follows as of 9 am IST, 14 February 2023 :\n\nBitcoin: $22,273.25\n\n+1.47%\n\nEthereum: $1,573.74\n\n+3.17%\n\nTether: $1.02\n\n-0.04%\n\nUSD Coin:$1.00\n\n-0.00%\n\nBNB: $299.46\n\n+1.70%\n\nXRP: $0.3848\n\n+3.39%\n\nDogecoin: $0.08711\n\n+5.23%\n\nCardano: $0.391\n\n+8.31%\n\nPolygon: $1.26\n\n+5.81%\n\nPolkadot: $6.27\n\n+1.41%\n\nTron: $0.06734\n\n+2.11%\n\nLitecoin: $96.91\n\n+5.50%\n\nShibu Inu: $0.00001294\n\n+3.47%\n\nSolana: $96.91\n\n+5.50%"

        "title": "Turn every smartphone into a Bitcoin hardware wallet using Secure Enclaves - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nWe use the secure enclaves of iOS and Android devices to store Bitcoin private keys. The keys never leave the enclaves, providing same security as hardware wallets. This essentially turns billions of smartphones into secure Bitcoin hardware wallets. Users can authorize Bitcoin transactions using FaceID and TouchID.\n\nSecure Enclave\n\nThe Secure Enclave is a special chip in Android, iPhone, iPad and Macs to secure your biometrical data like FaceID and TouchID. The key feature of the Secure Enclave is that a private key generated on it cannot leave the chip, providing maximum security as in hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor.\n\nPrivate key in it can be used to sign messages securely. Messages are sent into the Secure Enclave, signed, and then the signature is returned. The private key during signing reside in the chip and is not stored in memory and thus is inaccessible from software. Permission to sign a transaction can be granted using a biometric authentication such as FaceID and TouchID.\n\nElliptic curve secp256r1\n\nThe Secure Enclave supports a single elliptic curve, secp256r1, also known as prime256 and P-256. It is different from the elliptic curve secp256k1 that\u2019s used for the popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBoth elliptic curves are of the form y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + ax + b.\n\nIn the secp256k1 curve, we have\n\na = 0\n\nb = 7\n\nand in the secp256r1 case we have\n\na = FFFFFFFF 00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFC\n\nb = 5AC635D8 AA3A93E7 B3EBBD55 769886BC 651D06B0 CC53B0F6 3BCE3C3E 27D2604B\n\nDue to the lack of native support of secp256r1, all cryptocurrency wallet apps today are using software signing, instead of hardware signing. Software signing is susceptible to side-channel attacks that leak information about the private key.\n\nImplementing secp256r1 on Bitcoin\n\nThanks to the expressiveness and scalability of Bitcoin smart contracts, we can implement secp256r1 efficiently, specifically ECDSA signature verification, at contract level. The signature is generated by the Secure Enclave, enjoying maximal security. We then verify the hardware signature in a smart contract. Note this does not require any breaking changes at the base layer, even though it uses a different curve.\n\nWe modified the ECDSA verification implementation released before, switching from curve secp256k1 to secp256r1. It basically implements the standard ECDSA verification algorithm.\n\nsecp256r1\n\nBackup\n\nTo be as secure as possible, the Secure Enclave disallow export keys, making it impossible to backup keys (different from hardware wallets with mnemonic words). If a smartphone is lost and damaged, the private key and the funds it controls are lost.\n\nOne solution is to create a 1 of 2 (or N) multisig wallet. One key can be generated offline and safely stored as in a cold wallet. The second key is generated inside the Secure Enclave. In case of phone loss or damage, the user can safely use their offline backup key to move the funds out of the wallet.\n\nPlease contact us if you are interested in building the first ever hardware-signing Bitcoin wallet. Some other types of hardware security modules (HSM), which hardware wallets belong to, like Smart Card also support elliptic curves, so they also act as Bitcoin wallets as well.\n\nWatch: Small Payments, Big Fun: Micropayments for Casual Games\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "DBS exchange sees Bitcoin trading volume jump 80% in 2022 despite crypto winter - The Straits Times",
        "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 DBS Group Holdings saw a surge in Bitcoin traded on its digital exchange in 2022 even as a crypto winter gripped the market amid a spate of high-profile company collapses, rising interest rates and lower risk appetite.\n\nSingapore\u2019s largest bank said on Wednesday that the amount of Bitcoin that changed hands on the DBS Digital Exchange jumped 80 per cent compared with 2021.\n\nBitcoin custodised, or stored securely, with the bank\u2019s digital asset custody solution also doubled in the same period.\n\nThis comes even as the world\u2019s largest digital coin by market capitalisation lost over 60 per cent of its value in 2022, while the wider crypto market shrunk by US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion).\n\nBitcoin traded at $29,475 as at 12.45pm on Wednesday \u2013 a far cry from its peak of over $90,000 in November 2021.\n\nDBS likely benefited from a flight to safety after the implosion of crypto darlings like hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.\n\nDBS Digital Exchange chief executive Lionel Lim said: \u201cWe believe that the market has decisively shifted its focus towards trust and stability, especially in the wake of multiple scandals that have rocked the industry.\n\n\u201cAs a regulated digital exchange backed by the DBS Group, we offer many unique advantages that investors have come to appreciate as they seek reliable gateways to access the digital asset economy.\u201d\n\nThe exchange\u2019s customer base doubled in 2022 and had close to 1,200 registered participants as at Dec 31.\n\nLaunched in December 2020, DBS Digital Exchange is a members-only exchange for institutional and accredited investors.\n\nThe bank said it did not observe any major sell-offs in 2022 and the exchange\u2019s customers had a net-buy position throughout the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a prudent and measured approach towards developing our digital asset ecosystem, choosing to keep pace with the market as it matures and as investors become more sophisticated,\u201d said Mr Lim.\n\nThe amount of Ether traded on the exchange also surged 65 per cent in 2022, while the amount custodised grew over 60 per cent.\n\nDBS holds all custodised digital assets separately within the bank using institutional-grade cold wallets, which are not connected to the Internet.\n\nThe exchange itself does not store any custodised assets, said the bank, adding that it checks the purity of all digital assets entering its custody.\n\nDBS has also been expanding its footprint in the digital assets space.\n\nIt said on Monday that it plans to apply for a licence that allows it to offer crypto trading services to Hong Kong customers as the city pushes to become a hub for digital assets."

        "title": "What do you think about Ordinals on the BITCOIN NETWORK? - Tekedia",
        "content": "Basically the ERC-721 standard on Bitcoin Network allows you to \u201cInscribe\u201d individual Satoshi\u2019s with data known as the Ordinals [Bitcoin NFTs]. Anyone still bullish on what this can do for BTC Adoption, will this new discovery taint the original digital P2P cash that Bitcoin started as, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s pretty wild what\u2019s going with the Ordinals trends in the Crypto and NFT space and its great to see builders building amazing blockchain infrastructures.\n\nSince this new meta launched weeks ago, Ordinals NFT transactions has been limited to spreadsheet OTC trading\u2014 due to a non availability of marketplace to process trades. Interestingly, Mark Hendrickson of the Hiro Wallet Project, announced on microblogging platform Twitter that; \u201cHiro Wallet has begun rolling out support for Bitcoin, and Ordinals for a truly cross-protocol Bitcoin Web3 experience.\u201d\n\nWith the new bridge, Extension users can send Bitcoin from their Hiro Wallet using the same Secret Key or Ledger device for managing their STX and other assets (such as BNS names and NFTs) across accounts. Send to all Bitcoin address types, with additional support for sending to BNS names coming soon.\n\nUsers can view their BTC holdings as stored on the account\u2019s Native SegWit address under \u201cBalances\u201d. They can also copy this address under \u201cReceive\u201d and soon reveal Taproot addresses for the deposit of Ordinal inscriptions (more on that below!). All inbound and outbound Bitcoin transactions appear within the \u201cActivity\u201d tab, alongside other Stacks activity such as contract executions and deployments. You can access this Bitcoin functionality now for testing by switching your network to \u201cTestnet\u201d with the latest version (v3.34.0) of the Hiro Wallet extension. Mainnet activation is expected soon later this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the fun is only getting started as we roll out expansive support for both Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions. By connecting Hiro Wallet to apps like Gamma, you\u2019ll be able to pay for new inscriptions and deposit them directly into your account as \u201cCollectibles\u201d Mark stated.\n\nThe simplest way to describe Ordinal Theory according to ChainLeft, an early advocate of Ordinal Theory \u2014 Is to track the provenance of fungible sats on Bitcoin and assign a \u201cnon-fungible\u201d value to them. It\u2019s up to the collectors to subscribe to accept this method and find value in it. Different methods to track provenance aren\u2019t new in Blockchain\u2019s.\n\nCounterparty (XCP) tracks provenance through linked UTXOs in transactions.\n\nNamecoin (NMC) tracks provenance through name identifiers.\n\nEthereum (ETH) tracks provenance through smart contracts\n\nOrdinals are actually \u201csats\u201d, not the images you see shared around. With ordinals, you could philosophically assign a \u201cnon-fungible\u201d value to technically fungible satoshis (1/100 millionth of a $BTC). Here\u2019s alpha: I think in the future these early sats will have a lot of value.\n\nIn a different twist, a closely followed crypto strategist is predicting a huge upside for one under-the-radar Ethereum (ETH) altcoin. Pseudonymous analyst Cantering Clark tells his 159,800 Twitter followers that he has his eye on Hashflow Token (HFT).\n\nThe last tickerless chart I shared did a 3x this week. I have been building a spot position in this one patiently because the setup is looking like it has quite a move ahead of it. 3 things in its favor. -New coin and new chart effect. -Not microcap but not overweight\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WODQXqA1Xl \u2014 HORSE (@TheFlowHorse) February 12, 2023\n\nThe last tickerless chart I shared did a 3x this week. I have been building a spot position in this one patiently because the setup is looking like it has quite a move ahead of it. Three things in its favor.\n\nNew coin and new chart effect.\n\nNot microcap but not overweight already.\n\nLow unit bias.\n\nAlthough, Cantering Clark initially shared a tickerless chart, he eventually unveiled the name of the low-cap altcoin on his radar. \u201cThis is not a microcap but smaller never the less so be mindful, but HFT looks like it is going to push much higher before what is probably a long corrective re-accumulation period. I am long.\u201d\n\nHashflow is the 262nd-ranked crypto asset with a market cap of $110.87 million. At time of writing, HFT is trading for $0.62, up more than 20% in the last 24 hours. Looking at the analyst\u2019s chart, he believes HFT could rally to as high as $1.02. The blockchain project recently announced a roadmap for 2023, which includes plans to launch the Hashverse, Hashflow\u2019s gamified, storyverse-driven decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows users to stake tokens, complete quests and earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHashflow is built on the Ethereum network for interoperability, zero slippage and miner extractable value (MEV)-protected trades. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) traditionally rely on automated market markers (AMMs) to enable on-demand trading of assets, but Hashflow uses a request-for-quote (RFQ) model that allows for professional market makers to manage liquidity pools. Next, Cantering Clark says a key price range for Bitcoin ($BTC) is around $22,200, where he notes that the king crypto could either find resistance or break through it with momentum.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
