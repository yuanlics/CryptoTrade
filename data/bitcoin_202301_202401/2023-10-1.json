        "title": "Ian Freeman of \u2018Crypto Six' sentenced to 8 years in NH bitcoin case - NBC Boston",
        "content": "A federal judge on Monday sentenced a New Hampshire man to eight years in prison for running an unlicensed bitcoin exchange business and fined him at least $40,000, although a hearing will be held to determine how much money multiple people who said they were victimized by his enterprise will get.\n\nIan Freeman, whose story was the subject of an episode of an NBC10 Boston docuseries titled \"The Crypto Six,\" was taken away in handcuffs following his sentencing in U.S. District Court in Concord. Prosecutors said Freeman, a libertarian activist and radio show host, created a business that catered to fraudsters who targeted elderly women with romance scams, serving as \u201cthe final step in permanently separating the victims from their money.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you, Ian,\u201d supporters shouted as he was led out of court.\n\nFreeman, who is in his 40s, said in court he did not believe he broke the law. He said he was trying to get people to adopt bitcoin. He said there were times he detected fraud and protected many potential scam victims. He apologized for not being able to help them all.\n\nGet Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston\u2019s newsletters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to be taken advantage of,\u201d said Freeman, who said he cooperated with law enforcement to help some people get their money back.\n\nFreeman said he devised a series of questions for customers, including whether a third party was putting them up to their transactions or if they were under duress. Some victims lied about their circumstances, he said. Freeman also said he didn\u2019t learn about scam victims until he saw their stories in the news.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how strict I was or how many questions I asked,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a two-week trial, he was convicted of eight charges in December, although his conviction on a money laundering charge was later overturned by the judge. The prosecution is appealing it to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nFreeman was sentenced on the remaining charges, which include operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. Freeman\u2019s lawyers said they planned to appeal and asked that he remain free on bail for now, but U.S. District Court Judge Joseph LaPlante didn\u2019t allow it.\n\n\u201cThere was real harm caused by his conduct,\u201d LaPlante said.\n\nThe sentencing guidelines called for much longer term, ranging from about 17 years to nearly 22 years in prison. Freeman, who doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record and has been monitored by the government for at least the last two years in Keene, where he lives, had asked for a sentence of a little over three years in prison.\n\nHis wife, Bonnie Freeman, said he was a positive role model and leader at a local church. Sheriff David Hathaway of Santa Cruz County, Arizona, described Freeman as an \u201cadvocate for freedom and the American dream\u201d and \u201cpromoting free trade capitalism and individual liberty.\u201d\n\nIt starts with an early morning raid by the FBI all caught on camera as the federal government cracked down on the group later dubbed \u201cThe Crypto Six.\u201d In this episode we breakdown the federal case against some Free Staters who were charged with wire fraud and money laundering but with a new twist\u2026 using cryptocurrency. Three members of the Crypto Six speak out about their federal indictment, including Ian Freeman, host of the talk show \u201cFree Talk Live\u201d, Aria DiMezzo, the high priestess of the Reformed Satanic Church of Keene and Nobody, the former Pope Indigent of the Church of the Invisible Hand.\n\nThe transactions were handled at bitcoin kiosks in bars, online and through an app.\n\nLast month, one of the victims described herself as a lonely widow who got scammed by a man she met on a dating site. At his instruction, she sent $300,000 to Freeman, wiping out her life\u2019s savings. Another woman told a similar story of taking out three loans and selling her late husband\u2019s truck to send money to the man who duped her.\n\nFive other people were arrested with Freeman in 2021. Three pleaded guilty to wire fraud for opening accounts at financial institutions in their names or in the names of churches to allow someone to use the accounts to sell virtual currency. They received light sentences. A fourth pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Charges were dismissed against the fifth person."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 3% to $27,921. The cryptocurrency traded above the $28,000 mark for much of the day, putting bitcoin at its highest level since Aug. 17, according to data from Coin Metrics. Ether briefly traded above $1,700 before giving back its gains on Monday afternoon.\n\nCrypto prices rallied on Monday, pushing bitcoin to its highest level in more than a month.\n\nThe catalyst for bitcoin's move was not immediately clear. There were several ether futures exchange-traded funds set to launch Monday, a possible positive sign for the crypto industry, which has been waiting to see whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a true bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nBitcoin has risen for four-straight weeks and is now up about 70% for the year. However, the digital currency is still more than 50% below its all-time highs.\n\nEven with the recent rally, trading volumes for bitcoin have been light, according to Citi strategist David Glass.\n\n\"Though the global crypto market cap has risen ~30% YTD, BTC volumes are struggling to sustain higher levels. Volumes (spot plus futures) have been trending lower since March, and currently sit ~57% below 2022 averages. \u2026 Separately, this year's crypto rally has also seen a rise in Bitcoin dominance \u2014 defined as Bitcoin's share of total crypto market cap \u2014 which has stabilized around 50%,\" Glass said in a note to clients Friday.\n\nEquities tied to crypto were also moving higher, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital each jumping more than 7% in premarket trading.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Explode in Value? 1 Key Metric to Watch - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When it comes to Bitcoin (BTC -1.61%), the conventional wisdom is that it is a risky, highly volatile asset prone to sharp price fluctuations. Indeed, for much of its history, Bitcoin has been characterized by very high volatility.\n\nBut that may be changing. Since April, Bitcoin's volatility has been on the decline. In fact, it touched historically low levels in late summer. Bitcoin's future price trajectory could depend on this metric, so let's take a closer look.\n\nBitcoin volatility\n\nBy just about any measure, Bitcoin's volatility (i.e., how much Bitcoin's price fluctuates within a given time period) is trending down and approaching all-time lows. This first became a phenomenon late last year when crypto traders began to complain that Bitcoin was becoming \"boring.\" Instead of seeing massive price swings daily, the price of Bitcoin seemed to move within a very narrow band. And that same trend has persisted into 2023. If you're wondering why Bitcoin has not been able to punch through the $30,000 mark recently or why there's little to no movement after major news events, this is the reason.\n\nIn mid-August, a popular Bitcoin volatility index (known as the BVOL) touched a new low, and some crypto analysts were quick to point out the \"exhaustion and apathy\" for Bitcoin. You can see this on the chart below showing changes in Bitcoin's volatility in 2023:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nBut let's zoom out for a second and see how the current period stacks up against previous historical evidence. This chart shows Bitcoin's volatility since 2016, and it is eye-opening, to say the least. At a glance, you can see how Bitcoin's current volatility is clearly at historical lows. Annualized volatility previously approached 100% to 200% during certain periods, and now it's around 10%:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nIs this the new norm?\n\nOne view about this extraordinary change to Bitcoin volatility is that this is the new norm. As Bitcoin goes increasingly mainstream and as more institutional investors boost their allocation to crypto, Bitcoin could lose some of its volatility. Quite simply, large institutional investors (think pension funds and university endowments) have much longer investment horizons than speculators and traders, and this should help reduce some of the zigs and zags in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThere is some evidence to support this theory beyond just lower volatility figures. For example, the supply of Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges appears to be on the downswing. The basic idea here is that, as more Bitcoin goes off-exchange for secure long-term holding, less Bitcoin can be traded on the major crypto exchanges, and this should reduce volatility.\n\nOr is it the calm before the storm?\n\nHowever, the opposing point of view is that the current period is the proverbial \"calm before the storm.\" Quite simply, this unprecedented period of lower volatility could precede a major spike in volatility as Bitcoin explodes in value. In the past, this has been the pattern with Bitcoin. In two different cases, a prolonged period of relatively low volatility led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin price targets\n\nVolatility is important because it directly impacts the future price trajectory of Bitcoin. High volatility increases the chances of major price swings, both to the upside and the downside. In short, it's what makes huge Bitcoin rallies possible. These rallies draw in speculators and short-term traders, making Bitcoin even more volatile.\n\nThus, when you hear investors suggesting that Bitcoin could soar to $100,000 or skyrocket to $1 million within a very short period, they are likely assuming that Bitcoin's volatility will eventually return to its previous levels. This is what enables huge price swings over a relatively short period.\n\nBut what if lower volatility is the new norm? Well, then, the chances of Bitcoin spiking to $100,000 anytime soon are very much limited. At this point, it is still too early to say that Bitcoin's volatility is in permanent decline. Crypto has always been a risky, highly volatile asset class, and Bitcoin's current volatility could simply be a historical aberration.\n\nBut maybe it's not, considering all the new institutional money flowing into Bitcoin. So keep your eye on Bitcoin's volatility -- this might end up being one of the biggest factors determining whether or not it can soar in value heading into 2024."

        "title": "Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "\u201cHalving\u201d is an automatic event that occurs every four years on the bitcoin blockchain. Not only is halving a massive technical happening that serves as an anti-inflationary model for bitcoin, but it is also of considerable interest to investors: for all past halvings (in 2012, 2016, and 2020) were followed by massive bull runs that propelled the value of BTC to historic highs.\n\nThe fourth halving event is expected to happen in April or May 2024 \u2014 and the future may look different from the past. What are the implications for the price of BTC? Can we expect another historic bull run in crypto? What is the optimal investment strategy for investors during a halving event?\n\nIn this article, we explore the answers to all these questions \u2014 and more \u2014 in our in-depth analysis of BTC halving events in the run-up to 2024.\n\nBitcoin, Halving, and Scarcity on the Blockchain\n\nOne of the key features of bitcoin is a mechanism of forced scarcity. The reasoning is that for something to hold value, it must be finite and scarce. Consequently, the main feature of bitcoin is a limited supply \u2013 only 21 million BTC will ever be created.\n\nNew bitcoins are issued through a complex cryptographic process called mining, a complex and computationally (and financially) demanding process whereby transaction validators compete for the potential to earn returns in the form of bitcoin.\n\nThe blockchain forces a system of diminishing returns to control the supply of bitcoin \u2013 miner rewards reduce by half every four years, or roughly the time it takes to add 210,000 blocks to the blockchain. Hence, bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d events.\n\nThis system helps ensure that bitcoin does not suffer from the same inflationary tendencies plaguing fiat currencies by controlling the currency flow and reducing the returns from mining. Hence, the timeline for bitcoin production extends out for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe History of Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nBitcoin was born on January 3, 2009, with the mining of \u201cBlock 0\u201d \u2013 the \u201cGenesis Block\u201d \u2013 of the bitcoin blockchain. The genesis bitcoin miner was Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of the blockchain.\n\nInitially, miners were awarded 50 BTC for adding a block to the network. Satoshi Nakamoto accumulated nearly 1.1 million BTC as mining rewards in this period. As the blockchain became more popular, other miners entered the space.\n\nHistorically, bitcoin users can be broadly divided into four overlapping categories \u2013 early investors/blockchain evangelists, tech enthusiasts, retail users, and big institutional investors.\n\nIn the pre-halving era, bitcoin was mainly traded among its original investors and enthusiastic early adopters. The new cryptocurrency was virtually worthless at this stage. In July 2010, bitcoin first started trading at $0.08.\n\nBy 2011, the launch of the first bitcoin exchanges brought new users to the ecosystem, driving the price above $1 for the first time. The same year, bitcoin surged to $31 before suffering a 99% crash in value due to security breaches and hacks.\n\nFirst BTC Halving (2012)\n\nThe first halving of BTC occurred on November 28, 2012, with the writing of block 210,000 to the network. The mining rewards were halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The inflation rate, which was 50% the previous year, was reduced to just 12% after the halving.\n\nBitcoin was in a steady recovery phase in 2012. After crashing to $0.01 in June 2011, the crypto slowly clawed back to $12 by November 2012. Since the 2012 halving was the first-ever event of its kind, it didn\u2019t have the same level of anticipation as the later events.\n\nThe vast majority of users didn't know what to expect. And bitcoin had not evolved into a speculative investment asset at this point. So, the halving did not immediately impact the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe closing price for BTC on December 31, 2012, was $13.45. However, everything changed in the new year \u2013 by April 2013, the price rose to $250 before facing a 50% correction. Further price consolidation and another massive rally drove the price to $1,100.\n\nHowever, we cannot entirely attribute those later gains to the halving. It was later revealed that the price manipulation by a single individual using bot accounts at the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange may have significantly pushed the price of BTC above $1000.\n\nStill, 2013 proved to be a landmark year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, catching the attention of mainstream media and investors in a big way. The first halving did play a significant role in the price history of BTC.\n\nSecond BTC Halving (2016)\n\nDriven by memories of 2012 \u2013 2013, expectations were relatively high in the crypto community in the build-up to the 2016 halving event. The stature of bitcoin has also changed drastically since 2012, attracting more speculative investors.\n\nThe 2016 event occurred on 9th July and reduced mining rewards from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Inflation was reduced from 12% in 2012 to around 5% post-halving in 2016.\n\nBTC started that year at $434. The price started increasing noticeably a few months before the halving. It peaked at $735 on June 21 before undergoing a minor correction and eventually settling at $663 on the day of the halving.\n\nOver the next three months, there were minor corrections and recoveries in the price of bitcoin. The next big rally began in October and propelled BTC to $975 in the final week of December 2016. This bullish trend pushed bitcoin above $1,000 in the first week of January.\n\nBy September 2017, bitcoin had breached the $5,000 mark for the first time. After a significant correction, the crypto continued its upward trajectory, reaching an all-time high of $19,783 in December.\n\nYet again, experts cited market manipulation as a significant factor behind the massive bitcoin rallies in 2017. This time, researchers alleged that individuals used the stablecoin Tether to create price support for bitcoin during bear runs in a coordinated strategy.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that investor frenzy also played a big part in the bitcoin bull run of 2017. And the ultimate catalyst for this series of events was the second BTC halving of 2016.\n\nThird BTC Halving (2020)\n\nAfter the historic gains in 2017, expectations ran high for the third BTC halving. However, the COVID-19 outbreak crashed the price of BTC in March 2020, complicating matters.\n\nThe halving event occurred on 11th May, reducing block rewards to just 6.25BTC. Inflation in BTC was also pushed down further to under 2%.\n\nBTC had a strong Q1 in 2020, starting at around $7,200 in January before reaching $10,000 in mid-February. This was followed by a pandemic-induced collapse in March-April, driving prices below $6,800.\n\nHowever, bitcoin recovered to $9,900 by May 9, attributed to rising excitement about the upcoming event. The third halving event further decreased the inflation levels in bitcoin, driving it even below gold.\n\nHowever, the collapse of traditional markets in the latter half of 2020 pushed bitcoin to new heights. From $9,000 before the halving, the value of BTC soared to $28,000 by the end of the year, driven by a massive increase in the inflow of investor money.\n\nIn hindsight, COVID-19 was both a blessing and a curse for bitcoin in 2020. After triggering an initial collapse, the pandemic soon facilitated capital inflows into crypto. It played a significant role in elevating bitcoin to the rank of a bonafide investment option in the mainstream.\n\nUpcoming Fourth Halving (2024)\n\nThe fourth halving of bitcoin is expected towards the end of April or early May 2024, with a tentative date of April 25. Since we cannot accurately predict the speed at which blocks are mined, the actual timing of the event can vary.\n\nPotential Impacts and Speculation\n\nOnce miners add block number 840,000 to the blockchain, the mining rewards will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. A likely reduction in the annual inflation rate of Bitcoin from 1.8% to 0.9% due to the decrease in supply will likely follow.\n\nThese are the intended outcomes of the halving event \u2013 why Satoshi Nakamoto chose to design the system as it exists today. However, with each successive event, the actual direct impact of the halving has a smaller footprint on BTC prices.\n\nSince more than 92% of BTC has already been mined, the supply shock from the halving will be relatively low. The volatility will be driven mainly by investor sentiment, particularly outsiders, due to FOMO and speculators looking for short-term gains.\n\nThe main impact will be keenly felt in the mining arena, where lower rewards and high costs potentially trigger an exit of nearly 30% of the total operations. The overall impact of this development on network security remains to be seen.\n\nWhat Should Investors Look for After a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nUnder the existing protocol, bitcoin will undergo 33 halving events between 2012 and 2140. Although a sample size of 3 events is small in the grand scheme, we can still identify several patterns from these past halving events.\n\nChanges in Miner Trends and Behaviors\n\nFor miners, each halving event doubles the production costs per BTC earned. However, until now, this was offset by the massive increases in bitcoin price that followed after each halving event.\n\nThe hash rate is an important metric that shows the total processing power committed to securing the blockchain by miners. A higher hash rate indicates the presence of more mining equipment and, possibly, more miners.\n\nAccording to the hash rate chart for BTC, there has been a constant increase in mining operations since the second halving event in 2016. Although the market crash drove down the price of BTC in 2022, the mining curve is still relentlessly going up.\n\nThis has grave implications for miners in 2024. As of 2023, the average BTC cost is around $15,000. After the halving, this will double to $30,000. Unless the price of BTC surges back to pre-2022 levels, many mining operations could shut down in 2024.\n\nProfitability concerns have already been affecting many bitcoin mining companies since 2022 due to rising energy costs and a fall in the value of bitcoin. With the halving of rewards to 3.125BTC, experts estimate that 15% to 30% of mining operations will stop in 2024.\n\nMiners are investing heavily in equipment upgrades in 2023. The newer mining rigs can improve energy efficiency by up to 25%. Miners not investing in better ASICs may see their profits dwindle to zero after the 2024 halving.\n\nHalving events also have severe implications for network security. The network may become more vulnerable to 51% attacks if the hash rate falls significantly. However, given the sheer size of the BTC blockchain, it would take a massive fall-off in miner activity to make the system dangerously insecure.\n\nShifts in Market Sentiment and Investor Reaction\n\nIt is much harder to gauge the potential impact of halving events on bitcoin market sentiment. There are far too many variables at play. For instance, in 2020, the unprecedented pandemic played a pivotal role in bringing liquidity to the crypto markets.\n\nHowever, we can analyze past market sentiment and investor reaction. The run-up to a halving event has been accompanied by rising excitement, minor volatility, and relatively smaller bull runs in BTC.\n\nIn all previous instances, the actual event was followed by minor corrections. Major rallies have occurred after a few months, often driven by investor excitement and a lower supply of BTC.\n\nAs outlined in the graphs below, the typical aftermath of a halving event has looked something like this:\n\nAn initial bull run that lasts for anywhere from 365 days to 540 days.\n\nA bearish correction lasting close to 400 days.\n\nA sideways run until the next halving, lasting around 450 to 500 days.\n\nSource: Breakdown of BTC's Price Performance After Previous Halvings, Will History Repeat? (cryptopotato.com)\n\nA cursory glance at the halving data also shows that the impact of each successive halving event on BTC prices may be weakening. Over 92% of the total supply of bitcoin has already been mined by now. With most of the coins already in circulation, future reductions in supply will have a lower impact on the price of BTC.\n\nMuch of the volatility will come from investor sentiments in 2024. Here, a distinction can be made between the reactions of the various communities of bitcoin investors:\n\nThe HODLers : Long-term BTC enthusiasts and early adopters will play a small role in the market. The standard playbook for them is to keep HODLing no matter what \u2013 seasoned investors typically make purchases during market downtrends like the ones in 2022.\n\n: Long-term BTC enthusiasts and early adopters will play a small role in the market.

The Speculators/Newcomers : Fear of missing out (FOMO) also plays a huge role in the crypto markets. As media coverage of the halving increases, there could be an influx of new investors into crypto. Speculators who only care about short-term gains will also become more active and add to the overall volatility.\n\n: Fear of missing out (FOMO) also plays a huge role in the crypto markets.

Speculators who only care about short-term gains will also become more active and add to the overall volatility. Institutional Investors: Whales, financial institutions, private companies, and even governments hold bitcoins worth billions of dollars in 2023. The actions of these investors are driven mainly by factors including interest rates, the performance of traditional markets, and other economic/political factors and are much harder to predict.\n\nHow Can Investors Prepare for Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThere are better times for serious investors to make any moves in the market than a bitcoin halving event. Most investors and HODLers try to accumulate BTC at favorable rates before the halving event.\n\nThis allows you to avoid market volatility and increase the chance of high returns. \"Buy low and HODL\" remains our preferred strategy for BTC in 2023. The optimal accumulation period is usually between the market bottom (the most recent event was in 2022) and the next halving \u2013 an average of around 500 days.\n\nBased on historical data, the best time to move into BTC has been 900 to 1000 days (just short of 3 years) after a halving event. That is the typical time the market ends its bull and bear runs, leaving BTC at historic lows as panicked short-term investors try to offload their holdings.\n\nWhile halving events can generate massive levels of hype, it is crucial to keep perspective \u2013 with each cycle, the impact of halving on BTC prices has decreased. Investor sentiments and external events have primarily driven the volatility after halving.\n\nIn 2023-24, the cryptocurrency markets face unprecedented pressure from external factors like energy prices, rampant inflation in traditional markets, and regulatory pressure from governments worldwide, especially the United States.\n\nUnder the circumstances, our strategy is to avoid getting caught up in the trading frenzy in the immediate run-up and aftermath of a halving. We believe investors preparing well in advance are more likely to see gains.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nHalving remains a pivotal event in the evolving story of bitcoin\u2013and will remain that way for the foreseeable future. However, its actual impact on the price and supply of BTC is trending downward with each event. External factors like interest rates, regulatory developments, and energy costs have a far more significant impact.\n\nThe main impact of the halving is more psychological these days \u2013 massive gains recorded during the previous cycles generate hope and FOMO in the minds of many investors. Although gains made by BTC after halving have steadily declined over the cycles, we can never rule out another massive bull run.\n\nWhether you are investing in traditional assets or crypto, it is vital to maintain a balanced portfolio for optimal returns and risk mitigation.

        "content": "After rising about 80% in the first two quarters of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) fell roughly 11% in the third quarter ending September. However, there is a silver lining for the bulls because they managed a positive monthly close in September, the first since 2016.\n\nBuyers will try to build upon this momentum in October, which has a bullish track record. According to CoinGlass data, only 2014 and 2018 have produced negative monthly returns since 2013 in October. There is no guarantee that history will repeat itself but the data can be used as a good starting point to formulate strategies by traders.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe recent strength in Bitcoin has also boosted interest in altcoins. Select altcoins are trying to break above their respective overhead resistance levels, indicating the start of a robust recovery. The bullish momentum could pick up further if Bitcoin extends its relief rally to $28,000.\n\nNot all altcoins are expected to blast off to the upside. The cryptocurrencies that are showing strength are the ones that may lead the recovery higher. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading above the moving averages since Sep. 28, which is a positive sign. This shows that the advantage is gradually tilting in favor of the buyers.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to stall the rally near $27,500 but the bulls have not given up much ground. This shows that every minor dip is being purchased. This increases the odds of a break above $27,500. The BTC/USDT pair could then retest the crucial overhead resistance at $28,143. This level may again attract aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nIf the price turns down sharply from $28,143, the pair could retest the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,630). A strong bounce off this level could kick the price above $28,143. The pair may subsequently climb to $30,000.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and dives below the solid support at $26,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is taking support at the 20-EMA. This indicates that the bulls are trying to take charge. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and they will try to halt the recovery in the zone between $27,300 and $27,500. The sellers will then have to yank the price below the 20-EMA to seize control.\n\nConversely, if bulls pierce the overhead resistance at $27,500, it will pave the way for a possible rally to $28,143. This level may witness a tough battle between the buyers and sellers.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) broke and closed above $1,370 on Sep. 26, indicating the start of a new uptrend. When an asset is in an uptrend, traders tend to buy on dips.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears tried to stall the up-move at $1,600 but the bulls purchased the dip at $1,432. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive and lower levels are being bought. If bulls propel the price above $1,600, the MKR/USDT pair could rally to $1,760 and then sprint to $1,909.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and skids below $1,432, it could make room for a retest of the breakout level at $1,370. The bears will have to yank the price below this support to indicate that the uptrend may be over.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are fiercely protecting the overhead resistance at $1,600. If bulls want to keep their chances of continuing the uptrend alive, they will have to buy the dips to the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, the buyers will once again try to overcome the obstacle at $1,600 and start the next leg of the uptrend. Alternatively, a collapse to $1,432 and then to the 50-simple moving average may begin if the pair drops below the 20-EMA.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) is trying to break above the long-term downtrend line, indicating a potential trend change. The rebound off the 20-day EMA ($62.42) on Sep. 28 indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears will try to stall the recovery at the downtrend line but if bulls do not allow the price to slip back below the 20-day EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break above it. The AAVE/USDT pair could thereafter start an up-move toward $88.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is the important support to watch on the downside. If this level cracks, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($58.82).\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth the upsloping 20-EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in command. The rally may face selling at the downtrend line but the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the 20-EMA.\n\nA strong rebound off the 20-EMA will open the doors for a possible rise above the downtrend line. The pair may first rally to $75 and next to $80. The bears will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA to break the tempo.\n\nRelated: Crypto synthetic assets, explained\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) has reached the overhead resistance at $2 for the third time within the past few days. The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will improve the prospects of a rally above $2. If that happens, the RUNE/USDT pair could first rise to $2.28 and subsequently to $2.78.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the bulls have given up and the pair may then drop to $1.37.\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling near the overhead resistance at $2 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to skid and sustain below the 20-EMA. This suggests that lower levels are attracting buyers.\n\nIf bulls push and maintain the price above $2, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The pair could then surge toward $2.35. On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will indicate the start of a deeper correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective (INJ) has been swinging inside a large range between $5.40 and $10 for the past several days. The price action inside a range can be random and volatile but when the boundaries are far apart, trading opportunities may arise.\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The INJ/USDT pair could first rise to $8.28 where the bears may mount a strong resistance. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $10.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to defend the overhead resistance and quickly drag the price below the moving averages. The pair could then retest the immediate support at $6.36.\n\nINJ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the overbought territory, suggesting that the bulls have a slight edge. The rally could reach $8.28 which is likely to act as a strong hurdle.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. A bounce off this level will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. Contrarily, a break below the 20-EMA will signal that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the price down to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Boost Brings Solana up 15% as Bears Lose $94 Million - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has reached its highest price in over a month, breaking the $28,000 barrier.\n\nShort liquidations on crypto-tracked futures, totaling $94M, led to a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d and contributed to the BTC rise.\n\nSolana saw significant gains, up by nearly 15%, as traders gained faith in the network.\n\nThe anticipation of ETF approvals and positive macroeconomic developments further support this bullish sentiment.\n\nFactors such as the avoidance of a US government shutdown and speculation about the Fed\u2019s rate hikes have contributed to the positive sentiment.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $28,000 barrier to reach its highest price in more than a month. Analysts cited seasonality and ETF optimism as a few factors contributing to the increases.\n\nLast week, traders at the Japanese exchange Bitbank were already keeping an eye on the $28,000 mark for Bitcoin. In the previous bull market, the $28,500 served as a significant support level. In the next weeks, it may turn into a level of resistance, making it an important price level to watch for.\n\nShort Selling Liquidations\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin and Ether prices could be attributed to short liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets. Approximately $94 million worth of bets against price increases were impacted on Sunday, leading to a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d This occurs when short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, creating excess demand and a scarcity of available stock.\n\nThe data reveals that almost 30,000 negative bets were settled, the majority of which happened on the cryptocurrency market OKX.\n\nLiquidation happens when a trader\u2019s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a loss of their initial margin. It occurs when a trader cannot fund or meet the margin requirements for their leveraged trade.\n\nSome traders attributed Sunday\u2019s advances elsewhere to past seasonality.\n\nSolana Takes the Lead in Altcoin Surge\n\nIn the last day, Ether (ETH) crossed the $1,700 mark, Bnb (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) all saw price increases. Solana\u2019s SOL tokens are the reason behind most of the gains, up almost 15%, mostly because of some traders\u2019 newfound faith in the network.\n\nSolana (SOL) has had a strong week, gaining over 25%. Open interest in Solana now stands at $321.13 million, up 2.37% from the previous session. In the last 24 hours, the long/short ratio is 0.965, with short holdings at $534.18K and long positions at $304.30K.\n\nThe SOL price may encounter probable resistance at $25 and $27. If it breaks out above these levels, it might rise to $32 in the future. A downturn, however, can resume if it fails to hold its current position, leading to potential support levels at $18 and $16.\n\nSome significant events in the Solana ecosystem provide the background to the SOL price momentum. Solana announced their merger with leading global e-commerce platform Shopify back in August 2023.\n\nThe partnership would let millions of businesses to take blockchain payments with ease by immediately integrating Solana Pay, a decentralised payment protocol, into Shopify\u2019s platform.\n\nAnalyzing the Macro Landscape\n\nSeveral events have had a positive impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price. Firstly, they discussed the looming threat of a US government shutdown . Although this risk has arisen in the past due to disagreements over government spending, it has been resolved.\n\nJust hours before a crucial midnight deadline when funding for federal agencies was due to run out, President Joe Biden signed the short-term spending package passed by Congress into law.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the Senate approved the legislation, following an unexpected shift in the House earlier in the day, where lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill to prolong government funding. This came after several days of uncertainty regarding the possibility of avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nThe second factor is the growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may have concluded its rate hikes. While this is still uncertain and has been a topic of discussion for some time, recent developments have eased some concerns. However, it\u2019s important to note that this situation remains fluid, and market sentiment can shift unexpectedly.\n\nThird factor may be the optimistic retail sales and factory output data from China last month which have rejuvenated risk sentiment in financial markets. This has paved the way for continued price increases in the leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAltcoins Downtrend on the Horizon?\n\nThe recovery has the potential to expose altcoin bears who engaged in leveraged bearish positions last month due to concerns about potential FTX creditor selling. These traders face the risk of exchanges forcing them into liquidation if the market moves against their positions, potentially resulting in a margin shortfall. The possibility of forced short liquidation is adding upward pressure on SOL\u2019s price, leading to a rally driven by a short squeeze. The most significant near-term risk is now a positive one: the covering of short positions in altcoins could lead to leveraged liquidations that boost the entire cryptocurrency market. SOL is a cryptocurrency to watch in this context.\n\nVanEck launched an official Ether futures ETF, leading to expectations of increased demand in the cryptocurrency markets. Analysts predicted a 90% chance of the ETF approval in the first week of October.\n\nThe SEC may no longer utilise justifications and continue to refuse to approve ETFs on spot Bitcoin, according to the US Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, which found Grayscale to be in the right and the SEC to be in the wrong.\n\nBecause of this, a lot of people now consider approval to be quite likely, and the market is responding accordingly.\n\nBlackRock has an ETF approval rate of more than 99%, so when news of its request in this respect broke, the price of BTC also increased past $31,500.\n\nSeptember Historically a Bad Month for Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe Federal Reserve employs interest rate increases to slow economic activity when consumer prices are high, but they can also lower the prices of investments like stocks and cryptocurrencies. As a result, financial assets as a whole have struggled.\n\nThe stock market often had a terrible month in September. According to statistics , the S&P 500 has fallen a median of 0.42% in September since 1928 and has experienced gains just 44.7% of the time.\n\nOver the past five years, Bitcoin has experienced an average monthly price decline of 8.5% in September, contrasting with increases of 7.9% in November and 11.1% in December, along with an average gain of 24.6% in October. Bitcoin\u2019s price has increased from the start to the end of September only 28.6% of the time since October 2014, with an average decline of 4.82%.\n\nSimilarly, Ether has seen an average 8.5% price decline in September over the past three years, followed by an average 17.5% increase in October. Since November 2017, Ether\u2019s price has been higher from the start to the end of September only 25% of the time, with an average loss of 10.8%.\n\nEther\u2019s monthly performance, according to data , has been worse in June than in September, with the price falling an average of 15% in that month."

        "content": "FTX's multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency blowup hasn't destroyed all faith in the industry. In a new documentary premiering Monday, FTX customers, insiders and investors tell CNBC that despite not receiving a single dollar's worth of cryptocurrency back, they're optimistic on the industry and plan to keep investing. Evan Luthra, an app developer, entrepreneur and angel investor, told CNBC he lost $2 million in the collapse of FTX. Luthra said he knew when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2022 that he wouldn't have \"access to any of this money for the next few years.\" He continues to speak at crypto conferences.\n\nFTX customer Evan Luthra talked with CNBC in Miami before speaking at a crypto conference. CNBC\n\n\"I do want everybody to understand that the mistake here was not bitcoin , the mistake was not crypto,\" Luthra said. \"The fundamental reason why we buy bitcoin, why we use bitcoin has not changed.\" Luthra said his hefty loss on FTX hasn't shaken his bitcoin bullishness. \"I know it's going to end up at over $100,000 sooner or later anyways, so for me it's a great buy,\" he said. Bitcoin is currently trading at about $26,900, down from a high of about $69,000 in December 2021. \"All the success is made in the trenches, not when everybody's already celebrating,\" he said. FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, spiraled into bankruptcy after its swift collapse last year. Shortly afterward, FTX investigators said they discovered $8.9 billion in customer assets were missing from the exchange. FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces seven criminal charges of fraud and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection begins in New York on Tuesday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves Manhattan federal court in New York after a court appearance, June 15, 2023. Fatih Aktas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAt a bankruptcy hearing in April 2022, an attorney for FTX said $7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets had been recovered from the exchange. So far, none of the customers interviewed by CNBC have received any of their money back. Jake Thacker, an FTX customer in Portland, Oregon, told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exchange shortly after he lost his job in the tech industry. \"I'm in quite a big hole right now,\" Thacker said. \"I'm probably going to have to file for bankruptcy.\"\n\nFTX customer Jake Thacker told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the crypto exchange. CNBC\n\nThacker told CNBC he \"would encourage people to still invest in crypto.\" \"I probably would give them some different advice at this point,\" he said. That advice would come with the warning: \"Here's what I learned, don't make the same mistakes I did.\" Bhagamshi Kannegundla said he first heard about FTX in an advertisement featuring comedian Larry David that aired during the Super Bowl. \"I was like, oh my goodness, there's all these big name people utilizing FTX,\" Kannegundla said. \"So I was like, OK, hey, I think I'll be safe using this.\" Less than a year later, Kannegundla said, he was out $174,000, representing around 60% of his crypto portfolio, from FTX's collapse.\n\nBhagamshi Kannegundla, an FTX customer, told CNBC he sold his bankruptcy claim to reinvest in crypto. CNBC\n\n\"Based on all the other bankruptcies and everything that happened in the crypto market, I was really, really worried about getting anything back, and then how long I would have to wait,\" Kannegundla said. Instead of waiting for the recoveries to eventually be distributed to FTX customers, Kannegundla went online and found a company that would help him sell his bankruptcy claim for pennies on the dollar to get a little bit of cash more quickly. Kannegundla said his bankruptcy claim was for $174,000. He received around $19,000 in the sale. \"The buyer was, after all the due diligence and everything, it went down to like 11% of the $174,000,\" he said. Years later, if the FTX bankruptcy process recovers more than the 11 cents on the dollar for his claim, the buyer pockets the difference. Kannegundla said he will have \"zero regrets\" if that money gets recovered because he has a different strategy. \"I wanted to get the cash from the bankruptcy claim, primarily to invest in crypto again,\" he said. \"I felt as if there was a good chance for me to make money in the next five to 10 years.\" Kannegundla said he understands that it may be an odd choice. \"People might think I'm crazy for this,\" he said. \"After going through the FTX and all these other bankruptcies, why would you want to buy any more crypto?\" \"When you believe in something as far as technology, you will go through it, you know, it's kind of like the same person who bought like, let's say Amazon stock,\" he said. Another FTX customer, Sunil Kavuri, who has a background in traditional finance, said he moved his digital assets from rival exchange Binance to FTX because he believed it was a safe place for his money. He pointed to the fact that the company raised money from top venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm. \"I thought OK, this is a very safe, institutionally backed exchange,\" he said.\n\nBahamas-based crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11, 2022. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIn an email to CNBC, Kavuri said he hasn't purchased any crypto since the collapse of FTX because he \"wanted to take a break from suffering a massive loss.\" Over the last 10 months, he said, the majority of his time has been spent fighting \"for the rights of all FTX users that lost money due to the FTX bankruptcy.\" \"It hasn't shaken my faith in the underlying asset itself,\" Kavuri said. \"I think cryptocurrencies generally, it should be here to stay.\"\n\nFTX customer Sunil Kavuri told CNBC his loss on the exchange hasn't shaken his faith in the underlying asset. CNBC\n\nAcross the industry, crypto still has its believers despite the madness of 2022. Brett Harrison, the former president of FTX's U.S. business, said he was blindsided by his parent company's collapse. But he's doubling down on cryptocurrencies. Harrison, who left FTX less than two months before its demise, told CNBC he \"had no reason to suspect that FTX wasn't anything other than extremely profitable and in great shape\" prior to his departure.\n\nBrett Harrison, former president of FTX US, left the company less than two months before its collapse. CNBC\n\nHarrison said he's been raising money to start a new company in the space called Architect Financial Technologies. \"I'd really like to build a technology and a tech-forward brokerage that allows people to trade seamlessly and easily in digital assets and any kind of other tokenized products in addition to other asset classes,\" Harrison said. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, said he felt like he was late to the game. He didn't make his first bitcoin investment until October 2020. He later started Skybridge to focus on digital assets.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, spoke with CNBC at his office in New York. CNBC"

        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nThere's an old aviation joke that asks \"How do you make a million dollars in the airline business\"? The punchline (\"Start with two million dollars\") is a bit of hyperbole but there is a kernel of truth to it. Much of the same can be said for investing in Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. Unless you got in on the ground floor in the early 2010s or get incredibly lucky, you're unlikely to make any life-changing amounts of money in cryptocurrency. In this article, we'll take a look at Bitcoin, what it means to invest in cryptocurrency and some alternatives that have a better track record of historical success.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular form of cryptocurrency (introduced in 2009), many people use the two terms interchangeably. But Bitcoin is just one form of cryptocurrency \u2014 some other forms are Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that is backed by a form of cryptography often referred to as the blockchain. Because of the way that cryptocurrencies are set up, they are nearly impossible to counterfeit. There are a few ways that you can invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The easiest way to invest in Bitcoin is to simply get a Bitcoin wallet and buy Bitcoins. We recommend Coinbase for U.S. investors \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest, links to your bank account, and allows you to buy and sell Bitcoins. Plus, if you open an new account, Coinbase will give you a $5 Bitcoin bonus when you make your first trade! Another way is to If you want to invest in an ETF through your broker, check out the GBTC. This ETF tracks Bitcoin, and you can invest in fractional shares. Another option is mining for Bitcoins, since as long as the markets remain active you can basically make money for nothing. But the problem is, mining is such a tough gig now that it is hardly worth it. Turning your computer into a miner will likely make it noisy and heat up. It would likely take you a long time to even mine a single Bitcoin, by which time you probably would have spent more on electricity. Keep in mind that investing in Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For almost all people, it is not a good idea to invest the majority of your portfolio in any form of cryptocurrency. If you really want to dabble in crypto investing, set aside a small portion of your investments \u2014 only enough that you would be comfortable losing entirely.\n\nWhen You Would Have Needed To Invest in Bitcoin To Be A Millionaire\n\nThe history of Bitcoin is volatile and turbulent. Long gone are the days that you could make a token investment in Bitcoin and become a bitcoin millionaire seemingly overnight. To give you a bit of context:\n\nInvesting $10 in Bitcoin in January 2011 would have turned into $1.2 million by March 2022 .\n\n. You'd have needed to invest $160 in Bitcoin in January 2012, $440 in January 2013 or $24,000 in January 2014 to have that same amount.\n\n\n\nBy January 2018, you'd have needed to invest nearly $450,000 in Bitcoin in order to have $1.2 million today.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, we've seen a smaller and smaller rise in the price of Bitcoin. This doesn't mean that there isn't money to be made, but gone are the chances you can turn $10 into $1,000,000.\n\nThe \"Risks\" Of Becoming A Bitcoin Millionaire\n\nEven if you had invested in Bitcoin way back then, it would have taken nerves of steel to hold onto it through the year. Looking at the historical BTC chart, you'd have had to survive and hold through several periods where your investment lost nearly 50% of its value within the period of a few weeks.\n\nWith hindsight, it's easy to say that \"it's just $10\" if that's all you invested originally. But would you have been willing to not panic when your Bitcoin portfolio had gotten up near $1M and dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight? Another risk of having all of your money in Bitcoin is finding places that will accept it as payment for goods and services. While it is becoming more and more prevalent to find a business that will accept cryptocurrency as payment, it is still relatively rare. You're not likely to be able to get bread and milk from the corner store by paying with crypto. Instead, you'll have to change your currency, likely incurring additional fees and taxes. Related: How Taxes On Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin Works\n\n\n\nAlternatives To Winning Big In Crypto\n\nIf you are an individual of \"normal\" risk tolerance, Bitcoins probably don\u2019t excite you too much. The risk/reward profile of the Bitcoin market is not going to be very appealing to the savvy investor. This is just a chance to either make a quick buck, or lose everything. That is one reason why most savvy investors will keep the majority of their money in reliable investments like index funds. Plus, depending on when you started investing, index funds may outperform Bitcoin anyway. For example, From March 2021 to March 2022, you'd see the following returns: Bitcoin: -21.28%\n\n-21.28% S&P 500: +14.49%\n\nYou would have done remarkably better investing in simple index funds over the last year than Bitcoin.\n\n"

        "title": "Babylon Positions Bitcoin Beyond Store of Value, Unveiling Its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP At Cosmoverse 2023 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Babylon introduces its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at Cosmoverse 2023, addressing the untapped potential of idle Bitcoins for PoS chains and dApps\n\nIstanbul, Turkey --News Direct-- Babylon\n\nBabylon, the blockchain project that aims to convert the 21 million bitcoins into a decentralized staking asset for the Proof of Stake economy, unveils its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at the Cosmoverse 2023. Earlier this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin staking to secure PoS chains. Recent data from Glassnode\u2019s reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation. A staggering 66% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, positioning idle Bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nBabylon positions itself as the first marketplace to connect the $500B decentralized trust to earn yield for providing security capital. The company was able to gain support from prominent Cosmos chains that are exploring to adopt Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Zaki Manian, co-founder of Sommelier Protocol, said, \u201cFor years interactions between bitcoin and the growing web3 application layer have been limited to bridging and swapping. Babylon Bitcoin staking lays the path for consensus layer integration with modular and app chains\u201d.\n\nPoS chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains usually have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital. Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to stake Bitcoin instead of their native tokens. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high security. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chain\u2019s inflation pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Babylon's protocol doesn't just harness these idle bitcoins, it transforms them into a security backbone for PoS chains,\" said David Tse, Co-founder, Babylon. \"Our approach seamlessly integrates Bitcoin staking with almost any PoS protocols in a modular fashion, allowing any bitcoin holder to earn staking rewards from a wide variety of PoS chains. This not only amplifies economic incentives but paves the way for broader adoption, underscoring Bitcoin's diverse utility beyond its widely-recognized role as a store of value.\"\n\nBabylon overcomes the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language by amalgamating it with advanced cryptographic techniques. It allows bitcoin holders to lock their bitcoins on the Bitcoin network in a self-custodian way, yet the locked bitcoins can serve as a first-class staking asset for PoS chains with desirable properties such as yield-generation, slashability, and on-demand unstaking. In addition, Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol does not require any soft or hard fork of Bitcoin.\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nBabylon MVP showcases the first implementation of this new technology, where bitcoin testnet coins are staked to secure Babylon PoS chain, which will serve as the control plane for other PoS chains to access to the Bitcoin staking protocol. The MVP comes with a modern explorer and a very straightforward web application for bitcoin holders to test Bitcoin staking.\n\nAfter the MVP debut, Babylon will focus on adoption in various ecosystems. This includes the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains, which is heavily reliant on native staking. Within Cosmos, the top ten protocols boast a combined $2.5 billion worth of staked assets, with an average staking ratio of 50%. Furthermore, 34 integrated PoS chains have shown a strong desire to reduce the 21 day unbonding time for assets staked in Cosmos. Demand for Babylon\u2019s time-stamping protocol was made clear when the Osmosis governance proposal to utilize Bitcoin staking was passed with a 99.9% vote in favor.\n\nThe Company successfully secured a seed funding round, spearheaded by IDG and Breyer Capital\u2014prominent early backers of Coinbase and Circle. With this momentum, the firm is actively seeking additional investment to bolster the advancement of the Bitcoin Staking protocol, among other initiatives.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a transformative research paper on Bitcoin security co-authored by Babylon co-founders David Tse, a professor at Stanford, Fisher Yu, Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, and co-authors. This Bitcoin security research paper achieved a significant milestone as it has been accepted by the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, recognized as the world's leading security conference. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nBitcoin Staking Protocol MVP: https://btcstakingscan.devnet.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nBabylon\n\nShalini Wood, CMO\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-positions-bitcoin-beyond-store-of-value-unveiling-its-bitcoin-staking-protocol-mvp-at-cosmoverse-2023-586215540"

        "content": "Nine years ago today, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made his most substantial public remarks on the nature of Bitcoin, a then five-year-old project that had just broken into the financial mainstream by passing $1,000 the year prior.\n\nAt that time, Assange was not new to Bitcoin. In fact, Wikileaks had discussed accepting Bitcoin since as far back as 2010, when early efforts were made by users to introduce the journalistic agency to the payment method.\n\nUltimately, Wikileaks began accepting Bitcoin in 2011, a move the organization has since credited for helping break its banking blockade in the wake of its publishing of classified U.S. government information.\n\nThat said, a 2014 interview, unearthed by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, shows Assange was every bit as convinced about the technology years later.\n\nIn the video, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a bold statement about Bitcoin that has since proved to be remarkably accurate. In the interview, Assange labeled Bitcoin as \"the most interesting thing on the internet,\" and his words have aged well as the cryptocurrency has seen a staggering surge in value over the years.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Bitcoin was trading at a fraction of its current value, yet Wikileaks was using the technology as a publishing platform, in part, to prove the existence of information it published.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Assange discussed the nature of Bitcoin, and cryptography in general, as a tool for civilians to resist government overreach.\n\n\"The ability of cryptography to create situations where it can defend the people who use it against the full might of a superpower. The full might of a superpower doesn't help you solve a math problem,\" he said. \"It's not something you can get at through overwhelming coercive power.\"\n\nAssange's foresight regarding Bitcoin's significance is evident when we consider the cryptocurrency's remarkable price trajectory since the interview. In 2014, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $380 per coin across exchanges.\n\nFast forward to 2023, and Bitcoin is trading at $28,000, marking an increase of over 7,000% in the nine years since.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mature and gain acceptance, it remains closely tied to the principles of decentralization and censorship resistance that Assange and WikiLeaks championed. Assange is still in prison for publishing key information in the public interest, and his fight for freedom remains a core Bitcoin cause.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Beyond bitcoin: Understanding stablecoins - CUinsight.com",
        "content": "While cryptocurrency continues to make headlines, the recent focus has been on declining valuations rather than stunning surges. Bitcoin (BTC), the quintessential decentralized crypto, is still primarily viewed as a speculative investment. Despite being around since 2010, using bitcoin for everyday small transactions remains impractical and, in many cases, unwise.\n\nDue to their continuously changing value, decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be somewhat risky for purchasing and merchant acceptance \u2013 as exemplified by the famous case of an individual who spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas in the early days of bitcoin, an amount that would now be worth more than $200 million. To help combat these concerns, a distinct category of cryptocurrencies, known as stablecoins, was launched in 2014.\n\nWhat is a stablecoin?\n\nAs their name implies, stablecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies engineered to maintain a fixed value. This level of stability and predictability sets them apart from other cryptocurrency varieties, including bitcoin. Stablecoins are typically tethered to a benchmark currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. When someone acquires a stablecoin for $1, a corresponding coin is generated, and the dollar used as collateral is usually deposited in either a commercial bank account or short-term assets like T-bills. When the stablecoin is redeemed, the coin is effectively removed from circulation (a process known as \u201cburning\u201d) and the original dollar is returned. These types of stablecoins are referred to as fiat-backed stablecoins, but there are other forms as well, such as algorithmic stablecoins that seek to maintain value by dynamically minting or burning coins based on demand.\n\nHow are stablecoins used?\n\nHolding a stablecoin in a wallet is similar to holding a paper dollar in a wallet \u2013 it may be safe, but it is not necessarily a good investment. However, stablecoins can serve several purposes:\n\nAs a safe haven: In countries like Argentina, where high inflation and currency devaluation are prevalent, workers are challenged with preserving the value of their paychecks. Stablecoins, particularly those tied to the U.S. dollar, provide a reliable and straightforward means to safeguard earnings from volatile fluctuations. This makes them particularly popular in nations with unstable currencies, such as Venezuela and Iran.\n\nIn countries like Argentina, where high inflation and currency devaluation are prevalent, workers are challenged with preserving the value of their paychecks. Stablecoins, particularly those tied to the U.S. dollar, provide a reliable and straightforward means to safeguard earnings from volatile fluctuations. This makes them particularly popular in nations with unstable currencies, such as Venezuela and Iran. For efficient money movement: Cryptocurrency has emerged as a convenient channel for international money transfers. Since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, more than $225 million has been sent to the country in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and dogecoin. However, these decentralized cryptocurrencies carry the risk of price fluctuations between the sender\u2019s initiation of the transaction and the recipient\u2019s need for the funds. Converting these assets to stablecoins before transferring them eliminates this risk, ensuring the intended value reaches the recipient.\n\nCryptocurrency has emerged as a convenient channel for international money transfers.

Converting these assets to stablecoins before transferring them eliminates this risk, ensuring the intended value reaches the recipient. For swift, \u201con-chain\u201d transfers: Large-scale digital asset traders \u2013 typically institutional investors such as cryptocurrency hedge funds \u2013 must swiftly move funds in and out of decentralized cryptocurrencies to catch a rise or exit before a fall. The delay involved in transferring funds from a traditional bank account to a cryptocurrency exchange can result in significant financial losses, often amounting to millions of dollars. To mitigate this risk, these investors prefer to hold their capital in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, which can be easily converted between different coins, ensuring agility in their investment strategies and the ability to react promptly to market dynamics.\n\nAre there risks to consider?\n\nAlthough generally considered far less risky than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have experienced exceptions that reveal potential pitfalls. The most significant setback occurred in May 2022, when Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin, failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a collapse that erased approximately $20 billion worth of circulating coins.\n\nTerra\u2019s failure was not an isolated incident. In January 2021, Basis Cash caused losses of $30.74 million for its investors. Another stablecoin, Titan, issued by Iron Finance, also faced a collapse \u2013 impacting notable backers like Mark Cuban, who later called for increased regulation of stablecoin issuers. Meta, the technology conglomerate which owns and operates platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, attempted to instill trust by creating a stablecoin initially named Libra and later rebranded as Diem. The goal was to enable Meta\u2019s billions of individual users to conduct global financial transactions, which would potentially shake up the world banking system. However, similar to other stablecoins, it encountered strong opposition from regulators and politicians globally, eventually leading to its abandonment.\n\nWhat is next for stablecoins?\n\nWith more than $120 billion minted, stablecoins have gained widespread popularity. Tether, the largest stablecoin, accounts for $11 billion of that. The continued adoption and use of stablecoins in various sectors indicate their potential. For example, Visa recently announced its expanded stablecoin settlement capabilities, which encompass the high-performing Solana blockchain and USDC, a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn addition, PayPal\u2019s recent entry into the stablecoin arena with the introduction of the PayPal USD \u2013 a fiat-backed, regulated stablecoin \u2013 is a notable development. With its established history in the payments industry and strong trust among consumers and regulators, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin could potentially have a transformative impact, allowing users to store the new coin within PayPal or external wallets for flexibility and security. This opens doors for various use cases, including peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and making purchases at merchants, potentially broadening the utility and accessibility of stablecoins.\n\nWhat should credit unions be doing?\n\nThe following are considerations for credit unions to keep in mind with the increasing popularity of stablecoins:\n\nFollow this segment of financial services. Stablecoins represent an evolving segment of the broader crypto industry, one that is gaining in acceptance and trust \u2013 and being scrutinized by regulators. They also represent a potential competitor to regulated banking services by supporting DeFi (Decentralized Financial Services), which are banking services provided by unregulated entities.\n\nStablecoins represent an evolving segment of the broader crypto industry, one that is gaining in acceptance and trust \u2013 and being scrutinized by regulators.

Monitor your members\u2019 activity. Some of your members are holding stablecoins. Tracking outflow from share deposits to crypto exchanges should be a regular report to understand the magnitude of the both the dollar volume and the number of unique members that are participating. These same members could be valuable to the credit union, as they might also be early adopters of other advanced services.\n\nSome of your members are holding stablecoins.

These same members could be valuable to the credit union, as they might also be early adopters of other advanced services. Consider potential use cases in your strategic planning. There are a few pilots of moving tokenized deposits between financial institutions that have taken place over the last few years. Tokenized deposits are a form of stablecoin moving between banks and credit unions over a private, \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain. This moving of tokenized deposits is an alternative for B2B payments and cross-border payments. If B2B payments or cross-border payments are something that fits with your credit union model, consider participating in a pilot case of tokenized deposits in the near future.\n\nIt is imperative for your credit union to keep a pulse on the latest developments concerning stablecoins. As this unique type of cryptocurrency becomes more popular and integrated into the financial ecosystem, stablecoins are likely to play a significant role in the future of digital finance."

Jaime breaks down the economics behind bitcoin mining and the need for mining operations to diversify, and explains how Hut 8 brought on traditional data centers under its services. She addresses the criticisms surrounding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, emphasizing the industry\u2019s efforts to use renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nJaime also discusses the convergence of AI and blockchain technology as the next frontier for innovation and provides updates about material partnerships with US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC) and Coinbase.\n\nQuote of the episode\n\n\u201cAI is scalable everything. There\u2019s no limit to where AI could ultimately go, but what AI lacks is truth, is hardcoded truth.

Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today, I\u2019m joined by Jaime Leverton, who is CEO at Hut 8. Jamie, welcome to the program.\n\nJaime:\n\nThanks so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be here.\n\nIan:\n\nWe have been planning this I think for over eight months. So it holds the record as the longest in the works Public Key episode. I don\u2019t know about the audience, but I\u2019ve got a ton of anticipation. You are famous, I think, in crypto circles. You\u2019re one of Coin Telegraphs 15 Most Influential Entrepreneurs in Web3, and you run a publicly traded cryptocurrency firm, which is a rare, rare thing. Tell us a little bit about Hut 8 for people that aren\u2019t familiar.\n\nJaime:\n\nSure, happy to. So Hut 8 is one of the oldest publicly traded Bitcoin miners. We started as a pure self-mining Bitcoin company. We went public initially on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2018. We\u2019re headquartered in Canada. All of our operations today are in Canada as well. Then we moved up to the Toronto Stock Exchange proper in 2020, and then we\u2019re the first Canadian company in our space to do a list onto the Nasdaq, which we did in the spring of \u201921. Since I took over the company, which is coming up on three years now, we\u2019ve diversified the business model quite a bit. We still do self-mining of Bitcoin, but at the end of January 2022, we closed on the transaction to purchase five traditional data centers across Canada, two in Toronto, two in Vancouver, and one in Northern BC and Kelowna. So those are five data centers that do traditional types of workloads, co-location, cloud managed services.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot going on in that space right now with the boom in AI compute demand we\u2019re seeing. So within the realm of Bitcoin miners, we\u2019re unique in that we are fully diversified between traditional data center compute and Bitcoin mining compute. The other thing that makes us stand out from our peers is we\u2019re actually the first public company to start holding Bitcoin on balance sheet, which we did really from inception going back to 2018.\n\nIan:\n\nWe\u2019ll definitely dive into Bitcoin on balance sheet. We\u2019ve had a number of folks who specialize in the accounting and some of the legal technicalities of dealing with that. I\u2019d love the CEO perspective, but maybe we can start at the beginning because I think you and I have a shared enterprise IT background prior to crypto. You\u2019re a relatively recent joiner to the space. Talk about your career that led you into the world of cryptocurrency. I\u2019m always fascinated by the origin stories here.\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll try to keep it as net as possible. I started my career in trad tech back in 2000. I did my MBA at Dalhousie University on the East Coast of Canada with a concentration in marketing informatics, which was really the precursor to what we would now consider big data or business intelligence, and because that program was so unique, IBM recruited myself and one other from that program and moved me from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Toronto. I\u2019m actually from a small town about two and a half hours east of Toronto. So that was me coming to the big city for the first time in the spring of 2000.\n\nI started working for IBM. I spent the first 10 years of my career working at IBM in a variety of different roles, quite a bit of it spent in the media and entertainment sector, doing a lot with emerging technologies in that space. Then I ultimately made the decision to leave IBM at the end of 2009, and that really kicked off the second half of my career journey, where I\u2019ve worked for a number of companies, all Canadian owned and operated, really focusing on more transformation type of mandates, so going into business units or companies that are struggling with something and really driving or attempting to drive a fix of the business unit or the problem or grow it out in a significant way.\n\nSo over the course of the 10 years from me leaving IBM to me ultimately taking over at Hut 8, I had the opportunity to work for companies like Blackberry, Bell Canada, National Bank, Cogeco Peer 1, a lot of it spent on the infrastructure side. So the majority of my career has been in and around the data center world. So when I got the call to look at this opportunity with Hut 8, ultimately, what a Bitcoin mine really is is an industrial scale stripped down data center.\n\nSo it\u2019s a technology I really understand. I understand the operations, the vendors, how the whole system works, albeit they\u2019re completely different from a security and a redundancy perspective, how you build a Bitcoin mining data center versus a traditional data center, but because I understood the motion and the operations and I had gone down the rabbit hole with respect to Bitcoin in the 2017-\u201918 run, so I was already a big believer in the space, I had looked at other opportunities to come into the space, but ultimately didn\u2019t find the right fit until it was the opportunity to take over Hut, which I did did in December of 2020.\n\nIan:\n\nWow. When you first saw crypto back in 2017, what drew you into it? What appealed? Also maybe the other side of that, what scared you a little bit since you didn\u2019t immediately jump into the industry professionally at least at that time?\n\nJaime:\n\nWell, so a couple things happened. I spent some time working within one of Canada\u2019s large banks in their capital markets division and really had the opportunity to see how capital markets was functioning from the inside. I had the opportunity to go across the capital markets business and understand how they were interacting with each other, with customers, within the broader industry. It really felt like an industry that was ripe for some disruption. It appeared to me to be behaving the same way it had behaved for decades.\n\nSo I went proactively searching for what could be that disruptor for the finance industry and ultimately found Bitcoin, but it was still early, it was still speculative. There were a lot of bad actors in the space. There was a lot of drama. So I just paid attention to it from a peripheral perspective.\n\nAt that time, \u201917-\u201918, run I was running Canada and Asia Pacific for Cogeco Peer 1, which is a traditional data center company. Almost overnight, we saw this overwhelming demand come in from a completely new segment of customers, and really what they were were Bitcoin miners looking for anywhere to plug in servers. They were willing to come into traditional data center environments despite the fact that they were paying arguably retail rates for co-location, but they were so desperate to get somewhere to plug these miners in that they were willing to come into, as I say, traditional spaces.\n\nNow, there are a whole lot of problems that get introduced when you actually try to mix ASIC-based computing in a traditional data center environment. The industry learned those the hard way in that \u201917-\u201918 run. Then ultimately, because the economics didn\u2019t hold, most of those Bitcoin miners that came into a traditional data center environment quickly went under when the economics turned against them as that bear came around quite quickly in \u201918, but through that process, I learned about mining and got just really, really interested in, ultimately, the promise of this technology.\n\nInitially for me, it was about banking the unbanked. It was about really bringing something completely different to every world without borders, without centralization. Then I think for many of us, once you go down that rabbit hole and that fire sparks within you, it\u2019s really, really hard not to eventually make your way into this space.\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s hard to go back once you\u2019ve seen it. You bring up a point that I would love your perspective on, which is as an outsider to the mining industry, it seems like it\u2019s a boom and bust market mixed with geopolitics, right? So when I was coming into the industry two and a half, almost three years ago, everybody was getting kicked out of China, where it seemed like at least 50% of the mining activity had migrated to, I think, driven off of cheap power, and suddenly China said, \u201cNo more. Everybody\u2019s out.\u201d\n\nThen we\u2019ve seen over the last year with the downturn in asset prices it seems like a lot of people were turning off their rigs or actually going outright bankrupt and having asset sales. What is the economics around the mining industry? How does this work? How do you manage to successfully run a publicly traded company in that context? It seems like it would be really challenging.\n\nJaime:\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong. It is very, very challenging. We do see cycles in crypto. I think the Bitcoin cycle, historically, is quite predictable. It all centers around the halving. Generally, we have seen the halving creates a bit of a supply shock because the amount of block rewards available to miners drops by 50% every four years, and that shock to the industry ultimately tends to trigger a new bull cycle, so a new cycle of price appreciation for Bitcoin, which generally happens about six months after the halving.\n\nSo initially, that shock causes really challenging economics for miners because, obviously, the amount of revenue you can generate drops by 50%, but what we see in the network, just based on how the network is designed, the most inefficient miners tend to also shut off immediately following the halving because they just can\u2019t afford to run. So the network is always dynamically self-adjusting based on where the economics are.\n\nSo really, the strategy going into any halving event is to make sure you\u2019re in the top 50% as far as the efficiency curve so that you can continue to mine even after the halving award drops by half, but really, the industry is optimistically waiting for that next cycle of price appreciation for Bitcoin, which is where all of the economics turn in in a Bitcoin miner\u2019s favor in that window. My perspective, and actually I\u2019ll take a step back, we did see a lot of pain in the industry last year across crypto, but that miners were not immune to that. Much of it had to do with leverage.\n\nSo the miners that got into the worst trouble and the bankruptcies that we saw in the space were really driven off of having too much debt that they couldn\u2019t service when mining economics turned suddenly and more negatively than anyone expected. We did have the perfect storm of events last year between an energy crisis, which drove up our number one operating expense as a miner is energy. So prices skyrocketed. Bitcoin price turned earlier than people expected. It didn\u2019t hit the all time highs that people were expecting and it dipped lower than people were expecting. So that obviously has a dramatic impact on our economics.\n\nThen the third factor, which really nobody expected, was the network cash rate continued to hit all time highs, and we\u2019re seeing that momentum also flow into 2023. So our economics are the most challenged perhaps that they\u2019ve ever been since Bitcoin mining really started back in \u201908-\u201909. So from my perspective, one of the things we\u2019ve been very, very focused on since I took over was taking on as little leverage as possible, really having a balance sheet first approach to the business so that you\u2019ve got some insulation from these cycles that can be difficult to predict.\n\nThen the other thing is really looking at a diversified business model, as I talked about. So one of the reasons that we went into the traditional data center space was so that we would have a mix of fiat-based income streams, as well as the self-mining, which ultimately generates the Bitcoin as the output. So from my perspective, those are the two most important things you can do to manage the cycles is a diversified business model that gives you fiat-based income streams that aren\u2019t directly related to Bitcoin mining economics and cycles, and to make sure your balance sheet is robust. So again, I mentioned we\u2019ve been keeping Bitcoin on balance sheets since inception. We now have over 9,000 Bitcoin on our balance sheet, and that gives us a lot of optionality throughout market conditions.\n\nIan:\n\nWhat\u2019s the strategy with Bitcoin on the balance sheet? Are you holding forever as some of the folks in the community might claim to be or is there a more active trading strategy behind that?\n\nJaime:\n\nThis is something we\u2019re constantly looking at. I have no intention to sell down our Bitcoin stack at present. We are selling monthly production to fund operations. As we\u2019re going through, we\u2019re going through a merger, which I\u2019m very, very hopeful we\u2019ll ultimately get final shareholder and regulatory approvals in the next few weeks. I\u2019m happy to talk a little bit about what that will look like and what Hut 8 will be on the other side, assuming that transaction is ultimately approved and successful.\n\nSo our view in the bull market, one of the things we were doing with the stack of Bitcoin that we had on our balance sheet was actually putting it to work. So we had strategic relationships with both Galaxy and Genesys, and we were using a portion of our Bitcoin stack to generate a fiat-based yield. Now, ultimately, when market conditions turned and there was a lot of pain and noise in the industry, we pulled that back so that all of our Bitcoin would be custodied and wouldn\u2019t have any direct market exposure.\n\nThen over the past nine months as we really wanted to be able to enter into the right types of growth opportunities, including the merger we\u2019re working through with USBTC, having that much Bitcoin on balance sheet gives us a lot of optionality to grow the business because, ultimately, it serves as a great currency to put towards growth.\n\nWe did announce about six weeks ago or so a credit facility with Coinbase, so it\u2019s a $50 million US credit facility, where we\u2019re using a portion of our Bitcoin to secure that facility. Coinbase is one of our custodians as well. So it\u2019s a very elegant way to access non-dilutive capital at competitive rates to allow for us to continue to fund and grow the business. So that Bitcoin on balance sheet gives us a lot of optionality, more security and downside protection for cycles.\n\nOver time, I believe, as we get more regulatory clarity and more sophisticated counterparties coming into this space, I think there will be an even greater opportunity for us to really put that stack to work in an increasingly meaningful way, and that is my intention going forward.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, that\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s such a diversified business. Talk about what\u2019s going on with the merger. I think this is a pretty exciting development for Hut.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. So we were vocal with our intention to continue looking for inorganic growth opportunities, the first one being the transaction that we closed to buy the Tarago data center assets at the end of January 22. Then we continue to look for the right opportunity to grow further. Really, I think one of the most important things that I was looking for in a strategic partnership like this was I think cultural fit is incredibly important. The USBTC team, really great group of entrepreneurs, young, positive, hungry, they had also been able to capitalize on some amazing growth opportunities during the bear market and really grow their business out in a meaningful way.\n\nI was looking for an opportunity to get geographic diversification. As I mentioned, we\u2019re entirely Canadian based from an operational perspective, and USBTC is entirely US-based. So their assets are in Texas, Nebraska, and Niagara Falls, and then their corporate team is based in Miami. So very synergistic. There\u2019s really no overlap as far as where we\u2019re positioned on the map.\n\nThey had also embarked on a diversified approach. So they have three primary business lines. They do self-mining of Bitcoin. They also do hosting. Then they built out a category called managed infrastructure operations, where they take their team and their purpose-built in-house software, and they actually go to other people\u2019s sites and manage Bitcoin mining operations for them. That really provides \u2026 It\u2019s two product lines that are fiat-based cash flows, one that\u2019s Bitcoin-based in the prop mining, and different levels of capital intensity. So self-mining of Bitcoin is the most capital intensive in that you have to build and pay for all of the infrastructure, as well as the miners themselves.\n\nThe hosting side of the business, much less capital intensive in that you only have to put capital towards the infrastructure and the clients you\u2019re hosting bring the miners. Then with respect to the managed infrastructure operations, really no capital intensity. It\u2019s software and labor. So that gives us, when we think about ultimately if we\u2019re successful in the merger, these businesses coming together. We have three different primary fiat-based revenue lines. In addition to the repair center, we also have a repair business where we repair third parties mining equipment, and there\u2019s a fiat-based revenue component to that. Then we\u2019ve got, obviously, the self-mining side of our business and my data center business.\n\nSo as these things all come together, it allows us to be very opportunistic in when and how we deploy capital based on what we\u2019re seeing in the markets in which we participate. Obviously, one of the things we would like to be able to avoid and are lucky that we historically have been, you don\u2019t want to be deploying capital into mining equipment in the peak bull market. We saw a lot of people in the last cycle deploying significant amounts of capital into machines that we\u2019re trading at a hundred dollars, north of a hundred dollars per terahash when the real market price is more like high teens, low twenties for that equipment.\n\nSo having the optionality to allow us to flex in and out of segments based on where we think the right deployment of capital exists or makes the most sense is one of the things I really, really like about our business and is incredibly differentiated from anyone else in the space.\n\nIan:\n\nThe strategy makes a ton of sense. One of the things that\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m curious your perspective because you sit on both the GPU, a purview into the world of artificial intelligence and into crypto, and it feels like we\u2019re in a similar cycle to what you just mentioned about the overpriced, overheated market when it comes to GPUs right now.\n\nI had a conversation with somebody the other day that said they were doing an M&A type activity and the value being placed on the GPUs that the to-be-acquired company had was greater than the enterprise book value of the entire company. So GPUs are a hot thing to get right now. Are you seeing that in your business as well, like access to Nvidia chips just being challenged or is this driving demand for you because you had a stockpile ready to go in advance?\n\nJaime:\n\nWell, right now, the biggest demand is for a specific card Nvidia manufacturers called the H100. So that\u2019s absolutely supply constrained, but yes, we are seeing demand, obviously, has exponentially increased for space for people to be able to \u2026 Right now, it\u2019s all about generative AI. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of the demand coming into this space. I think we\u2019ve seen AI hype cycles go \u2026 Well, the first paper on neural networks, I believe, dates back to 1943, and we\u2019ve seen many cycles for AI as well where it\u2019s the next big thing, robots are going to take over the world, and then it peters off and then it comes back. I think this time does feel materially different than prior cycles. I think that the big difference is the way consumers are actually able to interact with AI in a meaningful way, which has not occurred in the past. So I\u2019m not saying that this is the cycle that is here to stay, but it definitely feels different would be my perspective.\n\nI think one of the really fascinating things about how Hut has evolved as well, the company was named after Hut 8, which is the Hut number that Alan Touring worked in during World War II. He built out the bomb and ultimately helped to crack the code that allowed the winning of the war. So that cryptography ultimately formed the basis on which blockchain and Bitcoin technology was built.\n\nThe other thing that is interesting though, Alan went on to write about AI and, ultimately, machines being able to be indistinguishable from humans, and he wrote that paper, I believe, in 1950. So our company is named after the godfather of crypto and AI and where the unique public company that is existing in trying to lead in the convergence of these two worlds.\n\nIan:\n\nI didn\u2019t know the history around the name, but I love that. That\u2019s such a great insider reference. One of the big criticisms that I think the industry at large gets is environmental in nature. I think I\u2019ll summarize as being like, \u201cHey, this Bitcoin thing doesn\u2019t need to exist, so therefore any amount of power consumed by Bitcoin is wasted power.\u201d We\u2019re in an energy constrained world, and we\u2019re in a situation with climate change where, \u201cHey, we should stop all unnecessary power consumption.\u201d\n\nWhen you and I first met, we got into this discussion on this topic, so I know you\u2019ve got some strong opinions here. Build the case why what I just said, the poor man\u2019s summary of, I think, the anti Bitcoin mining argument doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Then I think your organization\u2019s also done some pretty exciting stuff specifically related to greening of the industry that we should also touch on.\n\nJaime:\n\nThis is a big topic that I\u2019m very passionate about and could spend an hour on my soapbox on. So I\u2019m going to try to not do that. I\u2019ll break it into three categories. First of all, having a value-based conversation about compute workload, which is ultimately what that is and the value Bitcoin, does Bitcoin deserve energy, that\u2019s a very dangerous argument to have. Are we then saying that all other workloads we should debate on their value to society? There are a lot of very terrible workloads out there that have never debated their energy profile. So that is complicated.\n\nI would also say if you look at where we\u2019re seeing the highest level of Bitcoin adoption right now, it\u2019s in Argentina for obvious reasons. So if you\u2019re going to talk about values, you really have to have to talk to people who don\u2019t sit in a privileged position from being me in Canada or those of us that are in the United States or Europe that have stable currencies and stable governments.\n\nBitcoin solves a really serious problem that affects a large portion of the globe, and we\u2019ve still got just under two billion people unbanked that Bitcoin is an answer for. So a challenging argument and one that I really don\u2019t think holds any water if you think about the promise of Bitcoin and what it does that no other technology in the history of the world has been able to do from a store of value perspective and transfer of value perspective.\n\nWhen we get into the energy conversation, I think it\u2019s really driven on people not understanding the industry or how it works. I think the easiest way for me to describe a real life use case is our site in Medicine Hat. So our largest site in Canada is in Medicine Hat, Alberta. We\u2019ve got 67 megawatts. Medicine Hat is an independent power authority in that the city also owns their own power generation. When we set up our Bitcoin mining facility, we built it directly next to one of their cogen facilities.\n\nNow, that facility always was producing the same amount of power, but for the most part, that power would sit idle waiting for peak demand. It was always there to support the constituents, but it wasn\u2019t being monetized or put to productive use until we built the Bitcoin mine next to it. So what that did for the community as a whole, now that 67 megawatts of power is being utilized and monetized at all times, but when there\u2019s peak demand on the grid, we power off.\n\nSo Bitcoin mines are built to power up and down based on the cost of electricity because if it\u2019s not economical for us to mine Bitcoin, we\u2019re not going to mine Bitcoin, we shut down, and that always coincides with peak demand. So the community at large gets to use the power when they need the power, but the power that\u2019s available is never being wasted. It\u2019s always being monetized and utilized and going where it\u2019s most needed.\n\nThat made us one of the largest sources of revenue, obviously, for the power side of the community or one of the largest taxpayers for the community. We brought 30 skilled labor jobs into a community that really, really needs them without taking anything away from the community or the constituents. We are purely a net benefit. We almost operate like a battery in that we move up and down as required by the needs of the grid.\n\nIan:\n\nCan I ask a question on this because I\u2019ve heard the Bitcoin battery argument before, and I\u2019m such a novice when it comes to understanding the energy industry? So I think the way it goes is power plants, hugely capital intensive to build, take years if not decades to construct a new power plant of any generation technology, and once it\u2019s built, you may not have \u2026 Let\u2019s say that it has 100 megawatt supply capacity. That 100 megawatts, you may not have demand for that most of the time, but there\u2019s no-\n\nJaime:\n\nExactly. Generally, you\u2019re only hitting that peak demand maybe 10%, 15% of the year on the very, very cold days, the very, very hot days, but it has to be available to support those days. Otherwise, it-\n\nIan:\n\nThis is where the power plant concept seems strange to me. If I was talking about in my house, I would just turn things off and I would be consuming nothing, but in a power plant, it\u2019s not trivial to cut down the power generation capacity, particularly if I have to, and it\u2019s hard to scale up quickly to meet that peak demand when it comes.\n\nJaime:\n\nThat\u2019s right. Exactly.\n\nIan:\n\nSo the operators want to run at full capacity all the time.\n\nJaime:\n\nCorrect. That\u2019s right.\n\nIan:\n\nMost of the time, they\u2019re just dumping that power into nothing.\n\nJaime:\n\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s absolutely right. Yup.\n\nIan:\n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not as clueless as I thought on this.\n\nJaime:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIan:\n\nSo you\u2019re suddenly there with your infrastructure to consume this. Do you have a formal agreement with the power generator to say, \u201cOkay. When you hit some point of consumption, we will start powering off machines,\u201d and you match their demand from other consumers in line?\n\nJaime:\n\nSo most Bitcoin miners have exactly this relationship with their power provider and their local community. We see a lot of this in Texas in ERCOT, where miners are helping to support grid stabilization during peak weather events and those kinds of things. It makes the most headlines. The mechanics of each contractor are slightly different, but I would take it back to first principles, which is if there\u2019s a spike in demand for power, power prices naturally go up and we naturally have to shut down when power prices go up because it\u2019s no longer economical for us to mine. There\u2019s a price at which it no longer makes sense to have those miners running, and it\u2019s always going to coincide with peaked grid demands. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s built.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, and is your pricing dynamic? I know my home energy bill is fairly static. I\u2019m not seeing changes in price throughout the billing period of a month, but I assume you\u2019re a wholesale consumer, not a retail consumer, so your billing probably works a little different.\n\nJaime:\n\nEach miner\u2019s PPAs are slightly different. Some have fixed components, variable components. Again, no PPA is created exactly equal, but the other thing that I think is so exciting and not talked about very often in our space is because a miner\u2019s number one operating expense is energy, we\u2019re constantly on a mission to find lowest cost energy solutions.\n\nSo one of the most exciting things happening in this space over the last couple of years have been miners that are going and using flare gas directly in oil and gas fields, capturing flare gas, using that to mine Bitcoin right at the site, which means that that carbon isn\u2019t being flared off or emitted into the environment. So the beautiful thing about a Bitcoin mine, you can really set it up anywhere there\u2019s an energy source. It does not need to be connected to the grid.\n\nTransmission and distribution has always been the biggest challenge for these stranded negative energy assets, which Bitcoin solves for. Again, captures a flare gas uses that to mine, makes sure that carbon doesn\u2019t go into the atmosphere, and when that flaring site runs out of gas, the rigs can literally just pick up and move to the next flare site. They\u2019re broadly portable.\n\nThe other great area of innovation is in waste methane. So we\u2019re seeing miners set up next to landfill sites, which have a similar problem. So you can use waste methane to create energy, but the landfills generally aren\u2019t able to dump that energy into the grid so they don\u2019t have an offtaker for it. Whereas if you set a mining facility up next to a landfill, you can actually use that waste methane to power the mine and keep that methane out of the atmosphere.\n\nAll of this is happening directly by the industry. The industry\u2019s coming up with this innovation. The industry is funding it. We\u2019re not dependent on government programs or government subsidies. This is all private sector driven, which is an entirely net benefit to the environment. It\u2019s a net benefit to have less gas being flared. It\u2019s a net benefit to have less methane going into the atmosphere, and Bitcoin miners are the only offtaker right now that can set up in all of these remote locations.\n\nIan:\n\nWhat does it look like when you set up next to a landfill or a natural gas drilling site? Is it like a trailer full of racks of servers?\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, they\u2019re generally on trailers, skids on trailers. Most Bitcoin mines are set up in containers. So picture a shipping container. Generally, they\u2019re between one megawatt and two and a half megawatts per container, and you can put those on flatbeds and drive them around.\n\nIan:\n\nDrive them anywhere.\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, but we\u2019re simplifying here. Then from an industry perspective, wherever we can, one of the things that has driven a lot in ERCOT in West Texas, there was a huge boom in renewable projects going on out there, solar farms, wind farms. Those are intermittent power sources, and many of them ended up being constructed in areas where there wasn\u2019t actual enough demand, load demand to support the projects. So we\u2019ve seen a number of Bitcoin miners set up directly next to wind farms, solar farms, and they\u2019re able to consume that energy when it\u2019s available. Then otherwise, they\u2019re using grid energy.\n\nSo just a ton of great stories coming out of innovation in this space. In fact, KPMG wrote and published an article a few weeks ago talking about the benefits of Bitcoin mining to the renewables transition, which is the best thing that our industry could hope for, to now have credible third parties that have done the work, that understand the space, that understand the incredible potential that Bitcoin miners have to help more rapidly and sustainably drive and help fund the renewable energy transition is incredible. So I expect we\u2019ll see a lot more of that research start to come out in the next six to 12 months.\n\nIan:\n\nAwesome. We\u2019ll link to that article in the show notes so that people can go and read it themselves. This is where I wanted to go with the conversation is, what\u2019s your perspective on getting the industry to carbon neutrality or potentially all sourced green energy? I don\u2019t know if the economics make sense today to do something like that. Obviously, you\u2019re not going to catapult the business into bankruptcy. So is there a transition plan on which you foresee this happening where you\u2019re 100% sourced from green energy? Is it possible to look that far into the future?\n\nJaime:\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to look that far into the future, for sure. Where we use natural gas, we\u2019ve established a program to start offsetting that natural gas consumption to ultimately get to a carbon neutral state. We came together as an industry over two years ago and formed the Bitcoin Mining Council. That council publishes research on a regular basis and has been able to demonstrate that the industry is broadly run, it\u2019s run on \u2026 The majority of the industry uses renewables. I think it\u2019s up to over 58% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable sources today, and that\u2019s research that will continue.\n\nWe do see some miners in the US now using nuclear as a source, which is, obviously, emission-free. I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more nuclear in our future. Then one of the things we are challenged with is how do you really capture the benefit of miners converting flare. So it\u2019s almost using flare to power. Flare isn\u2019t a renewable source, but you\u2019re actually taking carbon out of the atmosphere. So that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think has been fully standardized or thought through, and the same would be true with waste methane.\n\nIan:\n\nYou\u2019re still burning it. So there\u2019s still some carbon emission, but I\u2019m guessing the argument is that it\u2019s quite a bit lower than just releasing the methane or releasing the flare directly into the environment.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah, materially lower.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. That\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ll see if we can find a reference of somebody that\u2019s done some research on this and include it in the show notes too.\n\nJaime:\n\nYeah. Dennis Porter\u2019s done some great research. Daniel Batten\u2019s done some great research. Luckily, there\u2019s increasingly bodies of good research out there.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. I\u2019m curious as you look to the future, you\u2019ve obviously got a great diversification strategy for the business. What comes next? You\u2019ve got the merger, obviously, that\u2019s in the near future, but I imagine you\u2019re thinking a few steps ahead. Where do you go after that?\n\nJaime:\n\nI\u2019m always trying to think a few steps ahead. Hut\u2019s got such a great track record of being where the puck\u2019s going. So I think I\u2019ve put a lot of pressure on myself to keep that track record alive. Our focus is getting to the other side of this transaction successfully this fall, but we\u2019ll certainly continue to push the envelope when it comes to driving and leading innovation in this space. Really, I spent a lot of time thinking about how these worlds come together.\n\nI think when we think about what is AI, really, AI is scalable everything. There\u2019s no limit to where AI could ultimately go, but what AI lacks is truth, is hardcoded truth. It lacks provenance, it lacks identity, and that\u2019s what blockchain technology can really provide. It\u2019s really scalable truth at the end of the day. So I think these worlds, in order for them to both reach their maximum potential, they need to work together. I think that\u2019s the intersection that\u2019s going to get the most innovation and attention over the next few years.\n\nIan:\n\nThe service level discussion there on the AI meets blockchain, I haven\u2019t seen people going deep on it. So it\u2019s interesting for you to bring that up, but I think you\u2019re incredibly well-positioned to lead these two things together into the future. So Jaime, this was a fantastic conversation. Thanks so much for joining us, and I\u2019ll talk to you again soon.\n\nJaime:\n\nThanks again for having me, and sorry for making the record of the most difficult interview to schedule.\n\nIan:\n\nIt was absolutely worth it.\n\nJaime:\n\nGood. Thanks again."

        "content": "Analysts have unveiled their forecasts for October as the Bitcoin (BTC) price has pushed past the $28,000 mark. The cryptocurrency is currently experiencing an upward trajectory in October, firing up hopes for a productive month.\n\nAnalysts Predict A Bullish Run For Bitcoin Price In October\n\nThe month of October also referred to as Uptober in the crypto community has always been a bullish month for Bitcoin with a lot of gains. The cryptocurrency has always finished October with gains, doing so 8 of out 10 times since 2013.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, October has been one of the highest-performing months for Bitcoin. The crypto analyst highlighted this in a post on X (formerly Twitter), along with a graph of Bitcoin\u2019s average monthly performance.\n\n\u201cHistorically, October + November are the best performing months for #Bitcoin,\u201d Miles stated.\n\nAnother crypto analyst who is also bullish on Bitcoin this month of October is Michael Van De Poppe. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin reaching a $40,000 mark is reasonable due to a pre-eminent Q4 of 2023, triggered by a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the pre-halving rally.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Uptober. Welcome to Q4, which is leading towards a great quarter, potentially fueled by ETF approvals and the pre-halving rally. Potentially #Bitcoin to $40,000 is reasonable.\u201d Michael\u2019s post on X read.\n\nWelcome to Uptober. Welcome to Q4, which is leading towards a great quarter, potentially fueled by ETF approvals and the pre-halving rally. Potentially #Bitcoin to $40,000 is reasonable. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 1, 2023\n\nCrypto traders are also high-geared up with Uptober due to Bitcoin experiencing its first ever green in September since 2016, marking the strongest one Bitcoin has experienced since 2016. This pivotal movement of Bitcoin in September sets the pace for October (Uptober).\n\nCrypto trader Ran Neuner also pointed out the last time Bitcoin experienced an upward trajectory in September and the positive effect of this significant move, along with a yearly chart of Bitcoin on a post on X yesterday October 1, 2023.\n\nAdditionally, On-chain analytics firm Santiment recently revealed on X that Bitcoin\u2019s sharks and whale holders have now accumulated up to 13.03 million BTC in 2023, presenting a promising long-term outlook for Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to the analytic firm, the whales and sharks addresses have been accumulating Bitcoin and Tether quietly for the past six weeks.\n\nBTC Holders Are On the Rise\n\nThe expectations of approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have since had a positive effect on the BTC price. The crypto asset experienced a significant increase in adoption in different regions of the world.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recently pushed past its resistance level of $27,500 and it is currently being traded at $28,300 as of the time of writing. This shows that the cryptocurrency is slowly gaining momentum in what is established to be one of its most bullish months.\n\nCo-founder of Reflexivity Research, Will Clemente revealed Bitcoin\u2019s metrics of long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs) on X a few days ago, as well as data on Bitcoin\u2019s holder supply, circulating supply, and adjusted supply.\n\nThe chart illustrated by blockchain data and intelligence firm Glassnode showed that three out of four Bitcoin are presently owned by long-term holders. The percentage of BTC supply held by Bitcoin\u2019s long-term holders accounted for 76.09%, reaching its highest level ever and pointing to strong conviction among these \u2018diamond hands.\u2019\n\nBTC breaks above $28,000 to kick off October | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Blasts Up 8% \u2013 Is a New Bull Market Starting?\n\nIn recent times, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been abuzz with talks about Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) trajectory. This attention is further intensified by its notable 8% surge, sparking discussions about the potential onset of a new bull market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price stands at an impressive $28,000 with a robust 24-hour trading volume of $12 billion, indicating a 4% rise in a single day.\n\nUnwavering in its dominance, Bitcoin retains its top spot on CoinMarketCap, boasting an enviable market capitalization of approximately $547 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the circulating supply of Bitcoin hovers around 19,501,531 BTC coins, inching ever closer to its predetermined cap of 21 million.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nTaking a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour chart, several key price levels emerge.\n\nKey Technical Levels: The pivot point, an essential metric, is pegged at $27,347. As for resistance levels, the immediate one is at $28,706, followed closely by $29,417 and $30,275. Conversely, Bitcoin finds its immediate support at $26,636, with subsequent layers of support positioned at $26,000 and $25,325.\n\nIndicators Show Overbought Market Conditions\n\nTechnical indicators further shed light on Bitcoin\u2019s current status. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, sits at 78. Traditionally, an RSI level that eclipses the 70 mark signifies overbought conditions, alerting traders to possible pullbacks in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) unveils a value of 124, contrasted against its signal line placed at 393. Notably, the MACD line below the signal line suggests a potential shift towards downward momentum.\n\nThe 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50 EMA) is another noteworthy metric. Currently valued at $27,000, it provides a bullish sign as Bitcoin\u2019s price trades above this level.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIn the realm of chart patterns, Bitcoin presents a symmetrical triangle pattern, climaxing with a breakout at the $27,350 mark. Historically, such breakouts are often precursors to bullish momentum, suggesting that Bitcoin\u2019s ascent might continue.\n\nTo wrap up, the trajectory for Bitcoin leans heavily bullish. For investors, there\u2019s a possible strategy in buying above the $27,500 mark, with targets set at either $28,800 or $29,300.\n\nHowever, a word of caution: should Bitcoin struggle to cross the $28,300 barrier, it could catalyze a selling trend.\n\nLooking forward, Bitcoin seems poised to challenge the $28,800 resistance level in the upcoming days. And, if the market remains favourable, there\u2019s a plausible chance for Bitcoin to strive for the $29,300 pinnacle.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay up-to-date with the world of digital assets by exploring our handpicked collection of the best 15 alternative cryptocurrencies and ICO projects to keep an eye on in 2023.\n\nOur list has been curated by professionals from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring expert advice and critical insights for your cryptocurrency investments.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to discover the potential of these digital assets and keep yourself informed.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews.com\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."
