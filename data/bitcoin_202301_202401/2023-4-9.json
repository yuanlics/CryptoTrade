        "title": "Bitcoin's insatiable appetite for energy is driving up pollution and costs for Americans, report finds - The Verge",
        "content": "Bitcoin mines in the US have had a tremendous impact on power grids, a New York Times investigation reveals. The mines \u2014 which are giant data farms \u2014 use vastly more electricity than the communities surrounding them, driving up pollution from coal and gas power plants. The crypto mines also make electricity bills more expensive for their neighbors, even as the companies profit off incentives that grid operators offer to prevent blackouts during an energy crunch.\n\nThis is the most comprehensive analysis yet of Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the environment and energy system in the US. And it comes as Democratic lawmakers press federal agencies to require crypto companies to divulge information about their operations. The Times has startling numbers for individual crypto mines and the industry as a whole, which it got by pouring over financial records, satellite imagery, and studies it commissioned from outside research groups.\n\nThe newspaper identified 34 of the biggest crypto mines in the US, each operating at 40 megawatts or higher. Every single one of them, on its own, uses at least 30,000 times as much electricity as the average home in America. In Rockdale, Texas, the largest and most energy-hungry Bitcoin mining facility in the country burns through as much electricity as the closest 300,000 homes combined.\n\nIn Rockdale, Texas, the largest and most energy-hungry Bitcoin mining facility in the country burns through as much electricity as the closest 300,000 homes combined\n\nThe industry\u2019s expansion in the US has been swift, another stressor for US power grids. The US only became the world\u2019s biggest hub for Bitcoin miners after China kicked them out in 2021. The Times compares the new power demand coming from American crypto mines to suddenly adding another \u201cNew York City\u2019s worth of residences.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is a purposely energy-demanding blockchain. To validate transactions and generate new tokens, Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d use specialized hardware to solve mathematical puzzles. The amount of energy needed to solve those puzzles is supposed to dissuade bad actors from messing with the ledger. The puzzles get increasingly complex with time as more people try to solve them, requiring more sophisticated software that eats up more electricity in the process.\n\nPollution stemming from the added energy demand of Bitcoin mines is about as much as the annual emissions from 3.5 million new gas-guzzling cars, the Times reports. Promises from the industry that Bitcoin mines would spur renewable energy growth haven\u2019t panned out. Coal and gas plants meet about 85 percent of the demand Bitcoin mining adds to power grids, according to an analysis the Times commissioned from the nonprofit Watttime.\n\nOn top of making pollution worse, crypto mines also affect Americans\u2019 energy bills. Skyrocketing demand raises electricity prices and forces nearby households to compete for limited supply. The energy consumption has raised other customers\u2019 electricity bills by almost 5 percent in Texas, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis commissioned by the Times. That amounts to $1.8 billion per year in higher electricity costs for consumers across Texas, which is home to about a third of the crypto mines scrutinized.\n\nWhile they drive other people\u2019s bills up, crypto companies have managed to game energy systems in their favor. The company operating the Bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas, paid just 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour last year, it reported to investors. That\u2019s compared to 13.5 cents residential customers typically paid that year.\n\nHow does a crypto mine get electricity for so cheap? In Texas, it can benefit from a program that pays industrial businesses to power down when the grid is under too much pressure. This happened in February 2021 when a severe cold snap disrupted energy supply \u2014 leaving millions of residents without power and ultimately killing hundreds of people. During the disaster, the state power grid operator paid one crypto mining company an average of $175,000 an hour to power down its computers. In 2020, five mines made at least $60 million from that energy-saving program, the Times reports."

        "title": "75% of those who've heard of crypto aren't confident in its safety, reliability - Pew Research Center",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets are taking hits from all sides \u2013 from declines in value to multiple corporate bankruptcies to lawsuits and regulatory threats. Among the vast majority of Americans who say they have heard at least a little about cryptocurrency (88%), three-quarters say they are not confident that current ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 13-19. This comes out to about two-thirds of all U.S. adults.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten adults who have heard about cryptocurrency (39%) say they are not at all confident and an additional 36% are not very confident in the reliability and safety of cryptocurrencies. On the other end of the spectrum, few of these adults are extremely (2%) or very (4%) confident in cryptocurrencies. About one-in-five (18%) say they are somewhat confident.\n\nWhile concern about cryptocurrency is broad, some groups of Americans are more concerned than others. For instance, adults ages 50 and older who have heard about cryptocurrency are more likely than their younger counterparts to say they are not confident in its reliability and safety (85% vs. 66%).\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to examine Americans\u2019 views of and personal experiences with cryptocurrency. This survey was conducted among 10,701 U.S. adults from March 13-19, 2023. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology. This survey includes a total sample size of 375 Asian adults. The sample primarily includes English-speaking Asian Americans and therefore may not be representative of the overall Asian adult population. Despite this limitation, Asian adults\u2019 responses are incorporated into the general population figures throughout this report.\n\nWomen are also slightly more skeptical of investing in, trading or using cryptocurrencies. Among Americans who have heard about cryptocurrency, 80% of women say they are not confident in it, compared with 71% of men.\n\nAttitudes also differ based on whether someone has invested in cryptocurrency. While one-in-five cryptocurrency users say they are extremely or very confident that it is safe and reliable, that share drops to 2% among those who are familiar with cryptocurrency but have not invested. Still, many who have invested in cryptocurrency also have concerns about its security: 43% of this group say they are not very or not at all confident in it.\n\nWho uses cryptocurrency in the U.S.?\n\nOverall, 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency. This share is mostly unchanged from previous Center surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAs was true in past surveys, younger men are more likely to use cryptocurrency compared with men 50 and older and women of any age. For example, 41% of men ages 18 to 29 say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 16% of women in the same age range.\n\nCryptocurrency use also differs by race, ethnicity and income level. Some 24% of Asian adults and 21% of Black or Hispanic adults say they have ever invested in or used a cryptocurrency, compared with 14% of White adults.\n\nAbout one-in-five adults with upper (22%) or middle (19%) incomes have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 13% of those with lower incomes.\n\nFew cryptocurrency users first used it within the past year\n\nThe survey also asked Americans when they first used cryptocurrency. Roughly three-quarters of those who have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency (74%) say they did so for the first time one to five years ago. Much smaller shares say they first did this within the past year (16%) or more than five years ago (10%).\n\nThere are differences by race, ethnicity and household income among newer cryptocurrency investors. Black users (27%) are more likely than White users (12%) to say they first used cryptocurrency within the past year. Roughly two-in-ten Hispanic users (21%) say the same. (There were not enough Asian American cryptocurrency users to be broken out into a separate analysis.) And about three-in-ten users from lower-income households report first investing in cryptocurrency within the past year, compared with about one-in-ten adults from middle- or upper-income households.\n\nSome past cryptocurrency users no longer have it today\n\nRoughly three-in-ten adults (31%) who have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency say they currently do not have any cryptocurrency. Still, a majority (69%) say they do currently have cryptocurrency.\n\nThose who live in lower-income households (43%) are more likely than those in middle- (30%) or upper-income (21%) households to have given up cryptocurrency. And women who have ever used cryptocurrency are more likely than men in this same group to say they currently do not have any of the currency (37% vs. 29%).\n\nRoughly one-in-five cryptocurrency users say the investments have hurt their personal finances at least a little\n\nA plurality of cryptocurrency users (45%) report that their investments have performed worse than they expected, a result that is statistically unchanged since July 2022, when the Center last asked about this. In comparison, 15% say their investments have done better than expected, 32% say they have done about the same as expected and 7% are unsure.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the impact these investments have had on users\u2019 personal finances, three-in-five users (60%) say that they have neither helped nor hurt. Roughly equal shares say that these investments have helped (20%) or hurt (19%) their finances. Just 7% say that cryptocurrency has helped their finances a lot and 3% say that it has hurt a lot. \u00ad\n\nCollege graduates (25%) and those with some college experience (20%) are more likely than those with a high school education or less (10%) to say that their cryptocurrency investments hurt their personal finances.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold: Here's What the Founder of the World's Largest Hedge Fund Would Choose - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin and gold surged in March after Silicon Valley Bank led a string of bank failures and liquidity crises. Few analysts were surprised by these price movements as both are used to circumvent banks and other centralized financial institutions. The question is, which one is a better choice in the current economic climate?\n\nRay Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has weighed in on the great Bitcoin vs. gold or digital gold vs. real gold debate. Few were surprised to hear his opinion as he is well known for his bullish stance on gold. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo at Fox Business, Dalio expressed that he much prefers gold over Bitcoin, even though he said that he holds a small amount of Bitcoin.\n\nDalio has soured further on Bitcoin since the interview, saying that Bitcoin \u201chas no relation to anything\u201d and that it receives disproportionate attention. Dalio believes that Bitcoin's status as a form of digital gold is still unproven, citing concerns that it\u2019s too volatile to be money or a store of value. He acknowledges the potential of blockchain tech; he just doesn\u2019t think Bitcoin will be the one to win out.\n\nIn contrast, gold is stable because it has been a reliable store of value and medium of exchange for thousands of years. Its stability, scarcity and inherent value make it a trusted asset for preserving wealth.\n\nDalio has emphasized that he is not opposed to cryptocurrencies in general but remains skeptical of their ability to replace gold. He has previously stated that he owns \"some Bitcoin,\" but his personal investments in the digital asset have been limited compared to his holdings in gold.\n\nOne of the main arguments against Bitcoin as a store of value is its volatility. Although the digital asset has seen a meteoric rise in value over the past decade, it has also experienced significant price fluctuations. In contrast, gold's price has remained relatively stable, providing investors with a more secure option for preserving their wealth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother concern Dalio has raised is the possibility of government intervention in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent podcast, he warned that \u201cin history, they\u2019ve outlawed gold and they\u2019ve outlawed silver and so on, and they could outlaw Bitcoin.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only one who expects world governments to try to shut down a currency they have no control over before it supplants their own.\n\nAs governments around the world start to pay closer attention to digital assets, there is a growing risk of regulatory crackdowns that could impact Bitcoin's value and adoption. Gold, on the other hand, is less likely to face such intervention because it\u2019s a physical asset, it already plays a large role in the global economy and would be extremely difficult to ban. It can also provide unique exposure to things like volatility and fear in the markets, making it a popular tool for diversification and hedging.\n\nInvestors are turning to gold and silver in droves to protect their portfolios as uncertainty rises in the economy.

Banks typically purchase stocks in these cases on behalf of clients and investors in active or passive strategies run out of an asset management arm\n\nFidelity, according to an SEC filing tracking stock purchases through year end 2022, snapped up 97,199 MSTR shares.\n\nBoth regulatory filings are not necessarily indicative of overall holdings for either company.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) have closely tracked the price of Bitcoin since the company began holding the digital currency as a reserve on its balance sheet. And scores of traders still view the stock as one of the closest publicly traded proxies for spot bitcoin exposures.\n\nBTC vs MSTR 2 year / Yahoo Finance\n\nYouwei Yang, chief economist at Bit Mining, told Blockworks in an interview that MicroStrategy continues to be known as the \u201ctop choice\u201d for obtaining indirect bitcoin exposure via public and regulated markets.\n\nPlus, bitcoin has been on the upswing for the last three to four months, Yang said, making it a no-brainer for traders to hop on MicroStrategy shares and other bitcoin exposed assets.\n\n\u201cStarting [in] early January, the coins have been climbing quite a bit and it\u2019s [natural] for a trader, whether small or large, to jump in to [buy] any exposure related to crypto or bitcoin,\u201d Yang said.\n\nThe SEC disclosures come as MicroStrategy has continued its long time corporate strategy of adding more and more bitcoin to its portfolio.

        "content": "Industrial-scale bitcoin mining facilities in the US create as much carbon pollution as 3.5 million gas-powered cars, and Texas, which boasts the largest number of mining facilities in the country, will see the cost of electricity rise nearly 5% by mid-2023 due to cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\n\nThose stunning figures come from analyses by tech nonprofit WattTime and energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie for a New York Times investigation into the rise of large-scale bitcoin mining in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin miners operate large arrays of computers that are paid fees to solve the cryptological problems that allow the currency to maintain a decentralized database of all its transactions. The investigation found 34 mining operations, each drawing more than 40 megawatts of electricity; many of them were started in the US after China banned the activity there in 2021, partly due to concerns over power usage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, many of the mines were able to profit from agreements with electrical grids to pause their operations during emergencies. Systems to reward large electricity users that commit to shutting down when the grid is strained, whether they actually do or not, predate the bitcoin miners, but participating in them added tens of millions of dollars to their aggregate bottom lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs bitcoin too big for Texas?\n\nTexas, which governor Gregg Abbott wants to be a \u201ccrypto leader,\u201d has seen major stress on its grid in recent years, particularly rolling blackouts in February 2021 and a failure in 2022 that left 70,000 people without power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe additional load created by the miners, equal to tens of thousands of new homes, as well as their participation in incentive programs, increased the cost of electricity by nearly 5% across the state and by as much as 9% in some West Texas communities.\n\nRiot Platforms, the largest miner discussed in the New York Times story, said it paid 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in Texas in 2022. Other industrial power users in the state paid 7.2 cents, while residents paid 13.5 cents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin proponents say that other industries aren\u2019t judged on their electricity usage, and that they don\u2019t have a say in how the power they buy is generated. But grid experts say their constant demand for power makes bitcoin mines more reliant on plants that burn fossil fuel.\n\n\n\nThe other question is whether their benefits match the costs: While most forms of power usage offer some obvious added value, the jury is still out on what kind of advantages bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer society besides an opportunity for speculation.\n\nUnlike other industrial power users, which typically generate jobs and products, bitcoin mines employ few people, and the gains from the currency largely accumulate for insiders. The price of a bitcoin has risen 76% this year to nearly $30,000, but it is still more than 50% off its peak value in 2021 after the collapse of FTX and disillusionment with the idea of \u201cWeb3.\u201d"

The Suffolk clerk is an independently elected office, but its data center is under the purview of the county's Department of Information Technology.\n\nThe question for management, said John Bandler, who teaches cybersecurity at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, is, \u201cHow did it allow this to happen essentially in the open and for so long?\u201d\n\nSuffolk officials, including Chief Deputy County Executive Lisa Black and IT Commissioner Scott Mastellon, did not respond to numerous requests for interviews. Deputy County Executive Vanessa Baird-Streeter said: \"We will not comment on a pending criminal matter being prosecuted by the district attorney's office.\"\n\nCybersecurity experts interviewed by Newsday said the bitcoin mining might have contributed to opening up the county\u2019s system to the ransomware attack. Bellone last year released a report on the cyberattack that found it started in the county clerk's office as early December 2021; took advantage of a common security flaw in computer systems; and spread throughout the computer network, halting the county's websites and servers. In the months after Naples' arrest, the county clerk's office sought a security upgrade, but a steering committee \u2014 chaired by the county IT commissioner \u2014 rebuffed it, according to emails obtained by Newsday.\n\n\"The issue is that there are so many other attacks on municipalities around the country that are going through this. So, are they related? Possibly. Probably. Certainly, I think there\u2019s a huge chance it was,\u201d said Michael Nizich, director of the Entrepreneurship and Technology and Innovation Center at New York Institute of Technology.\n\nWill Cong, Cornell University Rudd Family professor of management, said the bitcoin mining may have indirectly increased the county\u2019s exposure to a ransomware attack, just as browsing certain websites does.\n\nAttorney William Keahon is representing Christopher Naples, the Suffolk County employee who allegedly ran an illegal bitcoin mining operation. Credit: James Carbone\n\nBellone suggested in a December news conference that Naples, \u201cthe architect of the clerk\u2019s IT environment,\u201d for years delayed a key security upgrade that could have blocked the ransomware attack because he didn\u2019t want outsiders discovering his illegal mining operation.\n\nKeahon disputed that.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do everything he can to shift the blame,\u201d he said of Bellone.\n\nIn response to Keahon, Baird-Streeter, the deputy county executive, said: \"No official forensic examination has been released nor has the Legislature conducted their review, obviously.\"\n\nThe full court file lays out the suspicions of county IT employees and their unease with the unusual devices they saw not just in the data center but around Naples\u2019 desk. The file also paints a picture of an increasingly brazen Naples, who kept bringing in more bitcoin mining devices, even after a subordinate asked about them. There were so many devices \u2014 46 in all \u2014 that they raised the temperature in the data center by 20 degrees and set off alarms.\n\nNonetheless, the court file shows, IT employees were reluctant to remove them, despite the damage the high heat could do to other equipment, or even to confront Naples.\n\nOne systems analyst, Christopher Rizopoulos, who worked for Naples, told detectives in a statement: \u201cI am aware the bitcoining units were not OK. I wanted to notify someone. However, I was really concerned about repercussions from Chris Naples. I didn\u2019t want him to seek revenge.\u201d\n\n\"I am aware the bitcoining units were not OK. I wanted to notify someone. However, I was really concerned about repercussions from Chris Naples. I didn\u2019t want him to seek revenge.\" Source: Southampton Town Justice Court\n\nNaples started working at the clerk\u2019s office in 2000 at the age of 21 under then-Clerk Ed Romaine, who is now the Brookhaven' Town supervisor. Naples\u2019 father, builder Jim Naples Sr., has contributed money to Romaine's political campaigns, giving at least $7,650, state records show.\n\nJim Naples Sr. also contributed at least $2,300 to Judy Pascale, who followed Romaine as clerk.\n\nRizopoulos also told detectives that in 2017, Brian Bartholomew, the county\u2019s information security coordinator, said, \u201cThese guys are bitmining.\u201d\n\nThe Suffolk County Clerk's office, where employees reported seeing bitcoin mining devices. Credit: Chris Ware\n\nBartholomew\u2019s attorney, Ray Doyle, declined to comment. Rizopoulos did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nAnother systems analyst, Matthew Ballantine, became alarmed when he noticed the excessive heat in the data center.\n\n\u201cI know that heat is not good for the equipment, so I looked for the source of the heat,\u201d he said in a statement to investigators. \u201cThat\u2019s what caused me to find several devices that appeared to be hidden inside the server racks.\u201d\n\nAt first, Ballantine wasn\u2019t sure what they were and thought there might be a legitimate reason for them. Later in the day, he realized that they might be bitcoin miners. But because he wasn\u2019t authorized to remove the equipment, he instead told Vincent Cordiale, assistant manager of IT operations. Ballantine offered to photograph the equipment the next time he was in the data center. He took the photos of 10 bitcoin miners on Feb. 9, 2021, and showed them to Cordiale.\n\nBallantine and Cordiale did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\nAround July 16, 2021, Ballantine returned to the data center with several other systems analysts to work on some network problems. One analyst, Anthony Oliveto, noticed the excessive heat. Ballantine pointed out the devices and saw additional ones sitting atop server racks, according to his statement.\n\n\u201cNone of us had any more conversations about the equipment, but I believe everyone had an understanding that they were miners that probably did not belong in the data center,\u201d Ballantine said in his statement.\n\nAn IT employee who is not named in court records told his superiors, who notified the Suffolk district attorney, according to a statement by district attorney investigator Christopher Acquilino, who led the investigation.\n\nWhat followed was an investigation marked both by technical complexity and cloak-and-dagger technique, such as entering the building in the middle of the night to install covert video equipment.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, special investigator John Primiano and systems analyst Mark Enoch visited the data center after employees left, about 6:45 p.m. They immediately noticed the high heat \u2014 it was 89 degrees \u2014 and saw an LCD display flashing a red warning light as a high-temperature alarm, despite several large fans in the room. The ideal temperature is just under 70 degrees.\n\nSeveral branch circuits were nearing overload, as the miners were connected to county power strips. They also noticed that someone had put duct tape over the miners\u2019 identification labels, according to Primiano\u2019s statement.\n\nThey counted 21 bitcoin miners.\n\nAbout five hours later at 12:15 a.m., investigators installed a video camera system in the public corridor next to the data center, according to Primiano\u2019s statement. They finished by 2 a.m. and left the building.\n\nTheir nighttime work paid off. They saw Naples installing one of the devices in the data center, according to Acquilino\u2019s statement.\n\nDistrict attorney investigators executed a search warrant on Aug. 19, 2021. This time, they found 46 machines.\n\n\u201cSCDAO investigators found devices in server racks, on top of server racks, on Naples\u2019 desk, under removable floorboards in the data center and in an unused electrical wall panel,\u201d according to Acquilino\u2019s statement.\n\nEquipment used in the illegal bitcoin mining operation that Suffolk authorities displayed in 2021. Credit: John Roca\n\nNaples showed up at 11:30 a.m. District attorney investigators searched the data center and Naples agreed to answer questions, according to Primiano\u2019s statement. Naples acknowledged that he installed the miners to earn money and \u201cindicated that he bought the servers from eBay and 'they were six for $90.' \"\n\nTwo hours after investigators removed the machines, the temperature in the data center dropped 20 degrees.\n\nJust how much Naples earned in cryptocurrency is not revealed in the court file. But at the time he was mining, a single bitcoin was worth $30,000 to $40,000, Cong said.\n\nA bitcoin is now worth about $28,000.\n\nBitcoin is a form of cryptocurrency. It is based on what is known as the blockchain, which is a series of data points linked together. The blockchain serves as a public ledger that anyone can see. Each block in the chain is encrypted through a highly complex and secure algorithm. Because no one has been able to break the code, it is extremely valuable, Nizich said.\n\nAdding a block to the chain requires that somebody make sure that the encryption was done right. That\u2019s called \u201cproof of work,\u201d which is the same as bitcoin mining. That\u2019s done through a complex mathematical process. When someone successfully completes a proof of work, the reward is a bitcoin. Because people all over the world are trying to solve the same mathematical problems, there\u2019s intense competition, Nizich said.\n\n\u201cSo you have to have a really good algorithm and a really powerful device \u2014 not just a single computer or PC \u2014 you have to have a very special device, using what is called an ASIC processor, or you have to have some sort of distributing process level. It wouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019d have usually in your home office,\u201d he said.\n\nNaples\u2019 operation was \u201cextremely sophisticated,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause these devices use enormous amounts of energy, it\u2019s not practical to do it at home. A single device uses the same amount it takes to run a house for 24 hours in just 45 minutes, Nizich said.\n\nA conservative estimate of the cost of the electricity used by Naples' machines was $6,477 from Feb. 10, 2021, though Aug. 10, 2021, according to the court file.\n\nThe machines also used so much county bandwidth that employees working on the weekend couldn\u2019t access the internet, Bellone said in December."

        "content": "The U.S. state of Arkansas joined Montana and Texas this year in proposing legislation to regulate Bitcoin mining while also offering legal protections to companies operating such businesses, a stance in contrast to national regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that have fined and filed lawsuits against companies running cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSee related article: Solana introduces \u2018state compression\u2019 to lower NFT storage costs\n\nFast facts\n\nThe state\u2019s bitcoin bill, known as the Data Centers Act of 2023, has passed in both the Arkansas House of Representatives and Senate and now awaits the governor\u2019s approval. The bill, proposed by Republican Senator Joshua Bryant on March 30, seeks to protect miners from discriminatory regulations and taxes with clearer guidelines.\n\nIt states that crypto miners will be required \u201cto pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility\u2019s generation capabilities or transmission network.\u201d\n\nUnder the legislation, crypto miners will have the same rights as data centers, which the state recognizes as a value to the local economy.\n\nThe move in Arkansas reflects a similar action in Montana in February when the state Senate passed a bill to offer legal protections to cryptocurrency miners, such as prevention of discriminatory electricity rates.\n\nThe picture in Texas is more mixed, with legislation introduced on April 4 that would eliminate some incentives for crypto miners in the state, while in March, the state introduced a bill in support of Bitcoin mining, which is still pending at the House Committee on State Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. regulators such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have fined and filed lawsuits against crypto trading platforms, such as Kraken and Binance, claiming they lack legal approvals to sell some of their services.\n\nCongressman Tom Emmer of the Republican Party has criticized SEC chair Gary Gensler during a podcast appearance, saying Gensler is \u201cblindly spraying the crypto community with enforcement actions while completely missing the truly bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe administration of President Joe Biden has also proposed an excise tax on crypto miners that equals 30 percent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nSee related article: Thai opposition pledges US$15 bln in digital tokens: Bloomberg"

        "content": "Bitcoin is a wasteful asset that doesn't add to global welfare, Dieter Wermuth, economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management, wrote in a recent note.\n\nHe says the bitcoin market is highly centralized, and primarily benefits early investors and miners.\n\nThe tokens fail as currency, given their high volatility and lack of real-world use, according to Wermuth.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite calls from crypto enthusiasts to HODL (hold on for dear life), letting go of bitcoin may be good for world prosperity, at least according to one economist.\n\nThat's because the cryptocurrency is a wasteful investment that takes funds away from general economic growth, Dieter Wermuth \u2014 economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management \u2014 wrote in a note published on Wednesday.\n\nNot only does the speculative asset not contribute to broader welfare, it creates social inequalities and allows for money laundering, tax evasion and major climate deterioration, Wermuth said.\n\n\"Bitcoin activities are a negative-sum game,\" he wrote. \"Without crypto, the economy would be better off \u2014 there would be more money for consumption and investment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetailed below are three reasons to support Wermuth's negative assertions about bitcoin.\n\n(1) It doesn't distribute wealth equally\n\nAfter the front-and-center cryptocurrency bitcoin first launched in 2009, it went from being a virtually worthless asset to holding a level of nearly $68,000 by 2021. But Wermuth argues that the gains were not enjoyed by every investor; rather, an uneven wealth distribution formed that favored crypto insiders.\n\nTo illustrate, a 2021 Wall Street Journal article reported that 0.01% of bitcoin investors held 27% of coins then in circulation, or approximately $232 billion at the time.\n\nWermuth notes that coin-producing crypto miners and those who had positions long before the 2021 rally overwhelmingly profited from the currency's gains, while those who joined late helped make the initial investors richer \u2014 only to potentially undergo losses themselves when bitcoin crashed by around 75% in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(2) It's not really a currency\n\nThe intense volatility that bitcoin has experienced through its history also demonstrates how ill-equipped it is for a monetary role.\n\n\"Bitcoin has been brought to market with the narrative that it would be a better, more stable currency than traditional money,\" Wermuth wrote. \"This story has been a deception.\"\n\nHis assertion runs on the premise that money needs to attain three core roles \u2014 as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value \u2014 all of which bitcoin performs poorly at.\n\nIn order to facilitate stability, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have a limit to the amount of tokens that will enter circulation. However, this is quickly undone when investors treat it as an investment and create more daily volatility than other markets, Wermuth said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, he cites the fact that bitcoin has yet to have widespread use as a purchasing device, and hasn't been accepted as a means to pay taxes. Transfers between bitcoin accounts, meanwhile, continue to be slower and more expensive than traditional ones.\n\n(3) It's a negative-sum asset\n\nDespite the elements outlined above, bitcoin generates a great deal of financial liquidity without any proof that it contributes to productivity growth, Wermuth said.\n\n\"Back in November 2021 bitcoin's market capitalization reached 1.27 trillion dollars,\" he wrote. \"When Lehman Brothers went belly-up in 2008, a smaller amount of money had triggered the largest financial crisis and the deepest recession of the post-World War period.\"\n\nOn top of that, the process of bitcoin mining \u2014 which uses computer hardware to add transactions in the crypto to a blockchain in return for newly minted coins \u2014 is so energy intensive that Wermuth described it as a \"major climate killer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroader crypto-market issues\n\nHis note comes at a time of high-profile challenges for the broader crypto world \u2014 ones that may have started deteriorating investor confidence in the asset.\n\nMost recently, the collapse of the crypto-friendly Signature Bank revealed that it had faced a US probe indicating that its crypto clients may have been taking part in money laundering. At the same time, crypto-exchange Binance is facing a US lawsuit, with one of the allegations citing that it knew that it was facilitating criminal transactions.\n\nBefore that, November's FTX collapse demonstrated the risks for crypto investors operating in the unregulated market, as many of the lender's clients saw their holdings wiped out.\n\n\"I wonder whether it will be enough to just step up regulatory efforts, or to forbid the participation of banks and other financial institutions \u2014 or to get rid of these markets altogether (if this is still an option),\" he wrote."

        "content": "The Lightning Network, a layer-2 payment solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is six years old.\n\nProducts, users and the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) sent on the Lightning Network (LN) has sky-rocketed in 2023, despite the price per Bitcoin slipping under $20,000.\n\nSource: Twitter/Kerooke\n\nThe LN has benefited from the integration into the Nostr protocol \u2014 in which users can send one another satoshis (small amounts of Bitcoin) \u2014 and the proliferation of custodial and noncustodial LN wallets, and its formal integration in territories such as El Salvador and Lugano.\n\nFrom Mediterranean cities to Senegal, the LN is also growing as a peer-to-peer means of payment. Nonetheless, despite its growth, concerns still stymie the network, according to key opinion leaders interviewed during Advancing Bitcoin Developer Conference in London.\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of Bitcoin mobile app Fedi and maintainer of the Fedimint protocol, explained that running a Lightning node in 2023 is still difficult and that some people don\u2019t bother when faced with the complexity:\n\n\u201cTo keep your own Lightning node running, to keep well connected, like keep your connections up to date with the nodes that are relevant \u2014 it\u2019s a part-time job essentially.\u201d\n\nMatthias Koller, co-founder of Swiss company Pocket Bitcoin, said, \u201cIt has become substantially easier compared to early 2018. However, it is still not \u2018easy\u2019 for the masses.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s exciting to see the development around full node implementations and the progress that\u2019s been made.\u201d\n\nSirion, who wrote the open-source code Fedimint and now works on the Fedi team, explained that custodial Lightning wallets, such as Wallet of Satoshi, are popular among Bitcoin advocates. He\u2019s right: It is the wallet of choice for Nostr, a space dominated by Bitcoiners.\n\nHowever, the reliance on custodial wallets could be a problem for the LN. Trusting a third party with funds, such as Wallet of Satoshi, is contrary to the Bitcoiner mantra, \u201cnot your keys, not your coins,\u201d Sirion said.\n\nFurthermore, Koller explained that the reason many Bitcoiners end up sidestepping the \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d mantra is that some of the custodial solutions are just so easy. \u201cIt\u2019s set up in seconds, ready to transact,\u201d he said, noting:\n\n\u201cBut in fact, it\u2019s no different from keeping Bitcoin on an exchange \u2014 it\u2019s not your Bitcoin. It\u2019s risky if people aren\u2019t aware of the risks involved and the amounts kept in custodial wallets grow in size.\u201d\n\nHowever, Koller conceded that custodial solutions are fine for \u201cpocket money.\u201d The LN is ideal for micropayments, but even so, trusting centralized wallet providers could erode privacy. In response to the rise in custodial wallets, one Twitter user explained, \u201cIf payments are being made from custodial mobile wallets to custodial mobile wallets it\u2019s very simple to link senders and receivers.\u201d\n\nSirion hopes that the rollout of Fedi will undermine the reliance on third parties and provide a straightforward and privacy-centric route to using Bitcoin and Lightning. Fedi uses the open-source protocol Fedimint in which trusted members of a community share ownership of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already using custodial service, at least use one where you have a reason to trust the people that are.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the reliance on Lightning custodial wallets could be in part due to the difficulties in running a Lightning node. Node software businesses, such as Amboss and Umbrel, attempt to remedy the issue with improved UX, but in comparison to downloading Bitcoin Core to run a Bitcoin node, there are more steps, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin is required to run a Lightning node.\n\nFurthermore, in the world of Venmo, Revolut and other near-instant centralized payment services, there\u2019s a risk that Lightning\u2019s free and frictionless payments do not necessarily solve a pressing problem. During Advancing Bitcoin, Alex Leishman, CEO of Bitcoin firm River Financial, told Cointelegraph, \u201cBitcoiners use Lightning mostly because it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s not solving deep problems in their life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Lightning Network growth is organic, coming from real-world adoption\n\nKoller joked that the LN is \u201cBitcoin on steroids. Fast, cheap and perfect for small, daily transactions.\u201d Plus, it\u2019s still substantially more private than Google Pay or using Visa or Mastercard at a checkout:\n\n\u201cThe pain I feel every time I have to use a credit card online is just gut-wrenching. Give me Lightning everywhere!\u201d\n\nLeishman would like to see more people working backward from real human problems observed worldwide and see where Lightning can fit in. For example, in the West, the LN could resolve inter-institutional transactions.\n\n\u201cIt can really move the needle on a number of things in the West and in the developing world.\u201d\n\nIn El Salvador, some Salvadorans use the Lightning Network, but cash is still king. Leishman mentions the Taro protocol, which, once implemented, could allow for assets to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cDo people actually just want dollars? And does that mean we want to try to build stablecoins on Lightning with Taro?\u201d he said.\n\nTaro Diagram. Source: River Financial\n\nThese assets could be deposited into Lightning Network payment channels and transacted instantly. In theory, LN users could hold several balances in their wallets, including different stablecoins or dollars.\n\nCurrently, developers can mint, send and receive Taro assets on the test network of the Bitcoin blockchain. In the meantime, LN developers will continue to seek out more user-centric Bitcoin solutions."

        "content": "Bitcoin Reclaims $30,000\n\nThe road to redemption for the world\u2019s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency has been a rough one (to say the least) and has had plenty of skeptics. However, last night, Bitcoin breached the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022. Against all odds, BTC is up ~80% year-to-date. Here are a few important things you should know:\n\n\u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d: More times than not, the best time to buy a market is when the news is the worst. Indeed, this turned out to be the case for BTC and various BTC proxies such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). In November 2022, doomed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy (after committing the largest fraud since Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme), shaking crypto markets. Over that short time, BTC has doubled.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSafe Haven Asset: For months in 2022, Bitcoin was closely correlated to equities, specifically tech, and the Nasdaq. However, in the past few months, Bitcoin has been trading more in sync with gold. Finally, it appears that \u201cBitcoin Maximalists\u201d that believe BTC is a safe haven asset and not just a \u201cyolo\u201d product of easy money central bank policies have something to hang their hats on.\n\nBitcoin Behemoth is Back Onside: In 2020, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a public software company in business since the late 1990s, took the bold and unorthodox step to move to the \u201cBitcoin Standard\u201d. Led by its outspoken and eccentric founder Michael Saylor, MSTR has purchased nearly $4 billion worth of Bitcoin, which translates to roughly 130,000 BTC! In a show of conviction or unfounded confidence (you decide), Saylor and MSTR have dollar cost averaged into BTC the entire way down is finally back to their cost basis of around $30,000 per coin.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBitcoin Halving is Slated for Early 2024: Roughly one year from now, Bitcoin will experience its next \u201cHalving\u201d. Bitcoin halvings occur every four years and refers to when the reward for Bitcoin miners (network validators) is cut in half. Each halving event means that the number of new Bitcoin being let out into circulation is slashed in half. Remember, unlike central bank currencies, Bitcoin is finite \u2013 there will only ever be 21 million in existence. Past halving events have led to dramatic bull markets in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners are on Fire: Year-to-date, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) is up 97%, making it one of the top-performing ETFs in the entire market. The ETF\u2019s top three holdings include Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nLong-Term Technical Picture is Improving: While it is hard to chase Bitcoin into a large round number like $30,000 after a rapid short-term move, BTC and BTC proxies like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are showing improving longer-term technical. GBTC just triggered a bullish golden cross \u2013 a bullish technical signal that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day from below. While the signal failed the last time, when it happened in 2020, GBTC shot higher from $10 to $60 is rapid order fashion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.\n\nMr Baio said that he had received a tip-off that the existence was filed as an issue a year ago, and that it was assigned to the engineer who added it, but that there has not been any update since.\n\nOfficially, Apple has stayed largely separate from cryptocurrency, even as it moves into more traditional financial services such as payments and lending.\n\nIn 2021, chief executive Tim Cook said Apple was \u201clooking at\u201d cryptocurrencies and that he had invested in it personally.

If the report shows inflation dropping, it could be the next possible catalyst that furthers BTC's upward move.\n\nOn April 10, BTC price soared 3.37% to over $29,300 after a quiet Easter weekend. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s intraday gains appeared alongside a drop in U.S. equities, a rare decoupling that highlights the coin\u2019s diminishing risk-on characteristics.\n\nBTC/USD year-to-date returns versus U.S. stock indexes. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pre-CPI dynamic could be in effect\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will release March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on April 12, which is expected to show inflation down to 5.1% from 6.0% year-over-year previously.\n\nA slowdown in headline CPI increases the prospects of the Federal Reserve shifting in a more dovish direction. Conversely, persistent inflationary forces could lead traders to bet on more interest rate hikes in May.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise above $29,000 suggest that crypto traders have been pricing in a drop in inflation, which, in turn, could lead to a potential Fed pivot.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, climbed 0.7% on April 10, which, alongside a weaker U.S. stock market, shows macro investors see a rate hike ahead.\n\nDXY daily price chart.

        "content": "The long weekend has not produced any fireworks in Bitcoin (BTC) price, which continues to trade inside an ever-narrowing range. Bitcoin is on track to form a third consecutive Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. This suggests that the Bitcoin bulls and the bears are not clear about the next directional move.\n\nIt is not only Bitcoin that is stuck inside a range. On April 7, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at asset manager Fidelity Investments, tweeted that the S&P 500 Index had been stuck inside a range for the past nine months and a breakout was due \u201csooner or later.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin\u2019s failure to break above the $30,000 level has attracted profit-booking in several altcoins but a few have witnessed shallow pullbacks. This indicates that traders are holding on to their positions expecting a move higher.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of select altcoins that may turn up and start an uptrend if Bitcoin breaks out to the upside. What are the resistance levels above which these five cryptocurrencies turn bullish?\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading inside a tight range for the past two days, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Usually, tight ranges are followed by an expansion in volatility.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($27,500) is flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has gradually been slipping toward the center. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the price tumbles below the 20-day EMA, several short-term stop losses may be triggered and the BTC/USDT pair may dive to the breakout level of $25,250.\n\nConversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. A rally above $29,200 could enhance the prospects of a rally to $30,000 and subsequently to $32,500.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is flattening out on the four-hour chart and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. This uncertainty is unlikely to continue for long, and a directional move could soon start. However, it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout.\n\nTherefore, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before establishing directional bets. The important level to watch on the upside is $29,200 and on the downside is $26,500. A breach of either level could start a short-term trending move.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nThe bulls are not allowing Cardano (ADA) to dip below the 20-day EMA ($0.37), indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive area suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The ADA/USDT pair could first rise to the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. A break and close above this resistance will signal a potential trend change. The pair could then rally toward the pattern target of $0.60.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly yank the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair may then drop to the 200-day simple moving average ($0.35) and later to $0.30.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have pushed the price above the 20-EMA and will next try to overcome the barrier at the downtrend line. If they do that, it will suggest that the pullback may be over. The pair may then climb to the neckline where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nContrarily, if the price faces rejection at the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. The selling could accelerate below $0.37 and the pair may plunge to the 200-SMA.\n\nStellar price analysis\n\nStellar (XLM) turned down from the overhead resistance of $0.12 and the price is nearing the 20-day EMA ($0.10). The bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA.\n\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they succeed, the XLM/USDT pair will complete a bullish rounding bottom pattern. That could signal the start of a new up-move. The pair may first rally to $0.15 and thereafter march toward the pattern target of $0.17.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.09). This is a make-or-break level for the bulls because if it cracks, the pair may plummet to $0.07.\n\nXLM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is correcting inside a falling wedge pattern. The price has bounced off the support line and the bulls will next attempt to propel the pair above the wedge. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $0.11 and subsequently to $0.12.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and plummets below the support line, it will suggest that the selling has intensified. There is a small support at $0.10 but if that cracks, the decline could extend to the 200-SMA.\n\nRelated: SushiSwap approval bug leads to $3.3 million exploit\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) has turned down from the overhead resistance of $82, indicating that the bears are fiercely protecting this level. They have pulled the price below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($75).\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe AAVE/USDT pair could next slip to the 200-day SMA ($73), which is close to the uptrend line. Buyers are likely to defend this level with vigor. If the price rebounds off the uptrend line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach $82.\n\nIf bulls overcome this barrier, the pair will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective of $100. This bullish view will invalidate if the price continues lower and breaks below the uptrend line. The pair may then slide to $68 and later to $64.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears have pulled the price to the 200-SMA on the four-hour chart. The 20-EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have the upper hand.\n\nIf the 200-SMA gives way, the pair could decline further to the uptrend line. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it will further strengthen the bears.\n\nOn the upside, a break above the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are making a comeback. The pair may then rise to the overhead resistance at $82.\n\nCFX price analysis\n\nConflux (CFX) has been in a corrective phase for the past few days but a minor positive is that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.36).\n\nCFX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the current level, the CFX/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. This is an important level for the bears to guard because a break above it could open the doors for a possible rally to $0.44 and then $0.49.\n\nConversely, if the price plunges and sustains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. That could attract further selling, pulling the price toward the next support at $0.30. The bulls are expected to buy the dips to this level.\n\nCFX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to keep the price below the 20-EMA. That could pull the pair to the 200-SMA, which is likely to act as a major support.\n\nIf the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to drive the price to the downtrend line. This is the key level to keep an eye on because a break above it will signal that bulls are back in the game.\n\nOn the downside, a break and close below the $0.30 support could attract further selling, sinking the price to $0.25.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms Are Moving Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe price of several cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks moved higher today for no obvious reason, but as investors prepared for new economic data and for earnings season to kick off later this week.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.49%), traded 3.8% higher as of 3:37 p.m. ET today.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of the large crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%) traded 5.5% higher during normal trading hours, while shares of the Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) traded nearly 15% higher.\n\nSo what\n\nBecause the markets were closed Friday, the market didn't get to react to the March jobs report until today. The U.S. economy added 236,000 jobs in March, which does represent a slowdown in hiring and was in line with estimates. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% as the labor force participation rate increased.\n\nStill, that's a healthy month of hiring, and following the report traders increased their bets that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates at its May meeting. Rising interest rates crushed Bitcoin in 2022.\n\nYet in another report that came out today from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consumers said that accessing credit in March got more difficult and is the toughest it's been since 2014. Since the banking crisis started, banks have been expected to tighten credit, which could chill the economy and potentially even trigger a recession. This might entice the Fed to cut interest rates, which has historically been good for riskier assets like Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, analysts from Bernstein in a research note today said that investors' rising interest in gold should also lead to a rise in interest in Bitcoin. The analysts said they see more investors expecting a hard landing for the economy, which will trigger rate cuts and a weakening dollar, which has led them to start favoring gold as a hedge.\n\n\"When there is a massive monetary debasement event, while both Bitcoin and Gold rally, Bitcoin outperforms Gold,\" the analysts wrote. \"For example, post-Covid monetary printing, Bitcoin outperformed Gold (2.9x over ~3.5 years). In fact, even this year, since the banking crisis fears have escalated, Bitcoin rallied ~71% YTD vs. Gold rallying ~10% YTD.\"\n\nWhen Bitcoin trades up other crypto stocks tend to follow. Coinbase benefits when there is increased trading activity in cryptocurrencies, while Riot benefits because the asset that the company mines, Bitcoin, is increasing in value.\n\nNow what\n\nI think the economic data has been somewhat conflicting recently. Traders have been penciling in rate cuts this year, which would likely favor Bitcoin and crypto, but the Friday jobs report also hints that inflation hasn't been tamed yet. The Fed is now expected to do another quarter-point hike at its May meeting.\n\nStill, there will be new key inflation data out Wednesday, and then bank earnings kick off Friday. Both of these events could still change the trajectory of the Fed, so you'll want to keep an eye on them.\n\nWhile I expect volatility, I do think Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency worth having at least a little bit of exposure to, and I would expect Bitcoin to benefit from a weakening dollar or a rate cut. Currently, I am not interested in Coinbase or Riot because of the enhanced regulatory environment around crypto companies, although both will likely benefit if Bitcoin rises. I just prefer Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts the week on a firm footing as bulls send BTC price to a new 10-month high weekly close.\n\nAfter a relatively calm week, last-minute volatility is getting traders excited at the prospects of a repeat attack on $30,000 resistance \u2014 but a lot stands in the way.\n\nIn what is set to be a significant week of macroeconomic data releases, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for March is due April 12, along with fresh insights into Federal Reserve policy.\n\nAdd to that the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade and it\u2019s a recipe for volatility. How will Bitcoin react?\n\nVolatility correlations between the largest cryptocurrency and traditional risk assets are inverting, data shows, while sentiment data also suggests little appetite for sudden selling among the hodler base.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at the status quo in the run-up to what promises to be a week that keeps market participants on their toes.\n\nCPI headlines key macro data week\n\nA familiar event leads the week\u2019s macro calendar, with U.S. CPI data due for March.\n\nThe release, this time on April 12, traditionally accompanies heightened volatility in risk assets, making that date a key area to watch for \u201cfakeouts\u201d in crypto markets.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will further produce the minutes of its latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, during which it opted to continue raising interest rates.\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\n\n\n1. March CPI inflation data on Wednesday\n\n\n\n2. Fed minutes on Wednesday\n\n\n\n3. March PPI inflation data on Thursday\n\n\n\n4. Consumer sentiment data on Friday\n\n\n\n5.

While traders want to see inflation receding faster than expected, the Fed itself remains hawkish, last month confirming that further interest rate hikes may be appropriate.\n\nHowever, a divergence between the Fed and markets is equally evident, with sentiment beginning to show that the latter simply does not believe rate hikes will continue much longer.\n\nAccording to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, next month\u2019s FOMC meeting will likely end in a repeat 0.25% hike. Those odds are highly flexible and react immediately to any new macro data releases, CPI included.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent upward trend has ceased, and the price has entered a phase of steady consolidation with no clear direction. The cryptocurrency is currently in a crucial zone, and in order to surpass the significant obstacle of the $30K resistance level, there must be an increase in demand and buying power.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nBitcoin has recently reached a critical zone of $30,000, which has proven to be a significant resistance level.. This level has halted Bitcoin\u2019s recent impulsive rally and has resulted in a period of steady PA with low volatility.\n\nIf the BTC bulls push the price above this crucial region, it could likely lead to a long-term bullish trend.\n\nHowever, the divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests that a short-term correction is likely to occur soon. In this case, the $25K region, which aligns with the 50-day moving average, will become the primary support level for Bitcoin.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nBitcoin has formed an ascending trendline on the 4-hour timeframe, which has been in place for several months and is currently acting as a support for the price. However, the cryptocurrency has been trapped between the ascending trendline and the $30K price region. A significant move above or below this crucial range will potentially eliminate any uncertainty and determine the mid-term outlook of the price.\n\nTo summarize recent movements, a short-term rejection followed by a consolidation correction stage seems likely for Bitcoin in the coming days.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nBitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjusts based on the behavior of miners and the latest movements in the hash rate. The difficulty level is readjusted depending on the number of miners currently using their machines to mine. When there are more active miners, the difficulty adjustment makes it harder for them to mine a block, which helps ensure that the rate of block production remains relatively constant.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, the most recent adjustment has led to a spike in the difficulty metric, resulting in a new all-time high. This indicates that more miners are willing to mine Bitcoins and keep their machines running, making the network more secure. Overall, this is a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose in Monday afternoon trade in Asia, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon\u2019s Matic token was the only loser, while Dogecoin gained the most. Asian equity markets were mixed as investors assessed Friday\u2019s U.S. jobs data while awaiting key inflation figures to be released later this week.\n\nSee related article: FTX\u2019s lack of financial controls complicates bankruptcy asset recovery, says legal filing\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 1.36% to US$28,301 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 1.23%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum gained 1.24% to US$1,859, ahead of its Shapella Upgrade on Wednesday, which is expected to lower gas fees for developers and allow investors to withdraw their staked Ether.\n\n\u201cThe Beacon Chain and Ethereum have been working smoothly as one since last year, and the Shapella Upgrade is set to enable new features based on the new architecture,\u201d Chen Zhuling, founder and chief executive of crypto staking provider RockX, said in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cWhile some short-term market volatility is to be expected, the long-term benefits to the ecosystem are substantial, as Ethereum\u2019s capacity to handle more transactions per second increases, transaction costs decrease, and the security and efficiency of smart contracts improve,\u201d Zhuling added.\n\nDogecoin led gains at 1.44% to US$0.08287, bringing its weekly gains to 6.15%. Polygon\u2019s Matic was the only coin among the top 10 cryptos to drop, diving 0.09% to US$1.10 in 24 hours, although it is still up 0.32% on the week.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization rose 1.02% to US$1.18 trillion, while the total crypto market volume gained 4.09% to US$29.18 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.24% to 3,942.37 points during the day and 2.93% during the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.\n\nAsian markets were mixed on Monday, after U.S. jobs data on Friday revealed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 236,000 jobs in March, indicating that the Federal Reserve may again raise interest rates at its meeting on May 3. Currently, interest rates in the world\u2019s biggest economy are 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 0.37%, while the Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.80%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained 0.42%, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi strengthened 0.87%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index slid 0.2% to trade above 102 on Monday, a near one-week high, after the U.S. non-farm payrolls report signaled a tight labor market and supported speculation for another interest rate hike in May.\n\nThe euro rose 0.14% to hover above US$1.09 on Monday, close to its two-month high on April 4, as investors expect another interest rate hike from the European Central Bank (ECB). Last week, Klass Knot, a member of the ECB governing council, said he was unsure whether rates should rise by 25 or 50 basis points."

        "content": "At 19:27 Eastern time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world\u2019s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning \u201cviewing parties\u201d for the occasion. Codenamed \u201cShanghai,\u201d the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured.\n\nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network\u2014or stakes\u2014the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\n\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022\u2014equivalent to that of the Netherlands\u2014of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\n\n\u201cThe energy consumption problem is Bitcoin\u2019s achilles heel,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\n\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW\u2014prone to centralization (crypto\u2019s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\n\nIn bitcoin\u2019s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies\u2014some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain\u2014that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nConversations surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability often touch on how much power the network consumes. But the mere fact that its power consumption is a known factor is notable, according to Canadian Bitcoin miner Hut 8\u2019s CEO Jaime Leverton.\n\n\u201cWe see our energy use, really, as a feature of proof of work,\u201d she said, referencing the process by which Bitcoin transactions are verified on the latest episode of Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have slammed Bitcoin mining as a contributor to the climate crisis. Bitcoin faithful like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor counter with the notion that miners give what would be wasted energy a new purpose, effectively storing it in cyberspace as Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes roughly the same amount of electricity as Washington state\u2014putting pressure on our power grids and worsening the #ClimateCrisis. We need to protect our planet and crack down on environmentally wasteful crypto mining practices. https://t.co/ChKYcD82gH \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 7, 2021\n\nRegardless, the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining has been well documented, in part because Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is public. The measure captures the computational force being used across Bitcoin\u2019s network as miners race to solve Bitcoin\u2019s next block by continuously crunching complex calculations.\n\nLeverton said that having this competition play out in front of everyone\u2019s eyes creates a degree of transparency innate to Bitcoin mining\u2014one that isn\u2019t shared by the traditional financial system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how much energy is used by Bitcoin miners because it\u2019s publicly available information,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas, you can\u2019t see how much energy is used by the traditional fiat banking system or by hard metal mining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn terms of where miners source their power, Leverton noted that the Bitcoin Mining Council produces quarterly reports by surveying industry participants. The latest report found that around 60% of the power tapped by BMC's members\u2014which comprise nearly of the Bitcoin mining industry globally\u2014came from a sustainable power mix, harnessing sources like solar, wind, and hydro electricity.\n\n\"That data is incredibly relevant,\" Leverton said. \"It differs from other industries that aren't transparent about their energy use.\"\n\nThe conversation surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption reignited last month partly due to the \u201cSkull of Satoshi,\u201d an art installation unveiled as part of Greenpeace\u2019s \u201cChange the Code, Not the Climate\u201d campaign. Working with the artist Benjamin Von Wong, the international environmental NGO sought to bring attention to Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint. (Von Wong later said that his black-and-white perception of Bitcoin mining was wrong.)\n\nBut making a judgment about Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is influenced by whether or not someone thinks Bitcoin itself has any value, Leverton said. And she argued that the value versus energy critique hasn\u2019t historically been applied to other forms of technology with the same scrutiny, overlooking the potential that Bitcoin has to offer financial services to the globe's unbanked population at the same time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about how much energy the gaming industry uses, as an example, or whether video games have value to the broader population,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just accept that we know we assume that\u2019s a lot of energy, but we don\u2019t have a value debate about it.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode and subscribe to the gm podcast."

        "content": "The crypto market is always buzzing with news and predictions from experts, and the latest one comes from Jesse Myers who predicts that Bitcoin price will reach an incredible $10 Million per BTC. While this news is exciting for Bitcoin investors, there is another crypto that is expected to outperform most others in the market \u2013 RenQ Finance (RENQ). Experts believe that RenQ Finance has the potential to become the third biggest crypto after BTC and ETH, and it\u2019s no surprise why.\n\nIn this article, we will explore why RenQ Finance is making waves in the crypto world and why it should be on every investor\u2019s radar.\n\nJesse Myers\u2019 Prediction for Bitcoin Price\n\nJesse Myers, has recently made waves in the crypto world with his bold prediction for the future price of Bitcoin. Myers believes that BTC could reach an astounding $10 million per coin in the next decade.\n\nIn an interview on the \u201cCoin Stories\u201d podcast with Natalie Brunell, Myers explains the reasoning and timeline behind his daring forecast. He points out that Bitcoin is carving out its place as a solid and scarce store of value in an age where debt is ballooning, and currencies are depreciating at an alarming rate.\n\nMyers emphasizes the precarious state of holding bonds or fiat money in today\u2019s economic climate, with the national debt and unfunded liabilities necessitating unprecedented levels of money printing just to stay afloat. According to Myers, Bitcoin\u2019s maximum supply of 21 million BTC will create a massive supply shock as the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s rate of adoption increases.\n\nTo reach his $10 million per BTC prediction, Myers breaks down the math in today\u2019s dollar terms. He believes that Bitcoin capturing half of gold\u2019s market cap, along with additional percentages of the world\u2019s top store of value categories, could lead to this incredible price point.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s Potential in the Market\n\nIn addition to Myers\u2019 bold prediction for Bitcoin, there is another crypto that is catching the attention of experts: RenQ Finance (RENQ). According to market analysts, RenQ Finance is poised to outperform most cryptocurrencies in the market and become the third-largest after BTC and ETH.\n\nRenQ Finance is a multi-chain DeFi yield optimizer that allows users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings. RenQ uses a set of investment strategies secured and enforced by smart contracts to automatically maximize user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs), automated market-making (AMM) projects, and other yield farming opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. This DeFi token aims to provide a range of financial services, including yield optimization and lending protocols, to users across multiple blockchain networks.\n\nOne of the main advantages of RenQ Finance is its focus on user experience. By using a RenQ vault to compound gains, users can save thousands of transactions with their associated gas costs and precious personal time. RenQ Finance also offers a decentralized launchpad for blockchain projects, an NFT launchpad, and a lending protocol, which further enhances its appeal to investors.\n\nIn addition, RenQ Finance\u2019s focus on interoperability is a key factor that sets it apart from other tokens. The ability to operate across different blockchain networks can increase the adoption and utility of the token, leading to further growth in its value.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s Recent Milestones\n\nRenQ Finance has already achieved several significant milestones in its journey. The token\u2019s presale stage saw tremendous success, with the team raising over $5.6 million in just four stages of the presale, with over 75% price gain as of writing. The presale stage was launched in February 2023, and the project is currently in its fourth stage, selling at $0.035, which is 84% full, and approaching stage five with full force and a gain of 100%.\n\nRenQ Finance has also partnered with several key players in the industry, including Chainlink, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. These partnerships have helped to increase the visibility and credibility of the project and provide users with a seamless experience across different blockchain networks.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always evolving, with new developments and predictions emerging on a regular basis. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, other tokens like RenQ Finance are gaining attention for their innovative offerings and potential for growth.\n\nWhether Jesse Myers\u2019 prediction for Bitcoin\u2019s future comes true or not, it is clear that the cryptocurrency market will continue to be an exciting space to watch in the coming years.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin appears to be under consolidation ahead of a move toward $35,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nOver the past several days, the total market capitalization has remained in the range of $1.8 to $1.9 billion, suggesting stability in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price is in a consolidation phase after last week\u2019s rapid rally above $20K, a key support level.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $28,315 against the USDT pair with an overnight gain of 1.37%. The trading volume also increased by almost 24% to $12.23 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nBuyers seem to be getting tired as the BTC price traded sideways above $27,700 and $28,500. However, the largest cryptocurrency reached a 2023 high of $28,028 on March 30.\n\nFollowing the bullish rally in March, the Bitcoin price structure drew a pole and flag pattern on the daily price scale. This bullish price action displays an upcoming bullish rally which will take place at the next conceptual round level of $30K. If this level gets broken, then the price can see a bullish rally up to $35K. Sellers may attempt a massive sell-off near the $35K area.\n\nOn the daily time frame, Bitcoin remains above all significant moving averages such as 20, 50, 100, and 200. Specifically, its low volatility and sideways market momentum could lead to a BTC crackdown below the 20 DMA (black).\n\nSupport levels \u2013 $25,000 and $20,000\n\n\u2013 $25,000 and $20,000 Resistance levels \u2013 30,000 and 35,000\n\nSubscribe to The Crypto Times to stay updated on Market Analysis!!"

        "content": "Tesla Inc. is collaborating with Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. and crypto firm Blockstream Corp. to mine Bitcoin at a solar-powered battery manufacturing facility run by the automaker in Texas. The mining farm will tap into Tesla's energy storage technology with rechargeable large-scale batteries at the site, Adam Back, chief executive of Blockstream, said at the Bitcoin Conference 2022 in Miami. Back didn't specify the location.\n\nThe venture is the latest manifestation of the aligning interests of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Dorsey, including over the energy usage of Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Dorsey said he was happy that Musk joined the board of directors of Twitter after Musk revealed his sizable stake in the social media giant.\n\nMusk expressed his interest in Bitcoin and Dogecoin early last year and allowed Tesla customers to buy the electric cars with Bitcoin, helping to send the crypto market to record highs. However, the carmaker later suspended the Bitcoin payment opening citing environmental concerns over Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe latest move comes after Block, which is formerly known as digital payment company Square, secured a purchase from Intel Corp.'s Bitcoin mining chip. Buyers of the chip can potentially either make their own mining rigs or receive an assembled machine from the chipmaker.\n\nDorsey revealed the plan to decentralize Bitcoin mining and make the token's network more secure with Block earlier this year.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Dorsey has fully embraced the largest cryptocurrency by including Bitcoin micropayment Lightening Network in Twitter's tipping function and launching the NFT profile function. He has funded Bitcoin developers and planned to decentralize Bitcoin mining.\n\nTesla's first-quarter filing disclosed the company held $2.48 billion in Bitcoin as of March 31. Bitcoin revenue contributed to over half of the total net revenue of Block's Cash App, a separate filing showed.\n\nThe central and western parts of Texas are among the regions with rich wind and solar power resources. Bitcoin miners have flocked to the region, set up mines or expand transmission capacity in the past year.\n\nA Tesla subsidiary registered as Gambit Energy Storage LLC is building a more than 100 megawatt energy storage project in Angleton, Texas, a town roughly 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Houston."

The best years of economic growth are ahead of India. The construction and infrastructure sector is coming up the curve at a thousand miles an hour. It is boom time for India.Well, I think it is an interesting time over Easter. We have seen dramatic moves and we are worrying over geopolitical fronts \u2013 the China-Taiwan situation, the ongoing situation with Russia and crude. So that is going to be a very interesting quarter. We have to see how it plays out over the next couple of months. The first quarter was electric and this quarter is going to be equally volatile and exciting.Yes, that really shook the market last Sunday week and it hit everyone for a six. It was out of the field. It really surprised everyone. There was an end. I think there is further upside. Many of the investment banks are saying $95 is achievable, maybe even $100. I just want to see where we are over the next matter of weeks. If geopolitical tensions escalate, we could put $15, $20 on very, very quickly. So, yes, it is exciting times across that trading complex.I do not know. When you think about demand, we are still at 100 million barrels approximately a day from a big picture perspective. Yes we could see a softening as far as demand, but China is still doing incredible numbers. I have been in Mumbai for 12 hours and it is just incredible; the construction here, the movement, the mobility. We cannot kid ourselves that there is no huge demand across the planet and we have just got to see where that all plays out from an OPEC perspective. It is going to be again very exciting for the complex.Well it has been strong. They have come out of the blocks very quickly after Lunar New Year and it really surprised everyone with those growth forecast numbers moving forward. So from a demand picture, we have very strong demand for crude, strong demand for base metal and strong demand for every commodity in the world. I think there has been chronic underinvestment over the last decade which is going to come home to roost and will in turn make this decade a continuation of the super-cycle across the commodity complex.The dollar has come under continued pressure to the downside. Only a couple of months back, when it hit that 114 everyone was saying the US dollar index is capable of hitting 120. It is now at 102. You have seen big moves across the Yen, British Pound, Aussie Dollar and naturally the Euro. We are at the end of the rate tightening cycle. Some of the other currencies are going to see a continuation of rate rises, probably the ECB and the Pound. I think that the dollar will come under a little bit further downdraft and between Jerome Powell's rhetoric and inflation numbers, everyone is sitting on the edge of their seats, seeing if there is going to be any surprise.Absolutely. It has been incredible after the last six weeks or so. Metal has been whipsawing. It went to 1810, came back to 2000 and is currently at about 2010, I had a look at 2020., So it has got plenty of upside and the demand picture as far as precious metals and silver are concerned. Do not count that one out. Again central banks have been hoarding gold, buying like crazy and the retail sector is really on fire.Yes.That is right.It was oversold and the best days of crypto may be ahead of us.Oh yes, definitely, they are back at $28,000 and there will be that upside maybe later on this year. There is a lot of uncertainty. There are different payment systems that banks are looking at as far as centralised digital and, of course, decentralised are concerned. On the other side are countries asking for payment of commodities or goods other than the petrodollar. So, there is going to be a fractured mindset. It is going to be incredible how it plays out and as an observer looking in, volatility across crypto and currencies is going to be incredible.Yes, I think so. It is pretty hard not to. There are a lot of traders out there that are absolutely in love with it and that is a global phenomenon.Absolutely, From 18,000 to 28,000, it has been a monstrous move, up nearly 50%.We have forgotten that SVB only a month ago, shook the markets like anything. One month down, it is more or less forgotten., I do not think that that has been put to sleep yet.We are offering retail derivatives globally but as far as a personal side is concerned, there is just so much upside. I have been an advocate of India and I am not saying that because I am here but one has to look at the dynamics;an incredibly young population, growing population, appetite, entrepreneurship, innovation, some of the best professors in the world are Indians who have been trained at US business schools and the brains trust here is just immense.So, I am not doubting India's recovery or growth over this decade, let alone what will happen in the next few decades. The best years of economic growth are ahead of India and you have only got to look at the construction, the infrastructure and everything. It is just coming up the curve at a thousand miles an hour. It is boom time. It truly is. It is mind-blowing.I do not think it has run its course. The best days are ahead of it and how it trades over the next 18 months is going to be electric. I would not be surprised to see big whipsaws and I would not be surprised to see it considerably up from here. I do not know what that number is going to be. The overall momentum, central banks buying, geopolitical concerns \u2013 there are a lot of pluses playing into gold's picture and its basket.Well, in some ways something like the Nasdaq at 16,000, then back to 10,000, now at 12,000. There is a lot of fear across the main street as far as the earning season is concerned. I am pretty sure that equities probably will have another leg up but I just want to take my point in time to look at where the US trades in the next few months.Inflation worries me and the world is concerned how it is going to play as far as equity market growth is concerned. We have got strong interest rates and that flight to safety from the money market versus equity perspective. So, yes, I am sitting here being patient. You also have to be patient at the moment."

        "content": "Investors who understand the workings of market cycles within crypto will be more profitable than those who do not. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices have been trading flat after recent rallies, which means only one thing, altcoin season has begun. New projects have huge potential to rip, and one, Collateral Network (COLT), has already been forecast to gain 3,500% in its presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has thrived in the past months as the failings of fractional reserve banking have been highlighted to the world. With decreasing confidence in the dollar, more and more people have begun to look to Bitcoin (BTC). This application-specific hard money may unseat gold as the world\u2019s reserve currency in the coming decade.\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC) began in 2009 following the global financial crisis, and the same landscape which birthed Bitcoin (BTC) is helping it gain traction currently. Bitcoin (BTC), after surging upwards, has stalled as money floods into altcoins such as Collateral Network (COLT), and investors would be wise to rotate. Price predictions from analysts vary enormously, with some predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will trade as high as $180,000 in 2025, whereas more conservative estimates put Bitcoin (BTC) trading between $77,000 and $92,000 in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade for Ethereum (ETH) scheduled on the 12th of April, many investors have grown increasingly cautious about holding Ethereum (ETH). The Shanghai upgrade will enable Ethereum (ETH) staking withdrawals, and analysts predict that Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals will unleash heavy sell pressure.\n\n\n\nHowever, more bullish analysts and capital fund managers such as Chris Burnisky predict that Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals going live with lead to a greater influx of staked Ethereum (ETH). Regardless of the upgrade, traders should be cautious and, instead of holding Ethereum (ETH), should take advantage of altcoin season and projects like Collateral Network (COLT), which continue to rip to the upside.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) has generated a buzz not seen in the crypto landscape for a long time. This challenger lender unlocks liquidity for real-world assets. The growth and integration of real-world assets into DeFi have been an expected growth driver amongst venture-capital firms for several months. Collateral Network (COLT) makes this possible through its use of 100% asset-backed NFTs.\n\n\n\nAsset owners can collateralize their assets with Collateral Network (COLT), anything from real estate and vintage cars to fine art and luxury watches. Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT 100% backed by the asset, which then becomes liquid. The holder can access the crowdsourced liquidity through fractionalizing the NFT.\n\n\n\nThe COLT token powers this entire ecosystem and grants discounts to borrowers and lenders, and also enables access to the auction where distressed assets will be sold off. On top of this, it can be staked for passive income, making it a DeFi token with excellent utility cases.\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) aggressively expands liquidity flows and lending potential within DeFi. For this reason, analysts have already forecast a 3,500% growth in its presale. Still, many expect it will rally much harder when it launches on centralized exchanges, and early holders could see a 100X on their initial investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk"

        "content": "The Bitcoin white paper, authored by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, continues to be disseminated in multiple languages by community members who strive to make the document\u2019s content accessible to a wider audience.\n\nTo date, the whitepaper has been translated into 43 languages, including including Chinese, Spanish, Italian, Russian, French, German, Bahasa Indonesian, Basque and Swedish, among others, according to information gathered from bitcoin.org on April 10.\n\nAdditionally, to cater to people with visual impairments, the whitepaper is also available in braille. These efforts have significantly contributed to making the document\u2019s contents more accessible and understandable to a broader audience worldwide.\n\nThe translation of the Bitcoin whitepaper plays a significant role in breaking down the entry barriers to Bitcoin and enabling millions of people worldwide to understand its technology better. By eliminating the language barrier, people can engage with the subject and gain a deeper understanding of how Bitcoin works.\n\nFortunately, anyone interested in translating the whitepaper can do so by submitting a request through the bitcoin.org Github page. This open approach allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge about Bitcoin and help make it more accessible to people of diverse cultures and languages.\n\nBitcoin white paper found on Apple MacBooks\n\nLast week, it was revealed that the Bitcoin white paper was found buried deep inside Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ: AAPL) system files on computers running macOS Catalina or later.\n\nThe document, which has the filename \u201csimpledoc.pdf,\u201d purports to present Satoshi Nakamoto ideas for a decentralized form of currency that is based on a public ledger on all nine of its pages.\n\nInterestingly, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Dr. Craig Wright accused the tech giant of breaching copyright laws by putting the Bitcoin white paper on MacBooks. Wright is well-known for his contentious approach to asserting intellectual property rights over Bitcoin and its underlying technology."

        "content": "Enterprise business intelligence (BI) software vendor MicroStrategy has so far purchased over 140,000 Bitcoin (BTC), largely due to the enthusiasm of its executive chairman and former CEO, Michael Saylor. However, not everyone thinks this is necessarily a good thing for the company.\n\nAs it happens, Hal Press, the founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment fund North Rock Digital, has voiced concern over MicroStrategy\u2019s large purchases of Bitcoin, stating it was \u201ccomically stupid\u201d to leverage a software company to this end in a series of tweets posted on April 8.\n\nCommenting on an April 5 tweet by Bitcoin Magazine, in which the crypto news outlet had highlighted that \u201cMicroStrategy now owns one out of 150 Bitcoin that will ever exist,\u201d considering that the maximum supply of Bitcoin is 21 million, Press had this to say:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen anytime soon (multiple years minimum IMO), but eventually, every single one of Saylor\u2019s coins will need to be sold. When the time eventually comes, it will be a career-making short.\u201d\n\n\u2018Comically stupid\u2019 strategy\n\nIn the following tweet, he ridiculed Saylor\u2019s strategy, arguing that \u201cthe idea of taking a software company and levering it to the gills to run a \u2018Bitcoin acquisition strategy\u2019 is so comically stupid it\u2019s actually quite funny\u201d and that it would \u201cbe so obvious in hindsight.\u201d\n\nThat said, Press insisted that his view \u201cgenuinely isn\u2019t a comment about Bitcoin,\u201d but that \u201chijacking a public company and levering it to acquire any asset in a way that adds nothing to its core business just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d As he added, \u201cIf he did it to buy ETH, it would be just as silly IMO,\u201d but admitting that it doesn\u2019t mean \u201che won\u2019t be profitable either, there is a chance he will be.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is no secret that Saylor is a vocal Bitcoin enthusiast, having hailed the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset as an \u201ceconomic engine based on a truth machine poised to emerge as a freedom machine,\u201d which is why he led MicroStrategy to adopt the Bitcoin strategy back in August 2020, as Finbold reported in October 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $28,373, up 1.59% on the day, as well as gaining 0.48% across the previous week and as much as 40.49% on its monthly chart. This means that the current value of MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin bid stands at close to a staggering $4 billion ($3,972,220,000)."
