        "title": "Is cryptocurrency helping Hamas fund terrorism? - FRANCE 24 English",
        "content": "Financing 2.0\n\nThe US and Israel have stepped up their efforts to limit cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas since the group\u2019s brutal October 7 attacks on Israel. Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum are increasingly blamed as conduits of funding for Islamist groups, but to what extent is this justified?\n\nVirtual wallets containing tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency suspected of funding Hamas have been seized by Israel.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nIn the wake of Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israeli territory on October 7 that were unprecedented in scale, the role of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin and crypto exchange platforms in financing the radical Islamist movement are increasingly under scrutiny.\n\nOn October 19, the US Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new regulations identifying \u201cConvertible Virtual Currency Mixing (CVC mixing) as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern \u2026 to combat its use by malicious actors including Hamas [and] Palestinian Islamic Jihad\u201d.\n\nThese online services, known more casually as \u201cmixers\u201d or \u201ctumblers\u201d, mix cryptocurrency of illicit origin with other cryptocurrency funds. As such, \u201cthe risk of employing crypto mixers to launder money or conceal earnings is pretty considerable\u201d, acknowledges crypto industry news site Cointelegraph.\n\nAppeals for Bitcoin via Facebook, Instagram and Telegram\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 assault, the Israeli defence ministry claimed it had seized virtual wallets linked to Hamas that had received $41 million (\u20ac39 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, for its part, has raised $94 million (\u20ac89 million) in cryptocurrency in recent years, according to Elliptic, a British firm that analyses virtual currency transactions.\n\nAnd that's not all. Washington also decided on October 18 to sanction \"Buy Cash\", a Gaza-based company accused of \"facilitating\" cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\n\"Hamas\u2019s use of crypto first came to light in January 2019,\" writes David Carlisle, co-founder of Elliptic, in a blog post published on October 11. The al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019s armed wing, was caught red-handed while organising a call for Bitcoin donations via Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAt first, these \"funding 2.0\" initiatives only raised a few thousand dollars, but Hamas has increasingly used social networks as funding channels ever since. And the Palestinian group formally listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the US is not alone in its actions. \"Using crypto in conjunction with social media platforms \u2013 Facebook, Instagram, and I've seen Telegram mentioned recently \u2013 has become quite popular,\" says Nicholas Ryder, a professor of law and specialist in terrorist financing networks at Cardiff University.\n\nThe recent attention paid to funds transferred to Hamas in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may give the impression that without this windfall, the Islamist movement would be bankrupt or would, at least, have had a much harder time financing its attacks on Israel.\n\nSecondary means\n\n\"There is a degree of hyperbole about this topic. It\u2019s relatively new, has cachet and is unknown by many people, so of course it attracts attention. You cannot ignore it, but if you think about the pros and cons of [using it for] raising or moving funds, crypto is not the best,\" says Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime Research and Security Studies at the Royal United Service Institute, one of the UK's leading think tanks on security issues.\n\nFor example, Hamas, which Forbes magazine ranked in 2014 as \"one of the richest terrorist groups in the world\", has an estimated annual budget of nearly $1 billion. Most of the money comes from \"expatriates or private donors in the Gulf region\", points out German news channel Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn this respect, the $41 million in cryptocurrencies seized by the Israeli authorities may seem like a drop in the bucket for Hamas. What\u2019s more, these amounts should be taken with a grain of salt: it can be very difficult to separate funds intended to finance terrorist activities from others in a virtual wallet, Chainalysis, an American blockchain analysis company, notes in a blog post.\n\n\"[It\u2019s] impossible to quantify how much money is transferred via crypto, but it has become a more and more prominent funding method,\" says Ryder.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in the world of terrorism can be explained first and foremost by the simplicity of making a transaction, notes Keatinge: \"It's easy, and I can make a donation from my couch at home.\" It's also much quicker than having to open a bank account and find intermediaries willing to transfer the fund. \"You just need a smartphone and/or a laptop,\" adds Ryder.\n\nInternational authorities are also putting more effort into countering traditional terrorist financing channels, so these groups are trying to compensate with new ways of raising money. \u201cThe more we put pressure on traditional ways of financing, the more they\u2019ll find alternative ways like crypto. And we are becoming better at fighting against the traditional means of financing. It's like a balloon: when you squeeze one part, the other gets bigger,\" says Keatinge.\n\nNot so anonymous\n\nHamas, al Qaeda and Hezbollah don't hesitate to combine the best of both worlds, either. For example, there can now be a cryptocurrency dimension to the use of fake NGOs, a classic means of funding for terrorist groups. \"They can cut the top 10 to 15 percent and convert it into crypto, and then transfer it in order to make it more difficult to trace,\" explains Ryder.\n\nHowever, these movements' interest in such new funding methods is not as strong as current media noise might suggest, because they are not ultimately as anonymous as we\u2019ve been led to believe. \"It may seem as though crypto is some kind of secret way to channel funds, but it has vulnerability. As soon as you start blockchain transactions, they are traceable. They\u2019re not as secretive as many people think,\" says Keatinge.\n\nIndeed, all Bitcoin transactions pass through the blockchain, which is the digital equivalent of a ledger that is accessible to all. Admittedly, the names of those transferring or receiving the funds do not appear, but it is possible to track every movement of funds, and companies such as Chainalysis and Elliptic have become masters in the art of tracing their origin.\n\nOf course, there are ways of making these transactions more anonymous, but they come at the expense of ease and speed \u2013 the main advantages of the use of cryptocurrencies for terrorists and other criminals. In the end, it\u2019s still easier and more anonymous to hand-deliver suitcases full of cash.\n\nThis article is a translation of the original in French.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe"

        "title": "Morgan Stanley believes crypto winter is over, Bitcoin halving will kick off new bull run - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley believes that crypto winter is over, and Bitcoin\u2019s next halving will kick off a new bull run as it has in the past.\n\nIn a recent report titled \u201cWill Crypto Spring Ever Come?\u201d the bank\u2019s wealth management division delved into the four-year cryptocurrency cycle and the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s halving events on market cycles in shaping the crypto landscape.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Denny Galindo \u2014 author of the report \u2014 wrote:\n\n\u201cSigns indicate that \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2014 bitcoin\u2019s cyclical bear-market decline \u2014 may be in the past.\u201d\n\nThe Four Seasons of Crypto\n\nGalindobegan by drawing a parallel between the four-year cryptocurrency cycle and the year\u2019s four seasons. He detailed the four distinct phases of the cryptocurrency cycle, with each phase bearing a resemblance to a season:\n\nAccording to the report, the summer phase commences with the highly anticipated halving event, where the rate of new Bitcoin creation is slashed in half.\n\nHistorically, this phase has been marked by substantial price increases in Bitcoin, as scarcity drives demand. It typically culminates when Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high, sparking euphoria in the market.\n\nAfter reaching a new high, Bitcoin garners media attention, attracts new investors, and piques the interest of businesses. This phase is reminiscent of summer, turning into fall as the crypto market basks in the warmth of renewed interest. It spans the period between surpassing the old high and establishing a new peak, marking the climax of the bull market.\n\nPost-peak, the market enters a bearish phase, similar to the onset of winter. The market cools down as investors lock in profits and divest from Bitcoin.\n\nThis phase has historically persisted for around 13 months, with prices experiencing significant declines from their highs. It is a time of consolidation, correction, and introspection for the crypto community.\n\nPreceding each halving event, Bitcoin\u2019s price generally rebounds from its lowest point. However, investor enthusiasm tends to remain relatively subdued, much like the cautious optimism of early spring.\n\nThis is the period when the crypto market finds its footing again, preparing for the next halving event and the subsequent bull run. Galindo highlighted that there have been three crypto winters since 2011, each spanning roughly 13 months. He also noted that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event plays a significant role in driving the value of the flagship crypto.\n\nAccording to Galindo:\n\n\u201cHistorically, most of bitcoin\u2019s gains come directly after a \u2018halving\u2019 event that occurs every four years.\u201d\n\nThis observation lends credence to the notion that a crypto spring may be on the horizon.\n\nSigns of Spring\n\nThe report said there are several key factors to consider in determining whether crypto spring has arrived. Historical patterns reveal that the trough of Bitcoin in previous crypto winters typically surfaces about 12 to 14 months after the peak, offering a timeline for market cycles.\n\nAnother crucial factor is gauging the decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value from its all-time high. Bitcoin prices have plummeted by approximately 83% from their previous highs in past crypto winters.\n\nMiner capitulation is also a noteworthy indicator, as many miners cease operations due to financial losses when Bitcoin approaches the trough of past cycles. Miner behavior is monitored through \u201cbitcoin difficulty,\u201d a metric gauging mining ease. Decreasing difficulty signifies proximity to the trough.\n\nThe \u201cBitcoin Price-to-Thermocap Multiple\u201d is another critical metric. \u201cThermocap\u201d measures the total investment in Bitcoin since its inception. A lower price-to-thermocap ratio indicates a trough, while a higher ratio suggests a peak in the market\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe report added that price action can also signify the end or beginning of a new cycle. A substantial 50% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from its lowest point typically indicates a trough.\n\nHowever, there have been instances where significant price declines followed such gains."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are on the rise again, helped by optimism surrounding the possible introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. But no matter how strong this rally gets, it won't convince one of the industry's biggest critics \u2014 Warren Buffett. Bitcoin surged 10% over the past week, at one point briefly topping $30,000, as hopes grew that a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be approved. The idea among boosters is that such a vehicle would further legitimize the digital token and attract a wave of investment dollars, pushing the price of bitcoin even higher. But whether a bitcoin ETF soon becomes reality or not, it won't alter the Oracle of Omaha's thesis on cryptocurrencies, which is that they are highly speculative, non-productive assets. Buffett, who once famously called bitcoin \"probably rat poison squared,\" has compared the bitcoin phenomenon to the tulip bulb mania in the Netherlands in the early 1600s . \"All you're counting on is whether the next person is going to pay you more because they're even more excited about another next person coming along. But the asset itself is creating nothing,\" Buffett said in a 2018 CNBC interview. \"It's been a very speculative, kind of Buck Rogers type thing, and people buy and sell them because they hope they go up or down just like they did with tulip bulbs a long time ago,\" said Buffett, Berkshire Halthaway's CEO. \"If you just look at something and say that's magic, you can do it with shark teeth or seashells, or anything.\" Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is an even a more vocal crypto hater, once saying digital currencies are a malicious combination of fraud and delusion, \"good for kidnappers.\" Munger supports a ban of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Wouldn\u2019t buy \u2018all of the bitcoin in the world\u2019 for $25 Buffett believes that the digital token has no value because it doesn't deliver anything. Unlike farms, which produce food, and real estate, which produces rent, cryptocurrencies rely on market sentiment and supply-demand dynamics. \"If you said \u2026 for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I'll write you a check this afternoon,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2022 annual meeting. \"[For] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. [If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I'll write you a check, it's very simple.\" \"Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything,\" he added. 'Not a currency' The legendary, 93-year-old investor also said that bitcoin failed to meet the definition of a currency as its price fluctuates with the dollar. Crypto bulls tend to think bitcoin is a superior means of payment given its underlying, decentralized technology. \"It is not a durable means of exchange. It's not a store of value,\" Buffett said in a 2014 CNBC interview. \"People say 'well I'll sell you goods in bitcoins,' but they change the price of those every time the price of the dollar changes.... they are pricing off the dollar.\" BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin in 2023."

        "title": "Guy Who Stole Billions in Bitcoin Lived a Sad Life - Futurism",
        "content": "A Bitcoin \"original gangster\" who stole cryptocurrency from the original Silk Road a decade ago spent lavishly \u2014 but lived what sounds like a sad and lonely life before he was caught.\n\nAs CNBC reports, Bitcoin thief Jimmy Zhong not only helped write the original code of the cryptocurrency and early blockchain tech, but he also pilfered a bunch of it off the Silk Road in 2012, when its worth was a small fraction of what it became by the time he was busted in 2019.\n\nHe was also something of a rich nerd stereotype in Athens, Georgia, where he lived \u2014 a hard-partying local who dropped thousands to fly his friends cross-country on a private jet to attend a football game and had a stripper pole in his house \"for the girls,\" all of which masked how shallow those connections really were.\n\nZhong's fall from crypto grace began in March 2019, when he called the local police department in a panic because someone had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crypto from his house near the University of Georgia's campus \u2014 which is pretty ironic considering that the Bitcoin stolen from him was itself stolen.\n\n\"I\u2019m having a panic attack,\" the then-28-year-old computer scientist told the Athens-Clarke County Police dispatcher, per transcripts reviewed by CNBC.\n\nThough he tried to explain to the cops the significance of someone stealing 150 bitcoins from his house, calling it \"kind of an online thing,\" the local authorities were far out of their depth. To try to get to the bottom of the case, he hired Robin Martinelli, a private investigator in a nearby town.\n\nHerself far from a crypto expert, Martinelli said that as she learned more about bitcoin and about Zhong's case, she warmed to him \u2014 and felt the exact opposite way of the people he kept around him, whom she surveilled in attempts to see which of them had broken in and stolen whatever the crypto was physically stored on.\n\nZong's friends, Martinelli said, were \"very, very casual, plastic, not really caring, maybe using Jimmy a little bit.\" But he didn't respond well to her suspicions, seemingly clinging to the idea that his social circle was drawn by something other than a meal ticket.\n\n\"He would get upset,\" the PI said, \"when I would kind of mention somebody would had to have known where this cash was.\"\n\n\"Jimmy wanted to be loved,\" she added. \"Jimmy wanted friends.\"\n\nUltimately, that desire to be loved may have led to his downfall. As CNBC reports, that 2019 theft \u2014 which remains unsolved \u2014 brought government attention to Zhong, who, as it turns out, had been involved in the earliest days of crypto.\n\nBody camera footage reviewed by the news outlet showed how the young man's desire to be liked was turned against him when Zhong invited authorities into his house, where they were able to successfully ascertain that he had at least one Bitcoin wallet with tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto in it.\n\nThey then served him with a search warrant and tore his house apart until they found the computer that contained the rest of the 2012 Silk Road theft that netted Zhong 50,000 bitcoins, which ended up being worth a whopping $3 billion. It was the Justice Department's largest crypto seizure to date, and because nobody came forward to claim it, all of the proceeds went into government coffers.\n\nThough he was far from the first nerd to get rich and try to buy relationships \u2014 there was even an entire arc in \"30 Rock\" about such a man, the very year of the Silk Road theft \u2014 Zhong's painfully obvious loneliness adds a tragic new dimension to one the largest and earliest crypto crimes.\n\nNow 33, Zhong reported to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Alabama earlier this year and will only be there for 366 days, CNBC reports, which seems much more like a white-collar wrist slap than a book-throwing, and constitutes yet another all-too-familiar aspect of this saga.\n\nMore on crypto crime: You Have Got To See This Unhinged SBF Memo"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) had a good week, with prices rising about 10% to reach the psychologically important level of $30,000. After the rally, the question troubling investors is whether the uptrend will continue or if a reversal will happen.\n\nTrading team Stockmoney Lizards recently said that Bitcoin may soon break above its overhead resistance and start a sharp rally. They believe the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund would drive mass adoption and trigger a rally before the halving due in April 2024.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nA positive development this week was that Bitcoin\u2019s strength rubbed off to several altcoins, which surged above their respective overhead resistance levels. This suggests that the sentiment is gradually turning positive and that it may be time to consider buying selectively.\n\nTypically, the coins that lead the markets higher are the ones that tend to do well. Laggards are generally the last to perform, hence could be avoided initially.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $30,000 mark, but a positive sign is that the buyers have not given up much ground.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA consolidation near the current level suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, as they anticipate another leg higher. That could catapult the price to the overhead resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,400.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,160). If the price snaps back from this level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle.\n\nThe positive sentiment will be negated on a break below the 20-day EMA. That could keep the pair stuck inside the $31,000\u2013$24,800 range for some more time.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair is in an uptrend, as seen on the four-hour chart. Normally, during an ascent, traders buy the dip to the 20-EMA. If that happens, it will signal that the sentiment remains bullish and every minor dip is being purchased. The pair may then continue its journey toward $32,400.\n\nConversely, if the price skids below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be closing their positions in a hurry. That could open the gates for a further decline to the important support at $28,143.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL (SOL) broke out of the neckline on Oct. 19, completing a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This setup has a target objective of $32.81.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI) suggest that a correction is possible. The important support to watch on the downside is $27.12. A strong bounce off this level will indicate that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That will improve the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. Above $32.81, the rally could hit $39.\n\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to halt the up-move, they will have to drag the price back below $27.12. The SOL/USDT pair may then tumble to the neckline. This remains the key level to keep an eye on because a drop below it will suggest that the break above $27.12 may have been a fake-out.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are facing stiff resistance near $30. This may start a pullback that could reach the breakout level of $27.12. Buyers are expected to defend this level with vigor. A solid bounce off this level may suggest the resumption of the up-move.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below $27.12, it will signal that the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. The pair may then dive to the neckline near $24.50. This level may again witness strong buying by the bulls.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink\u2019s LINK (LINK) has been trading inside a tight range between $5.50 and $9.50 since May 2022, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls tried to resolve the uncertainty to the upside with a break above the range on Oct. 22, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the bears are not willing to relent. If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $9.50.\n\nThe LINK/USDT pair could then start a move toward the pattern target of $13.50. Typically, a breakout from a long consolidation results in a sharp rally. In this case, the uptrend may stretch to $15 and thereafter to $18.\n\nThe first support on the downside is at $8.50. If bears tug the price below this level, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a while longer.\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair witnessed a sharp rally from $7.50, which propelled the RSI deep into the overbought territory on the four-hour chart. This suggests that the rally is overextended in the near term and could result in a pullback or consolidation.\n\nThe solid support on the downside is $8.75 and then $8.50. A strong bounce off this zone will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the possibility of a retest of $9.75.\n\nOn the contrary, a break below the 20-EMA will indicate that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then sump to $7.\n\nRelated: Lightning Network faces criticism from pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) rose above the downtrend line on Oct. 21, invalidating the bearish descending triangle setup. Generally, the failure of a negative setup starts a bullish move.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have started to turn up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls are at an advantage. If the price maintains above the downtrend line, the AAVE/USDT pair may first surge to $88 and then to $95.\n\nIf bears want to prevent this up-move, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the downtrend line. That may catch a few aggressive bulls on the wrong foot and start a correction to the moving averages. A slide below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($62) will put the bears back in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to stall the relief rally at the downtrend line, but the bulls did not give up much ground. The momentum picked up, and the pair is on its way higher toward $88.\n\nA minor concern in the short term is that the RSI soared into the overbought territory, indicating that a consolidation or correction is possible. On the way down, the first support is at $72. The bears will have to yank the price below the downtrend line to trap the bulls.\n\nStacks price analysis\n\nStacks\u2019 STX (STX) rose sharply in the past few days, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a new uptrend.\n\nSTX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bullish crossover on the moving averages suggests that the bulls have an edge. In the short term, the overbought levels on the RSI indicate that a minor correction or consolidation is possible. The first support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($0.54).\n\nIf the price rebounds off this level, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That will increase the likelihood of the continuation of the up-move. The STX/USDT pair could first rise to $0.80 and subsequently to $0.90.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA.\n\nSTX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been consolidating in a tight range between $0.61 and $0.65, as seen on the four-hour chart. This is a positive sign, as it shows the bulls are not rushing to the exit because they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers drive the price above $0.65, the pair will attempt a rally to $0.68 and then to $0.75.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal profit-booking by short-term traders. The pair may then plunge to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Tone Vays recently shared his perspective on the recent trends. While Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has seen a notable uptick this week, Vays is urging traders to tread cautiously.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin experienced a 10% increase in value last week. However, Vays expressed reservations about its potential to sustain this momentum and hit the $32,000 mark.\n\nIn a YouTube video last week, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s not go crazy here. I still think there\u2019ll be a pullback sometime in November. I don\u2019t think this is rallying to $32,000.\u201d\n\nVays predicted that Bitcoin would fall to around $28,000 before taking out the top of the range at $31,000 and rallying above $34,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $29,923.75, up 11 percent in the last seven days.\n\nTurning his attention to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Vays pointed out a potential double-bottom pattern forming against Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Analyst Confident About Bitcoin's Surge, But There's A Catch\n\nHe predicted that Ethereum could face challenges ahead.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEthereum is making new lows against Bitcoin. This is not surprising. Ethereum is in a very critical support area\u2026 On a monthly scale, Ethereum still has significantly more downside. This is a very nasty double bottom. This is very bad for Ethereum. This sets up Ethereum to go significantly lower.\u201d\n\nAt present, the ETH stands at 0.0543 BTC, equivalent to $1,608.\n\nSpeaking of Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), Vays anticipated a continued decline in its value relative to Bitcoin. Drawing from historical data post-LTC halving events, he said, \"Litecoin is on its way to an 80% destruction. I\u2019ve made this very clear many times. Every time Litecoin halves, the price of Litecoin goes down 80%. This happened after the Litecoin halving in 2015, after the Litecoin halving in 2019, and likely after the Litecoin halving in 2023. We\u2019re down 30%. We need to go 80%.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, LTC was trading at $64.16.\n\nNow Read: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is On The Horizon: 'This Is The Beginning'\n\nJoin Benzinga\u2019s Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions, and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

        "content": "Security researcher and developer Antoine Riard is stepping down from the Lightning Network\u2019s development team, citing security issues and fundamental challenges to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nAccording to a thread on the Linux Foundation\u2019s public mailing list, Riard believes the Bitcoin community faces a \u201chard dilemma\u201d as a new class of replacement cycling attacks puts Lightning in a \u201cperilous position.\u201c\n\nHow does a lightning replacement cycling attack work?\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of discussion about this newly discovered vulnerability on the mailing lists, but the actual mechanism is a bit hard to follow.\n\n\n\nSo here's an illustrated primer...\n\n\n\n1/n pic.twitter.com/mvvS8bEc5f \u2014 mononaut (@mononautical) October 21, 2023\n\nThe Lightning Network is the second-layer solution built over the Bitcoin blockchain. It is designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions by enabling off-chain, peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThrough the Lightning Network, users can open payment channels, conduct multiple transactions off-chain and settle the final result on the Bitcoin blockchain. The replacement cycling attack targets these payment channels. It is a new type of attack that allows the attacker to steal funds from a channel participant by exploiting inconsistencies between individual mempools. According to Riard:\n\n\u201cI think this new class of replacement cycling attacks puts lightning in a very perilous position, where only a sustainable fix can happen at the base-layer, e.g adding a memory-intensive history of all-seen transactions or some consensus upgrade. Deployed mitigations are worth something in face of simple attacks, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019re stopping advanced attackers as said in the first full disclosure mail.\u201c\n\nRiard also noted that addressing the new type of attack may require changes to the underlying Bitcoin network:\n\n\u201cThose types of changes are the ones necessitating the utmost transparency and buy-in of the community as a whole, as we\u2019re altering the full-nodes processing requirements or the security architecture of the decentralized bitcoin ecosystem in its integrality.\u201c\n\nLightning developers grapple with challenges, including criticisms surrounding the network\u2019s complexity and the demands placed on user experience. Since its inception in 2018, the layer-2 network has gained popularity, with a total value locked reaching $159.5 million at the time of writing, according to data from DefiLlama. However, this figure is still very modest when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $587 billion market capitalization.\n\nRiard plans to focus now on Bitcoin core development, but warned about upcoming challenges for the major cryptocurrency ecosystem:\n\n\u201cOn the other hand fully explaining why such changes would be warranted for the sake of lightning and for designing them well, we might need to lay out in complete state practical and critical attacks on a ~5 355 public BTC ecosystem. Hard dilemma. There might be a lesson in terms of bitcoin protocol deployment [...]\u201d\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "For Bitcoin to beat the resistance around $30,000, the volume around the previous buying pressure needs to be higher.\n\nBTC accumulation is increasing and could be followed by a rise in volatility.\n\nAfter blasting past $29,000, optimism in the market has started to rise again, with many opining that Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] journey to $30,000 was a question of when not if. However, according to IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, it may not be an easy ride to the said price. This is because of a potential resistance around the $30,000 mark.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin is in a critical position\n\nIn spite of the fact that 73% of Bitcoin holders were now in profit, the blockchain insight platform noted that the resistance may occur because of the over 1.4 million addresses that accumulated in the region.\n\nAs Bitcoin is inching closer to $30k, we find that the most significant potential resistance is also around that $30k mark, where 1.49M addresses acquired Bitcoin. At the same time, 73% of Bitcoin addresses are currently in profit. This level has proven to be a significant\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OymqUOQ4Hw \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 20, 2023\n\nOne reason why this region was also important was due to the historical demand BTC had at this level. For instance, institutional investors like Michael Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy, and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla purchased high volumes of BTC around these prices.\n\nIt was also the same case with a number of retail participants. Therefore, it is likely that some market players might try to break even at these points. This could, in turn, draw back the upward movement experienced lately.\n\nA smooth sail may be coming\n\nTo avoid such an occurrence, a lot of accumulation has to take place, and it may need to be more than 496 BTC stockpiled previously at the $29,796 to $30,673 region. Well, data from Glasssnode showed that Bitcoin\u2019s accumulation trend score was 0.72 at press time.\n\nAs a value ranging from zero to one, the accumulation trend score is an indicator that reflects the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain in terms of their BTC holdings.\n\nWhenever the value of the metric is closer to zero, it means that the market is in distribution mode. Thus, the value mentioned above means that there has been more accumulation than distribution.\n\nHence, the chances of Bitcoin hitting $30,000 is much higher than a fall below $29,000.\n\nAs Bitcoin tries to move higher than the price at press time, it is also likely to see a surge in volatility. This was the opinion of Korean on-chain analyst Mignolet. Mignolet, who made his opinion known on CryptoQuant, noted that 3-6 months Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) was proof of the hike in price fluctuations.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nThe SOAB is a bundle of all spent outputs that were created within a specified age band. The metric is responsible for revealing the behavior of holders in a certain market atmosphere. Regarding the recent movement, the analyst explained that,"
