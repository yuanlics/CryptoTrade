        "title": "When to Buy Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin a Good Investment Now? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest bitcoin trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy bitcoin and the risks of buying BTC.\n\nFor trading bitcoin over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices.\n\nHowever, we also think bitcoin is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect the bitcoin price to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin had a great start to 2023, reversing the downward trend seen throughout the end of 2022. From $16,000 on 1 January, it has risen 63% to $27,152 so far this year. Last month, the BTC price even exceeded $30,000 on hopes that the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle was nearing completion and that inflation was calming down.\n\nHowever, recent weeks have seen bitcoin retrace its steps. We think the main reason for this is a deteriorating macro backdrop. The labour market remains very tight. Inflation remains way above target (April CPI showed little progress on disinflation, with core goods rising 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used care prices). And Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said \u2018\u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019\n\nCurrently, the markets are assigning merely a 5% chance of a 25 basis point increase by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in June. From our perspective, the markets are underpricing the likelihood of such a hike. Considering the ongoing inflation and growth dynamics, it is probable that a 25 basis point increase will occur in June (unless a debt ceiling crisis arises), which would have a bearish effect on bitcoin.\n\nShould you buy BTC now? The quick answer is \u2018probably not\u2019. The macro backdrop for bitcoin is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for bitcoin, which are neutral. So, overall, we are slightly bearish. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy bitcoin.\n\nShould I Buy BTC Now? Probably Not\n\nWhy Has the BTC Price Gone Up?\n\nOne of the primary drivers of the recent rise in bitcoin price is the goldilocks market regime that developed in early 2023. Inflation in the US has fallen from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 4.9%, and consequently, the Fed has been able to slow its rate hikes. Some even believe the Fed has now stopped hiking. Markets are pricing rate cuts for 2023, bolstering risk assets such as equities and crypto. Also, crypto benefitted during the US banking crisis as investors questioned the security of TradFi.\n\nWhy Has the BTC Price Dropped?\n\nBefore the early 2023 bull run, bitcoin was having a miserable time. This was due to several events, both crypto-specific and part of the broader macro backdrop. You can see the current BTC price on the chart below and its historical progress through 2022.\n\nThe FTX Collapse: Catalyst for a BTC Price Crash\n\nA significant event to negatively impact the BTC price was the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Bitcoin had traded in a tight range between $18,500 and $20,000 during September and October 2022. However, it fell 26% as news of the collapse emerged, and the coin has only just recovered past those levels.\n\nHigher Interest Rates: A Worrying Backdrop for Bitcoin\n\nHowever, even the recent FTX chaos fails to detract from the longer-term decline in crypto markets. Since its all-time high of $68,789 on 12 November 2021, bitcoin has fallen 60%. Likewise, ethereum \u2013 the other major player in the crypto space \u2013 is down 60% from its 2021 high of $4,891. These declines follow the broader selloff of 2022, which extended across equities, bonds, and real estate.\n\nThe generic risk-asset rout began at the end of 2021. Central banks are largely to blame as they raise interest rates to reduce demand in overheating economies following the pandemic stimulus. By December 2022, the Federal Reserve (Fed) had raised its policy rate to the highest level in 15 years, capping off four 75bp hikes with another 50bp hike at the end of the year. After another 25bps in February 2023, the policy rate now sits at 4.75-5.00%.\n\nMoreover, there are ongoing fears that the effects of high inflation and rising interest rates will plunge the world into a recession. Our recession probability indicator remains over 70%. Bitcoin is yet to experience a serious global recession, but we expect one would limit any potential upside in price action. This is because during times of economic uncertainty and weak growth, investors may be more inclined to sell risky assets like bitcoin and seek safer investments such as government bonds.\n\nHow Low Can Bitcoin Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, earlier in 2021, the bitcoin and NASDAQ correlation reached highs of almost 80%. So where the NASDAQ went, bitcoin followed. The correlation has declined recently, but should it rise again, the historical drawdowns of NASDAQ could be informative.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. As of November 2022, the NASDAQ is in a 27% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between bitcoin/ethereum returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation. Coinbase flirts with move outside the US due to regulatory pressures. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently noted at the Innovate Finance Global Summit this week that the \u2018UK is our second-largest market in terms of revenue. We\u2019re founded in the US, and I think the US has the potential to be an important market in crypto \u2013 but right now, we\u2019re not seeing the regulatory clarity we need.\u2019 Coinbase recently secured a licence to operate in Bermuda, too.\n\nThe ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor.\n\nThere are several events to keep track of over the coming weeks that will influence crypto prices:\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to 80%. Inflation remains at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, with data cooling but still elevated. Is crypto decoupling from equities? The moves lower in crypto markets this week disagree with traditional equity indices such as the tech-heavy NASDAQ. The NASDAQ is currently up +1% MTD compared to bitcoin and ethereum which are down -10% MTD and -6% MTD, respectively. Individual wallets containing at least one bitcoin (BTC) reached one million earlier this week. This indicates that the long-term sentiment towards these tokens remains strong, despite the downward pressure on bitcoin prices caused by broader market conditions.\n\nSummary of BTC Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including bitcoin, is experiencing a correction after a strong rally. It found support from the Fed\u2019s downshift in hiking and the broader bullish sentiment towards risk assets as the US banking crisis receded. This benign macro backdrop is starting to deteriorate, and we would caution against expecting another short-term rise in prices. For long-term investors, we think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nBitcoin and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 16 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think bitcoin is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that bitcoin is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before investing, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Bitcoin\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin fundamentals can help you understand how bitcoin prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important bitcoin metrics.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nWhen to Buy Bitcoin: Buying the Dip\n\nSome say the best time to buy bitcoin is during price dips. This seems alluring at first \u2013 catching a cheap price and benefitting from the rebound. However, timing dips is notoriously tricky and frought with risk. What happens if it wasn\u2019t a dip but the start of a long-term decline in prices?\n\nWe suggest paying attention to the long-term macro backdrop when asking yourself, should I buy bitcoin right now? Your exposure to bitcoin needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop Three Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Bitcoin\n\nWhere to Buy Bitcoin\n\nTo buy bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy bitcoin on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nDollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u2018Risk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u2019\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy bitcoin?\n\nFor trading bitcoin over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect falling prices. However, we think bitcoin is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was bitcoin at its lowest?\n\nSince the start of 2021, bitcoin was at its lowest on 22 November 2022, when the BTC price was $15,711. Of course, prior to bitcoin\u2019s major bull run in late 2020, it was much lower \u2013 under $10,000. However, bitcoin has not reverted to these lows even amid significant drawdowns.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying BTC now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of bitcoin can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that bitcoin will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell bitcoin?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell bitcoin depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some websites speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse than others for selling bitcoin, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on an analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Should I invest in crypto?\n\nWe think some cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH are a worthwhile long-term investment. However, they are also extremely volatile. That means large price movements over short periods are common. Before investing, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nAppendix: What Are in the Four Indices?\n\nBitcoin: the OG of crypto markets deserves its own category and is in many ways the true benchmark for any other crypto market.\n\nSmart contract platforms: after bitcoin, the big innovation was to have blockchains that were more programmable. These could host smart contracts or decentralised applications and have allowed the emergence of the metaverse and defi. Ethereum (ETH) is the most popular version of a smart contract platform. As well as ethereum, we also include some key competitors. The constituents of this index are: Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), Fantom (FTM), VeChain (VET), Terra (LUNA), EOS (EOS), and Chainlink (LINK). We also include Polkadot (DOT) which allows interoperability between blockchains and the use of smart contracts via parachains.\n\nMetaverse: coins associated with the creation of a virtual space/digital world on the internet using a combination of augmented reality, virtual reality, and social networks. The constituents of this index are Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Enjin Coin (ENJ), Aavegotchi (GHST), Terra Virtua Kolect (TVK), Ultra (UOS), Phantasma (SOUL), RedFOX Labs (RFOX), and Gala (GALA).\n\nDecentralised Finance (DeFi): financial services built on top of blockchain networks with no central intermediaries. This can be a broad category, so we narrow this down to platforms that focus on lending/borrowing, yield farming, automated market making and decentralised exchange tokens. The constituents of this index are: Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), Yearn.finance (YFI), Loopring (LRC), PancakeSwap (CAKE), Maker (MKR), 1inch (1INCH), Thorchain (RUNE), and Terra (LUNA).\n\nPrivacy Coins: coins that obscure transactions on the blockchain to maintain the anonymity of its users and their activity. The constituents of this index are Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Dash (DASH), Verge (XVG), Horizen (ZEN), Beam (BEAM), Secret (SCRT), Decred (DCR), Keep Network (KEEP), and Dusk Network (DUSK).\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "content": "A 21-year-old French citizen who bought a Ferrari with bitcoin had his 18-month sentence and $3.7 million fine upheld by a Moroccan court.\n\nThe original sentence handed down by the Casablanca Court of Appeals in October 2022 against Thomas Clausi was upheld earlier this month, his lawyer, Mohamed Aghanaj, confirmed. Clausi was arrested for buying the luxury sports car in 2021.\n\nMorocco banned holding and trading cryptocurrencies in 2017.\n\nThe enforcement actions against Clausi began when a French woman living in Casablanca sold the Ferrari in question to Clausi for a bitcoin payment worth 400,000 euros ($436,600) at the time. She filed a complaint accusing him of \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nA Moroccan citizen submitted a separate complaint against the Frenchman, alleging Clausi signed a fraudulent check with the name of another individual \u2014 which he obtained in exchange for bitcoin \u2014 in order to buy three of the Moroccan citizen\u2019s watches.\n\nThe court ordered Clausi to repay the watch owner with 3,900 euros.\n\nWhile the full sentence was 18 months, Aghanaj said that Clausi will spend a little bit more than a month in jail to complete his sentence. With this decision against Clausi, the country appears to be sending a message to all those who have a desire to use digital assets.\n\nDespite Morocco\u2019s hard stance on crypto, its citizens seem keen on digital assets. Morocco ranks 14th in the world on crypto adoption based on five different factors, according to a 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "On the Catalyst with Shayle Kann podcast this week:\n\nDepending on who you talk to, Bitcoin mines are either great for the grid or the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to it. These warehouses of computers essentially turn electricity into bitcoins. Proponents argue that mines can do a number of things for the grid, including:\n\n\n\nSupport grid reliability by reducing demand during peak hours.\n\nIncentivize new renewable generation by raising the prices that solar and wind farms receive.\n\nReduce methane emissions by capturing flare gas from fossil fuel wells and then using that gas to generate electricity for mine operations.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the mines raise emissions and electricity prices. So how do we make sense of the great Bitcoin energy debate?\n\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie. The New York Times recently reported on the role of Bitcoin mining on the grid, and Ben was part of a team that contributed to the report.\n\nShayle and Ben discuss:\n\n\n\nHow Bitcoin mines affect electricity prices for nearby consumers.\n\nWhether mines use only excess renewable generation or incentivize fossil-fuel generators to ramp up.\n\nWhat mines\u2019 load profiles say about their flexibility and price sensitivity, especially during peak demand.\n\nThe evidence on whether mines are signing long-term power-purchase agreements, repowering mothballed projects or otherwise helping to incentivize new renewables construction.\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t require so much electricity.\n\nRecommended resources:\n\n\n\nNYT: The Real-World Costs of the Digital Race for Bitcoin\n\nEarth Justice and The Sierra Club: The Energy Bomb: How Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Mining Worsens the Climate Crisis and Harms Communities Now\n\nCoinspeaker: Texas Senate Passes Bill to Limit Incentives for Crypto Miners Participating in Demand Response Programs\n\nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Thursday morning in Asia to trade around the US$27,500 mark, after briefly breaching US$28,000 on Wednesday as U.S. inflation slowed. Liquidity is becoming a concern after major market makers Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto quit cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. citing unfavorable regulations. Ether led the losers in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Pokadot led the winners. U.S. equity futures traded higher as inflation eased in April, adding to speculation the Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong will have \u2018tight\u2019 crypto regulation, says HKMA chief Eddie Yue\n\nBitcoin, Ether lose ground\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.60% to US$27,554 in the 24 hours to 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, logging a weekly loss of 5.24%.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached the US$28,000 ceiling on Wednesday as crypto markets rallied on a slower U.S. inflation rate, but soon fell back amid concerns about network congestion and liquidity.\n\nJane Street Group and Jump Crypto, two leading market makers, will quit digital asset trading in the U.S. as regulators crack down on the industry, according to a Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources.\n\n\u201cAfter the collapse of several crypto-friendly banks and FTX it seems like the SEC (regulator) is unsure what leg to stand on and for sure the stance has become more hostile to cryptos and the entire financial and technical ecosystem surrounding it,\u201d Mikkel Morch, chairman and non-executive director at digital asset investment fund ARK36, said in an email.\n\nAs of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, investors liquidated US$41.28 million of Bitcoin positions, almost 75% of which were long positions \u2013 or bets that the price of Bitcoin would rise, according to market data tracker CryptoMeter.io.\n\nEther fell 0.84% to US$1,837, down 3.49% for the week. The token neared US$1,900 on Wednesday before falling back to as low as US$1,795.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Polkadot\u2019s Dot token leading the winners with a gain of 1.91% to US$5.45. However, it\u2019s down 5.43% for the week. Web3 Foundation, the organization behind the Polygon blockchain, testified before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday on digital asset regulations, calling for a clearer rules of the road.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.30% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion. The total trading volume rose 43.61% to US$45.84 billion.\n\nNFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.67% to 3,440.57 in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 6.15% for the week.\n\nMilady Maker, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, topped the 24-hour sales across the market after Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter and Tesla, tweeted on Wednesday an image containing the NFT.\n\nMilady Maker\u2019s sales totaled over US$9.54 million in the past 24 hours, a surge of over 3,700%, according to data by CryptoSlam, with its floor price jumping 38.4% to 4.69 ETH (US$8,609), according to CoinGecko.\n\nBoosted by the rise of Milady Maker, NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain jumped 89.41% in the past 24 hours to US$34.25 million, according to CryptoSlam. The average transaction fees on Ethereum came in at US$19.70 on Wednesday, a drop from its 11-month peak of US$27.68 on Saturday, according to blockchain data platform BitInfoCharts.\n\nEquities futures rise as inflation slows\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures moved higher as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.04%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.19%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.16%.\n\nThe three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Wednesday as investors digested the U.S. consumer price index report that showed annual inflation unexpectedly slowed to 4.9% in April from 5% in March, the slowest pace in the past two years. The moderate cooling of inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may take a pause in its more than year-long cycle of raising rates to slow inflation.\n\nOn talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling to keep the government solvent, President Joe Biden warned on Wednesday that a federal government default could trigger a global recession, according to a Bloomberg report. Biden is set to continue talks to raise the debt ceiling on Friday, with congressional Republicans demanding more budget cuts in any agreement.\n\nOn other data releases, the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims come out Thursday to offer further insights into the health of the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on June 14 to decide its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 3.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 21.2% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Moody\u2019s, others to join new financial industry blockchain"

CNBC's \"Crypto World\" reached out to the firms. Jane Street declined to comment, and Jump did not respond.\n\n\"In general, we're going to see much larger swings in price both ways since so many large market makers have significantly reduced providing,\" said David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets.\n\n\"Larger market makers create more stability in prices due to the liquidity they provide,\" he added. \"You'll see more frequent gaps up and down since order books are thinner in general.\""

        "content": "In this issue\n\nBitcoin network: Stress test Binance: Applying brakes China: Crypto in court\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, It seems the crypto conversation is migrating and fast. This week, I\u2019m writing from the Middle East on the tails of the Dubai FinTech Summit and AIM (Annual Investment Meeting) in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. I\u2019ve been speaking with local firms and investors, along with regulators and regional leaders. And it\u2019s hard to gloss over the disconnect between the shining ideals that are supposed to underpin the U.S. economic model and the dysfunctional reality that the crypto industry is grappling with. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, is throwing its weight around and failing to support the emergence of an innovative industry. So it\u2019s no surprise to see some significant industry leaders from America \u2014 such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 making appearances in the Middle East this week. Coinbase, the exchange giant that recently sued the SEC for more clarity on crypto regulation \u2014 a call that has echoed throughout the entire digital asset industry for longer than anyone cares to remember \u2014 may find that clarity abroad, as U.A.E. looks to entrench its position in the Web3 digital ecosystem. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi launched a US$2 billion fund to support U.A.E.\u2019s Digital Economy Strategy as part of its diversification efforts into non-oil sectors. That strategy is also in play in Asia as Hong Kong opens up its policy arms with a new regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers to pave the way for crypto trading for the retail market. Hong Kong, too, is looking at comprehensive ways to win back the exodus of talent and innovation that left a few years before as regulators clamped down. And these regions with shared strategies and interests are exploring ways to collaborate. A delegation of industry leaders from Hong Kong and across APAC came to learn how to build meaningful business bridges into the MENA region. Even China is providing more clarity on cryptocurrencies (albeit cautiously). China\u2019s Supreme Court, it has been revealed, ruled back in January that cryptocurrencies possess certain attributes of virtual property. Meanwhile in the U.S., the SEC and the CFTC remain completely at loggerheads over whether cryptos are securities or commodities, an impasse in which no end is in sight, with far-reaching implications for the industry. Crypto policy intransigence from America\u2019s \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d has us wondering if there will soon be geographical moves as the industry finds guiding light elsewhere. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Bitcoin network: Stress test\n\nThe Bitcoin network has typically attracted fewer memecoins than Ethereum, but its role in the segment has grown since the BRC-20 standards were launched. Image: Canva\n\nTwo months after the launch of BRC-20 standards, the Bitcoin blockchain has become a popular destination for memecoins, a cryptocurrency market niche previously dominated by Ethereum. The market capitalization of Bitcoin-based memecoins has surged from around US$130 million at the beginning of May to over US$588 million at press time, triggering congestion on the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network.\n\nBRC-20 is an experimental token standard based on the Bitcoin blockchain, introduced on March 9 this year by pseudonymous blockchain enthusiast \u201cDomo.\u201d Inspired by the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s ERC-20 standards, BRC-20 allows users to issue fungible tokens through Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol. On the same day, Domo launched the first BRC-20 token, Ordi.\n\nMore than 14,300 BRC-20 tokens have been issued on the Bitcoin blockchain since the standard was launched, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io. Memecoins including ORDI, PEPE Ordinals (not to be confused with the Ethereum-based PEPE memecoin), and MEME have taken the lead in terms of market capitalization, with ORDI\u2019s market cap currently topping US$300 million, almost-two thirds that of all BRC-20 tokens combined.\n\nMemecoins are cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin and the Shiba Inu token, that started as a joke or meme. Memecoins typically have no underlying utility, but some have attained market caps in the billions of dollars. Memecoin prices are usually extremely volatile, and their popularity and values are driven mainly by fads and a herd mentality.\n\nThe prices of BRC-20 tokens have been on a roller coaster in the past several days, with their total market cap exceeding US$1 billion on Monday, plunging more than 28% to around US$689 million on Tuesday, and sliding some more to under US$580 million on Thursday evening in Hong Kong, according to BRC-20.io.\n\nThe BRC-20 memecoin surge has driven up transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain and put the network\u2019s capabilities to the test. Transaction fees for minting tokens using the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol reached more than 151 BTC on May 9, an almost 40-fold increase from 4.30 BTC on March 9 when the BRC-20 standard was introduced, according to blockchain data analytics platform Dune Analytics.\n\nDriven by surging transactions and fees on the Bitcoin network, crypto exchange Binance suspended Bitcoin withdrawals twice \u2015 once on May 7 and again on May 8 \u2015 triggering a drop in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nTransactions made by Binance users could not get picked up by Bitcoin validators, as the withdrawals fees charged by the exchange were lower than those charged by the miners, according to a Bloomberg report that quoted Stefan von Haenisch, head of sales trading at digital asset brokerage OSL SG in Singapore.\n\nDriven by blockchain users seeking alternatives to high Bitcoin transaction fees, the Litecoin blockchain has logged record-high daily transactions this week. Transactions on Litecoin topped 525,000 on Monday, more than five times higher than the start of the month, according to blockchain data platform BitInfoCharts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol was introduced in January and allows data such as text and images to be inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, a function similar to that used in the minting of non-fungible tokens.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin\u2019s embrace of memecoins helped the network achieve record-breaking transaction figures in the past week, but keen-eyed observers of the surge noticed that the dollar value of many transactions shrunk from US$1,000 to US$1. This downshift in value brings Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain behavior into line with other chains able to host tokens. It\u2019s a good sign for Bitcoin, but a terrible one for the environment. Bitcoin is notoriously slow at updating. Of all the nodes on the Bitcoin network that are reachable (some hide behind VPNs to avoid detection) currently only around 36% run the latest version of Bitcoin\u2019s core software. That makes upgrading all nodes difficult and makes changes to Bitcoin\u2019s core software a challenge. Introducing the BRC-20 token standard is a demonstration that change is possible on the network. But one change that hasn\u2019t been considered is Bitcoin\u2019s horrendous energy consumption. Bitcoin, now the only large blockchain running on a proof-of-work protocol, continues to tax energy grids across the world. The surge in transactions has increased the power needed to keep the network running. Although Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption has fallen significantly below its usage from a year ago, it represents a problem for the long-term sustainability of the network and the planet. If the trend toward smaller transactions accelerates, expect Bitcoin to become a burden on energy grids once again, perhaps even forcing miners out of their adopted homes in such eco-unfriendly places with artificially low energy prices as Texas.\n\n2. Pause and reset\n\nBinance\u2019s suspensions of Bitcoin withdrawals come amid surging transaction volumes that have strained the network\u2019s capabilities. Image: Canva\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, suspended Bitcoin withdrawals twice within 12 hours on Sunday and Monday Hong Kong time, citing a \u201clarge volume of pending transactions\u201d on the Bitcoin blockchain. The suspension came amid a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which has put the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network under pressure.\n\nBinance tweeted on Monday: \u201cOur set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in Bitcoin network gas fees\u201d and the exchange said it was attempting to solve the issue by amending pending transactions with higher fees so they would be picked up by mining pools.\n\n\u201cPending transactions are being processed by replacing them with higher transaction fees,\u201d Binance said after it resumed allowing Bitcoin withdrawals. \u201cTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.\u201d\n\nBinance also noted in the tweet it has been working to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network into its transaction services, which it said would help in such situations. The Lightning Network is a layer-2 protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain that aims to improve the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nOn Sunday night Hong Kong time, Binance tweeted that it had encountered a \u201ccongestion issue\u201d and had to halt Bitcoin withdrawals. About an hour and a half later, it said it had resumed withdrawals.\n\nData from CryptoQuant showed that Binance saw total outflows of around 188,281 BTC on Sunday alone, the largest daily volume CryptoQuant has recorded since it started tracking such data in May 2020.\n\nThe average transaction fee on the Bitcoin blockchain reached US$19.20 on Sunday, its highest level in almost two years, and soared to US$31.14 on Monday, according to data from blockchain information platform BitInfoCharts. Bitcoin\u2019s average transaction fee was only US$2.88 at the beginning of May.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, and the subsequent suspension of BTC withdrawals by Binance, was interpreted by some as an example of how someone might attack the Bitcoin network in the future, choking it with transaction requests. Others, meanwhile, highlighted that to do so would require deep pockets, as one user had to pay more than 5 BTC (over US$170,000) to complete one transaction earlier this week. The congestion temporarily created a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain that meant nearly 10 BTC had been double-spent as it had been registered on both chains. The last time this happened was November 2020, highlighting how unusual congestion on the network has become. The rocketing fees, alongside record-breaking outflows, suggest Bitcoin may be entering a new phase in its evolution. The total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets is now more than 5 million, a figure that has doubled in less than a week. Although historically Bitcoin has been used as a store of value, and the demand on the network has therefore been manageable, the explosion of people taking advantage of the BRC-20 standard means the network and its off-ramps need to adapt.\n\n3. Small doses\n\nThe decision by China\u2019s top court to allow settlement in crypto of cases involving small sums of debt marks a modest departure from Beijing\u2019s ban on all crypto transactions. Image: Canva\n\nVirtual assets can be used legally in China to settle debts in certain cases involving transactions made as part of barter agreements or labor services, despite the nation\u2019s blanket ban on cryptocurrency transactions, the Supreme People\u2019s Court of China declared at a conference earlier this year.\n\nThe country\u2019s top court said at the conference on financial cases in January that cryptocurrencies shared some attributes of virtual properties, and if parties in cases agreed to use small amounts of cryptocurrencies to settle their debts, those contracts should be regarded as valid by Chinese courts.\n\nIf cryptocurrency transactions could not be executed due to legal restrictions, courts would determine compensation based on the actual value of the agreed sum of crypto involved when contracts were signed.\n\nThe Supreme Court added that courts would not accept any complaints by users if their cryptocurrencies had been traded after Sept. 4, 2017 \u2014 the date that Beijing imposed a ban on initial coin offerings and crypto exchange services \u2014 and in cases in which trading platforms or token issuers failed to fulfill their liquidation obligations.\n\nCourt records further clarified that the use of cryptocurrencies as payment for fiat currencies or physical commodities under the guise of contracts would be treated as illegal.\n\nThe conference records align with the Chinese government\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies, which emphasizes that tokens such as Bitcoin, Ether and Tether do not have the same legal status as fiat money. China issued its comprehensive ban on cryptocurrency transactions in September 2021.\n\nOutside mainland China, Hong Kong\u2019s push to develop itself as a crypto hub has received Beijing\u2019s blessing, with Chinese state-owned banks now offering services to crypto firms in the territory."

        "content": "Bradley Rettler is an Associate Professor of Philosophy, and a member of the Resistance Money, a philosophy research collective focused on Bitcoin. In this interview, we discuss the potential ethical implications of AI, philosophical reflections on money creation and governance, the importance of financial literacy, and combating misinformation about Bitcoin.\n\n- - - -\n\nOver the past few years, one of the important groups to emerge within the Bitcoin community has been the philosophers studying Bitcoin, led by members of the Resistance Money collective: Andrew Bailey, Bradley Rettle and Craig Warmke (with Troy Cross as an honorary member). They have added academic weight to the consideration of the importance of Bitcoin in the context of fundamental questions regarding money\u2019s role in society.\n\nThe Resistance Money collective has been examining Bitcoin from various angles. In the episode, Bradley discusses moral dilemmas posed by a material global transition to this new form of money: the transfer of wealth, energy consumption impacts, the acceptance of privacy for bad and good, and usage by enemies. In addition, considerations about the benefits provided by fiat currency that could be lost: e.g. is there a useful societal function provided by money printing?\n\nBut this is where philosophical tools are extremely useful. In a previous episode, Craig Warmke explained the usefulness of the \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 thought experiment, where one assumes they have no knowledge of what position in society they would have, and, from this position, they then determine what monetary system would best serve society for the great good. It is this perspective that is used to establish the Resistence Money thesis on Bitcoin.\n\nIn a scenario where you could fall into any position in society, it would obviously be better that Bitcoin existed. It is the philosophical equivalent of checking your privilege. Whilst Bitcoin\u2019s potential impact on society is complex and uneven, it is far easier to understand how Bitcoin acts to mitigate global inequality and inequity when assuming a scenario where you need it, and it doesn\u2019t exist."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals, a technology that enables adding text, images and code on a satoshi \u2014 the smallest unit of Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 continues to inspire debate among the Bitcoin community.\n\nSoon after the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals in January 2023, the technology\u2019s opponents began to raise concerns over its perceived flaws, citing issues like rising transaction costs and slower speeds.\n\nConversely, Ordinals supporters said that the tech provides more opportunities, improves decentralization and ensures freedom of speech.\n\nAs the number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions doubled from 2.5 million to over 5 million in just eight days, Cointelegraph looks at the technology and the controversy surrounding it.\n\nCost, speed and security vulnerabilities\n\nThe undeniable and undesired impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin\u2019s network capacity and scalability is one of the biggest arguments by Bitcoin purists, who believe that BTC is supposed to exclusively follow Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s prescribed peer-to-peer payment mission.\n\nThe ongoing rise in BRC-20 activity \u2014 which utilizes Ordinal inscriptions \u2014 has triggered a sharp increase in BTC transaction fees. The trading frenzy of BRC-20 memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) has driven Bitcoin transaction costs to the highest levels since 2021.\n\nAs users continue pouring BTC into minting new tokens settled via Ordinals inscriptions, the blockchain has also experienced massive congestion. On May 7, the Binance exchange temporarily closed BTC withdrawals due to 400,000 pending transactions clogging the mempool.\n\nGiven recent events, can we just agree to rename the mempool to memepool? pic.twitter.com/6jHQKvjPW2 \u2014 alfaleek (yo / uhh / hmm) (@alfaleek) May 3, 2023\n\nEnrico Rubboli, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 sidechain Mintlayer, told Cointelegraph that the technology behind Ordinals is \u201cheavily flawed\u201d and doesn\u2019t follow the \u201caxioms of the core Bitcoin community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe developers of the standard and the tools are not affiliated with Bitcoin, they are anonymous, and their software has not been thoroughly tested in this application,\u201d Rubboli said. The exec also believes that Ordinals could cause additional regulatory scrutiny for Bitcoin, as new BRC-20 tokens may be considered unregulated securities.\n\nRubboli further argued that, with Ordinals, the protocol is vulnerable to scams. \u201cThe entire ecosystem was set up to be confusing and misleading,\u201d he said, arguing that BRC-20 was created to \u201cleech off the popularity of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token.\u201d\n\nHe further emphasized that the anonymous BRC-20 creator Domo warned users in the first place that the tokens were \u201cworthless.\u201d Before launching BRC-20, Domo took to Twitter to stress that the token is \u201csimply a fun experiment.\u201d\n\ngm. I'm glad that some people like the experiment. Some additional notes.\n\n1. These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.\n\n2. Due to how some inscription tools are set up, the 'balance' may be minted to the intermediary address used in https://t.co/mja39YGIow\u2026 \u2014 domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023\n\n\u201cThese will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting,\u201d the BRC-20 creator wrote.\n\nArguments from Bitcoin Ordinals supporters\n\nBitcoin Ordinal\u2019s capability to unlock new value on the Bitcoin blockchain is a significant counterargument by supporters of Ordinals. Some Ordinals defenders also believe that issues like higher transaction costs will fade with time.\n\n\u201cOrdinals is a beneficial exploration for Bitcoin application and helps to unlock greater value in the Bitcoin network,\u201d F2Pool chief marketing officer Li Qingfei told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cThe network congestion it brings should be temporary, and there will be good solutions to solve the problem and reduce transaction costs, and increase transaction speeds, just like the Lightning Network.\u201d\n\nLi claimed that the increase in transaction fees will encourage more miners to participate in maintaining the network after Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving in 2024. As an active proponent of Ordinals, F2Pool launched a special nonfungible token series called \u201c10\u00b2 Islands\u201d to celebrate its 10th anniversary.\n\nRoundtable21 co-founder Brandon Dallmann echoed Li\u2019s remarks, stating that BRC-20 is currently being stress-tested against Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol. \u201cSince it is not complete yet, the Bitcoin network is unable to keep up with the demand and is getting congested,\u201d he told Cointelegraph.\n\nDallmann also advised users to utilize multiple crypto platforms instead of keeping the entire stake on just one to prevent issues caused by congestion on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSome community members asked why one should hinder Bitcoin\u2019s transformation from \u201cmagic internet money\u201d to a more complex technology.\n\n\u201cI see the backlash from many BTC purists, but I don\u2019t think that anyone should use their platform to attempt to censor transactions and attempt to discern between what is a \u2018valid\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 transaction on any network,\u201d AngelBlock founder Alex Strzesniewski told Cointelegraph.\n\nMany Ordinals supporters have also noted the technology\u2019s contribution to the freedom of speech. \u201cI know everyone hates ordinals, but whether it\u2019s text or images, the ability to publish uncensorable information on the Bitcoin time chain effectively makes speech uncensorable worldwide forever,\u201d Bitcoin observer BitPaine wrote on Twitter.\n\nPerspective matters most\n\nDespite the clashing perspectives between Ordinals\u2019 supporters and detractors, it\u2019s important to note that much of the reasoning for or against them largely depends on perspective.\n\nFor example, for layer-2 tech builders, it is only natural to oppose Bitcoin\u2019s base layer developments like Ordinals. In contrast, miners will likely not oppose something that could increase their revenues.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are hardly changing anything for hodlers, who most likely won\u2019t care much about transaction fees or the size of the mempool. However, they are causing many issues for traders and other market participants like crypto exchanges.\n\nWhether or not Ordinals are here to stay, the community has yet to see the technology\u2019s full potential and its true consequences."

U.S. equity futures edged up as economic data on Thursday indicated inflation is slowing, raising optimism the Federal Reserve may halt its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin network buckles under weight of BRC-20\u2019s runaway success\n\nBitcoin, Ether fall to monthly lows\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin slid 2.13% to US$26,974 in the 24 hours to 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, losing 6.63% for the week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,781 at one stage on Thursday, the lowest price since March 28.\n\nCongestion on the Bitcoin blockchain is fueling the slide, with a backlog of waiting transactions reaching almost 300,000 on Friday morning, over six times higher than the number on May 9. That was when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced to allow the minting of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network and generated a surge in activity, according to data from blockchain researcher Jochen Hoenicke.\n\nThe jump in transaction volumes has raised concerns among Bitcoin developers. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin code contributor, emailed the Bitcoin developer community on Monday to suggest blocking the transactions of BRC-20 tokens, which \u201cthreaten the smooth and normal use of the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer digital currency.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s drop also comes amid rising concerns about liquidity. Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, two of the world\u2019s leading market makers, are reportedly quitting digital asset trading in the U.S., according to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday.\n\nEther fell 2.34% to US$1,795, posting a weekly loss of 4.45%. The token dropped to US$1,774 on early Friday, the lowest price since April 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Beacon Chain of the Ethereum Network briefly stopped validating transactions on early Friday morning, with Ethereum developers tweeting later that the outage had been resolved and the cause still under investigation.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers, dropping 3.75% to US$0.8406 and retreating 14.45% for the week. The token logged a low of US$0.8332 earlier today, the lowest price since January 8, 2023.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 2.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.12 trillion. The total trading volume dropped 17.87% to US$37.67 billion.\n\nNFT index dips, Ethereum sales slide after Milady hype\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.42% to 3,394.50 in the 24 hours to 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.14% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain fell 47.62% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, as the hype for Millady Maker NFT collection faded. Sales of Millady Maker dropped 86.53% to US$1.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nNFT trading is slowing due to the recent memecoin hype, with very few new users entering the space, according to Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. NFT buyers on the Ethereum blockchain totaled 45,298 in the past seven days, a drop of 72.97%.\n\nMemecoins are also losing steam. The price of Ordi, the memecoin that accounts for more than 60% of the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens, has slid 31.43% in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io.\n\nEquity futures gain on slowing inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.07%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.14%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.25%. The three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Thursday on investor concerns about banking risks.\n\nThe U.S. producer price index (PPI) in April logged an annual increase of 2.3%, lower than predictions of 2.4% and the slowest pace since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday.\n\nU.S. initial jobless claims rose to 264,000 in the week ending May 6, beating expectations and reaching the highest level since October 2021, according to a Thursday Bloomberg report. Together with the PPI, the data points to a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged in June.\n\nOn U.S. banks, PacWest Bancorp shares fell more than 20% on Thursday, after the California-based lender said its deposits declined approximately 9.5% in the week ending May 5, sparking new concerns about the banking industry after a series of failures at lenders this year.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and top lawmakers postponed Friday talks on raising the U.S. debt ceiling to early next week, according to CNN on Thursday, with the negotiations making little progress so far.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will decide on June 14 its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 12.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 3.9% on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Japan looks to regain its place in the cryptocurrency world pecking order"

        "title": "Bitcoin congestion issues continue amid BRC-20 memecoin, Ordinals surge - Forkast News",
        "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain has been facing a growing backlog of transactions in recent days amid the arrival of memecoins on the network.\n\nThe market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens, a fungible tokens standard built on the Ordinals protocol that is fueling the memecoin surge on Bitcoin, surpassed US$1 billion on Tuesday, before retreating to US$588 million as of 6:00 p.m. in Hong Kong Thursday, according to data provider BRC-20.io.\n\nHeadlined by memecoin rising star Pepe, over 14,300 types of BRC-20 tokens are contributing to jamming up the blockchain thanks to Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed in the smallest monetary unit of Bitcoin, satoshi. The inscription also brought a version of non-fungible tokens (NFT) to Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver of this congestion and the related surge in transaction fees are inscriptions that use the BRC-20 minting standard,\u201d said Colin Harper, head of research and content at Bitcoin mining software and services firm Luxor Technologies, in an email.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion can be measured by its memory pool size, or mempool, the queue of pending valid transactions waiting to be added to blocks. It is often measured in virtual bytes (vbytes), and a single Bitcoin block can theoretically hold up to a million vbytes.\n\nOver 298,312 transactions were waiting to be validated as of 6 p.m. on Thursday, which is equal to a near one-month high of 186.7 million vbytes. Bitcoin\u2019s mempool size stood at 3.31 million vbytes on April 24, according to on-chain data from mempool.space.\n\nThe expanding mempool size caused Bitcoin transaction fees to rise to US$30.91 on Monday, the highest in two years. This dropped to US$14.05 as of 6 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to Chicago-based investment software company ycharts.\n\n\u201c[BRC-20 inscriptions] use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format which is relatively data heavy. Combine that heaviness with the \u2018first-come, first-mint\u2019 incentives that BRC-20 mints create and you have a recipe for transaction congestion,\u201d wrote Harper,\n\nMiners profit from Bitcoin congestion\n\nWith the heating memecoin economy on the Bitcoin blockchain, the network surpassed 5 million Ordinals inscriptions on Tuesday, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nThe congestion may have lengthened waiting times for Bitcoin users, but Luxor Technologies\u2019 Harper said that the BRC-20 standard essentially doubled miner revenue.\n\n\u201cSurging fees will price out some transactions for sure, but I doubt that this BRC-20 minting mania will last too much longer. Fees may become elevated like this from time to time with different inscription mints or other demands for block space, but they will revert to the mean eventually,\u201d wrote Harper.\n\nNazar Khan, the chief operating officer and chief technology officer of U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf, also expects transaction fees to return to normal in the short term.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect transaction fees to return to lower levels in the next couple of weeks, we believe this episode highlights how varied the use case for the Bitcoin network can be over time. Whatever the short-term impacts of surging transaction fees may be today, Bitcoin is the most secure and robust network that exists and will continue to attract increasing levels of activity,\u201d added Khan.\n\nEnough memes for Bitcoin?\n\nWhile miners welcomed the revenue surge, some Bitcoin developers are campaigning to phase out Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens from the network.\n\n\u201cAction should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since day 1. It\u2019s a mistake that the existing filters weren\u2019t extended to Taproot transactions. We can address that, or try a more narrow approach like OP_RETURN (ie, what \u201cOrdisrespector\u201d does). Since this is a bugfix, it doesn\u2019t really even need to wait for a major release,\u201d said Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr in an email dated May 8.\n\nNFT supporters, including Washington Sanchez, the NFT product lead at U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, brushed off Dashjr\u2019s threat on social media.\n\n\u201cLuke is waging a 1 man jihad against Ordinals, I doubt the other devs will take him seriously based on their precious comments that Bitcoin was working as expected if people are submitting valid transactions,\u201d tweeted Sanchez.\n\nHowever, online discussions show that Dashjr has some support from the Bitcoin community.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin] was not originally intended to support tokens or smart contracts,\u201d one user wrote on bitcointalk.org, an online cryptocurrency forum launched by pseudonymous Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cThese changes are breaking the network and eroding the years of trust that Bitcoin has created.\u201d\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s mempool congestion eases after millionth Ordinals inscription"

At the time, Twitter said that 130 accounts were targeted.\n\nThe hackers tweeted from those accounts falsely claiming that they would double all bitcoin sent to them in the next 30 minutes.

Swatting refers to the act of calling the police on an innocent person and falsely claiming criminal activity.\n\n\"O'Connor's criminal activities were flagrant and malicious, and his conduct impacted multiple people's lives. He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.\n\nO'Connor pleaded guilty to multiple counts of stalking, computer intrusion, extortion, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23 and faces a maximum sentence of more than 70 years in prison."

Preston Pysh found it, retweeted it, and shouted me out. I owe him credit to go from 300 followers to 3,000 followers,\u201d Clemente says.\n\nAfter Pysh retweeted Clemente\u2019s report, Pomp stumbled upon it and invited Clemente to be a guest on his podcast \u2013 The Pomp Podcast \u2013 which boosted his follower count to 5,000.\n\n\u201cFrom there, it gave me the confidence to go from 5,000 to 10,000, and it just took off after that,\u201d he says. \u201cI owe Preston and Pomp big time.\u201d\n\nClemente appears unfazed by the enormous size of his audience online.\n\n\u201c600,000 \u2014 it\u2019s just numbers on the screen,\u201d he declares.\n\nThat said, he\u2019s even getting recognized on the street these days.\n\n\u201cWhen you see people recognize you, that is weird.

Credit: Twitter/@0xCuteSocks\n\nIn an undisclosed Discord server, the user (known as \u2018camper\u2019) reached out and pleaded with the Bitcoin user to return the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cJared from Subway, if you are reading this please help. I sent you by mistake tokens for about $1.5 m.

Credit: Twitter/@0xCuteSocks\n\nHowever, it seems the Bitcoin user\u2019s luck has finally turned around.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, @0xCuteSocks revealed that \u2018Jared\u2019 had returned the eye-watering sum later on.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nThey shared a screenshot of the Discord server, which read: \u201cMy story finished with happy end. Jared is a very good person. All money were refund.\u201d\n\nThe user also explained how the transactions had gone wrong, adding that they \u2018misstyped\u2019 the address where the tokens were being transferred to."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has had some tough times recently, from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal charges to the crash that has caused digital currency holders to rush toward investments that are more stable. Now they\u2019re facing a new challenge: memes.\n\nBinance, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world, recently suspended withdrawals after it experienced \u201ca congestion issue.\u201d New York Magazine\u2018s Kevin T. Dugan explains that the network that processes bitcoin transactions at one point had 400,000 stuck in a queue. Consequently, fees have increased to conduct transactions\u2014now up to $20, when last month it might have cost 87 cents. However, many of those people are simply trying to send memes.\n\nWhile the blockchain is primarily handling data that details transactions, users are now able to to write data into said transactions which might include photos or jokes, which is called \u201cinscribing.\u201d A recent upgrade to the network has made inscribing faster and cheaper, but the network is straining under the additional volume. That\u2019s because blockchain is now filled up with NFTs and meme coins. Two coins in particular\u2014one featuring alt-Right troll meme Pepe the Frog and the other based on SpongeBob SquarePants\u2014are having a huge speculative boom and their increased trading volume is gumming up the works.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on bitcoin network,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau told CNBC. \u201cThe bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network.\u201d\n\nYet, in the short term, the congestion points to a major problem with the blockchain, which is its processing speed. Right now it can handle about seven to 10 transactions per second, compared to MasterCard which claims the ability to process 5,000 per second. To truly become an alternate currency, bitcoin needs to really pick up the pace."

Source: TradingView\n\nThe BTC/USD pair broke above $29,800 on May 6, but the tide quickly changed as the resistance proved stronger than anticipated.\n\nThe subsequent 8.2% two-day correction tested $27,400 support, favoring the thesis of sideways trading as investors evaluate the economic crisis dynamic and its potential impact on cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway owner and billionaire investor Warren Buffett is no longer optimistic about U.S. economic growth. Such a pessimistic scenario for the global economy might explain why some Bitcoin traders decided to reduce exposure over the past week, greatly reducing the odds of breaking $30,000.\n\nBitcoin options: Bulls were excessively optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the May 12 options expiry is $900 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$28,000 price levels.\n\nThese traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied 11.2% between April 9 and April 14, testing the $31,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for May 12. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.65 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $560 million in call (buy) open interest and the $340 million in put (sell) options.\n\nBut if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $27,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 12, only $11 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $28,000 or $29,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bulls aim for $28,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 12 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $27,000: 100 calls vs. 9,900 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $230 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 9,900 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $230 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 400 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $120 million.\n\n400 calls vs. 5,000 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $120 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n1,500 calls vs. 2,100 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $29,000 and $30,000: 3,300 calls vs. 800 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $70 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nUltimately, after it became clear that the Bitcoin network was working as designed, the selling pressure dissipated, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to stabilize around $27,500. Nevertheless, traders should be cautious as the bears are still in a better position for Friday\u2019s weekly options expiry, favoring negative price moves.\n\nRelated: PayPal\u2019s crypto holdings increased by 56% in Q1 2023 to nearly $1B\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Clausi was imprisoned in December 2021 on charges of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cuse of foreign currency for payment within Moroccan borders,\u201d with a prison sentence and a fine handed down in October of the same year.\n\n| Un fran\u00e7ais a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par la Chambre criminelle du tribunal de Casablanca \u00e0 une peine de 18 mois de prison assortie d\u2019une amende de 3,4 millions d\u2019euros.\n\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour escroquerie et d\u2019usage ill\u00e9gal de crypto-monnaie.\n\nIl a vendu sa Ferrari en \u00e9change de pic.twitter.com/ubk3m1p9UJ \u2014 Moroccan History \u06de (@MoroccanSories) October 21, 2022\n\nThe legal case against Clausi began after a woman, who lived in Casablanca, accused him of \u201cfraud\u201d after exchanging the luxury car for a Bitcoin payment of around $437,000.\n\nAccording to Aghanaj, Clausi still has a month left to serve in prison.\n\nRelated: Porsche NFT trading volume nears $5M despite launch woes, minting halt\n\nDespite its illegal status in the country, Morocco was hailed as the number one in BTC trading across North Africa in 2021.

        "content": "Amid the ongoing spike in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees, some cryptocurrency exchanges have moved to adjust the cost of withdrawing BTC from their platforms.\n\nThe United States-based exchange Kraken has increased Bitcoin withdrawal fees to match the current fees on-chain, the company\u2019s customer support manager wrote on Reddit on May 10.\n\n\u201cThis helps ensure withdrawals are processed on-chain in a timely manner,\u201d the support manager noted.\n\nKraken\u2019s representative also referred to the company\u2019s public list of cryptocurrency withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts. According to the data, Kraken charges 0.00035 BTC, roughly $10, for a Bitcoin withdrawal, with a minimum amount of 0.0005 BTC, roughly $13.\n\nKraken Support on increasing BTC fees. Source: Reddit\n\nThe minimum BTC withdrawal amount on the Lightning Network (LN) also significantly differs from non-Lightning BTC, starting from as low as 0.00001 BTC, less than $1.\n\nThe support manager also advised customers to consider using the Lightning Network as an alternative. Adopted by Kraken in March 2022, the LN option allows users to withdraw BTC from the platform free of charge.\n\nBitcoin withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts on Kraken. Source: Kraken\n\nKraken\u2019s public withdrawal fees are significantly less than other major exchanges. Crypto exchange OKX charges between 0.00096 BTC ($26) and 0.00192 BTC ($53) for a BTC withdrawal, a spokesperson for OKX told Cointelegraph. The minimum withdrawal amount is 0.001 BTC, or $27.\n\nOKX declined to comment on whether the exchange will increase withdrawal fees due to skyrocketing Bitcoin transaction costs. The platform also implemented the LN in 2022.\n\nHowever, Kraken isn\u2019t the only exchange that has adjusted BTC withdrawal fees amid the ongoing memecoin trading frenzy.\n\nCrypto exchange KuCoin uses dynamic adjustment for BTC withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts, a spokesperson for the firm told Cointelegraph on May 10. The adjustment is based on the amount of actual processing fees on the chain so that KuCoin is \u201ccompatible with the market situation,\u201d the representative noted.\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, our withdrawal fee is between 0.00002 and 0.001 BTC, and the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.0005 BTC,\u201d the spokesperson stated, adding:\n\n\u201cWith regard to implementation of Lightning Network, KuCoin has not yet deployed LN, however, we will actively monitor the market and make adjustments if needed.\u201d\n\nKuCoin\u2019s current Bitcoin withdrawal fees are similar to those implemented on other exchanges like Huobi or Binance.\n\nRelated: Coinbase calls Pepe a \u2018hate symbol,\u2019 prompting calls to boycott the exchange\n\n\u201cOn-chain withdrawal fees are increased due to BTC network congestion. The current withdrawal fee is 0.001 BTC,\u201d a spokesperson for Huobi told Cointelegraph on May 11. Before the increase, the original BTC withdrawal fee was 0.0004 BTC ($11), the representative added. Huobi has also not implemented Lightning yet. \u201cThe Lightning Network is currently under discussion,\u201d the Huobi spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to public information, Binance also charges 0.001 BTC ($27) as a BTC withdrawal fee, while the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.002 BTC, roughly $55.\n\nDespite relatively expensive BTC withdrawal fees, Binance has experienced major withdrawal issues amid the ongoing mempool congestion recently. On May 8, Binance was forced to halt withdrawals twice in 12 hours, with 400,000 transactions stuck in the Bitcoin mempool. The events have pushed Binance to seriously consider implementing the LN.\n\nMultiple exchanges, including Coinbase, Bybit and Crypto.com, didn\u2019t respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "content": "The apparent exit or reduction in trading by Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two influential cryptocurrency market makers, has the potential to disrupt the fragile flow of liquidity across the industry, an analyst at Kaiko told CoinDesk.\n\nJane Street and Jump are paring back crypto trading in the U.S., Bloomberg reported Tuesday, amid the regulatory clampdown that spawned out of FTX's collapse in November. Jump's crypto division will continue to expand globally while Jane Street will scale back on its growth plans, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"The news is not necessarily surprising given recent developments,\" Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk. \"What's concerning is that liquidity has still not recovered from Alameda's collapse, and a slowdown with two of the biggest surviving market makers could weigh on liquidity even further. It's a bit surprising how slow the industry has been to fill Alameda's shoes.\"\n\nMarket depth, a metric used to measure liquidity on exchanges by assessing how much capital is required to move a market, slumped by more than 50% following the collapse of FTX and has failed to recover despite a rise in crypto prices.\n\nCrypto-native market makers, unlike traditional firms such as Jane Street and Jump, aren't put off by the duo's exodus as the issue is constrained to the U.S. market.\n\n\"Not a big impact yet,\" Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Paris-based market market Woorton, told CoinDesk. \"In the short term, some exchanges will be less liquid but more importantly it will be more difficult for US counterparties to source OTC liquidity.\"\n\n\"We might see it in the future if brokers, payment providers and other actors looking to source liquidity start shifting offshore or to Europe and Asia,\" he added.\n\nThe United States' gung-ho stance on crypto regulation has already attracted criticism from the likes of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, but the long-lasting effects are potentially far greater than any short-term tremble.\n\nAn absence of liquidity, which is what the crypto industry will experience as several market makers jump ship, causes an increase in volatility as it takes less capital to move an asset. This, coupled with this highly-leveraged nature of crypto markets, has the potential to create a credit risk that could spread to all sectors of finance."

But unlike other NFTs that may point to outside servers that store the media they represent, Ordinals fully exist on the blockchain, with the media \u201cinscribed\u201d directly on a Satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin.\n\nBinance also said it will make it simple for users to buy and sell a Bitcoin NFT \u201cinscription\u201d by letting them do so from their Binance accounts rather than a separate inscription-compatible wallet.\n\nSome Bitcoin supporters have said Ordinals are a good way for the network to expand beyond purely financial use cases.

It had recorded almost 2,300 transactions by midday Wednesday, according to a dashboard on Dune. The increased popularity of Ordinals comes as developers on other networks including Solana have challenged Ethereum\u2019s dominance in NFT transactions with new projects and experiments like xNFTs.\n\nBitcoin transactions have exploded on the network recently, boosted in part by Ordinals. In early May, the network recorded more than 680,000 daily transactions, the most ever. The fees to record a new transaction on the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed to $20 from just under $3 earlier this month, according to BitInfoCharts."

        "content": "The net effect of the presence of Bitcoin miners on a modern grid is to cut off the tails of the price distribution: they scoop up cheap (or even negatively priced power) when no one is buying it \u2013 helping utilities better monetize \u2013 and they turn off when power is expensive, giving power back to households during grid scarcity events. Miners actively participate in \u201cdemand response\u201d or \u201ccontrollable load\u201d programs in grids that have them, helping stabilize grids as they have a unique ability to react quickly to changing grid conditions and dial up and down their consumption as needed. During the grid strain last winter and in summer 2022 in Texas, miners dialed down their consumption, so energy could flow back to ordinary households. It\u2019s no wonder that Texas governor Greg Abbott has praised miners for their benevolent presence on the ERCOT grid."

        "content": "Two CryptoQuant analysts have opined that BTC\u2019s price will fall below $25,000.\n\nBTC\u2019s selling pressure has outweighed its buying pressure in the past few days.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] weighted sentiment lingers in the negative territory, CryptoQuant analyst Baro Virtual, in a new report, opined that the king coin\u2019s price could fall below $25,000 as long as bearish sentiments remain in the market.\n\nBaro\u2019s conclusion was based on an assessment of BTC\u2019s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) on a 21-day moving average. This metric tracks the number of cryptocurrency coins that have been inactive for a certain period of time and then suddenly moved.\n\nAccording to Glassnode Academy, it is calculated by multiplying the number of coins that have been inactive by the number of days they have been inactive.\n\nAccording to Baro, BTC\u2019s CDD metric revealed that the king coin enjoyed three periods of local accumulation on 15 March, 31 March, and 12 April, respectively, after which a period of local distribution began on 20 April.\n\nLocal distribution occurs when investors take to selling their holdings, causing the price of an asset to either stagnate or decrease slightly.\n\nAlthough BTC lingers in this phase, Baro added, \u201cBitcoin is still moving within a local uptrend.\u201d However, \u201cthe danger of falling to $24,500-25,000 remains within the bearish H&S pattern.\u201d\n\nSharing the same opinion, another pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Abramchart noted that a new support area had been identified following BTC\u2019s fall from the $30,000 price mark. According to Abramchart,\n\n\u201cAfter the recent drop in Bitcoin, we can identify the next support areas through the Realized Price \u2013 UTXO Age Bands indicator, which helps us to understand the holding behavior of each group by comparing a set of different realized prices. The closest support area is at 25619, which represents the average purchase price of wallets that bought Bitcoin within the last 3-6 months.\u201d\n\nThe numbers on a daily chart\n\nAt press time, BTC exchanged hands at $27,579.73. After the coin\u2019s price peaked at $30,967 on 14 April, it has since dropped by 11%.\n\nOn a daily chart, the coin\u2019s momentum indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested below its 50-neutral spot at 42.44. In a downtrend at the time of writing, selling pressure exceeded accumulation.\n\nAlso, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was spotted below its centerline at -0.02. When an asset\u2019s CMF returns a negative value, it means that the selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure.\n\nIt also suggests that the asset\u2019s money flow volume is decreasing, and is often followed by a price decline."

Vecchiarelli said that the stunted revenue growth was largely a result of low Bitcoin prices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Our revenue per Bitcoin this quarter was approximately $22,700 whereas last year, our revenue per Bitcoin was over $41,000,\" Vecchiarelli said in a conference call.\n\nHe added that the company's improved hash rate makes it \"well positioned to take advantage of even the slightest increase in bitcoin prices.\"\n\nCEO Zach Bradford was quick to bring up the next halving event too.\n\nThe halving refers to the moment when miners\u2019 block rewards will be cut from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, which is expected to occur sometime next April.\n\n\"Only the most efficient miners will have the production capacity and balance sheets to capitalize on this historic event,\" Bradford said. He added that CleanSpark's current fleet averages 31 watts of electricity per Tera hash, which he expects to bring down as low as 26 watts by the end of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCleanSpark and the Bitcoin halving\n\nBradford suggested that for CleanSpark the next halving is the starting line of the race and that the company is \"driving energy into our operational muscles\" in preparation for the event.\n\nCleanSpark's training regimen appears to consist mostly of adding 65,000 more mining computers to their Georgia-based facilities, as well as maintaining low energy costs and building up its Bitcoin reserves.\n\nCleanSpark is reportedly in the process of adding another 20,000 more Bitmain s19 jPro+ miners to its facility in Washington, GA in the coming months, and an additional 45,000 Bitmain XP miners to another facility in Sandersville, GA, by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to Bradford, the added miners will boost the firm's total hash rate to 15.9 EH/s.\n\nWhile bolstering its fleet will certainly improve CleanSpark's ability to rapidly mine Bitcoin, the firm is also striving \u201cto leave the planet better than we found it.\u201d\n\nExecuting on this value is easier said than done, however.\n\nCleanSpark boasts that its mining is largely powered by a renewable energy mix, but also notes that it can't control the energy mix available at certain sites. To make up for some of the fossil fuel power used in its facilities, CleanSpark buys \"renewable energy credits\" through programs like \"Georgia's Simple Solar.\"\n\nEnergy credit programs have, however, been criticized for not truly amounting to a reduction in fossil fuel use.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin Fees Hit a Staggering $24m Following Ordinals \u2018NFT\u2019 Craze\n\nTransaction fees for Bitcoin have spiked to $19 due to the elevated demand for blockspace following the creation of NFTs using the Ordinals protocol. With the total amount of Inscriptions hitting 5,010,014 to date, the NFT craze has led to the total fees of Ordinals to hit ~$24,285,831, according to data by Dune Analytics \u2014 causing congestion and blockchain backlog.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin miners are dramatically benefiting from the Ordinals surge, critics perceive Bitcoin NFTs as attacking the network, defacing the peer-to-peer financial network that the Bitcoin blockchain enables. In addition, the mountainous costs for Bitcoin transactions and longer confirmation times make it tricky for crypto enthusiasts to use Bitcoin for minor transactions, with Salvador\u2019s Chivo ATM system being unstable due to costly gas fees.\n\nOrdinals have provoked the widespread use of the Bitcoin network\u2019s Taproot update, which was activated in 2021. This way of inscribing digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain has driven enormous hype, with vocal Ordinal advocates claiming that inscriptions are a game-changing experience for the NFT sphere, despite of the issues mentioned above.\n\nOverriding Bitcoin Fees \u2013 A Possible Solution\n\nLightning Network allows Web3 users to transact using much smaller fees without waiting for confirmation on the underlying blockchain. Lightning users can quickly settle their Bitcoin transactions to the fundamental Bitcoin foundation whenever they wish, waiting for convenient times to dodge high fees and congestion. For this reason, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance is scoping ways to add Lightning features. Other exchanges like OKX, Kraken and Bitfinex already support this second-layer payment protocol built on a blockchain. Consequently, the number of Lightning channels and nodes has been descending over the past month, while the price of regular Bitcoin transactions is ever-increasing.\n\nAs more exchanges implement Lightning features, it will be interesting to see how the Bitcoin network adapts to the increasing demand for Ordinal NFTs and prevents such high-fee transactions.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Carrollton, Texas, --News Direct-- Allied Energy Corporation\n\nAllied Energy Corp (OTC: AGYP), a producing oil and gas company focused on the leasing and reworking of oil and gas reserves in one of the most prolific hydrocarbon area in the United States, is pleased to provide a shareholder update regarding the Company's activities partnering with Enerhash USA at the Thiel Well site in an effort to begin flare gas bitcoin mining.\n\nOn April 26th, CEO George Monteith of Allied Energy received a revised field build out report distributed by Enerhash's personal.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond the Company's control, initial target dates for the Thiel site had to be adjusted. At this time the Company is confident that all challenges have been overcome regarding the initial delays. The Company is pleased with the revised timeline and is thankful to report that thus far everything is proceeding according to plan. To date the following work has been completed:\n\nOperating permits - completed\n\nSite survey - completed\n\nSite planning - completed\n\nElevation study - completed\n\nContractor proposal for site buildout - completed\n\nAllied will update their shareholders as further developments occur with press releases and media updates on Twitter.\n\nThe initial Thiel project, if all goes as planned, is expected to take 8-10 weeks to complete. The generators and data centers will be located 150 feet south of the wellhead. A meter run will be installed just north of the generator pad. The existing water tank will be reused for discharge from the separator. The elevated pad will be constructed of compacted engineered fill to support generator weights up to 60,000 lbs. per generator and 20,000 lbs. per data center. A reinforced concrete pad will be constructed on top of the compacted engineered fill to support the generator / generators. The contractor will provide two 3-inch electrical conduits with sweeping connections from the generators to each data center pad.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllied CEO George Monteith commented: \"The Thiel is the first location where Allied will establish a bitcoin mining footprint in partnership with Enerhash. At this time, we believe that the Thiel site will be a 3-megawatt center and power three containers of bitcoin mining equipment. As per our last release investors / current shareholders can see that we are laying a broader foundation of gas well resources through our new partnership with Sloan Petroleum. Ultimately, we are focused on completing the initial 20-megawatt project with Enerhash to then set our sights toward completion of the 100-megawatt project. I am appreciative of all the hard work my team has given, we have a detailed plan and the resources to make it happen, now it is time to make the push toward mining digital currency.\"\n\nAbout Enerhash:\n\nEnerhash is an energy technology and digital infrastructure development company founded by European energy experts in 2019. Enerhash has developed projects on three continents providing renewable energy optimization and grid balancing services including New Zealand, Sweden, Hungary and now they are entering into the USA.\n\nEnerhash USA will align with energy producers as a solution to help alleviate harmful methane emissions caused by production. These solutions will monetize wasted natural gas resources to reduce emissions by eliminating routine flaring to reach ESG goals and unlock the value from stranded resources. To discover more about Enerhash USA, visit their corporate website at www.enerhashusa.com.\n\nAbout AGYP:\n\nAllied Energy Corp. is an energy development and production company acquiring oil & gas reserves in some of the most prolific hydrocarbon bearing regions of the United States. The Company specializes in the business of reworking & re-completing 'existing' oil & gas wells located in the thousands of mature oil & gas producing fields across the United States. The Company applies its knowledge, experience, and effective well-remediation technologies to achieve higher production volumes, longer well life, and more efficient recovery of the proven and available oil and gas reserves in the fields/projects in which it has acquired an ownership interest. The Company will utilize updated technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"), drilling of lateral (\"horizontal\") legs in productive zones, and utilizing new cased hole electric logging to locate bypassed pays, all to enhance daily rates and oil & gas recoveries. By acquiring interests in a growing number of selected projects in various regions, Allied Energy Corp. is diversifying its exposure and effectively minimizing risk as it pursues corporate growth, top line & bottom-line revenues to the benefit of all stakeholders. There are proven, recoverable reserves contained in the many aging oil & gas fields that have been bypassed by companies moving away from these fields in search of deeper, more plentiful, but more costly reserves. The Company plans to concentrate on bypassed oil and gas as there is less competition and, as mentioned above, the costs are considerably less. Additionally, the company will acquire interests in marginal wells that can be acquired at minimal cost, of which there are 420,000 wells in the U.S. Quoting Barry Russell, President of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (\"IPAA\") - \"With approximately 20 percent of American oil production and 10 percent of American natural gas production coming from marginal wells, they are America's true strategic petroleum reserve.\"\n\nSafe Harbor Statement:\n\nThis Press Release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "title": "What is Bitcoin funding rate and why does it matter - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Whether you are new to cryptocurrencies or a seasoned trader, you may come across headlines such as - \"Bitcoin funding rate plunges to new lows\" or \"Bitcoin prices will surge due to low funding rate\u201d. But what exactly is the funding rate, and why is it important to understand in the grander scheme of things? To answer this, we first need to understand how a futures contract works.\n\nPrerequisites for Understanding Bitcoin funding rates\n\nA futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and date in the future. However, these contracts have an expiration date, after which the settlement process begins. Unlike a traditional spot market, trades are not \u2018settled\u2019 instantly in the futures market. Instead, parties will trade a contract, that defines the settlement at a future date.\n\nAlso Read: A quick guide on how to make your own meme coin\n\nTraditional futures contracts generally settle on a monthly or quarterly basis. On the settlement date, the trade is made final and the buyer must pay the seller while the seller delivers the assets to the buyer. Settlement refers to the convergence of the contract price with the spot price and the expiration of all open positions. Meanwhile, the spot price represents the price at which a particular commodity can be bought on an exchange at a given time.\n\nPerpetual futures contracts are built on the same principles as traditional futures contracts. The key distinction is that crypto exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex offer perpetual contracts, allowing traders to hold positions without an expiry date. This eliminates the need to worry about settling the contract on a specific date.\n\nSince perpetual futures contracts don\u2019t have expiry dates, some exchanges employ a method to ensure that future prices and index prices converge at regular intervals. This method is known as the funding rate. Based on open positions, traders either pay or receive funding.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin funding rate?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, perpetual contracts have no expiration date or settlement, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. This makes them unique derivative offerings for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTraders opt for perpetual contracts to speculate on whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall in the future. Those who hold \"long\" positions expect the price to surge in the future, while those with \"short\" positions anticipate that the price will decrease in the future.\n\nIn this context, when traders take either long or short positions, they can influence the price of the perpetual contract, causing it to deviate from the spot price. The funding rate mechanism ensures that the perpetual contract price does not diverge significantly from the spot price.\n\nFor instance, if many traders open long positions and buy a bulk of Bitcoin perpetual contracts, the prices of these contracts can surpass the spot price of Bitcoin. If this happens, the traders who went long would pay the funding rate to those who went short, to keep their positions open.\n\nThe further the perpetual contract price deviates from the spot price, the higher the funding payments they have to make to the shorting traders. This incentivization system is designed to align traders' positions in a way that expects the perpetual contract price and spot price to converge or be relatively close to each other over time.\n\nBitcoin funding rate is made up of regular payments between traders and the same prevents a lasting divergence in the price of both perpetual contract markets and spot prices. Different exchanges readjust the funding rate several times a day. For example, Binance Futures calculate the funding rate of cryptocurrencies every eight hours.\n\nImportance of Bitcoin funding rate\n\nA positive Bitcoin funding rate indicates that more traders are taking long positions and expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise in the future. Meanwhile, negative funding rates suggest that more traders are taking short positions and have a bearish outlook.\n\nIt is important to stay updated on this metric because a positive or negative funding rate often precedes Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. In simple terms, if Bitcoin\u2019s funding rate is negative, it means that most market participants expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to fall in the future. The same could force others to dispose of their Bitcoin holdings, leading to a fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Conversely, a positive funding rate could spur buying in the market, which could send Bitcoin\u2019s price upwards on the chart. Another thing to note here is that extremely negative and positive funding rates can sometimes act as a precursor to market reversals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs highlighted above, the Bitcoin funding rate can be a powerful metric to determine Bitcoin\u2019s future price. However, it must be used in conjunction with other metrics to accurately predict market direction. Therefore, investors must it at their own discretion."

        "title": "How to use a crypto hardware wallet - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrencies is widely known to be associated with risk, given the crypto market\u2019s volatility, regulatory dilemmas and high-profile incidents of hacks, scams and fraudulent activities. According to Chainalysis\u2019 midyear report on cryptocurrency-related crimes in 2022, approximately $1.9 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in various hacking incidents and fraudulent activities compared to under $1.2 billion at the same point in 2021.\n\nSafely storing and managing cryptocurrency assets has its own set of challenges, and traders must educate themselves on the best options. As a type of cold storage, a crypto hardware wallet is a physical device designed to securely store cryptocurrencies offline, providing additional layers of security for those who hold large amounts of crypto and want to keep their holdings safe for a long time.\n\nThis article will discuss what a hardware wallet is, how to use one and the benefits of hardware wallets vs. software wallets, and it will answer the lingering question: Should you keep your crypto coins in a hardware wallet? Additionally, there\u2019s information on the available hardware wallets to store your crypto assets safely.\n\nRelated: How to mitigate the security risks associated with crypto payments\n\nWhat is a crypto hardware wallet\n\nCrypto wallets can be broadly classified into two categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are software-based crypto wallets connected to the internet, while cold wallets are physical devices. Cold wallets are considered a more secure storage option than hot software wallets, as they are not connected to the internet and do not interact with potentially vulnerable software and web viruses. Among cold wallets, hardware crypto wallets are considered one of the safest options to store cryptocurrencies.\n\nA hardware wallet is a physical device typically resembling a USB drive or a small plugin device designed to securely store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Hardware wallets do not actually store cryptocurrency; instead, they store the private keys that allow access to the stored digital assets.\n\nOne may check the price, model and specifications as per requirement. Bitcoin (BTC); Ether (ETH); stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC); and other popular digital assets like Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) are supported by most hardware wallets.\n\nHardware wallet vs Software wallet\n\nWhile software wallets allow ease and convenience, hardware wallets are known for their secure storage. A good understanding of the differences among the two options, user requirements and the level of digital asset custody needed can help users make informed choices on their wallet preference.\n\nHow does a hardware wallet work\n\nBefore understanding how a hardware wallet works, it is essential to have some know-how into crypto wallet keys.\n\nPublic and private crypto wallet keys\n\nCryptocurrency data lives on the blockchain, and crypto wallets store this information. There is no hard money like fiat, and this data on the blockchain determines one\u2019s ownership of the assets.\n\nEvery crypto wallet has a pair of keys to access it \u2014 a private key and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and is free to access by anyone. The private key, however, is like an ATM pin code and must be secured by the user.\n\nPrivate keys give access to the cryptocurrency funds and need to be safeguarded by the owner and should not be shared with anyone. They are a unique combination of letters and numbers, functioning as digital signatures or a password that grants access to and control over the cryptocurrency holdings. Hardware crypto wallets typically store these private keys, which are required for signing transactions.\n\nHardware wallet self custody\n\nWhen users hold their cryptocurrencies on a centralized exchange (CEX), they essentially transfer custody and control of their private keys and digital assets to the exchange while themselves using login credentials provided by the CEX. This implies that users rely on the exchange to securely hold and manage their funds on their behalf, making them vulnerable to scams, hacks and other security threats in the event an exchange comes under attack.\n\nHardware wallets, on the other hand, empower users with full control and self-custody over their digital assets. Users hold their private keys and are not reliant on third-party custodians or exchanges. To engage in cryptocurrency transactions using hardware wallets, the transactions require the private key to be \u201csigned.\u201d This signing process takes place within the hardware wallet itself using a cryptocurrency bridge. A crypto bridge facilitates the connection between the hardware wallet and the blockchain.\n\nThe hardware wallet uploads the signed transaction to the bridge, which in turn broadcasts the signed transaction to the blockchain network. Importantly, at no point during the entire process does the user\u2019s private key leave the hardware wallet, thereby ensuring safety and security.\n\nRelated: What is a Bitcoin Wallet? A beginner's guide to storing BTC\n\nHow to use a hardware crypto wallet\n\nThe exact steps and procedures may vary slightly depending on the specific hardware wallet. Users can refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and follow security practices to learn how to use a particular hardware wallet.\n\nThe following are some common steps to understand how hardware wallets can be used:\n\nStep 1: Purchase and install software\n\nObtain a crypto hardware wallet from known and reliable manufacturers such as Ledger, Trezor and Ngrave \u2014 and/or their authorized resellers. Ensure that it is sealed and tamper-free. Visit the official website of the hardware wallet manufacturer, then download and install the wallet software on desktop/mobile devices. Make sure to read the recommendations for the device specifications \u2014 operating system, processor, etc.\n\nStep 2: Connect the hardware wallet\n\nConnect the hardware wallet to a desktop/mobile device using the provided USB cable or the appropriate wireless connection (bluetooth or NFC). Follow the on-screen instructions to initialize the hardware wallet. This involves selecting a PIN or passphrase, creating a backup recovery seed phrase and securely storing the seed in multiple offline locations. The recovery seed is crucial for restoring access to funds if the hardware wallet is ever lost or damaged.\n\nStep 3: Add funds and transact\n\nWithin the wallet software, locate the option to receive or deposit cryptocurrencies. Copy the public address displayed or scan the QR code in order to add the desired amount of cryptocurrency to this public address from an exchange or another wallet.\n\nTo send cryptocurrencies from the hardware wallet, select the option to send or transfer funds, and enter the recipient\u2019s address and the amount to send. Confirm the transaction details on the hardware wallet\u2019s screen.\n\nStep 4: Confirm, sign and verify transactions\n\nUpon confirming the transaction details on the hardware wallet, one will be prompted to provide additional authorization by entering a PIN or passphrase. The hardware wallet will then sign the transaction with the private key stored within it, and the funds will be transacted. Track the progress of the transactions using blockchain explorers or within the wallet software. Verify that the transaction has been confirmed and added to the blockchain.\n\nIt is important to remember to securely disconnect the hardware wallet from the desktop/mobile device after completing the transaction and ensure safekeeping.\n\nPopular hardware wallets\n\nHardware cryptocurrency wallets have become increasingly sought after by crypto enthusiasts, investors and crypto whales. These include wallets such as Ledger and Trezor, which offer a secure and user-friendly solution for storing and managing digital assets. Other common names in the market include: Ellipal, CoolWallet, SafePal and Ngrave, among others. Furthermore, certain hardware wallets like Ledger offer staking and other earning opportunities through their Ledger Live app.\n\nThe superiority of hardware wallets in securing cryptocurrencies became even more apparent in 2022 due to the crypto exchange debacles of FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and Vault, which resulted in the loss of access to billions of dollars. As a result, hardware wallet providers like Ledger and Trezor experienced unprecedented sales as crypto holders rushed for storage safety and reliability.\n\nAre hardware crypto wallets secure\n\nFor anyone who has been in the crypto space long enough, there is a common saying: \u201cNot your keys, not your crypto.\u201d In essence, this phrase serves as a call to action for cryptocurrency users to take control of their own security and ensure the protection of their digital assets. It encourages the use of hardware wallets and other cold storage solutions to keep private keys offline and away from potential cyber threats.\n\nCrypto hardware wallets are widely recognized as secure solutions for storing, managing and taking custody of one\u2019s digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Although no security measure can guarantee complete safety, hardware wallets provide additional layers of security and safeguards for storing cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is Ethereum a Good Investment? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest ethereum trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy ethereum and the risks of buying ETH.\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect prices to either stay the same or fall, with more chance they will fall.\n\nHowever, we think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently amid a cumulative drawdown of around 62% since the November 2021 all-time high of $4,891 and is trading at around $1,820. However, the last six months have been more positive, with ethereum up 49%.\n\nOne of the main drivers of ethereum price rises is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. However, we think the Fed is not done with its aggressive hiking cycle, and recession risks are increasing.\n\nConsequently, the macro backdrop for ethereum is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for ethereum, which are neutral. Overall, we are neutral to bearish on ETH in the short term. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy ethereum.\n\nShould I buy ethereum? Probably not\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Risen Recently?\n\nReasons for the Current ETH Price (Short-Term View)\n\nCrypto markets surged this year after the FDIC announced it would back all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. This move follows the Silvergate Capital collapse and has calmed fears of a potential bank run across the US. As a result, ethereum and the wider crypto market are rallying.\n\nAlso helping the ethereum price is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. After one of the most aggressive hiking campaigns in decades, the Fed seems to have finally got inflation under control. After peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, headline inflation has fallen steadily to 4.9%.\n\nHiking interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that increases the cost of borrowing, reduces demand, and is generally negative for risk assets such as stocks and crypto. It also increases the risk of recession. However, if the Fed starts easing rates, as markets currently expect for 2023, risk assets like ethereum may benefit.\n\nThe chart below shows the latest ETH price.\n\nPrevious reasons for bullishness towards ethereum included the merge, ETH\u2019s upgrade to proof-of-stake. In a previous ethereum update, we discussed the implications of the merge. The punchline was it would be bullish for these reasons:\n\nValidators can earn yield on staked ETH post merge.\n\nFaster transactions.\n\nNet issuance is projected to drop considerably post merge, constraining supply.\n\nEthereum may become deflationary.\n\nIncreased scalability and security.\n\nBetter for the environment thanks to proof of stake not work.\n\nHowever, ethereum and the broader crypto space have been unable to escape the longer-term bearish macro backdrop. We discuss that next.\n\nLike these insights? Join our free newsletter for regular updates and trade ideas. Want to receive our latest macro and financial market updates? Subscribe to our newsletters! SUBSCRIBE\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Dropped?\n\nMacro Reasons for the Current Ethereum Price (Long-Term View)\n\nWhy is ethereum dropping? The main reason for the fall going into 2023 was the Federal Reserve\u2019s response to inflation. It has hiked interest rates an aggressive 500 basis points in this cycle, and this contractionary monetary policy tends to impact risk assets such as crypto negatively.\n\nMarkets seem to think the Fed is done hiking and has conquered inflation. However, April CPI showed no incremental progress on disinflation. Here are some of our main takeaways:\n\nA large increase in used car prices offset slower inflation in other categories.\n\nThe ongoing recovery in rental indices suggests that progress on shelter cost inflation may be transitory.\n\nApril core goods inflation rose to 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used car prices, which is converging to Manheim used car auction results, indicating further upside.\n\nMarkets continue to under-price the Fed. The labour market remains very tight, inflation is well above target, and \u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019 Markets are currently assigning just a 5% chance of a 25bp June FOMC hike. In our view, markets are under-pricing the risk of a hike and if current inflation and growth dynamics continue, a 25bp hike in June is likely (barring a debt ceiling crisis), which would be bearish for crypto.\n\nHow Interest Rates Affect Crypto\n\nYears of low interest rates since the global financial crisis in 2008 had seen markets reach extreme valuations by the end of 2021. Who cares if tech companies are loss-making if the companies can borrow easily? And if companies cannot borrow money, they can attract capital from investors, who themselves have likely borrowed money.\n\nCrypto markets have not been immune to the support from cheap leverage in the fiat markets. After all, crypto offers the tech dream of scalability and regulatory arbitrage. And if there was any doubt that crypto was not benefiting from low interest rates, the recent declines in crypto as US rates have risen should remove it.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation of ethereum to NASDAQ started to increase sharply just as US interest rates started to rise. This is a common occurrence throughout history. When the liquidity tap turns off, usually by central banks raising rates, the correlation between diverse assets shoots up. This time appears no different.\n\nThe bottom line is that the macro backdrop for crypto remains bearish on rate hikes and inflation. The probability of recession remains high at 80%, and we expect the Fed to hike more than markets are pricing in.\n\nHow Low Can Ethereum Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, the ethereum and NASDAQ correlation was around 80% until recently. So where the NASDAQ goes, ethereum follows.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. Currently, the NASDAQ is in a 30% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between ethereum/bitcoin returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nHow High Can Ethereum Go?\n\nShould the currently restrictive environment of rising interest rates and recession risks subside, we could see ethereum return to its all-time high of $4,379 or even beyond. However, we caution that this scenario is unlikely in the short term and, like with any investment, it is impossible to say with certainty how high ethereum will go.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation also is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation by increasing censorship. The ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor. Lastly, on ethereum specifically, there is the much-anticipated merge. We previously covered its potential implications. The punchline was that it should be bullish for ethereum.\n\nCrypto News Impacting the ETH Price\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.\n\nhave mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is targeting crypto companies that engage in crimes themselves or allow crimes like money laundering to happen.\n\nSummary of ETH Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including ethereum, will remain under pressure. The main near-term support would be Fed dovishness rather than any crypto-specific dynamics. While this is possible, persistent inflation and a roaring economy make it unlikely. And for long-term investors, we still think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense. But be prepared for weakness in 2022-3.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nEthereum and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 12 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think ethereum is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that ethereum is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before you invest in ETH, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Ethereum\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin and ethereum fundamentals can help you understand how ethereum prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important ethereum metrics. And the video below explains other cryptocurrencies that might put ethereum at risk.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nBuying the Dip\n\nYour exposure to ethereum needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop 3 Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nTo buy ethereum (ETH) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy ethereum on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nETH Dollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u201cRisk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u201d\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next. We advise only a very small allocation to crypto and prefer diversification with more traditional asset classes.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy ethereum?\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are neutral to bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices. For 2022-3 in general, we think recession risks pose a risk to ETH and so now might not be the best time to buy ethereum if you have a medium-term outlook. We think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was ethereum at its lowest?\n\nEthereum was the lowest in October 2016, when its price was $0.41. Since then, Ethereum has experienced several major bull runs. The first was in 2017/8 when it peaked at $1,400. It subsequently dropped to around $300-400 until the start of 2021. From January that year, bullish sentiment took the coin to over $4,000. It was not until the closing moments of 2021 that ETH breached this threshold, continuing its rise to $4,780 in November 2021. Since then, ETH price has been volatile and generally gone downwards. It is currently around $1,500.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying ETH now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of ethereum can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that ethereum will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell ethereum?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell ethereum depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some website speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse then others for selling ethereum, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Is ethereum a good investment?\n\nWe think a small allocation to ETH makes sense in the long term. However, we caution against investing in ethereum too heavily as cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and often subject to large downturns.\n\nAppendix\n\nEthereum as a Good Inflation Hedge\n\nEthereum and bitcoin have historically been touted as a hedge for inflation. When inflation expectations rise, you would want the relationship between the cryptocurrency and inflation expectations to be at least positive. This, historically, has held. However, since February, the relationship has broken down. Inflation expectations remained anchored while ETH prices have fallen. A more hawkish Federal Reserve could weigh on ETH going forward.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge (or ETH 2.0)\n\nEthereum has been running on two different blockchains since April 2022. One operates using proof-of-work, like bitcoin. The other is a test chain what uses proof-of-stake. The merge is an upcoming event where these two blockchains will combine, ending proof-of-work. It is expected to happen in Q3/Q4 2022, and it will eliminate the energy-intensive mining required in proof-of-work. Guest author Nikhil Shamapant explains more about the ethereum merge and what it could mean for ETH price in 2023 in his recent article.\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin [BTC] is due for a mid-week bullish relief, as per these findings - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls were making another attempt at taking over from the bears.\n\nWhale accumulation resumed after weeks of outflows.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] enthusiasts will be glad to know that at press time, bulls were once again fighting for dominance after prices fell towards short-term support. Multiple observations already indicated that a mid-week bullish bounce back might be on the cards.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nLet\u2019s kick off by assessing the latest on-chain data. As per Glassnode, 9 May\u2019s daily on-chain exchange flows and the net outflows outweighed the inflows. In other words, more Bitcoin is flowing out of exchanges than the amount flowing into exchanges.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s exchange flow data demonstrated a similar outcome, confirming a build-up of buying pressure. The latest data revealed that Bitcoin exchange outflow volume outweighed exchange inflow volume by slightly over 4000 BTC.\n\nAre these exchange flows enough to trigger a price pivot? Well, the answer will largely be determined by whale activity. Strong demand from whales will certainly influence market direction.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s important to look into what whales are doing.\n\nBitcoin whales make a splash\n\nBitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC have been accumulating for the last four days. This confirmed that the recent exchange outflows were backed by favorable whale activity. On the other hand, the Bitcoin Purpose ETF Holdings continued to sell.\n\nThe reason for the ETF outflows remains unclear, but it might be related to the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. Many crypto companies are exploring alternative options such as shifting their operations abroad and this might be discouraging institutional investors.\n\nRetail demand is also leaning on the bullish side. Last week, we saw a decline in daily active addresses to the lowest level during Monday\u2019s trading session. However, the last 24 hours were characterized by a surge in the number of active addresses. This may indicate that the market was regaining some confidence at the time of writing.\n\nThe combination of renewed retail activity backed by healthy demand from whales may lend favor to the bulls. However, these factors have not triggered a pivot in BTC\u2019s price action, at least not yet. This is likely because there is still significant sell pressure in the market.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nA look at Bitcoin\u2019s price action reveals that bullish demand was manifesting near a short-term support near the $27,000 price range.\n\nWhile the above analysis reveals the ongoing battle for dominance between the bulls and the bears, it does not necessarily guarantee a win for the bulls. The eventual outcome will ultimately depend on the level of buy or sell pressure prevailing in the market."

        "content": "Decentraland (MANA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are among the crypto market\u2019s best-performing coins, but there is an upcoming crypto project generating a stir in the industry \u2014 Uwerx.\n\nUwerx looks to be a project that is set to revolutionize the freelancing industry. This article will analyze the price and growth potential of all three cryptocurrencies and why you will need Uwerx in your investment portfolio in 2023.\n\nDecentraland (MANA): A New Era Of Decentralized Gaming And Socialization\n\nDecentraland (MANA) has recently gained attention for integrating with the popular gaming platform, Atari. Through this partnership, Atari has launched a casino within Decentraland (MANA) where users can play classic Atari games and win Decentraland (MANA) tokens.\n\nThe current price of Decentraland (MANA) is $0.489905, and there has been $59,801,138M worth of Decentraland (MANA) in the past 24 hours. Decentraland (MANA)\u2019s price has increased by 6.80% in the last 24 hours as well.\n\nExperts predict that the price of Decentraland (MANA) may surge to a minimum of $1.07 in Q1 2024, and its growth potential is still very high. However, some market analysts are bullish on a newly built blockchain-based project called Uwerx, which may also significantly impact the market.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency project that broke away from Bitcoin in 2017. The project has impressive upgrades that make it faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. At the moment, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is trading at $113.56, and it is expected to potentially reach a high of $531.93 by the year 2026 as a result of the growing adoption of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) especially in countries with unstable economies.\n\nUwerx looks to be a better alternative to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as it is an upcoming blockchain project with real-world applications.\n\nUwerx (WERX): The Future of Freelancing\n\nUwerx is a soon-to-be-launched blockchain platform that will offer instant payouts and complete transparency, all thanks to its efficient use of the fast and lightweight Polygon Network. In addition, Solidproof and InterFi Network audited this cutting-edge platform to ensure top-notch security and speed.\n\nBut Uwerx won\u2019t just be resting on its laurels. Uwerx\u2019s presale has already gained significant attention, and the WERX is priced at an affordable $0.012 in the first presale stage.\n\nExperienced traders predict that the WERX token could reach a whopping $1.20 in Q1 2024. That\u2019s 20 times more valuable than Decentraland (MANA). In addition, the project will be a force in the market as its liquidity is set to be locked for up to 25 years. The team behind Uwerx has decided to renounce contract ownership once taxes are sorted, ensuring that invested funds are not accessible to anyone.\n\nKeep your eyes on Uwerx, as it promises lots of exciting gimmicks.

        "content": "Bitcoin stands as the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, as it has retained dominance since its inception. In the midst of this dominance, bitcoin is being used for the development of NFTs and not only as a means of transferring value.\n\nThe CEO of Trust Machines, and co-founder of Stacks, Muneeb Ali, said at the Consensus 2023 that he was excited about the new use cases for Bitcoin coming up, especially from Q4 2022 to date. \u201cBitcoin is fun again because there\u2019s a place to build again,\u201d Muneeb added.\n\nTrust Machines is a web3 project designed to build applications and technology to unleash the true potential of Bitcoin as a final settlement layer. According to the Trust Machine, the project will expand on the success of Stacks, and build applications that make Bitcoin productive, such as trustless Bitcoin lending.\n\nStacks is an open-source blockchain with security based on the Bitcoin network, enabling DApps and smart contracts to be deployed. Its native STX token is used to process transactions and execute smart contracts.\n\nTrust Machine said that there has been massive attention given to the development and adoption of Bitcoin in Q1 2023, with projects such as Bitcoin NFTs, Bitcoin name services (BNS), and developments on the Stacks blockchain leading the way. More than 1 million Bitcoin NFTs have been minted, and there has been a 400% surge in BNS registrations since 2022.\n\nDevelopers are coming back to Bitcoin\n\nAli explained that one of the major reasons behind the resurgence of Bitcoin and redirecting its use case is the congregation of developers that are coming back to build innovative products on the first and most successful blockchain. \u201cIt\u2019s the revival of the developer culture that I\u2019m by far the most excited about,\u201d Ali said.\n\nFor the Stacks protocol, which powers applications in the Trust Machines\u2019 ecosystem, its average daily active users and addresses rose by 76% and 42%, respectively, at the end of 2022. This signified that more users were interested in what was happening in the Bitcoin space. In addition, Stacks revealed it will launch Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC) to make Bitcoin a programmable protocol.\n\nTrust Machines also hinted that part of the surge in the attention given to Bitcoin is due to the launch of Nostr by Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter and CEO of Bluesky.\n\nRead also;\n\nBitcoin beat gold, NASDAQ in Q1 2023\n\n\u201cDeliver value!\u201d Warner Music exec\u2019s advice to Web3 creators"

        "content": "Crypto has tumbled through a bumpy ride in the past few months, and institutional investors are looking at it warily due to its volatile nature. However, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Elliot Han suggests that institutional investors\u2019 interest is still strong and is even maturing. In this article, we\u2019ll compare and analyze the similarities and differences between two major projects in the same industry, Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and discuss how they relate to investments, decentralized finance, governments, and digital assets. In addition, we will also be looking at PAT WARS (PAWS) , a new meme coin, and why it\u2019s attracting the attention of institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin and Binance: Decentralization, Market Cap, and Regulatory Landscape\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) are both digital assets that operate using blockchain technology. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. The Binance Chain, started by Binance, has evolved into a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that is now community-led, open to all, and operates without requiring permission.\n\nOne of the main differences between Bitcoin and Binance is their market capitalization. As of May 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of around $1.1 trillion, while BNB\u2019s market cap is over $48 billion.\n\nBTC and BNB are two of the major players in the crypto market, and as such, have had to face many challenges. Governments have had mixed reactions to the DeFi nature of these coins, with some viewing them as a potential threat to their centralized financial systems while others have embraced them as digital assets.\n\nBitcoin vs Binance: Two Titans of Crypto Investing for Seasoned Traders\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Binance are popular choices for seasoned investors looking to expand their portfolios. Institutional investors have been slow to embrace cryptocurrencies, but their interest in the space is growing. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are two large banks that began experimenting with blockchain technology a few years ago and are still interested in the market, according to Han. However, Han warns that there is still a high level of volatility, uncertainty, and regulatory action that needs to be taken into account before investing in certain coins.\n\nPAWSitive Investment: How PATWARS is Winning Institutional Interest in DeFi\n\nWith institutional investors\u2019 interest in Decentralized finance (DeFi) increasing, PAT WARS (PAWS) emerges as a promising new meme token in the DeFi space. PAWS\u2019s brand message resonates with decentralization, prioritizing user governance in addition to community-driven decision-making. Through PATWARS DAO, users can vote on initiatives which promote community engagement and ensure the token\u2019s long-term success and sustainability. The governance model\u2019s transparency and adherence to DeFi principles are crucial for PAT WARS\u2019s success.\n\nAs the crypto market matures, BTC and BNB remain two of the top players in the industry. While they have their differences, both offer unique opportunities for seasoned traders looking to invest in digital assets. As institutional investors show growing interest in the space, new tokens like PAT WARS are emerging in the DeFi sector, offering new and promising investment opportunities!\n\nClick the Links Below for More Information on PATWARS!\n\nWebsite: https://www.patwars.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PATWARSOfficial\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/PATWARSOfficial\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant dip as the United States government allegedly sold 9,800 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $277 million, per certain reports. The US government seized the Bitcoin in question during the Silkroad case, as reported by Whale Wire on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin Investors Brace For Impact\n\nThe US government\u2019s alleged sale of such a large amount of Bitcoin caused a ripple effect in the market, with prices dropping in minutes. This is not the first time there have been reports that the US government has sold BTC, but it could be one of the largest sales.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent rollercoaster ride has had investors holding on tight. After reaching the $28,000 level post-CPI report by the Federal Reserve (Fed), the news of the US government selling a whopping $277 million worth of Bitcoin caused a dip in the market.\n\nOther parties, including independent analysts and research firms CryptoQuant and Arkham, have contested the transaction. Large Bitcoin transactions associated with the U.S. government caused controversy in the past. Similar to today\u2019s price action, the news triggered fear and uncertainty among investors.\n\nIn that sense, the news should be taken with a grain of salt. According to a pseudonym analyst:\n\n38 minutes ago, a large 9,800 $BTC transaction, valued at $264 million, was rumored to be sent from a US Government-controlled wallet. As a result, BTC\u2019s price fell by 5.3%. However, after examining the origin of the funds and receiving confirmation from Arkham, there is no\u2026 pic.twitter.com/uT9uVHpGQ2 \u2014 An Ape\u2019s Prologue (@apes_prologue) May 10, 2023\n\nThis led to a 0.7% retracement and a drop to $26,800. But, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Bitcoin bounced back and climbed above the 50-day moving average support at $27,200.\n\nDespite this, according to Whale Wire, even if the US government sold, it still owns over 200,000 BTC; prices could drop under $10,000 instantly if they were to sell that amount. This has raised questions about the government\u2019s intentions regarding their BTC holdings and whether they will continue selling them in large quantities.\n\nThe US government also allegedly sold 9,800 Bitcoin on March 14th, seized from criminals involved in illegal activities on the Silk Road website. At the time of the auction, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $26,000 and valued at approximately $215 million.\n\nAccording to a court filing, The US Government plans to sell another 31,700 BTC in connection with Silk Road. This online marketplace facilitated illegal activities and was seized by law enforcement agencies in 2013. However, It remains to be seen if these events will delay the Bitcoin bull run and further drop BTC\u2019s price to new lower lows.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Market sentiment and bitcoin price - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoin fell back below $30,000, fueling traders\u2019 fears of a bearish continuation in the coming months.\n\nMarket sentiment is now caught between fears of a prolonged bear market and confidence in a resumption of the bull phase.\n\nLet us analyse the situation together.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and digital asset flows\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply over the weekend after Binance temporarily suspended BTC withdrawals to its users due to heavy network congestion, mainly caused by a disproportionate increase in transactions on the Ordinals protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw outflows of $53.7 million, marking the third consecutive week of negative sentiment for this type of asset.\n\nHowever, if we look at the data since the beginning of the year, we see that values are still positive by $19 million in an overall picture in which \u201cProshares ETFs/USA\u201d and \u201cETC Issuance GmbH\u201d lead the way with market flows of $181.6 million and $88.4 million respectively.\n\nThe worst performer appears to be 3iQ Corp/Canada, with weekly outflows of $19.4m and YTD outflows of $207.7m.\n\nIn total, assets under management in these investment funds stand at $34.23 billion, while trading volumes are 16% higher than at the start of the year.\n\nLooking in more detail, bitcoin was once again the asset most targeted by investors in this type of regulated product, with outflows of $31.8 million last week and a total of $46 million since the beginning of the year.\n\nIn this context, Bitcoin accounts for $22.74 billion or 66% of all money invested in the asset class.\n\nAlthough the outlook does not look the best at first glance, sentiment in the US has turned positive with inflows of $18 million and the largest outflow in history for \u201cshort-Bitcoin\u201d products of $23.1 million.\n\nIn other words, investors are unwinding their bets on future declines in the price of BTC.\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the week, saw smaller outflows of $2.3 million out of a total of $7.86 billion managed by savings funds.\n\nThe only altcoin to see positive flows was Solana with $3.4 million, but this was a negligible amount.\n\nHow to analyse crypto market sentiment\n\nThe price of Bitcoin moves according to several conflicting variables and logics, one of which is undoubtedly market sentiment.\n\nThere are several ways to analyse the sentiment of the crypto market, apart from monitoring the money flows of digital asset investment products managed by providers listed on traditional markets.\n\nFirstly, if you want to get in touch with the short-term sentiment of investors, you can take a look at the \u201cFear and Greed Index\u201c, which shows the confidence of investors in the crypto market on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nExtremely high levels are usually a good time to sell and take profits, while fear in the sector, with the index in the red, could be an opportunity to buy at a discount.\n\nThe situation seems neutral at the moment, in line with the analysis in the previous paragraph,\n\nIt is important to remember that this type of indicator has a 24-hour lag.\n\nAnother way to analyse market sentiment is to look at changes in open interest in the futures markets by relating this data to the price of bitcoin.\n\nOpen interest represents the number of derivative contracts that have not yet been closed, given by the sum of the long and short open positions at a given point in time: this data is extremely important because it helps us to understand the interest of financial traders in staying in the market rather than choosing other investment venues.\n\nThe main futures brokers are Binance, Bybit, OKX, CME, Deribit and Bitmex.\n\nCurrently, total open interest on all exchanges stands at $10 billion, about 30% higher than at the beginning of the year, but about 15% lower than in mid-April.\n\nIf total open interest were to exceed $15 billion, we would have another reason to be bullish on the immediate future of this market.\n\nThe last way, perhaps the most spartan, but also the most effective way to understand market sentiment for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is to observe the reaction of investors on Twitter in relation to market price movements.\n\nBy first doing the work of selecting the most crypto-friendly profiles and having a follower base of at least 20,000, it is possible to understand in real time what investors are thinking.\n\nTypically, markets move in the opposite direction to the expectations of the masses, so by spending time analysing tweets and comments, we can easily understand which scenarios are preferred by the Twitter audience and get them to choose exactly the opposite direction.\n\nTechnical analysis of the price of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $27,537 with a market cap of $533 billion and a volume of $13.4 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe situation on the technical analysis front is at a point of maximum indecision, which is somewhat reflected in the trader sentiment analysis, which is caught between bullish and bearish views.\n\nIn the daily time frame, prices have fallen below the 60-period moving average, marking the fifth consecutive daily candle in the red (not yet completed).\n\nIf there is a dip below the support level of 27,000 dollars, we could see a sharp decline, at least to 24,000 dollars in the short term.\n\nThis is the most likely hypothesis at the moment, given the bearish divergence that has formed on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nVolumes are still low and there are no signs of a rebound that would contradict the bearish continuation theory in the short term.\n\nFurthermore, after the rally in the crypto market in Q1 2023, it seems logical to see a situation where traders take profits on their still open positions.\n\nDaily Bitcoin price chart (BTC/USD)\n\nOn larger timeframes (weekly and monthly), the situation does not look so dire and the bull/bear conflicts may resolve themselves in a period of stability and laterality in BTC prices.\n\nWhile we wait for the next macroeconomic data on US inflation and see how the issue of the Bitcoin mempool being clogged by BRC-20 token transactions will be resolved, the best choice to make right now is probably to be patient and wait for the next BTC price movements.\n\nA small curiosity at the end of the article: the Ethereum Foundation has started to sell some ETH: every time this has happened in previous years, this event has marked a small peak in crypto market prices.\n\nBe careful traders!"

Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to the information retrieved from aggregated derivative exchange data platform Coinglass, there was only 1.89 million BTC on all exchanges as of May 11, 2023, demonstrating a 14.87% decline over the year, as the balance on exchanges on May 11, 2022, stood at 2.22 million BTC.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nAs the platform explained, the trend of moving a digital asset off exchanges and into personal crypto wallets in such large amounts represented \u201ca good sign of increased interest in self-custody for traders, and less potentially at risk\u201d of selling back to exchange wallets.\n\nOn top of that, it demonstrates the growing need for investors to have full control over their cryptocurrency assets and provide assurance that they are safe in case history repeats itself and the FTX scenario, which has caused fear among many, happens again.\n\nBesides these signals, the decreasing amount of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges could be a bullish sign, indicating there is a substantial buying trend, as continued accumulation by hodlers could cause the price of the maiden cryptocurrency to rise.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $27,450, down 0.40% in the last 24 hours, in addition to dropping 5.31% across the previous seven days and losing 7.45% to its value in the past month, as per data retrieved on May 11.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNotably, the negative trend has continued despite Bitcoin briefly breaking through the $28,000 level after the latest consumer price index (CPI) report showed that the inflation in the United States had slowed down more than expected in April, as Finbold reported on May 10.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

So, is the platform a scam or is it legit? Here, we analyze the key features as well as the pros and cons of using the automated trading tool so that you can decide whether or not it is a good platform to use.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Review Summary\n\nBitcoin Sprint is a unique offering that claims to automate the crypto trading experience for its users. The trading software leverages the concepts of AI and unique trading consensus to scout the current market for opportunities in BTC, among other top altcoins. Once the Bitcoin robot finds a possible entry into the platform, it sends trade signals or executes the transaction (based on the preferred settings).\n\nInterestingly, the platform isn\u2019t limited to sending signals or automating trading for its users. Once signed up, users can leverage different functions like a demo trading account to learn and strategize the possible trade entries. Bitcoin Sprint has also earned a name for itself due to its zero fees structure. The website claims to charge no additional fees or taxes from its users. However, to get started, you must first fund your account with $250.\n\nNow that we have a clear idea of the basics of the platform, here\u2019s an overview table that summarizes the essential features of Bitcoin Sprint:\n\nType Of Trading Cryptocurrencies Success Rate Unknown Available Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, ADA, and XRP, among others Accessible Over Mobile No (Accessible over browser) Withdrawal Or Deposit Fees Zero Customer Support Live Chat & Email Withdrawal Time Limit Up to 24 hours Minimum Deposit $250\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Sprint?\n\nBitcoin Sprint is a new trading platform that specializes in trading BTC. As per its website, Bitcoin Sprint is a general trading platform that simplifies the process of Bitcoin (among other altcoins) trading in a more engaging and informed manner.\n\nThis new-age trading platform claims to leverage one of the most advanced aspects of technology to develop this reliable trading ecosystem. The website further says it combines cumulative experiences and knowledge from a group of experts and puts them on its platform. This way, the platform supports trading with the help of real-time insights.\n\nAccording to our research on the bitcoin trading platform, Bitcoin Sprint is an automated trading platform built for the cryptocurrency market. The software caters to investors and traders at different stages of their learning curve, making it a potential trading tool for users at all levels.\n\nThe core USP of Bitcoin Sprint revolves around its unique trading algorithms. The platform claims to leverage the concepts of AI, and a unique consensus algorithm tracks different opportunities in the market. The automated Bitcoin trading software works on identifying BTC and other altcoins, such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Cardano (ADA), at a discounted rate and provides trade signals to its users.\n\nThis unique functionality of the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform saves traders the time they would\u2019ve spent manually scouting the market for opportunities, researching trades, or studying different market movements. Instead, according to its website, Bitcoin Sprint offers an automated experience where traders can sit back and relax whilst the platform finds a profitable entry for BTC and other altcoins.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The platform also goes a step ahead to claim that Bitcoin Sprint can also automate trades when allowed to execute them on behalf of traders. Other platform features comprise a demo trading feature, different analysis tools, and seamless security and regulation.\n\nBesides, while Bitcoin Sprint mentions its automated trading features, the website does not make any claims about its algorithm\u2019s profitability or past success rate. Another claim Bitcoin Sprint makes is that its trading platform is free to use. The website claims that traders won\u2019t need to pay any account fees or trade commissions and have 100% claim over their profits.\n\nTo summarize, Bitcoin Sprint is a unique trading opportunity that delivers profits. However, as with other auto trading platforms, Bitcoin Sprint is very transparent about the information released on its platform and how the algorithm works. As a result, upon our research of the automated Bitcoin trading platform, we could not determine the success rate of its trades or other related claims.\n\nTherefore, we recommend interested traders carefully read and analyze the terms and conditions laid by the platform before signing up or investing in it.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Pros and Cons\n\nLike every platform, even Bitcoin Sprint has its own pros and cons. Check out our table on the different pros and cons that define the software before deciding whether or not to sign up:\n\n\u2705 Pros The platform supports multi-asset crypto trading\n\nThe platform supports multi-asset crypto trading Offers demo trading feature for beginner users\n\nOffers demo trading feature for beginner users No additional fees in the form of charges or taxes\n\nNo additional fees in the form of charges or taxes Straightforward UI that adds to its appeal \u274c Cons Bitcoin Sprint shares no information on the owners\n\nBitcoin Sprint shares no information on the owners The platform charges a minimum of $250 to get started Bitcoin Sprint Key Features\n\nWhen discussing an online trading platform, it\u2019s crucial to analyze and inspect other elements of its operations. Keeping this in mind, we\u2019ve listed some core features defining operations over the Bitcoin Sprint software trading tool.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Trading Education\n\nWhen catering to audiences at every level of their trading journey, it\u2019s important to educate them while they take baby steps in their trading journey. Interestingly, Bitcoin Sprint understands such needs like no other. Once signed up, users can access numerous educational tools to learn more about the industry.\n\nThe platform provides users with educational equipment like webinars, newsletters, articles, and videos. These resources will help traders at different stages understand the industry\u2019s basics and advanced aspects while staying updated with the latest activities in Bitcoin trading.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f General Trading Platform\n\nAnother unique aspect of signing up for the Bitcoin Sprint is access to its general trading platform. The automated Bitcoin trading software tool is unlike other market options that limit its users in terms of possible operations over the platform.\n\nAs the name suggests, this option doesn\u2019t limit you in terms of possible trading options. Instead, investors and traders can diversify their portfolios by putting their money in investment opportunities other than cryptos.\n\nNo matter your experience in the crypto industry, you can\u2019t overlook the significance of having the right analysis tools at your disposal. Using different sets of analysis tools allows investors and traders to understand the future possibilities in the market better. Moreover, advanced trading tools can help advanced traders make the most of a volatile market.\n\nBut using these advanced tools isn\u2019t very affordable. Most of these tools generally come with high subscription fees. Interestingly, this is where the Bitcoin Sprint comes in as a platform that provides access to these analysis tools at no additional cost. Once signed up, users can easily leverage these tools to execute their trade strategy and earn better profits.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Customer Service\n\nCustomer service is another crucial aspect of a crypto trading app, especially if it involves beginner traders and investors. Given their idea of the industry, beginner traders often need help executing their trades. This is where prompt customer services helps such users execute their trades seamlessly without losing their money.\n\nInterestingly, things are the same for users over Bitcoin Script. The platform offers prompt customer service, where all you need to do is fill out a form, and representatives reach back to you, resolving the queries of its users in real time. This way, users are also saved from the potential losses that they might have if customer service wasn\u2019t there to help them.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Demo account\n\nAs the name suggests, a demo account is a trading setup that allows traders to execute their trades under simulated market conditions. Any trader taking their trading seriously will tell you that the demo platform is the best feature for beginner traders. Here, users can execute new strategies without risking their money.\n\nOnce signed up over Bitcoin Sprint, you can use the demo account feature over a few clicks. Here, users are allowed to put their demo money on real-time market movements and understand whether or not there\u2019s a possibility of success in their trade.\n\nThis way, beginner traders learn about the market conditions\u2019 volatility. Interestingly, the demo account feature isn\u2019t only limited to beginner users. The option is also open for seasoned investors who want to sharpen their trading techniques and increase their chances of making profitable deals.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Security & Regulation\n\nSecurity and regulations of a crypto exchange are among the primary concerns for crypto traders of all sizes. Unfortunately, thanks to the industry\u2019s success, cryptocurrencies have been a hot spot for new traders and con artists. Over the years, millions of cryptos have been swept off major exchanges, individual investors, and day traders using different creative methods.\n\nAll these factors have made security a leading factor that makes or breaks any cryptocurrency. Thankfully, Bitcoin Sprint is different! The platform claims to incorporate foolproof systems that ensure users\u2019 funds and data security. Moreover, the website also claims that it continually implements strong encryptions and leverages global data protection considerations and measures for the safety of its users.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Bitcoin Sprint Registration Process\n\nNext, we have the registration and sign-up process over the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. Different from other trading platforms that make it challenging for users to sign up over their platform, things are different over Bitcoin Sprint. First, the platform streamlines the sign-up experience for its users by limiting the number of steps required in the process.\n\nOnce you log into their website, starting over on this Bitcoin trading platform is as effortless as filling out a form and waiting for a short period while the system verifies your details. This concise log-in approach over the Bitcoin Sprint application allows investors and traders to enter profitable trades quickly.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f User Interface\n\nThe intuitive design of the Bitcoin Sprint platform is another major highlight of the Bitcoin robot. The platform is designed keeping in mind users of every type. It has an easily comprehensible UI that even beginner users can follow without additional help.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The user-friendly interface also makes it easy for traders and investors to add funds, enter, and execute profitable trades without causing confusion. The platform has all the necessary features listed on its dashboard. Besides, every additional feature is only a few steps away.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Asset Availability\n\nThe availability of assets is a crucial factor for almost every investor. After a point when they\u2019re done investing in a limited set of cryptocurrencies, investors want to explore their options with different types of assets as a means to balance their portfolio.\n\nInterestingly, if you\u2019re an investor looking to grow your portfolio beyond Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sprint still has you covered. The platform allows users to trade in coins like Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, and Litecoin. This way, by allowing investors to deal with a wider range of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Sprint provides them with equal opportunities to expand their portfolio and earn more profits.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Fees\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bitcoin Sprint trading platform claims to charge no additional trading fees from any of its users. Unlike other trading platforms that charge users in the form of commissions, withdrawal fees, or spreads, Bitcoin Sprint claims not to charge any form of additional fees on the profits of its users.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the possible charges charged by any Bitcoin robot trading platform:\n\nAccount Fees None Trading Fees None Commission No commission Withdrawal/Deposit Fees No fees\n\nHowever, it should be noted that while there are no fees over the platform, Bitcoin Sprint charges a minimum deposit fee of $250 from all its users.\n\nTalking of the minimum deposit, Bitcoin Sprint has a similar requirement to many other Bitcoin robots in the market. However, we suggest potential investors and traders carefully consider all the risks involved in trading using such a platform before making the initial deposit.\n\nIs Bitcoin Spirit Available On Mobile?\n\nThe Bitcoin Sprint platform is developed to foster a budding community of investors and traders. The platform understands the need for flexibility among new-age investors. Keeping the same in mind, Bitcoin Sprint is spread across platforms like:\n\nMobile phones via online browsing\n\nLaptops & desktops\n\niPads and other tablets\n\nThis way, Bitcoin Sprint allows users to tap sign up for a 360-degree trading experience. Once signed up, traders can earn profits on the move by trading on the mobile trading app.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Account Types\n\nThe Bitcoin Sprint trading platform is designed to keep investors and traders of every type in mind. Keeping the same approach in mind, the platform offers numerous types of accounts for the convenience of its users.\n\nOnce signed up, you\u2019ll find multiple account types, namely:\n\nDemo trading\n\nAs explored earlier, the demo trading account allows users to participate in simulated live trades using demo funds. This way, they get an idea of the market\u2019s volatility while giving advanced users a practical idea of whether or not their strategy would be successful.\n\nManual trading\n\nNext, we have manual trading, an option available when you log into the active platform over the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. As is evident from the name, the user decides whether or not they want to execute a trade in the manual trading feature.\n\nUsers signing up for the manual trading approach can utilise signals from Bitcoin Sprint to maximise their profits. However, this option puts them at equal chances of suffering a loss.\n\nAutomatic trading\n\nThe automatic trading feature is the last option on our list of Bitcoin Sprint account types. As evident from the name, the automated trading account can enter and execute trades without taking consent from the users.\n\nAdditionally, this option allows traders of all types of experience to be a part of the market and earn profits by allowing the Bitcoin robot to make trade-related judgments. However, it should be noted that choosing the automatic trading option takes away the user\u2019s right to exit a trade (unless they default the settings).\n\nTherefore, if we look at it, there\u2019s a lot of difference between trading decisions made manually and automatically. Choosing a manual method means utilising the user\u2019s judgement, skill, and trading experience. On the contrary, the automated mode enables users to decide based on their preferences and criteria.\n\nIn this mode, consumers are prompted to choose from several factors, and the mode subsequently bases trading choices on those parameters. This allows the Bitcoin robot to enter a trade once it fulfils the parameters set by users.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nIs Bitcoin Sprint A Trading Bot?\n\nLooking at the different aspects of the platform and after reading an overview of the tool from its website, it\u2019s evident that Bitcoin Sprint is a trading robot.\n\nIs Bitcoin Sprint Legit?\n\nThe crypto industry is an active spot for scammers, known to almost everybody in 2024. However, many beginners must realize that these hackers and con artists have evolved in their game. Today, instead of attacking crypto wallets and scamming people directly, they create fake websites and trading bots to loot people for their money.\n\nKeeping the same in mind, we tried analyzing different aspects of the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. According to its website, Bitcoin Sprint allows traders to identify unique opportunities in the crypto market by leveraging algorithm-driven trade signals. Investors and traders can automatically or manually use these signals to earn profits.\n\nHowever, upon further research, we found little information about the team or owner behind the trading bot. While this is common among several automated Bitcoin robots, it is a red flag. Additionally, the platform must have active social media handles across significant platforms like Instagram or Twitter, raising another concern.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? We also couldn\u2019t find any reviews rating the platform\u2019s services across the internet, which limited our ability to analyze its authenticity. On the contrary, however, we found several blogs and articles confirming that the platform offers features like customer support and demo accounts.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s no solid proof of whether Bitcoin Sprint is genuine or fake. Therefore, we advise investors and traders to exercise caution while signing up for the platform.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow To Use Bitcoin Sprint In 2024\n\nBitcoin Sprint happens to be one of the most appealing automated trading software in its genre. Thanks to its appeal, many investors and traders sign up for the platform. Interestingly, the platform allows all its users to choose whether they want to trade on the platform or opt for a more traditional way via a broker.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the different steps involved in the sign-up process for Bitcoin Sprint. Continue reading as we walk you through the additional steps involved in the process:\n\nStep 1: Create an account\n\nTo get started, you first need to visit the Bitcoin Sprint platform. Here, the website greets you with a dialogue box that asks you to sign up for the platform. Once on the page, enter your first name, last name, email address, and phone number. After successfully adding the data, click \u2018Learn More\u2019 to proceed with the registration process.\n\nStep 2: Complete phone call verification\n\nYou must complete the \u201cKnow Your Client\u201d regulations and rules upon completing the registration process. Here, the company will call and ask applicants questions (related to the user\u2019s ID). Upon completing the process, you will be verified and free to start.\n\nStep 3: Deposit funds\n\nIn the third step, you must start depositing funds into your account. As mentioned, Bitcoin Sprint requires users to deposit a minimum balance of $250 to use the platform. Users can deposit these funds using debit or credit cards and e-wallets such as Skrill and PayPal.\n\nStep 4: Use Educational Materials To Learn About Trading\n\nNow that you\u2019re done with all the basics and ready to trade, we suggest using the educational materials on the platform to learn about the market\u2019s volatility and different trading strategies.\n\nInterestingly, since Bitcoin Sprint allows a demo trading feature, users can practise strategies or understand trading in real-market conditions.\n\nStep 5: Start placing live trades\n\nAfter you\u2019ve successfully understood the market conditions. Use the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform to start placing live trades and earning profits.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Sprint Improve Your Trading?\n\nAccording to its website, Bitcoin Sprint is an automated trading software that leverages the concepts of AI and a trading consensus to allow users to get into profitable trades. The platform scouts for potential trading opportunities among BTC and other top-performing altcoins. Once done, it sends trade signals to its users.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not all. The Bitcoin trading platform claims that it can do more than issue trade signals. As per its website, Bitcoin Sprint can automatically execute trades on behalf of its users once the trading criteria are met. The Bitcoin robot enters and executes a trade using the funds and returns the same with the surplus at the end of every trade.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of trading using automated software, it\u2019s wise to follow a few tips to trade successfully. So the next time you set up a trade, ensure that you\u2019re following these tips to ensure safety:\n\nNever give withdrawal access to your software\n\nIt\u2019s usually a thumb rule to deny any form of access to your automated software when funds are involved. Similarly, it\u2019s wise not to provide your Bitcoin robot authorisation to withdraw funds from your account.\n\nSimilarly, it also helps to check any additional fees or taxes the platform charges. Finally, remember it\u2019s wise to restrict your trading software from accessing your funds or bank accounts.\n\nAnalyse the credibility of the platform\n\nIt is crucial to conduct thorough research on any program you want to use, and you should wait to buy the first trading bot you come across. Likewise, anybody could develop these tools, and for them to work, they would require access to your exchange account. As a result, reputation is crucial when choosing a reliable crypto trading bot.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s wise to assess the product\u2019s reputation in the market and within the crypto trading community to ascertain how well-liked it is to decide whether it is reliable, efficient, and trustworthy.\n\nExpect losses in your trading journey\n\nAutomating trading is different from guaranteed gains. Therefore, before signing up for any such Bitcoin robot, users must understand that no software or platform guarantees complete profits.\n\nEven automated software tends to lose money. Here, the best approach is to opt for larger gains more frequently. Besides, don\u2019t be of the losses while you\u2019re at it. However, when trading using an automated program, be mindful of the trades and the profit.\n\nDon\u2019t go all-in\n\nBefore you stake the entire funds in your bank account on automated trading software, ensure that you are confident in the software. Being an automated Bitcoin robot, these platforms don\u2019t seek permissions while executing and settling trades that can be profitable or bear losses.\n\nBesides, even if you are an experienced trader, trading a percentage of your available money or the minimum funds required to get started may be a good idea. Once you\u2019re confident about the potential of your chosen software in making profits, you might consider increasing the size of funds.\n\nBeware of the market\u2019s volatility\n\nThe crypto market is known for its volatility, giving it the potential to increase or decrease the value of your investments by up to 50x at a time. When these fast changes appear, modifying your bot to suit the changes is challenging. This ultimately adds to the risk of losing your funds in the process.\n\nSo don\u2019t completely trust your automated software when entering and settling trades in the long term. When dealing with Bitcoin robots, it\u2019s only wise to keep an eye on the market at regular intervals.\n\nBitcoin Sprint Full Review 2024 \u2013 Conclusion\n\nThis brings us to the end of our blog on the Bitcoin Sprint online trading platform. Based on our research of the platform, we found minimal data to support the claims made on its website. Additionally, there\u2019s a lack of testimonials and an inadequate social media presence of the software.\n\nTherefore, we advise readers to invest only once they have a sound idea of the platform and its type of investment.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated; beware of brokers who aren\u2019t regulated or don\u2019t qualify for investor protection.\n\nFAQs"
