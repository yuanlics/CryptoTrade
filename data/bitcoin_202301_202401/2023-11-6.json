        "content": "It has been a very good year for bitcoin investors. Against a backdrop of multiple bank collapses, a shaky economic macro and recent geopolitical issues, the leading crypto has more than doubled in value in 2023, with investors increasingly viewing bitcoin as a safe haven asset to lean on in troubled times. Of course, the growing mainstream acceptance represents a big change in attitude toward what was not long ago considered an extremely volatile and risky asset.\n\nBut the good news is that this year\u2019s surge might just be the opening shot in a new bitcoin bull cycle. That is indeed the opinion of Bernstein analyst and digital asset expert Gautam Chhugani, who points out to investors the upcoming catalysts that could propel bitcoin to higher levels.\n\n\u201cYou may not like Bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of Bitcoin as a commodity, suggests a turn of the cycle,\u201d Chhugani noted. \u201cA good idea is only as good as its timing \u2013 SEC approved ETFs by world\u2019s top asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity et al), seems imminent. Bitcoin \u2018halving\u2019 (BTC rewards half every 4 years) is due April \u201924.\u201d\n\nSo how high can bitcoin actually go? For the upcoming cycle, by mid-2025, Chhugani anticipates it will climb to a new high of $150,000, almost a 4.5x from current levels.\n\nInvestors looking to get in on the game can buy bitcoin directly but there are other ways to participate. \u201cA winning Bitcoin miner,\u201d implores Chhugani, \u201cis a high-beta way to gain exposure.\u201d\n\nThe bitcoin miners Chhugani refers to constitute the firms with the infrastructure to validate the bitcoin transactions and receive bitcoin as a reward for doing so and Chhugani believes a pair of mining companies are extremely well-positioned to make bank.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the Bernstein analyst who sees good times ahead for these names. According to the TipRanks database, both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus, too. Let\u2019s take a closer look and see what makes them so.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nBitcoin might have more than doubled in value this year but that return actually pales against the gains notched by miner Riot Platforms. The stock is up by 238% year-to-date. Investors have evidently taken to a well-capitalized miner boasting a healthy cash balance of $289 million, minimal debt and a balance sheet that compares favorably to that of other mining companies.\n\nRiot oversees two large-scale Bitcoin mining facilities in Texas and electrical switchgear engineering and fabrication operations in Denver, Colorado. And while it has taken a conservative stance regarding its balance sheet, it has still been focused on growth.\n\nIn June, the company disclosed that it is acquiring 33,280 MicroBT immersion-cooled miners at an approximate cost of $22 per Terra Hash. This addition will increase the mining fleet\u2019s capacity by 7.6 E/Hs, ultimately reaching a total of 20.1 EH/s upon full deployment in 2024. This positioned Riot as one of the leading miners in the industry in terms of hash power. Furthermore, the company holds the option to procure an additional 66,560 miners at the same price, potentially elevating the total hash rate to 35.4 EH/s by 2025.\n\nThe company also makes use of selling electricity back to the grid, for which it sees the benefit of power credits. This has been particularly useful during the summer months, and in August alone, on the back of surging electricity prices in Texas, the company generated $24.2 million from power credits and an additional $7.4 million in demand response credits.\n\nFor Chhugani, it\u2019s the anticipated growth along with the company remaining solely focused on its bitcoin mining endeavors \u2013 rather than chasing the shiny new thing as other miners have done \u2013 that makes Riot a top pick.\n\n\u201cWe like RIOT over any other miner,\u201d he says. \u201cWe reckon winning the brutal game of mining is about positioning yourself to win big and being on the right side of the cycle. It is about backing yourself, investing in capacity counter cyclically and then winning big when the BTC price cycle heats up. We think Riot does all of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we like about Riot is that it\u2019s also not distracted from chasing a new trend,\u201d Chhugani goes on to add. \u201cSo it has stayed away from any pivots into AI computing or high performance computing. It is investing back in building more Bitcoin capacity, being counter cyclical and using the down market to negotiate the best equipment contracts with the mining manufacturers. Thus, it has locked prices for mining machines to expand capacity from 10.7 EH/S today to 35 EH/s by end of 2025. We think this counter cyclical focus on Bitcoin is going to win big.\u201d\n\nThese comments underpin Chhugani\u2019s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating while his $15.6 price target suggests shares will climb 33% higher in the year ahead. (To watch Chhugani\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThat stance gets the backing of almost all of Chhugani\u2019s colleagues. Barring one bear, all 7 other recent reviews are positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $16.40, suggesting shares will post growth of 40% in the year ahead.\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK)\n\nThe next Bernstein-endorsed miner we\u2019ll look at is Cleanspark, a former microgrid solutions specialist that shifted its focus to bitcoin mining some time ago. The company began exploring mining operations in late 2020 and has since made mining its primary focus.\n\nThat is not the only change that has taken place at CleanSpark. Where once the company\u2019s strategy involved selling much of the bitcoin it mined in order to fund expansion \u2013 a game plan that worked, as unlike other firms, it did not have to eventually sell its BTC at a reduced price \u2013 the company now prefers HODLing, positioning it well for the upcoming halving event. This event that takes place every 4 years or so, and in the past has been a catalyst for a bitcoin bull market. For instance, in September, CleanSpark mined 643 BTC, selling only 80 of those coins (12%), leaving it with a total of 2,240 bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe company is also boosting capacity at a fast pace and in a recent update said it has exceeded a total hashrate of 10 EH/s. During the last five months alone, the hashrate has risen by nearly 50%, bringing it more than halfway to the intended capacity of 16 EH/s by the end of the year. With the addition of recently purchased 4.4 EH/s of Antminer S21 bitcoin miners that are expected to be delivered early next year, once fully utilized, the company anticipates reaching a total hashrate of over 20 EH/s.\n\nFor Chhugani, all of this makes CleanSpark another excellent choice for investors.\n\n\u201cWe like CleanSpark, because it reminds us of Riot, except it\u2019s focused in Georgia state, and has an even lower power cost vs. Riot without the dynamic power credits enjoyed by Riot,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt also stays focused on self-mining (Bitcoin over AI), has built strong visibility to double capacity by end of 2023. Again, no use of leverage, healthy liquidity and gains from any shakeout in hashpower.\u201d\n\nQuantifying his stance, Chhugani rates the shares as Outperform (Buy), backed by a $5.3 price target. Should the figure be met, a year from now, the shares will be changing hands for a 14% premium.\n\nCompared to his colleagues, however, Chhugani\u2019s forecast is rather conservative. The average target currently stands at $9.16, making room for 12-month returns of an excellent 97%. All analysts are on board here as CLSK\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 5 Buys.\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

The Miner Mag\n\n\"While some of these companies consistently sell all of their mined bitcoin every month, others adopt a hybrid treasury strategy such as Marathon, Hut 8, Cipher, CleanSpark, Bit Digital \u2013 and it was them who liquidated more in October than in previous months,\" the post stated.\n\nUsually, miners sell minted coins to replenish their cash flows or take advantage of rallying crypto prices. Riding on a wave of optimism around an expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, prices surged to months-long highs. The currency is currently trading at $35,746, up 115% year-to-date.\n\nAnother possible reason why producers were cashing in on tokens is to get ahead of the next bitcoin halving in 2024. That's when the reward for mining is cut in half, and miners may have been trying to dampen the upcoming blow by selling.\n\nThe sale of tokens helps with bitcoin supply in what's currently a tight market. Last month, a Forex.com analyst warned that bitcoin may see a supply shock, with tradeable tokens on crypto exchanges at their lowest since 2018."

        "content": "Bitcoin wallet and API platform Blink, formerly known as Bitcoin Beach Wallet, has announced a new partnership with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n, the second-largest distributor of consumer goods in El Salvador, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThis collaboration between Blink and Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n has paved the way for a pilot program that allows the distributor to accept bitcoin from a select segment of its extensive customer base, which includes over 40,000 merchants. Furthermore, Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is actively encouraging and supporting these merchants in integrating Bitcoin as a payment option in their retail locations. This move by Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is a strategic endeavor to promote and foster business-to-business (B2B) Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador.\n\n\"Our distribution operation, until today, has been predominantly managed in cash and this presents a series of logistical, time, and operational difficulties that slow our day-to-day ability to visit more points of sale. Bitcoin solves that,\" said Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n CEO Rodrigo Jacir Garcia-Prieto. \"The vast majority of our customers do not have access to banking services and this is the perfect way to introduce them to their first financial tool. We want to take full advantage of what bitcoin can do for us and our customers by enabling cash management efficiency, reducing operational expenditures, and increasing our ability to expand our reach within Central America while using a secure payment method such as Blink.\"\n\nThe pilot program has already been rolled out to 30 of the target 80 Phase I merchants, with plans to onboard up to 3% of Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n's customers, equivalent to 1,000 merchants, in 2024.\n\n\"Our collaboration with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n isn't just about a feature or a program. It's about catalyzing a nation's shift to embrace Bitcoin from the ground up,\" said Noor El Bawab, CEO of Blink.\n\nThis partnership, along with Blink's new 'Buy & Sell Bitcoin' feature, marks a substantial step forward in normalizing Bitcoin transactions in everyday life in El Salvador. These initiatives exemplify a concerted effort to harness Bitcoin's potential for efficient business operations and inclusive economic growth among communities and small businesses.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "It\u2019s felt like old times in the crypto markets as traders celebrated the first proper \u201cUptober\u201d (October in crypto speak) in a while, with Bitcoin gaining around 28% by month\u2019s end. Meanwhile, the start of November has seen altcoins get a piece of the action with XRP rising around 20% over the past week as Dogecoin and Cardano have likewise posted double digit gains.\n\nAll of this reflects the return of what market watchers like to call \u201crisk on\u201d behavior\u2014or what skeptics might prefer to call \u201cLet\u2019s hit the casino, boys!\u201d The basic idea is that, as the vibe around crypto improves, more traders are willing to seek out investments that offer high risk but the potential for high rewards.\n\nAs analyst Noelle Acheson has noted, the recent rally has been fueled by the return of leverage as more traders borrow money to supersize their bet on a variety of exotic tokens. Meanwhile, the crypto derivatives market is humming again as people are buying stablecoins from DeFi platforms to try their luck on perpetual futures contracts and similar bets that those of us without a Ph.D. in math would be crazy to go near.\n\nThe question is what this all means. As is the case with most crypto market price swings, there appears to be no single cause to explain the current rally. Instead, there is a series of potential factors driving the current mini-boom\u2014including a growing consensus that Crypto Winter is over at last and that better times are on the way. Don\u2019t underestimate how much sentiment, bad or good, drives the market\u2014and especially the crypto markets.\n\nIf the current altcoin rally lasts, though, the thing I am most curious to see is if traders put a new premium on fundamentals\u2014however you want to define that term when it comes to crypto. In past bull markets, few investors bothered to look for anything resembling empirical evidence to justify throwing their money at the fly-by-night coin du jour. Instead, they relied on half-baked advice from their taxi driver or personal trainer, or accepted the claims of bag holders and bot armies on X. Number go up and all that.\n\nThis time around, it would be nice to see crypto traders return to the market older and wiser after the many debacles of the last cycle. And just maybe the price of altcoins will rise because they have found a novel application or because a critical mass of people are using them for something beyond blind speculation. That\u2019s the optimistic case. But if this new cycle proves to be driven again by mindless gambling, we can look forward to the same bad hangover that\u2019s become a defining feature of the crypto industry.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nKraken plans to follow Coinbase's lead and launch its own layer-2 blockchain, possibly built on the tech stack of Polygon or Matter Labs.

        "title": "Biggest Reasons to Bet on Bitcoin\u2019s Rise - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is a topic of debate and speculation in the financial world. Bitcoin has continually demonstrated endurance and growth since its creation, despite its well-known price volatility and occasional setbacks.\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin's allure stems from its scarcity and cyclical halving events. It is a deflationary digital asset with a predefined supply cap of 21 million Bitcoins. This scarcity distinguishes it from ordinary fiat currencies, which central banks can produce at will. The occurrence of Bitcoin halving events every four years slows the production of new Bitcoins. Historical data shows that these halvings are frequently followed by significant price increases as the reduced supply collides with continuing demand.\n\nBTC: Inflation and Diversification\n\nAnother important part of Bitcoin's attractiveness is its capacity as an inflation hedge. Many people regard Bitcoin, often known as \"digital gold,\" as a store of value analogous to precious metals. During times of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, investors seek safe havens to protect their assets. With its decentralized architecture and restricted supply, Bitcoin appears as an appealing option for both individual and institutional investors seeking to protect their assets from the corrosive consequences of inflation.\n\nPortfolio diversification is a popular technique, and Bitcoin has established itself as an asset class with negligible correlation to traditional financial markets. Because of this lack of correlation, Bitcoin's price moves are frequently independent of stock markets, bonds, and other traditional investments. As a result, Bitcoin can be a valuable component of a well-diversified portfolio, thereby lowering total risk.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nOn BTC\u2019s liquidity and \u201cdigital gold\u201d claims\n\nBitcoin's liquidity and accessibility have improved dramatically over the years. Investors now have easier access to buying, selling, and trading Bitcoin thanks to the emergence of cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms. Furthermore, the growing acceptance of Bitcoin by conventional financial institutions, including several investment funds, adds to its credibility and accessibility to a wider audience.\n\nThe increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" has aided its adoption by institutional investors and enterprises. Some major corporations have even designated a portion of their corporate coffers to Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against currency depreciation. This institutional acceptance not only verifies Bitcoin's status, but it also injects significant wealth into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBTC\u2019s underlying blockchain tech and other factors to consider\n\nAnother component that contributes to Bitcoin's value proposition is its underlying technology, blockchain. Blockchain technology provides transparency, security, and immutability, making it appealing for purposes other than bitcoin. This adaptability has fueled the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts, reinforcing Bitcoin's position as a basic component in the larger blockchain ecosystem.\n\nGeopolitical concerns also contribute to Bitcoin's popularity. Bitcoin provides an alternate means of protecting wealth and performing cross-border transactions in nations afflicted by economic insecurity, capital controls, or hyperinflation. Citizens in such places frequently turn to cryptocurrencies as a lifeline for asset protection and international trade.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem's constant development and innovation are critical factors enabling its continued growth. Developers are always working to improve the network's scalability, security, and functionality. This dedication to growth guarantees that Bitcoin remains relevant and responsive to changing market demands.\n\nFurthermore, as a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin transcends territorial boundaries. It operates independently of any single government or central authority, making it resistant to censorship and resistant to meddling. This characteristic appeals to persons who desire financial independence and autonomy.\n\nBitcoin's Role in Achieving Financial Inclusion\n\nDigital technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the financial industry, enabling fintech and big tech companies to compete with traditional banks and broaden the scope of financial services. Amid this transformative landscape, digital currencies, and, in particular, Bitcoin has emerged as a force for achieving greater financial inclusion.\n\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain network, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This decentralized nature makes BTC available to individuals in regions lacking traditional financial infrastructure. With a smartphone and internet access, people worldwide can participate in the Bitcoin economy, potentially bridging the financial inclusion gap.\n\nIn fact, traditional financial services often involve high fees and transaction costs, limiting their appeal to low-income individuals. Bitcoin's peer-to-peer nature, on the other hand, reduces these costs significantly, making it an affordable alternative for remittances, payments, and cross-border transactions, especially in regions where fees can be prohibitively high.\n\nBitcoin also allows users to have full control over their finances, promoting self-reliance and independence. This can be particularly empowering for those who may not have access to traditional banking services. BTC holders have the ability to send and receive funds without the need for intermediaries, offering financial freedom to the unbanked and underbanked.\n\nMoreover, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital payments played a crucial role in helping people cope with social distancing and lockdowns. Bitcoin's decentralized nature ensured that it remained accessible when centralized systems faced disruptions. This resilience underlines Bitcoin's potential to provide financial services in even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nBTC also facilitates cross-border financial interactions with ease. This can be particularly transformative for people in remote or underprivileged regions, as it enables access to a global economy, offering new opportunities for trade and commerce.\n\nLastly, Bitcoin offers a degree of financial privacy while maintaining a transparent public ledger. This can be appealing for individuals who value anonymity and security in their financial transactions. Enhanced security and privacy can encourage participation among those who are wary of traditional banking systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is critical to recognize that, while Bitcoin has enormous growth potential and has received a lot of attention, it is still a speculative asset with inherent risks. Price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and vulnerability to market sentiment are all aspects to consider.\n\nBitcoin's enduring appeal and growth potential are supported by a number of factors, including its limited supply, role as an inflation hedge, diversification benefits, liquidity, institutional adoption, technological advancements, and use in geopolitically challenging environments. As Bitcoin matures and evolves, it will almost certainly remain a topic of conversation in the financial sector, both for its distinctive characteristics and its potential to influence the future of finance. Nonetheless, investors must be aware of the risks connected with Bitcoin's volatile nature and regulatory uncertainties."

        "title": "Data highlights Bitcoin's potential path to $40K amid global economic turbulence - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a narrow 4.5% range over the past two weeks, indicating a level of consolidation around the $34,700 mark.\n\nDespite the stagnant prices, the 24.2% gains since Oct. 7 instill confidence, driven by the impending effects of the 2024 halving and the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nInvestors worry about the bearish global economic outlook\n\nBears expect further macroeconomic data supporting a global economic contraction as the U.S. Federal Reserve holds its interest rate above 5.25% in order to curb inflation. For instance, on Nov. 6, Chinese exports shrank 6.4% from a year earlier in October. Furthermore, Germany reported October industrial production down 1.4% versus the prior month on Nov. 7.\n\nThe weaker global economic activity has led to WTI oil prices dipping below $78 for the first time since late July, despite the potential for supply cuts from major oil producers. U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari\u2019s remarks on Nov. 6 set a bearish tone, prompting a \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d response.\n\nKashkari stated:\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t completely solved the inflation problem. We still have more work ahead of us to get it done.\u201d\n\nInvestors have sought refuge in U.S. Treasurys, resulting in the 10-year note yield dropping to 4.55%, its lowest level in six weeks. Curiously, the S&P 500 stock market index has reached 4,383 points, its highest level in nearly seven weeks, defying expectations during a global economic slowdown.\n\nThis phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the firms within the S&P 500 collectively hold $2.6 trillion in cash and equivalents, offering some protection as interest rates remain high. Despite increasing exposure to major tech companies, the stock market provides both scarcity and dividend yield, aligning with investor preferences during times of uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s futures open interest has reached its highest level since April 2022, standing at $16.3 billion. This milestone gains even more significance as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange solidifies its position as the second-largest market for BTC derivatives.\n\nHealthy demand for Bitcoin options and futures\n\nThe recent use of Bitcoin futures and options has made media headlines. The demand for leverage is likely fueled by what investors believe are the two most bullish catalysts for 2024: the potential for a spot BTC ETF and the Bitcoin halving.\n\nOne way to gauge market health is by examining the Bitcoin futures premium, which measures the difference between two-month futures contracts and the current spot price. In a robust market, the annualized premium, also known as the basis rate, should typically fall within the 5%\u201310% range.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium (basis). Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how this indicator has reached its highest level in over a year, at 11%. This indicates a strong demand for Bitcoin futures primarily driven by leveraged long positions. If the opposite were true, with investors heavily betting on Bitcoin\u2019s price decline, the premium would have remained at 5% or lower.\n\nAnother piece of evidence can be derived from the Bitcoin options markets, comparing the demand between call (buy) and put (sell) options. While this analysis doesn\u2019t encompass more intricate strategies, it offers a broad context for understanding investor sentiment.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals see resurgence from Binance listing\n\nDeribit BTC options put-to-call 24h volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nOver the past week, this indicator has averaged 0.60, reflecting a 40% bias favoring call (buy) options. Interestingly, Bitcoin options open interest has seen a 51% increase over the past 30 days, reaching $15.6 billion, and this growth has also been driven by bullish instruments, as indicated by the put-to-call volume data.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s price reaches its highest level in 18 months, some degree of skepticism and hedging might be expected. However, the current conditions in the derivatives market reveal healthy growth with no signs of excessive optimism, aligning with the bullish outlook targeting prices of $40,000 and higher by year-end.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

It's digital,\" she began, passionately advocating for Bitcoin. Wood acknowledged the time-tested appeal of gold but highlighted a crucial difference. \"Gold already has its demand; it's happened,\" she explained. In contrast, she emphasized that Bitcoin remains a fresh and evolving asset, with institutions only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential.\n\nWood's perspective aligns with the prevailing sentiment among younger investors who increasingly favor Bitcoin over gold. She pointed out that Bitcoin's allure lies in its technological novelty and the rising enthusiasm from millennials and Gen Z, who see it as a more attractive store of value compared to the yellow metal.\n\nIntriguingly, Wood made a notable observation regarding the role of both gold and Bitcoin as hedges against deflation. However, she noted that Bitcoin's recent performance suggests that it has been outshining its traditional counterpart.\n\nIn summary, Wood's sentiment reflects the evolving landscape of investments, with Bitcoin emerging as a powerful contender.\n\nTime will tell if more investors will follow suit as Bitcoin continues its recovery from 2022's brutal bear market.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

And popular inference is that the open interest is rising. It means traders are taking bullish bets, but that's not necessarily the case because you open interest doesn't tell you anything about the positioning of traders. Yeah, that they could be taking shots, they could be taking loans or, you know, they, they, they might be taking delta neutral trades like they might be selling futures against long position in the spot market right here. What's happening, you know, is the, as we can see on the chart, the open interest every time the open interest rises by double digits within just a few weeks, we tend to get a turnaround in the Bitcoin spot price. It happened in uh I think in late 2022 it marked the bottom, the July talk that we saw early this year was also accompanied by a sharp uptick in the CME open interest.

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin if You Don't Think It Has an Economic Moat? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -3.66%) is, by far, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, currently accounting for more than 55% of the total market capitalization of the entire crypto market. For individual and institutional investors, Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency added to a portfolio, and for good reason. Between 2011 and 2021, Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in the world -- it wasn't even close.\n\nJudging by that type of market-beating performance, you might assume Bitcoin shares a characteristic of all top-performing companies: an economic moat. In the investment world, an economic moat describes a sustainable competitive advantage that allows a company to outperform its rivals for long periods. The problem is that Bitcoin's economic moat appears to be eroding, not widening.\n\nDifferent types of economic moats\n\nAccording to investors such as Warren Buffett, there are several types of economic moats, and each acts as a source of long-term competitive advantage. The most common moats are those provided by intangible assets, such as a popular brand. The stronger the brand, the more it encourages customer loyalty and enables a company to charge premium prices for its products. Companies in this category include Nike and Starbucks.\n\nAnother common type of economic moat is created by network effects. Basically, the more people who use a product or service, the more valuable it becomes to every member of the network. These are most commonly found in the tech industry and include social networks and telecom networks. Think of your favorite social network: Every time a new friend, colleague, or family member joins, it becomes more valuable to you.\n\nOther types of economic moats include high switching costs (it's just too costly or cumbersome to make the switch to a competitor), low cost structures, and economies of scale that make it impossible for a new competitor to enter the marketplace. As a general rule of thumb, the wider the economic moat, the more valuable a company becomes.\n\nDoes Bitcoin have an economic moat?\n\nBased on the above, just about the only economic moat Bitcoin might have is a recognizable brand. If you ask anyone in the world to name a cryptocurrency, it's a near certainty they will name Bitcoin. It has been the market leader since its creation in 2009, and the original Bitcoin white paper is arguably one of the most influential pieces of intellectual property that has ever been created (similar to the original formula for Coca-Cola).\n\nHowever, plenty of high-profile investors consider Bitcoin worthless. For them, Bitcoin is synonymous with financial speculation and black market intrigue. Warren Buffett has famously said he wouldn't pay $25 to own all the Bitcoin in the world. His colleague Charlie Munger has called it worthless \"rat poison.\" So, before you start saying Bitcoin's brand is a source of competitive advantage, keep this in mind.\n\nMoreover, consider switching costs. There are plenty of other options you can use for payments beyond just Bitcoin (including other cryptocurrencies). So, if your favorite e-commerce shop no longer accepts Bitcoin, there's not a lot of pain to switch. At the same time, enterprises are not using Bitcoin to replace pieces of their corporate infrastructure, so there's no risk of them having to rip up their whole IT infrastructure if they have to migrate to another blockchain.\n\nAnd things become far dicier still when you think about cost structures. Bitcoin is a proof-of-work blockchain that requires energy-intensive mining. The newest blockchains are proof-of-stake and are generally acknowledged to be 99.99% more energy efficient. This makes them faster, cheaper to use, and more efficient. Bitcoin can still process only a handful of transactions per second compared to hundreds and even thousands of transactions per second for other blockchains.\n\nCan you analyze cryptocurrencies like companies?\n\nOf course, I'll admit that applying economic moat analysis to a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin may be unfair. After all, cryptocurrencies are not companies. And they are completely decentralized, meaning no CEO or corporate headquarters is making all the decisions.\n\nHowever, I do think economic moat analysis is one way of sorting through the literally thousands of cryptocurrencies that exist today. Only a handful are built for the long haul, and those are cryptocurrencies with some type of sustainable competitive advantage that makes them attractive to users and investors.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin had a vast economic moat because it was literally the only cryptocurrency on the planet. Now, however, Bitcoin's economic moat seems to be eroding. This is a common phenomenon in the stock market, as formerly top-performing companies fade into the background after losing their primary source of competitive advantage.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I still think Bitcoin is a fantastic long-term investment. But I think the record-beating returns it once delivered to investors could fade over the long run as other cryptocurrencies catch up."

If the value of Bitcoin continues to skyrocket, which it very likely will since there is a limited total of bitcoins in existence, Nakamoto could eventually become the richest person on earth.\n\nIn Searching for Satoshi: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator, Kemp investigates who the person (or people) behind the name might be and what might have happened to him.\n\nKemp was drawn to the story because it is, he says, \"the greatest technological mystery of all time.\" While there have been several attempts to uncover who Nakamoto is, none have been successful. So Kemp went on a global quest of his own, which he describes in the interview below.\n\nWhat made you want to investigate the story \u2014 and whereabouts \u2014 of Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nWhen I heard about Bitcoin in 2009, 2010, 2011 \u2026 I didn't really know what it was. I thought it was like Monopoly money. I thought it was just some crypto weirdness that [didn't have] much staying power.\n\nBut as the decade went on, I started to realize people are still working on this thing and the name Bitcoin is everywhere. I saw ATM machines selling Bitcoin. I saw vendors [and] stores accepting Bitcoin. So I started paying more attention to it around 2018, 2019. That's when I learned there was a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto, who actually created Bitcoin.\n\nEveryone who knows anything about Bitcoin realizes he's the greatest mystery in technological history. Nobody knows who he is. All they know is he could possibly be the richest person in the world in the coming years, but he's just vanished.\n\nNakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2009, and by 2011, he [disappeared] with over a million Bitcoins. This documentary asks the deeper questions about who he is and why he did this.\n\nBitcoin was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. 2 years later, he disappeared | Searching for Satoshi Duration 2:03 On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, released the digital currency to the world by posted the \"genesis block,\" the starting point from where Bitcoins could be mined through the blockchain.\n\nHow did you try to track Nakamoto down?\n\nIt's a global story and it needed global legs. I needed to get on a lot of planes. I needed to do a lot of interviewing. Throughout the making of this documentary, I've been to the U.K. to uncover somebody who has claimed to be Nakamoto. I've talked to people in Australia. I've been to Saipan, which is a U.S. protectorate in the middle of the Pacific where I uncovered some amazing evidence of who Nakamoto might be. And of course, I've been to Silicon Valley and the enormous Miami Bitcoin conferences. I think I've traced a pretty good story for the audience.\n\nHow did you create your list of the five people Nakamoto could be?\n\nThe main candidates for Satoshi are currently:\n\nAdam Back, a U.K. cryptographer.\n\nHal Finney, a now deceased cryptographer who was deeply influential in the creation of Bitcoin.\n\nWei Dai, who was a cryptographer in the late '90s and early 2000s who had worked on an earlier proposal for a digital currency.\n\nNick Szabo, who is a polymath. He's written on all sorts of things from politics to economics, but also has the coding ability to possibly be Nakamoto.\n\nSo there are a handful of top candidates, but there's also the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto is somebody that we've never heard of and that he basically released this technology on the world and vanished.\n\nPerhaps we'll never know who it is.\n\nDid the direction of the film change as you dug deeper into the story?\n\nIt's a detective story that's still unravelling, so the film was constantly changing and evolving as I discovered new pieces of evidence. I went into this film not knowing who I thought Nakamoto was. I had an idea that it could be probably three or four people.\n\nBut I was thrown for a loop on that and was forced to rethink my conclusions. And the deeper I went into my research, the more I came up with different conclusions.\n\nIn the documentary, I've presented a character whom I strongly believe is Nakamoto. Maybe I'm wrong. But if so, I'd love my critics to prove why."

The bank also operates as Custodia Bank in other states like California and Wyoming. Eligible users include U.S.-based businesses in states the bank is licensed, and which meets Custodia's customer onboarding requirements, Long noted.\n\nCustodia Bank and Custodia Digital Services operations in U.S. states. Source: Custodia\n\nCustodia Bank emphasized that the platform is a non-lending bank built by Bitcoiners that offers segregated custody accounts on its custom-built Bitcoin custody platform.\n\nUnlike the omnibus custody model, the segregated account model for Bitcoin custody is designed to separate customers' assets from the company\u2019s assets, Custodia\u2019s white paper reads. \u201cThe omnibus custody model dominates traditional financial markets, with most securities held at central securities depositories like the Depository Trust Company,\u201d the document stated, adding:\n\n\"We offer segregated accounts, which have superior customer protections over competing omnibus accounts that are standard offerings in the digital asset custody industry, and which commingle customer digital assets.\"\n\nCustodia Bank\u2019s approval from the Wyoming Division of Banking follows a series of regulatory challenges for the firm. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Board rejected the bank\u2019s application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, saying it was \u201cinconsistent with the required factors under the law.\u201d The Fed subsequently denied Custodia\u2019s request to reconsider its membership application in its system.\n\nRelated: DZ Bank, third-largest German bank, to start crypto custody for institutional investors\n\nIn a detailed report in March 2023, the Fed\u2019s board said the decision to reject Custodia\u2019s application was due to concerns about banks with a high concentration of activities related to the crypto industry. Custodia Bank opened for business in August 2023, though the Fed has blocked much of its proposed business model.\n\nFounded in 2020, Custodia is a bank aiming to bridge the gap between digital assets and the U.S. dollar payments system and a digital asset custodian. The firm was formerly known as Avanti Financial Group and is based in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

With inflation still on everyone\u2019s mind, the United States Federal Reserve will deliver a round of remarks as part of planned engagements, with Chair Jerome Powell among the speakers.\n\nA short trading week on Wall Street will mean an extended period of \u201cout-of-hours\u201d trading next week, allowing crypto to potentially see more volatile moves into the next weekly close.\n\nBehind the scenes, Bitcoin is technically as resilient as BTC price action suggests \u2014 hash rate and difficulty, already at all-time highs, are due to add to their record tally in the coming days.\n\nCointelegraph delves deeper into these issues and more in its weekly overview of what to expect when it comes to Bitcoin market activity in the short term and beyond.\n\nBitcoin bulls refuse to give an inch\n\nLike last week, Bitcoin did not disappoint with the weekly candle close into Nov. 6.\n\nAt just over $35,000, the close in fact set a new 18-month high and preceded a bout of volatility that saw a brief trip to just below the $36,000 mark, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart.

The timing is up for debate, but predictions for the end of 2023 revolve around even higher levels.\n\nIn the meantime, however, more conservative approaches remain. Among them is popular trader Crypto Tony, who over the weekend told X subscribers not to bet on bulls sweeping through resistance.\n\n\u201cI am only short if we lose that support zone at $34,100, and will close my current long position if we lose $33,000,\u201d he wrote, updating his current trading strategy.\n\n\u201cI would not recommend longing here into resistance at all.\u201d\n\nFed speakers lead macro week\n\nWith a break from U.S. macroeconomic data prints this week, attention is once more on the Fed as a source of market volatility.\n\nVarious speaking engagements over the week prior to the Veterans Day holiday on Nov. 10 will see officials, including Fed Chair Powell, take to the stage.\n\nThe timing is perhaps more noteworthy than the speeches themselves \u2014 the Fed continued a pause in interest rate hikes last week despite the data showing inflation beating expectations.\n\nPrevious comments have directed markets away from expecting a pivot in rates policy until well into next year. Per data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, bets for the outcome of the next rates decision, due in just over one month, are for a repeat pause.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

The report suggests that Bitcoin's illiquid supply and long-term holders are on the rise, resulting in a tightening supply and increased bullish sentiment.\n\nAccording to Glassnode's data, smaller, long-term holding entities are actively purchasing the available BTC supply, accounting for 92% of newly produced Bitcoin. The accumulating pattern is visible across investor cohorts, with long-term holdings outperforming short-term holders. This limiting of supply is helping Bitcoin keep its price over $34,000, giving strong support above $30,000.\n\nThe growing trust in Bitcoin is not limited to smaller entities; practically all investors have increased their Bitcoin holdings this year. This pattern displays an optimistic market attitude and points to a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAnother positive indicator is the accumulation of illiquid Bitcoin, which has a limited quantity. Monthly inflows into the illiquid Bitcoin supply continue, with a net gain of 71,000 BTC per month.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

He didn\u2019t know anything about financial regulation, either. He said he believed FTX\u2019s terms of service allowed Alameda Research, its closely associated hedge fund, to use FTX customer funds the way it did, actions prosecutors and the jury called fraud. Asked what he knew about crypto before starting FTX, he answered: \u201cI had absolutely no idea how they worked. I just knew they were things you could trade.\u201d\n\nWhile parts of the trial delved into the technical and financial structure of FTX\u2019s grand scam, the prosecution spent much of its time questioning Bankman-Fried about his public persona. The assistant US attorney Danielle Sassoon wanted to puncture his unkempt boy-genius look, demonstrating to the jury that he used his appearance to woo investors and reassure customers that they were safe in his hands, when in fact they were far from it.\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s vivisection of his image worked. Perhaps we\u2019ve grown weary of the unkempt Mark Zuckerberg school of style. You can read the verdict as such: a hoodie in place of a suit jacket does not mean you are focused on your product to the exclusion of all else; it means you are an amateur. Bankman-Fried admitted during the trial that he was.\n\nThe question after his conviction is whether the entire industry will be found guilty, or just him.\n\nThe trial did not focus extensively on the technological or legal governance of cryptocurrency or blockchain as Bankman-Fried\u2019s means to an end. Rather, the central question was whether the one-time mogul \u201cmisappropriated and embezzled\u201d his customers\u2019 money for his own high-flying ends. The crime is as old as banking itself, but it\u2019s being committed with a new and unregulated technology.\n\nDamian Williams, the prosecutor in charge of the southern district of New York, spoke to this when he said to reporters after the conviction: \u201cSam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history \u2013 a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto \u2013 but while the cryptocurrency industry might be new and the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, this kind of corruption is as old as time.\u201d\n\nA look at bitcoin today reveals the conflicted state crypto finds itself in. Because of Bankman-Fried, cryptocurrencies\u2019 backers have never looked worse. Still, there are signs that bitcoin will endure: the original cryptocurrency is on the verge of a major regulatory victory in the expected approval of exchange-traded funds, including it.\n\nAlso, to industry insiders, the one-time boy wonder is not the avatar of cryptocurrency. They are not like him, they think. And they may have a point: cryptocurrency is not doomed because Bankman-Fried is. Bitcoin is valuable, especially if you bought some in January of this year: it\u2019s up 110% year-to-date.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We may trade bitcoin for the foreseeable future, we may trade it as long as we do stocks, and the true blockchain believers will continue to buoy its value. It\u2019s likely to remain a symbol of libertarian rebellion against the financial system.\n\nFor true believers, the trial has simply been a distraction from the good work. Said Wired: \u201cThe Crypto World Is Already Sick of SBF\u2019s Trial.\u201d For those who do not belong to that school of thought, Bankman-Fried has irrevocably, irreparably, irresponsibly and irredeemably damaged the reputation of this technology. Said the Financial Times\u2019 opinion pages: \u201cThe SBF trial is a reminder that crypto is a rotten business.\u201d After the downfall of FTX, many people would probably take their chances gambling in Las Vegas before putting their money in crypto.\n\nOne lasting legacy of Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall is that it ushered in an era of crypto crackdowns in the US. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has sued Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange; and the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. Both companies deny wrongdoing.\n\nIf Bankman-Fried had been found innocent, I might have said definitively that crypto had, in fact, been on trial. The jury would have committed a spectacular act of faith in cryptocurrency in acquitting him.\n\nBankman-Fried might have struck upon a different, unregulated industry ripe for exploitation. Crypto was the one that was available."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSenator Ted Cruz now accepts Bitcoin donations for his 2024 campaign.\n\nThis move highlights his strong support for cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin enjoys a bipartisan appeal, with several lawmakers hailing its significance.\n\nBut the Biden Administration\u2019s push for SBDC faces skepticism from politicians.\n\nMayors across the US are increasingly opting to receive their salaries in Bitcoin.\n\nThemes like skepticism toward institutions, economic disparity, and increased financial literacy align closely with the surge of Bitcoin in terms of both its value and widespread adoption.\n\nAs Bitcoin reaches its peak value during an American Presidential election cycle, particularly appealing to a demographic with a growing distrust of traditional institutions, it raises curiosity about the potential implications of these trends on the upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential election.\n\nTed Cruz Embraces BTC Donations for 2024 Campaign\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas has started taking Bitcoin contributions for his 2024 reelection campaign. The Republican senator declared: \u201cI am bullish on Bitcoin and I\u2019m proud to accept Bitcoin campaign donations.\u201d\n\nI am bullish on bitcoin, and I'm proud to accept bitcoin campaign donations.https://t.co/0j5njATP8M \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023\n\nThe front page of his official website now features the Bitcoin logo and invites supporters to make cryptocurrency donations.\n\nSeveral presidential contenders declared earlier in the year that they would take Bitcoin donations for their campaigns. Other politicians might very well follow suit if the move proves to be effective. There\u2019s a chance that this will cause attitudes on Capitol Hill to change.\n\nStriving For Bipartisanship In BTC Realm\n\nThe senator is using BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that allows payments in Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and LTC with the ability to instantly convert to US dollars.\n\nThis makes him one of Congress\u2019s strongest supporters of cryptocurrencies, especially as Texas is becoming a center for Bitcoin mining as a result of China\u2019s 2021 ban on industrial mining.\n\nThe Bitcoin phenomenon may be more bipartisan than most people realize, despite the fact that Republicans have been more outspoken in their support of it.\n\nBe it as it may, a presidential candidate\u2019s views on Bitcoin and crypto are important not only because the president leads the country, but also because the President is responsible for appointing the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions that can influence various aspects of crypto, including the SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve and Treasury.\n\nSenators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand co-sponsored a bill about cryptocurrency. Though it is not a unique instance, this endeavor to legitimise the industry and explain rules in the summer of 2022 finally failed.\n\nAn essay titled \u201cA liberal case for cryptocurrency \u201d was written in 2022 by Representative Ritchie Torres, for instance. His piece focused on helping the underprivileged and shifting Wall Street\u2019s power dynamics. A few months prior, the article was the result of a legislative endeavor to provide clarification on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nEven at the most recent Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami earlier this year, several lawmakers with varying political affiliations gave speeches. Robert Kennedy, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tulsi Gabbard\u2014past and present presidential contenders\u2014were among the featured speakers.\n\nBiden Administration Advocates CBDC\n\nEven with the bipartisan support for Bitcoin, the Biden Administration\u2019s push for a central bank digital currency has not convinced many politicians. Ted Cruz mentioned the increasing significance of Bitcoin in a recent audio interview about CBDCs that is available to listen to below.\n\nBiden Admin Urges Israel to STOP\n\nKilling Terrorists, Dems Smear Justice Thomas, and School Choice\u2014the Civil Rights Issue of the 21st Century. @benfergusonshow and I discuss all this and more on this morning\u2019s new episode of Verdict. Don\u2019t miss it!https://t.co/zSt10lQMrs \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 6, 2023\n\nCruz seems to be thinking of CBDCs as an extension of the failed initiatives that led to the creation of the Build Back Better law under the Biden administration. During the interview, he stated that Build Back Better would have mandated that banks notify the government of any transaction above $400.\n\nCruz is mostly worried about the extent of monitoring and control that CBDCs would permit. He concluded that \u201cthe federal government has no business monitoring the financial transactions of a free people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CATO institute, 74% of Americans are against using CBDCs in place of dollars. Support for Bitcoin may increase as a result of people\u2019s opposition to CBDCs and their desire to elude increasing financial control.\n\nUS Mayors Join Bitcoin Payment Trend\n\nFollowing the 2021 election season, mayors of Miami and New York City, representing opposing political parties, decided to accept Bitcoin as payment for their salaries. Several other mayors were spurred to follow suit by this trend.\n\nTwo additional mayors have followed suit after Miami Mayor, Francis Suarez, and New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, declared they would accept their future paychecks in Bitcoin. Jane Castor of Tampa, Florida, and Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee, have similar plans for their next city payment.\n\nA group of politicians are attempting to establish their towns as genuine Bitcoin hubs in the United States as a result of game theory, which is increasing the rate and volume of mayors converting their payments into Bitcoin.\n\nWhile state law prohibits the @CityofJacksonTN from paying me in Bitcoin, I\u2019ll follow the lead of @FrancisSuarez & @ericadamsfornyc and instantly convert my next paycheck to #Bitcoin \u2014 Mayor Scott Conger (@MayorConger) November 5, 2021\n\nAccording to the mayor, everyone can receive payment in Bitcoin; all they need to do is purchase Bitcoin with their entire wage as soon as it arrives. Since Tennessee law prohibits the city of Jackson from paying him directly in Bitcoin, he can still convert his wage into Bitcoin.\n\nThe Mayor of Tampa likewise expressed her readiness to embrace the same approach, indicating her willingness to join the group of U.S. mayors receiving their payments in Bitcoin.\n\nApologies for coming late to the conversation \u2013 we've been busy preparing for today's cryptocurrency conference here in the @CityofTampa . \ud83e\ude99\ud83d\ude0f But I'm certainly up for the challenge! #ForbesTopEmergingTechnologyCity #FloridasTechCapitol #TechTown \u2014 Jane Castor (@JaneCastor) November 5, 2021\n\nOther Lawmakers To Join BTC Battle\n\nProponents like Cruz anticipate that more lawmakers will join the battle to support Bitcoin as more people start to recognizeBitcoin its worth in the face of this escalating threat. Washington might hold onto its unyielding beliefs up until that point.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain prominence and considering the importance of the young voter demographic, it will be intriguing to observe how presidential candidates\u2019 positions on cryptocurrency develop and whether they will have an impact on the 2024 American Presidential election.\n\nIt is crucial to closely monitor this, as the legal framework, policies, and regulations will hold significant consequences for the cryptocurrency as an asset class, America\u2019s position in the global economy, and the future of finance."

Supporters of BSV refer to it as \u201cthe original Bitcoin,\u201d but it remains a contentious cryptocurrency and has been delisted from several major exchanges.\n\nWright\u2019s threats of lawsuits were cited by Kraken as one of the reasons to delist BSV years ago.\n\nAs of now, BSV ranks 53rd among digital assets, with a market cap of $967 million according to CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency market data platform.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s decision to delist BSV came in 2021 after the coin\u2019s underlying blockchain suffered a \u201c51% attack,\u201d causing the network to become unstable.

        "content": "Lugui Tillier is the commercial director for Lumx Studios, one of the top cryptocurrency firms in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 a city with a burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nBut for Tillier \u2014 who holds dual citizenship between Belgium and Brazil \u2014 cryptocurrency is more than a job. It was a passion sparked by a friend, and it evolved into his first full-time crypto job with Lumx in 2021.\n\n1) How did you get into crypto?\n\nI was very fortunate because Alexandre Vasarhelyi, the stepfather of one of my closest friends, was the one who co-founded the first crypto fund here in Brazil in 2017 \u2014 BLP Crypto. Before that, he was always talking to me about crypto and blockchain, telling me it was the future and that I should learn more about it. So around 2019, I finally listened to him and deep-dived into Bitcoin. But until then, it had been nothing more than a secondary interest to me. I graduated in marketing from ESPM, one of the leading marketing universities in LATAM, and in 2021, when I saw in blockchain the expression of the connection between brands and people through NFTs and the Metaverse, I pivoted my entire life to crypto and began working at Lumx where I have had the pleasure of integrating Web3 solutions into companies such as Nestl\u00e9, Ab InBev, META, BTG Pactual, among others.\n\n2) Tell us about Lumx and what you do for them.\n\nWe are a blockchain abstraction solution for big enterprises. We help anyone who wants to integrate blockchain into their business, or companies that want to deploy projects or experiment on blockchain. We developed our own solution for account abstraction, payments, decentralized identity (DID), and smart contracts. Now, big companies can mostly focus only on their own applications \u2014 not on hiring blockchain engineers or learning about blockchain technology and infrastructure, which is still complex. So we enable those big companies to work and test safely. I am the commercial director here at Lumx, so I am always in touch with the directors of the largest companies in LATAM who wish to integrate Web3 into their businesses. It\u2019s still a very consultative sale, but companies are learning very quickly, especially the banks.\n\n3) Do you invest in crypto yourself? What do you take the most interest in right now?\n\nLugui Tillier at the Savvy Brain Academy in Tanzania, a school he began donating to in 2017 using Bitcoin. Source: Lugui Tillier\n\nI\u2019m investing a lot in layer 2s. (I like Polygon, Arbitrum, and ZK solutions \u2014 such as ZK-Sync and Linea.) In the last cycle, we saw a lot of projects start on Ethereum, and that was unsustainable. We were paying $50 (or more) per transaction. There were days that we had gas wars, and people were paying almost six Ethereum per transaction.\n\nI still don\u2019t know if there was just a lack of knowledge that you could build stuff on a layer 2 among new projects and companies at the time. But people wanted to have exposure to Ethereum, so stuff that should have been happening on layer 2s was happening on Ethereum.\n\nLiquidity is flowing to layer 2s now, so layer 2s are more prepared for the next wave.\n\nI also really like Bitcoin Ordinals and Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB). We\u2019re having an explosion of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) being built on Bitcoin, the biggest blockchain in the world. Being able to express art and culture in a 100% on-chain way via Ordinals \u2014 it\u2019s really amazing. That\u2019s why I really like Ordinals.\n\nI believe that Ordinals will perhaps capture the most of this new culture and way of expressing everything on Bitcoin. Ordinals help to express the core values of Bitcoin in a much more friendly way than Bitcoin, which is too technical or harsh for some people.\n\n4) Where do you see Bitcoin and Ethereum in 10 years?\n\nI think I see Bitcoin and Ethereum as the main consensus platforms in the world. This is curious, because nowadays it\u2019s rare to see Bitcoin as a platform. We already see Ethereum as a platform where you have other applications and layers to build around it. Because of the advancements of some protocols \u2014 like Taproot Assets and Ordinals \u2014 I see Bitcoin venturing into a new era.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nBesides being a currency to pay for stuff, or a store of value, you will be able to store other currencies and assets on it. Bitcoin is moving from an era where it\u2019s been an asset to an era where it will be a platform for storing and trading other assets.\n\n5) What is the main hurdle to mass adoption of blockchain technology?\n\nLugui Tillier (second from right) in 2022 speaking at NFC Brasil, one of the main Web3 events in Latin America, where he shared his experience of working with traditional companies in Web3. Source: Lugui Tillier\n\nEven though we have made significant progress, blockchain is still composed of complex infrastructure. It\u2019s complicated not just for end-users, but also for traditional companies that want to work with it. I often joke that you only realize how complex MetaMask is when you try to teach your father how to use it \u2014 hence the importance of the emerging abstraction solutions.\n\nWhile these solutions may slightly compromise decentralization, they preserve a blockchain\u2019s programmability and automation and significantly lower the barrier to entry. This is crucial because now we have a second option. People can stay 100% decentralized if they prefer it, but for those who do not, they have the option of adopting a \u201csemi-decentralized\u201d model, which is the missing link to mainstream adoption.\n\n6) What do you do in your free time?\n\nI really like to study philosophy, especially stoicism. Everyone who works or lives in this crypto world is exposed to a lot of volatility, and they\u2019re used to a lot of dopamine and incentives. The mantra of stoicism is to cultivate indifference to stuff that you are not able to control. When you master this, you are able to live in peace in this crazy crypto world. So it\u2019s one of my favorite subjects \u2014 not only for my personal life, but also for my professional life."

        "content": "An upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate-backed product that could offer 10%\u201313% returns shouldn\u2019t be compared to failed products by BlockFi or Celsius, as its returns come from proof-of-work, not \u201cPonzi schemes,\u201d claims the product\u2019s creator, Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technology.\n\nThe legitimacy of Luxor\u2019s hash rate-backed product was highlighted in an Oct. 17 episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast. Host Peter McCormack expressed concern about Luxor\u2019s upcoming offering and discussed what a worst-case scenario for Luxor\u2019s product would look like.\n\nLuxor head of derivatives Matt Williams told Cointelegraph that its hash rate-backed product isn\u2019t a repeat of products from BlockFi or Celsius because it\u2019s backed by economic production.\n\n\u201cThere is actual proof-of-work and demonstrable economic activity happening [here],\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe return comes from miners giving up some of the margin that they would produce from their mining business to an investor that is financing their operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main takeaway: The return comes from hash rate, not from pixie dust, Ponzi schemes or rehypothecation.\u201d\n\nInvestors make a return by paying Bitcoin to miners (not Luxor) and then receive that miner's Bitcoin production.\n\nThe returns are created when hash rate is purchased from a Bitcoin miner at a discounted price and is then \u201clocked in\u201d when sold at a higher price. Bitcoin in the form of mining rewards comes from that hash rate. Luxor estimates investor returns will range from 10% to 13%. However, these returns will vary based on market conditions and are not guaranteed.\n\nLuxor mandates miners to put up collateral to ensure they can still meet their obligations to the investor in the event of machine downtime, insolvency, or some other disruption to their operations.\n\nWilliams claimed the offering means miner\u2019s are provided with \u201cbetter\u201d access to capital because they won\u2019t have to sell their mined BTC to fund their operations.\n\n\u201cIt can be a more economically viable option for miners because they can receive funding upfront while retaining ownership of their mined Bitcoin,\u201d he added.\n\nLuxor stressed that it isn\u2019t using its own mining pool and is only acting as an intermediary between investors and mining firms. \u201cWe only custody Bitcoin for a very short period of time as we move funds from the buyer (investor) to the seller (mining firm),\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams stressed that Luxor's product isn't tapping into its own mining pool reserves or client funds.\n\nWe understand your concern regarding rehypothecation, but to be clear again, there is NO rehypothecation with this product. The yield comes from mining rewards as stated in the podcast.\n\n\n\nWe're happy to have a conversation on this topic to answer your questions and address your\u2026 \u2014 Luxor Technology \u26cf\ufe0f (@LuxorTechnology) October 27, 2023\n\nBut those interested in making a return on their Bitcoin should tread with caution, said Joe Kelly, CEO of Bitcoin lending firm Unchained.\n\nRelated: El Salvador launches first Bitcoin mining pool as Volcano Energy partners with Luxor\n\n\u201cAny investment or loan that requires a Bitcoin holder to part control with their Bitcoin should receive tremendous diligence and scrutiny,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin lending and borrowing markets are very nascent, and we are likely to see repeats of the failures that happened with BlockFi and Celsius unless investors on the whole exercise extreme caution.\u201d\n\nWilliams iterated that the hash rate-backed product isn\u2019t available to retail customers and mining firms must pass the firm\u2019s due diligence checks before being approved.\n\nTLDR: @LuxorTechnology intends to take customer Bitcoin and loan it to well established mining companies looking for funding.\n\n\n\nLuxor will do \u2018due diligence\u2019 on the recipient of the loan and the donor will immediately start receiving #Bitcoin at a pre determined rate (ie 10-13%) \u2014 The \u20bfitcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) October 27, 2023\n\nWilliams acknowledged Luxor\u2019s hash rate-backed product rightfully comes with \u201cinherent trepidation\u201d in light of the BlockFi and Celsius bankruptcies and noted that investors are taking on counterparty risk with Luxor.\n\nTo mitigate those risks, Luxor said it would only work with \u201creputable miners\u201d and will mandate them to post collateral to use the product.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives: Mt. Gox collapse saw birth of Chainalysis\n\nUpdate (Nov. 6 at 9:02 UTC): This article has been updated to include corrections pertaining to how Luxor's hashrate-based product operates and to clarify that 10-13% returns vary on market conditions and are not guaranteed."

        "content": "Ordinals, a BRC-20 token collection minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, have surged by 40.8% in the past 24 hours to $10.19 after listing on crypto exchange Binance.\n\nAccording to Binance\u2019s Nov. 7 announcement, users can now trade Ordinals (ORDI) against Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), and the Turkish lira. Binance claims that it did not charge developers any listing fees for the ORDI token and that withdrawals will open on Nov. 8. As part of initial incentives, the first 1,000 users who deposit at least 72 ORDI to the exchange received a 50 USDT trading rebate voucher.\n\n\u201cORDI is a relatively new token that poses a higher than normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each individual satoshi, or 1/100 million of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking and transfer. Combined with the inscription process, which adds an additional layer of data to each satoshi, this allows users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The current token listed on Binance, ORDI, is not associated with developers of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nInvented by Web3 developer Rodarmor in January, BRC-20 tokens have surged in popularity as one of the largest technological advancements in a 15-year-old blockchain. Self-custody wallet providers, such as BitKeep (now Bitget Wallet), have enabled BRC-20 token deposits and withdrawals since June. The total market cap of BRC-20 tokens currently stands at $1.34 billion.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals\u2019 total mintage fees increase 700% from April"

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA man who lost an estimated \u00a3165m of cryptocurrency thrown into a landfill by mistake has unveiled his latest plan to try and get the money back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried for 10 years to be nice, now we need to go to battle\u201d, James Howells explains as he outlines the next step in his fight with a council to find the hard drive that houses the digital fortune.\n\nThe IT systems engineer has spent a decade trying to convince Newport City Council to help him search for the device that was accidentally thrown away in 2013, but it has repeatedly refused to allow him access to the site.\n\nSo in a last roll of the dice, the 37-year-old has retained a legal team who have written to the local authority this week asking for legal access to the site. If successful, he hopes to employ mechanical arms powered by AI (artificial intelligence) to sift through the site to find the drive.\n\nThe bizarre saga started in 2013 when Mr Howells, put the hardware from an old laptop that contained 8,000 bitcoins, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, in a black bag in his hallway.\n\n\u201cI was doing a clear-out in my office and put a lot of items into a bag which I then placed at the front door of my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI woke up the next morning and my ex-partner had already taken the bags to the landfill site; she thought she was doing me a favour, it wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d\n\nAfter the unintentional error, the cryptocurrency expert hatched a plan to get back his lost millions by getting together a crack team of environmental health and data recovery experts.\n\nAs part of the plan, his team would utilise AI to operate a mechanical arm in sorting the mounds of rubbish. Each piece of detritus would then be sifted through by hand in a nearby pop-up tent.\n\nSecurity had been considered by the IT systems engineer who wanted to utilise robot dogs to make sure opportunistic thieves could not steal his discarded hard drive.\n\nMr Howells outside the landfill site in Docks Way where he believes his hard drive full of cryptocurrency is buried (Wales News Service)\n\nBut despite his schemes, there remains a stumbling block. The local council refuses to give permission to access the landfill site, despite Mr Howells saying he would cover any costs related to the search.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years I\u2019ve always tried to engage with Newport City Council in a businesslike manner, they are the site owner, they are the operator, they own the permit for the landfill, so I\u2019ve always wanted to be friends with them and work with them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd to do that I\u2019ve always tried to build a bigger, better team to try and impress them and finally engage with me.\u201d\n\nHowever, his requests to meet with the council\u2019s senior leadership were not successful, so he has now taken the next step in his fight and retained a legal team.\n\nIf Mr Howells does manage to recover his lost millions, he wants to turn Newport into the UK\u2019s first \u201ccrypto hub\u201d and gift its 160,000 residents \u00a350 in bitcoin each. A city council report in 2021 found that a quarter of areas in Newport were in the most deprived 10 per cent in Wales.\n\n\u201cThe idea is then people will have to learn how to use bitcoin, and that will then help them themselves going forward in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will also set up a blockchain education centre in Newport city centre which will be open with a five-year commitment where anybody can come in face to face and have a sit-down\u2026 it\u2019s scary going on a phone to learn about crypto but if you have somebody face to face to teach you and show you to ropes, so to speak, it\u2019ll be a little bit easier.\u201d\n\nMr Howells is now speaking to lawyers about how to progress his case (Wales News Service)\n\nHe also wants to install crypto point-of-sale devices in all the independent stores in Newport, so the local community \u201ccan use the coins and we can get a crypto economy going in South Wales\u201d.\n\nMr Howells\u2019s legal team wrote to the council on 6 September asking for access to the site and it has two weeks to respond, before a possible escalation in the courts.\n\n\u201cUntil the door is fully slammed shut by a court, then I will continue trying, as I have over the last 10 years ... the court is the last step for me, I am no longer asking Newport City Council for access, I am now going to be asking a judge for access.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin fluctuates but the value of Mr Howells\u2019s coins at the time of writing was \u00a3165m.\n\nA spokesperson for the authority said: \u201cNewport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins, which may or may not be in our landfill site.\n\n\u201cThe council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cThe council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear and consistent in our responses that we cannot assist Mr Howells in this matter. Our position has not changed.\n\n\u201cWe will be offering no further comments on this issue as it takes up valuable officer time which could be spent on delivering services for the residents of Newport.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction Summary\n\nThe current BTC price stands at $26,850 , a significant increase from the $16,605 (62% rise) at the beginning of 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Fear and Greed index is 51, indicating a neutral market .\n\nIn mid-July, BTC reached nearly $32k, marking an almost 100% surge from its starting price in January.\n\nA recent drop to $25k this month breached a major support level, signaling a potentially bearish shift in the market.\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate BTC to ascend to $45,200 by the close of 2025, presenting a gain of 73.8% from its current value.\n\nYear Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2023 $18,200 $21,525 $31,000 2024 $15,500 $25,200 $31,000 2025 $21,500 $45,200 $53,000 2030 $30,000 $69,000 $100,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Historical Data\n\nBitcoin is known for its highly unpredictable trading patterns compared to other well-known assets. The first significant uptick occurred in 2010 when BTC increased from a fraction of a penny to $0.09.\n\nSince then, the price of BTC has undergone several price changes. Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations show how people feel about it. Some are highly optimistic about its potential, while others might be unsure due to how it progresses.\n\nThe person or group who created Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, originally meant for it to be used for regular transactions. Cryptocurrency became popular for buying things, but some people also started betting on its price.\n\nPeople saw Bitcoin as a way to save money, make more, and protect against rising prices, and big organizations even worked on ways to invest in Bitcoin. Below is a breakdown of Bitcoin\u2019s price history since its inception.\n\nThe Origin 2009 -2015\n\nWhen Bitcoin started in 2009, it was worth nothing. But by July 17, 2010, its value increased to 9 cents. After that, it jumped from $1 to $29.60 in just three months by June 7, 2011, which was a big increase. But then, things got tough for Bitcoin.\n\nIts value dropped significantly and hit a low point of $2.05 in mid-November. Nonetheless, it went back from $4.85 on May 9 to $13.50 by August 15, 2012. By 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s price recorded some huge gains, which gave early investors profit.\n\nBitcoin started 2013 trading at $13.28 and increased to $230 on April 8, 2013. This represents an uptick of 1669%. Unfortunately, this pump was short-lived as the price retraced to $$68.50 on July 4, 2013. At the beginning of October 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $123.00.\n\nThen, in December, it shot up to $1,237.55 but quickly dropped to $687.02 three days later. After that, in 2014, Bitcoin\u2019s price went down and started at $315.21 in 2015.\n\nThe Bull-Run 2016-2020\n\nDuring 2016, Bitcoin\u2019s price went up steadily, reaching over $900 by the end of the year. 2017 Bitcoin\u2019s price started around $1,000, then suddenly jumped past $2,000 in May. Furthermore, by December 15, Bitcoin saw a massive surge, hitting a high of $19,345.49.\n\nThis caught the attention of regular investors, governments, and experts. Also, it\u2019s led to the development of other cryptocurrencies to rival Bitcoin. In 2018 and 2019, Bitcoin\u2019s price moved sideways with some short bursts of activity. In June 2019, it got active, and the price went above $10,000, but it fell to about $6,635.84 by December.\n\nThen, in 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world had to stop many things, including businesses. This made Bitcoin\u2019s price go up again. It began the year at around $6,965.72.\n\nPeople were worried about the economy, making Bitcoin even more popular.\n\nBy the end of November, Bitcoin was worth about $19,157.16. In December, it went up even more, almost hitting $29,000. This was a huge increase, about 416%, from the start of the year. Looking ahead, 2020 was a big year for Bitcoin.\n\nBy 2021, things became even more as Bitcoin\u2019s price smashed its 2020 record, hitting $40,000 on January 7, 2021. Furthermore, by mid-April, the price of Bitcoin shocked the world by hitting a new all-time high of over $60,000. This price increase attracted big investors, propelling its price toward hitting $63,558 on April 12, 2021.\n\nHowever, in the summer of 2021, prices dropped by over 50%, reaching about $29,796 on July 19. Then, in September, there was a period of strong growth, and prices went up to $52,693. But a little while later, they dropped again, closing at about $40,710.\n\nOn November 10, 2021, Bitcoin hit its highest price, reaching $68,789 before ending the day at $64,995. But the price had fallen to $46,164 by mid-December of the same year.\n\nUncertainty filled the market due to worries about inflation and the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron.\n\nFrom January to May 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s value steadily dropped, hitting $28,305 on May 11, the first time it closed below $30,000 since July 2021. In addition, on June 13, 2022, there was a significant drop in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nThis caused Bitcoin to fall below $23,000 for the first time since December 2020. However, 2023 started well for Bitcoin as its price staged a turnaround. By April 10, the coin had gone up by 83% for the year, reaching a high of $31,035.\n\nThis also marked a significant breakthrough above an important price of around $30,000.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin remained stable at around $30,000 between April and the end of July. BTC tried touching $32,000 following positive sentiment from BlackRock and Fidelity Bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nBut on August 16 and 17, it experienced a sudden decrease from $29,000 to $26,000, marking a two-month low in just 12 hours.\n\nThis drop was partly linked to reports that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had sold its Bitcoin holdings. There was another decrease in mid-September, but the crucial resistance level of $25k remained intact. The price has increased by about 4% in the past week.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2023\n\nMarshall Beard, the chief strategy officer at the Gemini crypto exchange, thinks that Bitcoin could reach new record highs this year. He mentioned that if Bitcoin reaches its previous high of nearly $69,000, then hitting $100,000 becomes a possibility.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s chief technology officer, believes Bitcoin might have a chance to reach around $69,000 again.\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin supporters see it as a reliable investment. Some called it a modern-day version of gold, which can provide good returns during uncertain times.\n\nThis hope was strengthened by the possibility that the US Federal Reserve might not rapidly raise interest rates. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index is 51, indicating a neutral market.\n\nThis suggests that investors are not overly driven by fear or greed. Instead, they take a balanced approach, considering potential gains and risks. Investors act cautiously, make decisions based on a balanced assessment, and avoid extreme emotions in trading.\n\nBased on technical indicators, the coin is approaching its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), positioned above it. This SMA could act as a resistance level, as it historically signifies a point where the coin\u2019s price might face challenges in rising further.\n\nBut, if the price breaks above the SMA, it could signal a bullish trend, indicating potential upward momentum.\n\nThis might attract more investors, potentially driving the price higher. However, it\u2019s important to approach such situations cautiously and consider other factors. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence has risen above its signal line, mirroring the strong bullish momentum in the Bitcoin market.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index is above 50, suggesting that the buying and selling pressure is relatively balanced. Considering the analysis, Bitcoin could return to its previous high of $30,000 if this momentum is sustained.\n\nFrom the above chart, BTC found support at $24,800 and $19,549. Bitcoin\u2019s slide has paused temporarily at the immediate support at the $26,499 level. If this support holds, BTC may rebound and move toward the resistance level of $28,142.\n\nHowever, if the support at the $26,499 level doesn\u2019t hold, the price may drop toward $24,800. This could spark negative sentiment within the crypto market or even affect other coins.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is our Bitcoin price forecast for 2023:\n\nMonth Potential Low Average Price Potential High July $21,525 $25,175 $27,200 August $20,000 $23,000 $25,500 September $17,000 $21,525 $25,000 October $15,750 $20,000 $24,000 November $16,000 $21,500 $25,175 December $16,000 $21,500 $25,175\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2024\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin might find stability around $21,500. Then, in 2024, things could improve. The US might lower interest rates, making it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin. New rules also make it clearer for investors.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin might skyrocket after 2024. It could slowly go up to around $25,200. It could go even higher, but only if there\u2019s a big reason for investors to get into Bitcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, if things don\u2019t go as planned, Bitcoin might drop back to around $15,500 like it was in 2022. Remember, these are just predictions, and things in the market can change. Always be careful with investments.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2025\n\n2025 Bitcoin\u2019s price is expected to keep increasing because of positive economic factors from 2024. If inflation stays low, interest rates might go down even more. Also, stricter rules for other cryptocurrencies could bring in new investors, many of whom might choose to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, if there are more rules for the crypto market, big funds like retirement savings might start investing in Bitcoin. This could unlock much money that can\u2019t be used to buy Bitcoin. Fidelity is the main company offering Bitcoin investment through US retirement plans.\n\nWe anticipate Bitcoin to make a strong move upward in 2025. Our prediction places Bitcoin\u2019s price at $45,200. Although this is lower than its highest point of $68,789.63, it\u2019s close to the level where Bitcoin steadied itself before and after hitting that high.\n\nIn a more optimistic scenario, Bitcoin might reach $53,000, the next significant level on its price chart. Conversely, a more cautious prediction has Bitcoin around $21,500. This might occur if investors show a weak interest in Bitcoin despite its improving fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction for 2030?\n\nBased on a basic extrapolation of Bitcoin\u2019s price trends since 2017. Bitcoin is projected to reach about $191,000 by January 2030. When considering the price impact of Bitcoin\u2019s halving events, which occur approximately every four years, it\u2019s important to factor in the influence of each event on Bitcoin\u2019s value. By 2030, two halving events are expected, one in May 2024 and another in May 2028.\n\nAnalyzing past halving events\n\nThe first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged from $12 to $1,050 in 2013. This suggests an increase of about 8,650%. The second halving in July 2016 led to Bitcoin rising from $664 to a high of $2,556 by July 2016.\n\nThis indicates about a 285% increase. The third halving in May 2020 resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s price surging from $8,721 to a high of $55,831 by May 2021, which depicts an impressive 540% increase.\n\nOn average, Bitcoin experienced a 3,158% increase in the year following each halving event. If we exclude the anomaly of 2012, the average increase is 412.5%. Utilizing an extrapolation from January 2017, which will project a price of $108,000 by May 2024.\n\nThis will also include a 413% increase between May 2024 and May 2025.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value could reach $446,000. Incorporating the estimated 413% increase between May 2028 and May 2029. Bitcoin could reach $2.08 million by May 2029, with a projected value of $2.11 million by January 2030.\n\nPotential Highs & Lows of Bitcoin Price\n\nFactors beyond the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s jurisdiction greatly influence Bitcoin\u2019s future worth. For instance, Bitcoin is notably affected by interest rates and inflation rather than the regulatory procedures that affect the broader crypto market. Therefore, forecasting Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, especially in the long term, remains a challenging task.\n\nHere are our projections for Bitcoin\u2019s highs and lows in the forthcoming years:\n\nYear Potential Low Potential High 2023 $18,200 $31,000 2024 $15,500 $31,000 2025 $21,500 $53,000 2030 $30,000 $100,000\n\nExpert price prediction for Bitcoin\n\nCryptoPredictions.com had a relative Bitcoin price forecast for 2023. They suggested a potential closing price of $27,042.45, followed by a slight decline to $25,750.01 by the year-end.\n\nThey further projected a possible decrease to $22,506.19 by the close of 2025, followed by a recovery to $25,879.65 in December 2026 and $31,789.45 in 2027.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice\u2019s Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 indicated a rapid growth trajectory. With an anticipated average price of $104,054.68 and a rise to $308,121.08 by 2030, eventually reaching $575,189.18 in 2032.\n\nPrice Prediction\u2019s Bitcoin price projection for 2030 was also quite bullish, foreseeing a value of $564,433.66. This is a significant increase from the already optimistic estimates of $38,957.08 in 2023, $55,512.18 in 2024, and $81,444.23 in 2025.\n\nAccording to ARKInvestanalyst Yassine Elmandjra, there is a possibility that Bitcoin might achieve a value of $1 million by the year 2030. This projection is grounded in the belief that Bitcoin remains a nascent market with untapped potential. This will unlock numerous new applications and purposes in the coming years.\n\nAlso, Crypto analyst Cezary Graf has highlighted concerns regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future. He stated that in the event of a collapse of either Tether, the leading stablecoin, or Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange. This could lead Bitcoin\u2019s price to plummet to as low as $2,700.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin, and what can it be used for?\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer or group of developers, Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on blockchain, a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not subject to central control by entities such as banks or the government.\n\nBitcoin serves several purposes. It can be used as a medium of exchange, allowing individuals and businesses to conduct online transactions. It can also be used to purchase goods and services.\n\nAnd even transfer money across borders quickly and with lower fees than traditional banking methods. Bitcoin is often seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Some investors view it as \u201cdigital gold\u201d because it has a limited supply, like gold. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, making it resistant to inflation caused by excessive money printing.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin has gained popularity as an investment asset, with many people buying and hoping its value will increase over time. It is also used for remittances and donations and to access financial services in areas with limited banking infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin Overview\n\nCryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker Symbol BTC Rank 1 Price $26,606 Price Changes 24H +1% Market Cap $518,666,341,219 Circulating Supply 19,492,900 BTC Trading Volume $10,307,321,773 All Time Low $0.00 All-Time High $68,789.63\n\nFactors that can influence the price of Bitcoin?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is subject to a complex interplay of factors. Supply and demand dynamics play a central role. When more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price rises, and vice versa. Also, market sentiment plays a significant role.\n\nNews events, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment can cause rapid price fluctuations. Furthermore, positive news like institutional adoption or regulatory support can boost confidence and increase prices. While negative news, such as security breaches or regulatory crackdowns, can have the opposite effect.\n\nAlso, Technical factors, like trading volumes and price patterns, influence short-term price movements. High trading volumes often accompany price rallies, while price patterns, like support and resistance levels, can provide traders with entry and exit points.\n\nAdditionally, macroeconomic factors can impact Bitcoin\u2019s price. Economic crises, inflation concerns, and currency devaluation can drive interest in Bitcoin as a store of value. This could increase demand for Bitcoin.\n\nIs Bitcoin worth investing in?\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin involves potential gains and risks; being well-informed about these aspects is crucial for making a prudent choice. Various elements, such as worldwide economic conditions, regulatory environment, technological advancements, and individual financial circumstances, play a role in this assessment.\n\nFor investors with a long-term perspective, there may be opportunities to acquire Bitcoin at a discounted price towards the end of the year. It\u2019s worth noting that various crypto analysts propose even more optimistic price targets, ranging from $100,000 to $1 million.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that there is no certainty that Bitcoin\u2019s value will rise over any specific timeframe since unforeseen global economic events could significantly impact BTC\u2019s price in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, predicting the future of Bitcoin\u2019s price for 2023, 2024, and 2030 is complex. While analysts offer various scenarios, it\u2019s important to approach these predictions with caution.\n\nFactors like market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements influence Bitcoin\u2019s value. While some foresee steady growth, others anticipate fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, potential investors should conduct thorough research before making any significant decisions. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and unpredictable, so always approach it carefully and prudencefully.\n\nFAQs"

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Tron were trading in the red, while XRP BNB , Cardano, Dogecoin , Polygon, and Toncoin were trading in the green.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.14% to around $1.32 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.6% at $34,915 as of 1:10 p.m., while Ethereum was below the $1,900 level. XRP surged over 9%.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been hovering around the $35,000 mark. This fluctuation may be attributed to traders cashing in their Bitcoin profits and reallocating them into altcoins. Another potential factor could be the United States reporting a gain of 150,000 jobs in October, falling short of the 180,000 predicted by economists and a decline from September's 297,000 figure.\"Meanwhile, in the last week major crypto tokens rallied on the back of the US Federal Reserve's rate pause. Bitcoin rose nearly 2%, while Ethereum surged 5%. XRP, Solana, and Cardano advanced over 17%.The recent rally from last week crypto has boosted investor sentiment, as the crypto fear and greed index has jumped 4 points from yesterday to be within the greed zone with a score of 74/100. While the price momentum may look short-term, market analysts are seeing signs of sustainable demand driving the crypto uptrend, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.The total volume in DeFi is currently $4.31 billion, 11.28% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $32.74 billion, which is 85.76% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, declined to $682 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 51.8%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 29% to $12.4 billion.\"There was a decrease of over 1.5% in BTC dominance, indicating potential opportunities for altcoins to shine. ETH dominance has also found support, potentially signaling a recovery,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.In the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin's price has faced challenges in maintaining a strong upward momentum, encountering significant selling pressure around the $36,000 mark. However, it's crucial to note that the overall market trend remains bullish. The current consolidation phase might merely represent an accumulation period, laying the foundation for a revival of bullish momentum. If the price of Bitcoin breaks out above this consolidation channel, it would invalidate the immediate bearish outlook and potentially indicate the beginning of a new rally.Bitcoin was trading in a range from $25,000 to $28,500 and was taking good support at the critical level of $25k (Horizontal Trendline & 50 Fibonacci Retracement Level). The asset finally gave a breakout above the range and started moving upwards. The prices broke the long-held resistance of $32,000 and rallied up to $35,984. BTC has a resistance zone from $36,000 - $36,500. If it breaks, closes and sustains above this level then we can expect it to further rally up to $40,000.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Celebrating Bitcoin White Paper Day: Bitcoin Backstage with Adam Back - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin White Paper Day, celebrated on October 31, marks the 15th anniversary of the release of the groundbreaking Bitcoin white paper by the pseudonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This pivotal document, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" introduced the world to a revolutionary technology that has since disrupted traditional financial systems and sparked a global interest in digital currencies. On this special day, it is important to reflect on the significance of Bitcoin's white paper, understand the underlying technology, and contemplate its future trajectory.\n\nUnderstanding the Significance of Bitcoin White Paper Day\n\nBitcoin White Paper Day holds immense significance within the Bitcoin community and beyond. It not only commemorates the birth of Bitcoin but also serves as a reminder of the transformative potential of this technology. This day offers an opportunity to delve deeper into the genesis of Bitcoin's white paper and explore why it continues to hold relevance in today's digital landscape.\n\nThe Genesis of Bitcoin White Paper Day\n\nBitcoin White Paper Day marks the day when Satoshi Nakamoto first shared their vision for a decentralized digital currency with the world. On October 31, 2008, the Bitcoin white paper was posted to the cryptography mailing list METZDOWD, outlining the principles of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This document laid the foundation for Bitcoin and sparked a movement that would eventually disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nWithin the white paper, Nakamoto proposed a solution to the long-standing problem of double-spending in digital currencies. By utilizing a decentralized network of nodes, Nakamoto's concept allowed for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This breakthrough idea paved the way for the creation of a new financial system that operates independently of any central authority.\n\nFurthermore, the white paper introduced the concept of mining, which is the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are verified. This innovative incentive mechanism not only ensures the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network but also incentivizes individuals to participate in its maintenance.\n\nWhy Bitcoin White Paper Day Matters\n\nBitcoin White Paper Day matters because it highlights the importance of Satoshi Nakamoto's groundbreaking ideas. The white paper introduced several key concepts that have since become fundamental to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including decentralization, immutability, and cryptographic security. By revisiting the white paper, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the technological innovations that underpin Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralization, one of the core principles outlined in the white paper, is a key feature that distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional financial systems. Instead of relying on a central authority, such as a government or a bank, Bitcoin operates on a network of nodes spread across the globe. This decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the currency, making it resistant to censorship and protocol manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmutability is another crucial aspect introduced in the white paper. Once a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain, it becomes nearly impossible to alter or tamper with. This property provides a high level of security and trust, as it eliminates the need for intermediaries to validate transactions. The immutability of the blockchain has far-reaching implications beyond finance, with potential applications in supply chain management, timestamping systems, and intellectual property rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptographic security is the foundation upon which Bitcoin's trustless system is built. The white paper explains the concept of public-key cryptography, which allows users to securely transact with each other without revealing sensitive information. By utilizing cryptographic algorithms, Bitcoin ensures that only the intended recipient can access the funds, providing a level of privacy and security that traditional payment systems often lack.\n\nBitcoin White Paper Day serves as a reminder of the transformative power of ideas. It encourages us to reflect on the impact of Nakamoto's white paper and the subsequent developments in the Bitcoin space. As we celebrate this day, let us continue to explore the possibilities that Bitcoin offers and strive to build a more inclusive and decentralized financial future.\n\nThe Evolution of Bitcoin Since the White Paper\n\nSince the release of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, the industry has experienced a remarkable journey of growth and adoption, revolutionizing the financial world irreparably. In a recent op-ed from Technical Editor Shinobi, Bitcoin Magazine took a look at the latest white paper releases from just this past year, including BitVM, Ark, Zerosync, CivKit and more.\n\nCommemorating Bitcoin White Paper Day\n\nBitcoin White Paper Day is an opportunity to celebrate the revolutionary technology that has transformed the world of finance. It also provides a chance to reflect on the continued relevance of the Bitcoin white paper and the enduring impact it has had on our society.\n\nWays to Commemorate Bitcoin White Paper Day\n\nThere are several meaningful ways to commemorate Bitcoin White Paper Day. One can organize local meetups, attend virtual conferences, or participate in educational initiatives to spread awareness about the importance of the white paper. Additionally, contributing to open-source projects or engaging in discussions about the future of blockchain technology can be a valuable way to celebrate this special day.\n\nThe Continued Relevance of Bitcoin's White Paper\n\nAlthough over a decade has passed since the release of the Bitcoin white paper, its relevance remains intact. As new use cases for blockchain technology emerge and the world becomes increasingly digital, the principles and ideas presented in the white paper continue to guide the development and progress of digital assets. By acknowledging the continued importance of the white paper, we recognize the enduring legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto and the profound impact of their visionary creation.\n\nAs we celebrate this day, let us not only reflect on the past but also look forward to the promising future of Bitcoin.\n\nNews Recap of the Week (October 30 - November 3)\n\nSam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been found guilty on all 7 counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and a handful of other charges.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Ordinals transaction volume surged to its highest levels since May on Tuesday, as about $14.7 million worth of the Bitcoin-based assets traded hands, as of this writing, according to a Dune dashboard created by the pseudonymous on-chain data analyst Domo.\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals enables the creation of NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol lets people assign data to an individual satoshi\u2014equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin\u2014whether that's art, profile pictures, or text.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of trading volume on Tuesday took place on the cryptocurrency exchange OKX, per Domo\u2019s dashboard. The Seychelles-based exchange rolled out trading support for Ordinals in May and accounted for 6,100 or 60% of daily Ordinals transactions, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Domo\u2019s dashboard does not reflect recent activity on Binance. Crypto\u2019s leading exchange by volume initially rolled out support for image-based Ordinals in May too, but it began letting customers trade ORDI, the first-ever BRC-20 token, on Tuesday.\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin-based token\u2019s price has increased 124% over the past day to $13.21, more than doubling its initial price on Binance\u2019s platform of $5.91, according to the exchange\u2019s website. Across all exchanges, $471 million ORDI has traded hands over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn addition to renewed interest from Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb toward $35,000, Charlie Spears of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies told Decrypt that Binance\u2019s move to support ORDI \u201csent everything flying\u201d that\u2019s related to Ordinals, whether that resembles a fungible token or JPEG.\n\n\u201cBinance alone dwarfs that of the entire Ordinals trading volume across all marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the fungible token side of Ordinals, and then you have the NFT, JPEG side of Ordinals, and they tend to go in tandem.\u201d\n\nPioneered by the aforementioned Domo, BRC-20 tokens take inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard, which is used across a plethora of tokens, such as Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. Domo issued the first BRC-20 token, ORDI, initially as an experiment in March.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nOrdinals creator Casey Rodarmor took to Twitter to address Binance\u2019s support of ORDI, clarifying the token\u2019s connection to the protocol. He said the exchange mistakenly called Domo\u2019s token \u201cOrdinals\u201d and incorrectly linked to ordinals.com as ORDI\u2019s \u201cOfficial Website.\u201d\n\n\u201cORDI is not associated with the Ordinals project,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cI hope this gets fixed soon.\u201d\n\nI hope this gets fixed soon. ORDI is not associated with the Ordinals project, The Open Ordinals Institute, or The Ordicord. Those links should be removed, and the token should not be named \"Ordinals\". The name of the token is ORDI. If anyone has any contacts at Binance they\u2026 https://t.co/vR9cneIPBk \u2014 Casey (@rodarmor) November 7, 2023\n\nThe uptick in Ordinals transaction volume also comes as the NFT market shows signs of life. While the industry found itself in the crosshairs of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d during a segment dedicated to NFTs on Sunday night, NFT trading volume hit a three-month high the following day.\n\nIn May, Ordinals activity sparked concern among some Bitcoiners, as transaction fees climbed to at least 654 sat/vB, or around $26, for high-priority transactions. On Tuesday, high-priority transactions commanded a rate of 98 sat/vB, or around $5, according to mempool.space.\n\nInfluential NFT firms like Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs have leveraged Ordinals to mint art on Bitcoin, but the protocol\u2019s momentum was bolstered in the first half of this year by fervor for BRC-20s. With Binance\u2019s move, that continues to be the case, Spears said.\n\n\u201cWe were losing momentum from the BRC-20 mayhem that peaked in May and kind of subsided into August,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the BRC-20s go flying when one gets listed on Binance, then it has knock-off effects to the broader Bitcoin NFT ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum on Thursday as the oldest crypto asset hit a 17-month high after the Fed's dovish tone. Crypto tokens posted big gains following the completion of one year of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire- FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin was trading in red as the largest crypto token edged marginally lower, less than half-a-per cent but remained below 35,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in green, slightly up and hovered around $1,900-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with decent gains.\n\nBitcoin kept on trading in a very narrow range of less than 2 per cent movement in the last 24 hours. It has now been close to two weeks. Although this means volumes in Bitcoin worldwide have started to slightly drop, any movement in its prices should mean the volumes are back in, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\"While BTC has been rising for a few weeks now, the ETH/BTC pair has seemed to find a little support around the 0.05 BTC per ETH mark. The little bounce back has helped other prominent altcoins as well to show some momentum on the upside price action,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin BLUR (+18.1%) has seen a positive price action in the last 24 hours. This could be as investors speculate it to be the world\u2019s biggest NFT marketplace by trading volumes, especially after Opensea downsized by letting go of 50% of its staff recently\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday. Chainlink was up 6 per cent, while Toncoin surged more than 5 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon rose 4 per cent each, while Cardano and BNB added over 3 per cent each. Among the laggards, Tron was down a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading modestly higher, rising up to $1.33 trillion-mark, as it rose marginally in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes increased more than 6 per cent to $40.46 billion.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, both BTC and ETH remained steady, while altcoins saw a rise of 5-10 per cent. This was accompanied by a decline in BTC dominance. Bitcoin is currently positioned between important support at $34,000 and resistance at $36,000, while Ethereum still has to clear a significant resistance level around $2,000, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\"The market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, reached nearly $400 billion, marking a positive sign for the crypto space. It's worth noting that tomorrow, on November 8, 2023, Fed Chair Powell will deliver a speech, which could potentially introduce some market volatility,\" he said.\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph(GRT) is an indexing protocol, catering to data querying needs in networks such as Ethereum and IPFS. It plays a pivotal role in numerous applications within the DeFi sector and the larger Web3 ecosystem. Currently, GRT extends its support to the indexing of data from Ethereum, IPFS, and POA, with plans to include additional networks in the near future.\n\nImage: Chart-Graph\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the GRT/USDT chart had been traversing within an ascending triangle pattern. The trend has bounced back from the bottom and is fast approaching the upper trendline with twice its average trading volumes. We could expect the momentum to continue into the coming weeks. The next resistance is expected at 0.17 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 0.12 USDT.\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Why 2023 is a good year to buy Bitcoin - Premium Times",
        "content": "2023 is an excellent year to invest in Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency\u2019s value has increased exponentially since its launch. In 2021, Bitcoin hit the highest value of around $66,000, drawing many investors\u2019 attention. However, its value has dropped since then, crossing a psychological threshold of $30,000 in April.\n\nCurrently, cryptocurrency specialists and financial technology experts project that Bitcoin\u2019s value will grow towards the end of 2023. Some predict that the price will increase as more people gradually see Bitcoin as an alternative to conventional banking. And this has affected Bitcoin adoption positively.\n\nMoreover, platforms like immediate alpha are getting more people seeking to register to trade Bitcoin with fiat money. That shows that Bitcoin\u2019s value will likely increase in the following years.\n\nShould You Buy Bitcoin Now?\n\nFor various reasons, many experts predict that Bitcoin will eventually become a high-potential and promising cryptocurrency. First, Bitcoin is already a popular cryptocurrency and a precious investment for many people.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin employs modern technology that enhances the security of its transactions. This cryptocurrency has an ecosystem comprising developers, investors, and traders supporting its growth. Moreover, Bitcoin is among the fastest-growing digital currencies worldwide. These are the primary reasons Bitcoin has vast potential and the motivation to invest in it.\n\nBenefits of Buying Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is undoubtedly a promising and exciting investment. Its price can rise substantially, especially after 2024\u2019s halving event. Additionally, you may enjoy significant tax benefits for holding Bitcoin. But bear in mind that Bitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile. Therefore, research is vital before buying Bitcoin in 2023. Here\u2019s how you can benefit from purchasing this cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin has a powerful and innovative blockchain technology underpinning it. And this enables it to attract more investors, increasing its value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mover advantage makes it a preference for many merchants, investors, and traders. Thus, you will have an easier time selling your Bitcoins.\n\nIts value has increased significantly over the years. And this trend will likely continue as miners new the supply limit of 21 million digital coins.\n\nBitcoin provides greater flexibility enabling users to transfer and receive funds anywhere without intermediaries.\n\nTransacting with Bitcoin is safe because its underlying technology encrypts transactions and makes them irreversible.\n\nBuying and using Bitcoin is straightforward because most crypto exchanges accept and allow people to trade it.\n\nThe number of merchants that accept Bitcoin increases by the day. That means you can purchase items or pay for services with Bitcoin at many locations. Moreover, investing in Bitcoin enables you to diversify your investment portfolio. That\u2019s because Bitcoin has shown the ability to withstand economic turmoil as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCan You Buy Bitcoin Free of Charge?\n\nYes. Several crypto exchanges allow you to purchase Bitcoin by signing up and loading your account with fiat money. However, check the terms and conditions of the crypto exchange you choose. For instance, check the amount you will pay when withdrawing your money after selling Bitcoin. Additionally, check the acceptable payment method. Take the time to study the terms and conditions of the crypto exchange to know the risks and fees you\u2019ll face when using the platform to buy Bitcoin.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve bought your Bitcoins, transfer them to your crypto wallet. Also, implement appropriate strategies for safeguarding the Bitcoins in your digital wallet. If you invest your Bitcoins via an investment fund, study it to ensure you will get reasonable returns.\n\nParting Shot\n\nSeveral factors influence Bitcoin\u2019s price, including the halving event, investor sentiments, and government regulations. However, many experts predict this cryptocurrency\u2019s value will increase, especially before or after the halving event. So, now might be the best time to buy Bitcoin. Nevertheless, research the crypto industry and ensure you understand Bitcoin. Also, use safe storage for the Bitcoin you purchase to ensure you do not lose your hard-earned money.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Several ex-Cantor Fitzgerald executives started a crypto lending platform with the expectation that it will serve operators of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds once they gain US regulatory approval.\n\nDigital Prime Technologies\u2019 Tokenet already lets clients including Xapo Bank lend out digital assets to others, such as EDX Clearing and global institutional credit network Hidden Road Partners, the Jersey City, New Jersey-based company said Tuesday. The setup offers risk-management tools and a chat functionality that lets users manage loans.\n\nThe firm joins a slew of exchanges and other companies, such as Swan Bitcoin, who are launching products to fill a void left by the demise of crypto lenders Genesis, Celsius, BlockFi and others. The crypto lending industry\u2019s collapse last year left market participants with a dearth of options, and helped depress trading volumes into 2023.\n\nThe launch also coincides with rising optimism that an ETF holding Bitcoin directly will be approved in the US within months. If that happens, Digital Prime expects ETF issuers will have a huge thirst for borrowing Bitcoin, and will jump start the fledging crypto-lending industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rebirth of crypto lending,\u201d James Runnels, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview.\n\nFor example, if authorized participants need to create new inventory in the ETF, but Bitcoin\u2019s price suddenly jumps, they may chose to borrow the cryptocurrency, instead \u2014 and to buy it later at a lower price, Runnels said.\n\nWith ETFs, specialized traders known as authorized participants can work with an issuer to create shares when demand is building. When buyers\u2019 appetites cool, participants redeem those shares with the fund\u2019s sponsor to reduce the supply, keeping the ETF\u2019s price in line with its net-asset value.\n\nRunnels was a managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald, while Digital Prime\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Bob Sherry was COO for Prime Services at Cantor until 2018. Glen Garofalo, head of margin and risk solutions, was managing director of prime services, head of margin, at Cantor, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nDigital Prime\u2019s DLCC Prime subsidiary received Financial Industry Regulatory Authority membership last year, and can operate as a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Digital Prime received its seed funding from investors including TD Cowen Inc.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."
