        "content": "Northwestern Engineering\u2019s Dongning Guo was awarded the 2023 Bitcoin Research Prize at the Chaincode Labs Bitcoin Research Day event, held October 27 in New York City.\n\nThe winning paper, \u201cBitcoin's Latency\u2014Security Analysis Made Simple,\u201d published in the Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Conference on Advances in Financial Technologies in September 2022, is coauthored by Ling Ren, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nGuo is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and (by courtesy) computer science in the McCormick School of Engineering. He is a member of the Communications and Networking (Commnet) Laboratory and the Institute for Data, Econometrics, Algorithms, and Learning (IDEAL).\n\n\u201cFor the past decade, I've been fascinated with Bitcoin and its profound implications on the monetary system, decentralization, and the concept of economic freedom for the masses. Several years ago, I took some risk to pursue this new research area with my PhD student, Jing Li, and later started collaborating with Dr. Ling Ren,\u201d Guo said. \u201cThis prize stands as a deeply gratifying testament to the contribution my co-author, Dr. Ling Ren, and I have made to the field.\u201d\n\nSponsored by Bitcoin research and development center Chaincode Labs, the Bitcoin Research Prize recognizes outstanding research papers \u2014 in domains including cryptography, theoretical computer science, network theory, and economics \u2014 that advance Bitcoin and the Lightning Network payment protocol. An award committee selects the annual winning paper based on its research impact. Eligible papers must be published in a peer-reviewed venue after January 2019.\n\n\u201cThe collaboration with Ling was filled with technical twists and turns and an abundance of enjoyable moments as we overcame one challenge after another,\u201d Guo said. \u201cI consider myself exceptionally fortunate to have had the opportunity to elucidate a fundamental property of Bitcoin and the underlying Nakamoto consensus protocol through the elegance of a theorem.\u201d\n\nGuo explained that, by design, the decentralized Bitcoin mining network allows users to join or leave at any time. Incentivized by mining rewards, honest miners run protocols to validate the transaction information in a blockchain block. Each transaction is approved or rejected by the network via consensus mechanisms.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for the ledger to fork into competing blockchains that disagree about recent transactions, but the deeper a transaction is in a longest blockchain, the more likely that all honest miners reach consensus about it,\u201d Guo said.\n\nGuo and Ren\u2019s paper resolved a fundamental latency-security trade-off by providing a pair of closed-form formulas to upper- and lower-bound the safety of a transaction as a function of the confirmation depth, the mining rates, and a network delay parameter.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Research Day event, Guo introduced a follow-up result that further tightens the upper and lower bounds. He is currently working with a graduate student on the question of whether the gap between the bounds can be eliminated.\n\n\u201cWe aim to pin down exactly what is the worst possible attack to Bitcoin and similar systems,\u201d Guo said."

        "content": "Bitcoin miners are making the world even worse.\n\nNew Book Tuesday is the best day of the week Chez Auffhammer. Especially when there is a new Michael Lewis release in the pile. Going Infinite describes the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of Alameda Research and the Crypto exchange FTX. Lewis got unprecedented access to Bankman-Fried and in nail-biting fashion describes one of the bigger implosions in finance history. I complained about crypto in 2018, but had sort of lost interest. Severin had pondered grid stability and crypto mining in another post. But this book made me wonder how the ole mining business is doing.\n\nGPUs are amazing things. They are gadgets that allow you to do massive amounts of computations in parallel, but they consume an enormous amount of power and generate significant heat! I moved mine into a refrigerated basement across campus, as my office resembled a sauna. And no, I am not mining crypto. I am using these gadgets to figure out climate impacts.\n\nSo in my recent reading journey across the nerdverse, I came across a piece by Anna Papp, Doug Almond and Shuang Zhang called \u201cBitcoin and Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Evidence from Daily Production Decisions\u201d. The first thing I learned is that the US overtook China in 2021 as the number one location for cryptomining, since China banned mining for crypto. Some US states even went as far as providing significant incentives for miners to locate within their borders, which reminds of an older literature on jurisdictional competition. You might think that this is a good thing, as on average, the grid here is cleaner than in China.\n\nTurns out things are trickier than they appear. What really matters is how much actual mining is done and how the electricity used to mine is generated. You might think that these miners just buy from the grid, so we should think about this issue the same way we think about plugging in an EV and contemplating which type of power is at the margin.\n\nThe paper shows a worrying case study of the Scrubgrass Power plant in Kennerdell, Pennsylvania. This is the type of plant you want to phase out if you care about mother earth. It burns waste coal and is relatively inefficient. It\u2019s a literal dumpster fire. It was on its way to be phased out (yay) until a cryptominer bought it and moved in their GPUs. Yes, you read that right. This is a power plant that generates electricity and mines crypto on site. In the alternate crypto free universe, this power plant would have been mothballed.\n\nSo is this bad? This is where the paper gets interesting. The cryptobros have all kinds of delusional stories about why this currency is making the world a better place. This paper is a pretty powerful counterexample. What they do is look at the price of crypto, which we observe, and look at what happens to the emissions at Scrubgrass. They have thousands of price movements and observe emissions (since the plant has Continuous Emissions Monitoring System, CEMS). These serious scholars think carefully through issues that might confound the effect of price on emissions and I am convinced by what they find.\n\nAre you ready? They find a long-run price elasticity of 0.33-0.40 and a bigger short-run elasticity of 0.69-0.71. What does that mean Max? If you take the most recent estimate of the social cost of carbon of $190 a ton, this implies that a $1 increase in daily Bitcoin price leads to an additional $3.11-$6.79 worth of daily damages from carbon emissions at Scrubgrass. Year to date the price of Bitcoin has gone up almost $20,000, so their results imply large emissions increases.\n\nDo I really need to point out that this is really dumb and something that should not be allowed to happen? Miners are creating value which they get to deposit in their bank accounts, while the rest of us pay $3-6 for each dollar they make. This is \u201cI literally spit out my coffee when I read that abstract\u201d stupid. So what do we do?\n\nTwo things. Price carbon. Globally. Not gonna happen just yet (although I am curious what will happen when the Trump tax cuts expire), or follow China in banning the mining of crypto domestically. If we don\u2019t like bans, at least prevent these firms from buying old dirty power plants. If the estimates from this paper are right, then it might make sense to buy these out using public funds and mothball them. That would sure beat turning them into carbon mines. And along the way, it might help discourage scaling up cryptononsense.\n\nKeep up with Energy Institute blogs, research, and events on X @energyathaas\n\nSuggested citation: Auffhammer, Maximilian, \u201cSaving Coal \u2013 One Bitcoin at a Time\u201d, Energy Institute Blog, UC Berkeley, October 30, 2023, https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2023/10/30/saving-coal-one-bitcoin-at-a-time/"

        "title": "Where is the bitcoin ATM market headed? | Commentary - Kiosk Marketplace",
        "content": "What's driving the bitcoin ATM market? There are several factors to consider including security and accessibility. However, there are also issues holding it back. Let's take a look at both.\n\n(Editor's note: An earlier version of this article ran on ATM Marketplace, a sister publication of Automation & Self-Service, Kiosk Marketplace and Vending Times.)\n\nBitcoin ATMs have quickly become a ubiquitous staple in many retail spaces. You can find them in places ranging from gas stations to supermarkets. In fact, there are now more than 37,000 machines in operation worldwide, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere are multiple factors driving this growth, including accessibility.\n\n\"Bitcoin ATMs are still a popular investing avenue for consumers because they offer accessibility in an industry that otherwise still has high barriers to entry,\" Gabriella Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association, said in an email interview. \"As more people become interested in buying crypto with cash, the easy-to-use, familiar technology allows consumers to securely expand and diversify their portfolio. Bitcoin ATMs offer a safe alternative to buying cryptocurrency, taking various steps to mitigate fraud risk and implement safeguards for investors. As the demand for bitcoin ATMs continues to grow, we will likely continue to see them placed everywhere from bustling cities to quiet suburbs.\"\n\nRetailer benefits\n\nBitcoin ATMs are also easier to use on the retailer's side as well, while also providing a profit.\n\n\"The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency varies from country to country, but in many places, there are few restrictions on bitcoin ATMs. This has made it easier for operators to set up new machines and expand their networks,\" Mark Fidelman, founder of SmartBlocks, said in an email interview. \"Bitcoin ATMs can be a profitable business for operators, as they often charge a percentage fee on transactions. As more people use bitcoin ATMs, the potential for profits increases, which can encourage more investment in the market.\"\n\nThe security side is also important as users can more easily make transactions on bitcoin ATMs and ensure the cryptocurrency stays on their own wallets, rather than having to go through an online exchange.\n\n\"Some people prefer to use bitcoin ATMs for the privacy they offer. Unlike some online exchanges, bitcoin ATMs do not require users to provide personal information, which can be appealing to those who want to keep their transactions anonymous,\" Fidelman said.\n\nChallenges remain\n\nHowever, there are also some issues within the bitcoin ATM industry. For one, the growth of bitcoin ATMs has slowed down significantly \u2014 in some cases many bitcoin ATMs have been removed. On Feb. 28, for example, there was a net reduction of 1,061 bitcoin ATMs. In addition, the speed of installations has dropped, currently sitting at around three deployed per day, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to why the market is being held back. One is that despite it being simpler than some cryptocurrency companies, there is still a lack of regulatory clarity.\n\n\"While the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency is generally becoming more favorable, there is still a lack of clarity in some jurisdictions regarding the legality and regulation of bitcoin ATMs. This can create uncertainty for operators and potential users of the machines,\" Fidelman said.\n\nOne example of this is the recent push by the Financial Conduct Authority of the U.K. to crack down on unregistered crypto ATMs. The authority is claiming cryptocurrency ATMs in the country are not registered, which can lead to money laundering. In the U.K., all cryptocurrency companies must register with the FCA.\n\nFidelman said other factors holding back the industry include limited acceptance of cryptocurrency, high transaction fees and security concerns.\n\nBankruptcy raises concern\n\nThere is also the issue of a major bankruptcy in the industry. Recently, Cash Cloud, an operator of Coin Cloud ATMs, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The company was in debt for an amount between $100 million and $500 million.\n\n\"The recent bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a bitcoin ATM operator, has raised concerns about the overall health of the bitcoin ATM industry. Some industry experts suggest that the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud may be an indicator of a larger issue in the bitcoin ATM market,\" Fidelman said.\n\n\"The industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, with many operators lacking the experience, financial backing, or business acumen needed to succeed in a competitive market. Furthermore, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is often uncertain, presenting challenges to bitcoin ATM operators. However, despite the challenges, the bitcoin ATM market has continued to grow in recent years, with an increasing number of machines being deployed worldwide, and more people using them to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Thus, while the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud has raised concerns, some analysts view it as an isolated incident, rather than a reflection of broader issues in the industry.\"\n\nEducation needed\n\nLastly, a major issue that needs to be addressed is educating the public on cryptocurrency. While it has become more mainstream, many businesses are unaware of the benefits of deploying a bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"Despite industry shakeups, investors are still interested in crypto but often don't know where to start,\" Kusz said. \"Even though bitcoin ATMs employ simple to use technology, companies still need to offer guidance and education within the crypto space to ensure that new investors are making educated decisions that align with their financial goals. In providing two-way communication and trustworthy customer support, companies can encourage return customers and increase participation in the DeFi community.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past seven days, Bitcoin (BTC -3.16%) is up a head-spinning 20%, making it one of the best weeks for the world's most popular cryptocurrency in nearly two years. And, as might be expected, that sizzling recent performance has energized the Bitcoin bulls, who are now predicting that it could be on one of its historic runs as we head into 2024.\n\nAnd that's exactly what has me so concerned. The market could be overheating, pulling in a lot of unsuspecting investors who are hoping to make a quick profit from a rapid price appreciation in the token. As Warren Buffett once remarked, \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful.\" Of course, Buffett (who famously does not invest in Bitcoin) was talking about stock, not cryptocurrencies, when he made that comment, but it's a useful way to think about what's happening right now with Bitcoin.\n\nPay attention to the Fear & Greed Index\n\nWarren Buffett's insight into investor psychology and market sentiment is why I'm keeping a careful eye on Bitcoin's Fear & Greed Index, which suddenly shifted into \"greed\" territory this week. In fact, the Fear & Greed Index is at its highest greed level since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000 back in November 2021. Back then, Bitcoin was hitting stratospheric new highs every day, and investors were convinced that the upward trajectory would continue forever. But if you were tracking the Fear & Greed Index, then you knew that there were obvious warning signs, and that the chances for a crypto market correction were increasing.\n\nThe Fear & Greed index is one of my favorite tools for gauging sentiment in the crypto market, primarily because it is so easy to track and understand. There are several different versions of this index, but the one that I use can be found displayed at the top of the homepage of CoinMarketCap. That Fear & Greed index ranges from 0 to 100. The closer the index is to zero, the more likely there is \"extreme fear\" in the market, and the closer the index is to 100, the more likely that there is \"extreme greed\" in the market. Right now, the index stands at 72, which is right at the boundary of \"greed\" and \"extreme greed.\"\n\nFinding value in the crypto market\n\nOf course, the Fear & Greed Index can't tell you whether or not to buy a certain cryptocurrency. It only offers an insight into the broad state of crypto investor psychology at a certain point in time. The more fear there is in the marketplace, the greater the chance that inventors will be dumping every token they own, which can lead to some bargain investment opportunities. The more greed there is in the marketplace, the greater the chance that investors are irrationally bidding up certain cryptocurrencies, increasing the chances for a market correction.\n\nIf used properly, the Fear & Greed Index can be a useful tool for determining if cryptocurrencies are undervalued or overvalued at any point in time. However, as Buffett suggested with his comment, this requires a certain amount of contrarian thinking. The knee-jerk reaction, of course, is to buy as much Bitcoin as you can if the price of Bitcoin is going up. However, the fact that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was in the mid 50s a week ago and has suddenly surged up into the low 70s could be a warning signal that those buying today are overpaying for Bitcoin. In other words, the price of Bitcoin could be overheating.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin?\n\nOne way to take fear and greed out of the investment equation is by adopting a strategy such as dollar-cost averaging, which is a commitment to buy fixed dollar amounts of an asset on a recurring schedule, regardless of the price of that asset. Thus, for example, you might commit to buying $50 of Bitcoin each week, regardless of whether its price is going up or going down. This prevents you from becoming too fearful or too greedy.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should only buy Bitcoin if you believe that its long-term growth prospects justify a very high valuation. If you are only buying Bitcoin because everyone else is buying Bitcoin, then you are probably doing it all wrong. Remember: The goal is to buy low and sell high. If you are getting too greedy, you might end up buying high and selling low."

Getty Images\n\nVanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC that the firm will not be pursuing a bitcoin ETF.\n\nRival asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are waiting to get their applications approved.\n\nExcitement over a possible spot bitcoin ETF fueled the largest weekly inflow into digital assets since July 2022.\n\nNot all of Wall Street is planning on pursuing a spot bitcoin ETF, even as optimism rises on the regulatory pathway to create one.\n\nWhile asset management rivals such as BlackRock and Fidelity have applications pending, Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC on Friday that his firm has no plans to follow suit.\n\n\"We won't be pursuing a bitcoin ETF. It's just like we don't use gold as an asset class for our clients,\" he said. \"It's not that people can't invest in there. We just look at asset classes or, you know, what belongs in a long-term portfolio, what has intrinsic value, has cash flows to it? And those are the asset classes we steer people towards. And so we don't go towards bitcoin or gold or any other of those stable assets.\"\n\nA spokesman later told Insider that Vanguard views the investment case for cryptocurrencies as weak.\n\n\"Unlike stocks and bonds, most cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends,\" he said. \"Further, cryptocurrencies have proven to be highly volatile, which runs counter to Vanguard's goal to generate positive real returns to investors over time.\"\n\nCurrently, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application remains under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the regulator allows bitcoin futures ETFs, it has been largely critical of the cryptocurrency sphere, and has previously denied such applications.\n\nBut in August, Grayscale Investments won its court case against the SEC, which had earlier rejected an application to turn its over-the-counter traded bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe court decision raised hopes that the regulatory obstacles would be cleared, allowing for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF soon.\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for a potential spot bitcoin ETF continues to grow on Wall Street. Earlier this month, crypto-bull Mike Novogratz told CNBC that it would make zero sense for an ETF to be blocked.\n\nMarkets are also demonstrating a readiness, and inflows into digital asset funds have jumped to their highest weekly level since July 2022.\n\nAccording to the latest Coin Shares report, digital asset investment inflows hit $326 million for the week, with bitcoin making up 90%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "The U.S. government on Friday published an application by crypto giant Grayscale to launch an Ethereum ETF for the spot market. Grayscale first applied for the ETF in early October, but the petition\u2019s appearance on the Federal Reserve is significant because it starts a 240-day clock by which the Securities and Exchange Commission must respond.\n\nThe start of the Ethereum ETF process also coincides with a surge in crypto prices this month that analysts believe is correlated to impending decisions by the SEC on a batch of Bitcoin ETF applications by Grayscale, BlackRock, and others.\n\nSince the start of October, Bitcoin prices have jumped around 27% while Ethereum has climbed 7%.\n\nMany in the crypto industry believe the approval of ETF products, which make it easy for retail investors to buy various assets in the form of shares, will result in a flood of new liquidity into the markets.\n\nWhile Grayscale has sought to launch a Bitcoin ETF for years, the SEC has rebuffed these efforts, leading the company to sue the agency last year. In late August, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a unanimous and resounding decision that opened the door to widespread expectations that the SEC would issue an approval soon.\n\nMany industry watchers have circled early January for when the SEC is likely to grant approval, in part because that will coincide with another \u201cshot clock\u201d deadline for a Bitcoin ETF application by the crypto hedge fund Ark Invest.\n\nWhile Ark is currently at the head of the approval queue, it remains to be seen if the SEC will approve its application first or instead approve a larger batch of applicants all at once. It\u2019s also possible, though unlikely, the agency will find a new pretext to delay or not approve the Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe process has been slow and convoluted in part because it involves a two-part approval\u2014one to permit exchanges to list crypto ETFs, and a separate one for individual companies to issue the ETFs.\n\nIn a quirk of the regulatory process, the SEC has approved futures ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While these are also crypto ETFs, the underlying assets they contain are not digital assets but instead futures contracts that are well understood only by investors well-versed in derivatives.\n\nIn response to a request for comment about the ETF application, a company spokeswoman said: \u201cThe filing reflects Grayscale\u2019s ongoing commitment to converting its entire family of crypto investment products to ETFs.\u201d"

Responding to strong speculation that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management firm, is preparing to \u201cseed\u201d its iShares Bitcoin ETF this month with an unknown amount of capital in anticipation of its imminent approval, investors bid up the price of the digital asset this week to more than $35,000, a price we haven\u2019t seen in nearly a year and a half. That\u2019s roughly double what Bitcoin started the year at. For comparison\u2019s sake, Ether, the second largest digital token by market cap, is up around 50% year-to-date.\n\nInvestors Seeking Direct Access to Bitcoin\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are already available to certain investors. Canada has had them for years. Europe launched its first one in August. But even when combined, Canada and Europe are dwarfed by the size of the U.S. stock market, which accounts for close to 60% of the total global equity market value. Of the top 10 largest investment management firms, only two\u2014France\u2019s Credit Agricole and Germany\u2019s Allianz\u2014are non-American.\n\nTo date, the only way for U.S. investors to get exposure to Bitcoin\u2014besides buying the asset outright\u2014is through futures, options and other derivatives. The largest of these products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has been trading publicly since 2015 and currently has over $21 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBut trusts are unwieldy products compared to ETFs, which are traded on exchanges throughout the day and can be highly liquid.\n\nPlus, investors want access to spot Bitcoin prices, just as they have access to spot gold prices with physical gold-backed ETFs.\n\nGrayscale knows all of this, of course, which is why it\u2019s filed to convert GBTC to an ETF. And now, like BlackRock and a number of other firms that have also submitted applications for a Bitcoin ETF\u2014they include Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree\u2014Grayscale must play the waiting game at a time when many market experts are concerned that the U.S. could be falling behind other jurisdictions when it comes to Bitcoin investment, not to mention regulation.\n\nSome firms are choosing to act now. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, which also has a Bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, has begun selling shares of GBTC in anticipation of its successful conversion into an ETF.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of a U.S. Spot ETF\n\nSo what are the implications?\n\nAssuming for the moment that the SEC is in fact ready to give its blessing to a BlackRock-issued Bitcoin ETF, it\u2019s possible we may never see the token below $30,000 again. In such a scenario, the New York-based investment firm would likely become the world\u2019s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, creating a potential supply crunch. Remember, Bitcoin production is capped at 21 million, and the \u201chalving\u201d\u2014when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half\u2014is coming up in around six months.\n\nThe availability of a Bitcoin ETF would also finally herald the arrival of institutional investors. For many financial advisors, fiduciaries and others, Bitcoin is not an approved wealth management strategy. A spot ETF, on the other hand, would be.\n\nAccording to estimates made by blockchain and digital asset company Galaxy, a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF would attract $14 billion in investor inflows in the first year alone. This would accelerate to $27 billion in the second year and, at the end of the third year following its launch, nearly $40 billion.\n\nThis is only an estimate, and no one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But for speculators, accumulating Bitcoin now\u2014before an ETF hits the U.S. market\u2014may end up being a very profitable decision.\n\nCertainty in an Uncertain World\n\nI\u2019m pleased to report that enthusiasm was very high at the ECB, held in beautiful Barcelona. It was the most well-attended event in the conference\u2019s history, with some 5,000 people in attendance\u2014double the turnout from earlier this year.\n\nDespite it being a blockchain/Web3/DeFi conference, Bitcoin was the $35,000 gorilla in the room. As a number of presenters said, the asset offers certainty in a highly uncertain world. This tracks with my recent comments that Bitcoin represents private property rights and, more broader, human rights.\n\nWith a spot ETF looking more and more likely, now could be an unprecedented opportunity to get exposure. Remember, however, to do your own due diligence and keep in mind that volatility is much greater than what you find in traditional investment instruments. For that reason, I recommend a weighting of no more than 2% of your total portfolio.\n\nAll opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

        "title": "Worst Kind of Mining for the Environment? It Might Be Bitcoin. - DISCOVER Magazine",
        "content": "Mining resources from our planet can take a devastating toll on the environment, both local and global. Even beyond this, using the resource could cause disastrous effects to our planet and dependence on a single resource can wreak havoc on a country's economy. Yet, many of these resources are needed for our daily life -- sometimes as a luxury, sometimes as a necessity. Any responsible country or company should always take pause to consider what impact mining of any kind can have on the planet.\n\nIt turns out that these days, one type of mining might be the worst for Earth's environment: bitcoins. Yes, the \"mining\" of virtual currency makes its mark on the our planet. The unequal distribution of Bitcoin mining across the globe means that some countries are making a much large dent into the planet's climate and environment than others ... all for a \"resource\" that is far from necessary for our society.\n\nBitcoin mining using a lot of computing power to solve the crypographic puzzles that lie at the heart of the industry. As of today (October 30, 2023), each Bitcoin is worth over $34,000 and with the multitude of other cryptocoins out there, using computers to unlock more can be a profitable endeavor. Almost half a trillion dollars of the global economy runs on these \"virtual currencies\".\n\nWhat is the Environmental Impact of Bitcoin Mining?\n\nRarely do people who mine Bitcoins stop to ponder the environmental impact of their \"extraction.\" A new study by Sanaz Chamanara and others in Earth's Future, a journal from the American Geophysical Union, lays out some of the startling numbers that come from Bitcoin mining.\n\nHere are some of the most eye-popping:\n\nIn 2020-21, Bitcoin mining consumed more electrical power than the country of Pakistan (population: 230 million).\n\nThe sources of this electrical power released over 85 megatons of carbon dioxide. That's the same as 190 natural gas power plants or ~5 Yellowstone calderas. This is based on the actual carbon dioxide emitted by the different styles of generation, so this isn't a maximum value.\n\nIf your power comes from hydropower, the loss of water from evaporation and other means led to Bitcoin mining consuming 1.65 cubic kilometers of fresh water. That's more than the domestic water use of over 330 million people in the rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf your power comes from biofuels, it takes almost 1,900 square kilometers of land to produce the source crops. That's the bigger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nThe biggest culprit for energy use for Bitcoin mining are not shocking: China and the United States. However, some of the other top ten power users are more of a surprise to many people: Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Iran, Ireland, Singapore. This means that 45% of all the power used to mine Bitcoins comes from the worst carbon dioxide emitted for energy generation, coal.\n\nIn many ways, the race for Bitcoin mining superiority has caused some countries to head directly towards calamity. Iran, a country already strapped for water, used over 19 million cubic meters of water for Bitcoin mining in 2020-21. That's nearly 20% of the country's domestic water use per year (in 2021), all going to energy production for Bitcoins.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoins rise, so does the power people use to mine it. As Chamanara and others point out, when Bitcoin prices spiked 400% in 2021, electric usage from Bitcoin mining also spiked 140%. If you live somewhere with an already-taxed electrical grid, this sort of change could easily use that grid over the edge.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Worth the Cost?\n\nWho exactly benefits from Bitcoin mining is unclear. Although corporations, banks and even some countries profess a desire to expand the use of Bitcoins and related virtual currencies, so far there is little evidence that they have looked at how amassing and exchanging these coins will impact the environment. Add on the impact that continuing (and growing) carbon dioxide emissions and water use of populations and our climate, you wonder why Bitcoin mining is allowed at all.\n\nThat is what is really boils down to: how much do we value our planet's climate and environment over amassing personal or corporate wealth? So many sectors of our economy have been trying to move to modes that are much less destructive, yet the emerging cryptocurrency markets are doing just the opposite. Instead, they have been exploiting the planet's resources no differently than putting a massive open pit mine in a National Forest or drilling for even more oil on the North Slope of Alaska.\n\nIt is up to the world's governments to decide if regulating Bitcoins like it regulates all traditional mining is needed. You can't just go and open your own mine in many countries without permission and an assessment of the impact that mine will have. It might be high time for the same guard rails be installed in the realm of Bitcoins."

        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 A controversial Bitcoin mine in Limestone must shut down by March 2026 after Washington County commissioners approved a proposed lawsuit settlement in a called meeting Monday.\n\n\u201cKnowing that it would come to an end would make us feel much better,\u201d Preston Holley, who lives across from the facility that opened in early 2021, told commissioners before they voted 13-2 in favor of the deal. Holley was one of five citizens who spoke during a public comment period and more than 40 who turned out for the meeting.\n\nHolley said the operation was brought to the community without their knowledge. He said it has affected many people living around the facility.\n\n\u201cFor myself and the neighbors around me, being at our own home has been changed tremendously,\u201d Holley said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go outside and hear the same things and see the same things that we looked for when we all built our homes out in the country in this beautiful place.\n\nOther people have had you know, loss of property value. They\u2019ve had real estate transactions to go bad as a result of this. And, you know, it definitely changed the way we live out in Limestone.\u201d\n\nThe Red Dog facility would close down even earlier if the company finds another location and starts operation there. According to Washington County zoning rules, no zoning districts currently allow cryptocurrency mining, so any local relocation would likely have to be in either Johnson City or Jonesborough.\n\nThe settlement also levies monetary fines against Red Dog and BrightRidge, the local utility that leases land and sells power to Red Dog and that was the initial defendant.\n\n\u201cTo set a date, not in the timeframe that we want them out because I would like to have seen them out yesterday or the day before or the day before, but this is an opportunity,\u201d Commissioner Josh Edens said before joining the 12 other commissioners who voted yes. \u201cNot the way we want it, but to see them out with a hard stop date that is enforceable by contract.\u201d\n\nThe settlement, already approved by BrightRidge and Red Dog\u2019s leadership, will now to go Washington County Chancery Court Judge John Rambo for approval.\n\nMayor Joe Grandy said the March 2026 date coincides with Red Dog\u2019s contract agreement with the TVA and BrightRidge.\n\n\u201cIt probably seems like a long time, but you got to realize they\u2019ve been operating out there for three years,\u201d Grandy said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re more than halfway through the contract period already. So this agreement will give a date certain at a maximum time that they will be shut down.\u201d\n\nHow we got here\n\nBrightRidge leased Red Dog property next to its substation on Bailey Bridge Road in the pastoral New Salem community in late 2020 after getting the property rezoned to A-3 (agriculture business) in February 2020. BrightRidge told county commissioners at that time it planned a \u201cblockchain data center\u201d but made no mention of another business or of a Bitcoin mine.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt about how or why we got here it\u2019s because of BrightRidge,\u201d Commissioner Freddie Malone said while commissioners discussed whether to accept the deal.\n\nCommissioner Marty Johnson (right) represents the district where the facility is and was one of two commissioners voting no. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nNeighbors began complaining of incessant loud noise at the site in May 2021, several months after Red Dog brought the mine to full capacity with $10 million of computer equipment that can use up to 25 megawatts of power. Red Dog is BrightRidge\u2019s largest customer.\n\nShortly after, commissioners learned Washington County\u2019s zoning administrator and attorney said the use didn\u2019t meet guidelines. The noise comes from high-powered fans used to cool the \u201cmine\u2019s\u201d computers, which perform complex equations in a race to \u201cunearth\u201d new coins of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nThey told BrightRidge to shut the mine down in September 2021. BrightRidge refused and said the county\u2019s issue was with Red Dog. Red Dog said they were simply operating under the terms of their lease with BrightRidge, which had gotten the rezoning in the first place.\n\nThe county sued BrightRidge in November 2021, claiming the Bailey Bridge Road site violated zoning rules and had been constructed without a permit. In June 2022, the county commission approved a settlement agreement that would have allowed Red Dog to build a new mine at the Washington County Industrial Park in Telford.\n\nCommissioners Larry England, Freddie Malone, and Suzy Williams. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nThat decision drew a backlash in a new community, and after seven new commissioners came on post-election last fall, they voted to back out of the still unfinalized settlement. Early this year, Washington County Chancellor John Rambo set a February 2024 trial date.\n\nSeveral commissioners expressed their dissatisfaction with some details of the proposal, including how long it allows Red Dog to operate \u2014 and BrightRidge to sell it massive amounts of electricity. But Jeff Ward, the attorney who has joined Washington County Attorney Allyson Wilkinson in representing the county, said additional costs were about to kick in as the case entered a new phase of document filings and pre-trial work.\n\nHe and Wilkinson also noted the possibility the county could lose the suit, despite Rambo already having ruled the operation did violate zoning rules \u2014 and they said if the county won, appeals would likely make it at least 2025 before the mine could conceivably shut down. That would be after substantial additional legal fees to the county.\n\nA number of commissioners registered their complaints about the length of time before Red Dog would have to shut down, and several questioned how enforceable the agreement would be. Ward said the fact that it would be viewed as a contract would make a judge likely to file an injunction to shut down the mine if Red Dog violated the terms.\n\n\u201cThe proposal being provided to you tonight is basically a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,\u201d Ward said.\n\n\u201cI know everybody would like to have more time, I know the citizens would like to have more time.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Jim Wheeler made a motion to approve, saying \u201cI think we have an opportunity here to settle this with a firm date and we have as much opportunity to enforce this as we do any other outcome I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nAttorney Jeff Ward addresses commissioners. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nSettlement details\n\nIn addition to a contractual guarantee the Limestone operation would shut down no later than March 2026, the proposal carries several costs for both Red Dog and BrightRidge.\n\nThe first would come within 30 days of Rambo entering an order dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice (meaning it couldn\u2019t be refiled). By that point, Washington County would receive a lump sum payment of $25,000, with half the money coming from Red Dog and half from BrightRidge.\n\nAdditionally, Washington County would collect $200 a day, payable the fifth of each month, for as long as the mine continues operating at its Bailey Bridge Road location \u2014 again with half the money coming from BrightRidge and half from Red Dog.\n\nIf the settlement were finalized quickly in court and the mine stayed open until the deadline, those penalties would total right around $100,000.\n\nThe 51 homes and one church that BrightRidge has been providing free high-speed internet for since last year will continue to receive that until the mine shuts down as well. The cost will be shared by Red Dog and BrightRidge and is estimated to be valued at $150,000.\n\nWithin 120 days of shutting down the current site, Red Dog would have to remove all equipment from the site, including the pods (storage-unit like buildings) housing the servers. Within 120 days after that, BrightRidge would have to remove all the supporting equipment it provided.\n\nResolution would bring an end to a long dispute that has created a high degree of citizen concern and damaged relations between BrightRidge and the county commission. Ward said he realized the specifics of the deal weren\u2019t likely to seem completely just.\n\n\u201cI know some of you don\u2019t really feel strongly that it\u2019s in the county\u2019s best interest, but that it still satisfies most of what you\u2019re trying to do for your citizens and hopefully gives them some surety of what\u2019s coming down the line, and hopefully gets a chance to build back trust with your partner entity BrightRidge down the road,\u201d Ward said."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising steadily over the past two weeks, growing more than 25%. In the last week itself, it has gone up more than 14% and has briefly breached the $35,000 mark. Currently, it holds firm above the $34,000 support.\n\nThis broad-based BTC rally has coincided with mixed earnings numbers coming in from big tech in the stock market, and there is a visible shift being witnessed in investors who are fleeing the stock market to apply buy-side pressure on Bitcoin. It is widely speculated that the benchmark crypto might breach the $40,000 mark very soon.\n\nBeing the most well-known and \u201creliable\u201d digital coin, BTC has solidified its position within the market itself. In an uncertain environment, investors turn less speculative and rush to safety. The crypto market itself is hardly ever considered stable or safe, but even in this space, investors are prone to clinging to BTC in times of crypto rallies.\n\nWith growing institutional acceptance for crypto across geographies, the benchmark digital currency might be entering a period of less volatility and sustained growth. Multiple traditional financial houses applying for a Bitcoin ETF have also acted as a tailwind. However, this recent rally might be even more significant because it lends credence to the notion that investors are considering Bitcoin as a viable option in times when the stock market is getting routed over a period of time. It will be prudent to watch a few bitcoin-exposed stocks in this light.\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants.

        "content": "In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin.\n\nThe Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.\n\nAfter 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20.\n\nThe total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.\n\nThe Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.\n\nIn a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.\n\nThe experiment conclusively proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.\n\nFurther, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like fiat currencies and other traditional savings vehicles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "3 Reasons Bitcoin Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After losing 64% of its value in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -3.18%) has been on an absolute tear this year. As of this writing, the leading digital asset has soared 107% in 2023. And after the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin is now knocking on the door of $35,000.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in a hugely positive price swing, with the intention of trying to ride the strong momentum. But before doing that, investors should really take the time to understand more about what makes Bitcoin a good investment opportunity.\n\nHere are three must-know reasons this top cryptocurrency is a screaming buy right now.\n\n1. Its absolute scarcity\n\nOne of Bitcoin's defining characteristics is that there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation. There is a hard cap on the supply that is etched into the cryptocurrency's computer code. And unless the majority of the crypto's stakeholders -- including users, nodes, miners, and developers -- all agree to change this supply constraint, this is basically set in stone.\n\nA fixed supply is valuable because when demand rises, the price should as well; there is no way for supply to increase to match heightened demand. That's why Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed throughout its history.\n\nThis reality is in stark contrast to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar or the euro, which are constantly losing purchasing power because of ongoing money printing and inflation. In fact, the purchasing power of $1 has dropped more than 95% since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.\n\nSome investors might view gold as having absolute scarcity, but this is inaccurate -- the supply does increase every year. And let's say that demand for the precious metal was to jump significantly in short order. In this scenario, it would be economically feasible for mining companies to try to extract gold from difficult-to-reach areas, so there is the possibility that supply could increase to meet demand.\n\n2. Its ownership by key figures\n\nSince its launch roughly 15 years ago, Bitcoin has been adopted by individuals mainly interested in computer science, cryptography, and privacy. But these days, because its market cap is $663 billion and there is a growing list of financial products and services supporting it, the digital currency is slowly finding itself more and more in the mainstream.\n\nSome prominent business figures have publicly announced their bullishness for the asset. Michael Saylor, billionaire founder of MicroStrategy, has purchased billions of dollars of Bitcoin, which his corporation holds on its balance sheet. Jack Dorsey, another billionaire founder himself, is focused on helping to advance Bitcoin adoption through his payments company Block, which also holds some of it on its balance sheet.\n\nFund managers like Bill Miller and Paul Tudor Jones both own Bitcoin in their personal holdings. And famed investor Cathie Wood, who heads up Ark Invest, is probably the most bullish on it. Her firm's base-case analysis suggests that the price could hit $683,000 by 2030, up 20-fold from today's level.\n\n3. Its near-term catalysts\n\nPerhaps the most pressing reason to buy Bitcoin is the list of near-term catalysts on the horizon. Maybe the market is realizing this, as its price has risen 31% just in the last month (as of Oct. 26).\n\nMany large asset managers have filed applications for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The potential approval of these could introduce massive amounts of fresh capital to the crypto.\n\nThe upcoming halving, which is set for April 2024, is when Bitcoin's inflation rate gets cut in half. Historically, it has been a very bullish event for the price, both in the months leading up to it and in the months following.\n\nAnother possible catalyst is the chance that the Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates in 2024. The central bank could be close to reaching its goal of taming inflation, after which it might want to take a more accommodating stance toward the economy. And this would be a positive backdrop for risky assets like Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) options volumes experienced a significant surge on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24, marking the highest level in over six months. This activity coincided with a remarkable 17% BTC price rally over two days. Traders are now pondering whether the increased activity in the BTC options market can be solely attributed to the anticipation of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or if the optimism has dwindled following the recent price surge above $34,000.\n\nThe recent gains are a rare sight in 2023, even considering Bitcoin\u2019s impressive 108% year-to-date performance. Notably, the last instance of such price action occurred on March 14 when Bitcoin surged from $20,750 to $26,000 in just two days, marking a 25.2% price increase.\n\nDeribit BTC options daily volume, in BTC. Source: Deribit\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the significance of the fact that a staggering 208,000 contracts changed hands in a mere two days. To put this into perspective, the prior peak, which occurred on Aug. 18, saw a total of 132,000 contracts exchanged, but that was during a period when Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted by 10.7% from $29,090 to $25,980 in just two days. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s options open interest, which measures outstanding contracts for every expiry, reached its highest level in over 12 months on Oct. 26.\n\nThis surge in activity has led some analysts to emphasize the potential \u201cgamma squeeze\" risk. This theoretical analysis seeks to capture the need for option market makers to cover their risk based on their likely exposure.\n\nthe #bitcoin gamma squeeze from last week could happen again\n\n\n\nif BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-36k, options dealers will need to buy $20m in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levels\n\n\n\nmore pic.twitter.com/OA9tJ0ZaK9 \u2014 Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) October 30, 2023\n\nAccording to estimates from Galaxy Research and Amberdata, BTC options market makers may need to cover $40 million for every 2% positive move in Bitcoin\u2019s spot price. While this number may seem substantial, it pales in comparison to Bitcoin\u2019s staggering daily adjusted volume of $7.8 billion.\n\nAnother aspect to consider when assessing Bitcoin options volume and total open interest is whether these instruments have primarily been used for hedging purposes or neutral-to-bullish strategies. To address this ambiguity, one should closely monitor the demand difference between call (buy) and put (sell) options.\n\nBitcoin options put-to-call volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotably, the period from Oct. 16 to Oct. 26 saw a predominance of neutral-to-bullish call options, with the ratio consistently remaining below 1. Consequently, the excessive volume observed on Oct. 23 and 24 was skewed toward call options.\n\nHowever, the landscape changed as investors increasingly sought protective put options, reaching a peak of 68% higher demand on Oct. 28. More recently, the metric shifted to a neutral 1.10 ratio on Oct. 30, indicating a balanced demand between put and call options.\n\nHow confident are Bitcoin option traders?\n\nTo gauge whether investors using options have grown more confident as Bitcoin\u2019s price held above $34,000 on Oct. 30, one should analyze the Bitcoin options delta skew. When traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the delta 25% skew tends to rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically see it dip below negative 7%.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Bitcoin options\u2019 25% delta skew shifted to a neutral position on Oct. 24 after residing in bullish territory for five consecutive days. However, as investors realized that the $33,500 support level proved more resilient than anticipated, their confidence improved on Oct. 27, causing the skew indicator to reenter the bullish zone below negative 7%.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s bull move might not be over yet \u2014 Here are 3 reasons why\n\nExtraordinary options premiums and continued optimism\n\nTwo noteworthy observations emerge from this data. Bitcoin bulls utilizing options contracts prior to the 17% rally that began on Oct. 23 were paying the highest premium relative to put options in over 12 months. A negative 18% skew is highly uncommon and signifies extreme confidence or optimism, likely fueled by expectations of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat stands out most, however, is the present negative 13% skew after Bitcoin\u2019s price surged by 26.7% in the 15 days leading up to Oct. 27. Normally, investors would seek protective puts to hedge some of their gains, but this did not occur. Consequently, even if the initial demand for call options was primarily driven by ETF expectations, the prevailing optimism has endured as Bitcoin soared above $34,000.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Roundhill Investments, which manages $608 million in 12 ETFs, filed to launch a crypto fund that takes a page from the playbook of JPMorgan & Co.\u2019s wildly popular JEPI.\n\nRoundhill last week filed an application to issue The Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF, which would offer investors exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by utilizing a covered call strategy, as investor demand for bitcoin funds rises.\n\nThe ETF will utilize a \u201csynthetic\u201d covered call strategy. The fund will work by purchasing and selling a mix of call and put options contracts that \u201cutilize the bitcoin futures ETF as the reference asset,\u201d the prospectus says. Unlike typical covered call ETFs, the fund will not be selling call options on a security that it already owns. Instead, it would gain exposure to bitcoin futures through options contracts that use the bitcoin futures ETF as the reference asset.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of using bitcoin for a covered call strategy is that bitcoin is extremely volatile,\u201d etf.com analyst Sumit Roy said. \u201cThat volatility makes options for bitcoin valuable, increasing the income potential for strategies that sell those options.\u201d\n\nThe price of notoriously volatile bitcoin has surged 27% this month on expectations that a spot bitcoin ETF may be launched in the U.S. this year. Cryptocurrency investors appear to be betting the so-called crypto winter has thawed and are looking for ways to boost their exposure to the asset.\n\nJEPI-Like Call Options Gain Popularity\n\n\u201cHowever, the volatility cuts both ways,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWhile the potential for high income is there, so too is the potential for big losses should bitcoin go down.\u201d\n\nThe fund will generate income by selling call options that reference the bitcoin futures ETF, but this technique will also limit the amount that the fund can see potential upside of bitcoin futures ETF\u2019s share price.\n\n\u201cI think where you'd get in trouble with a Bitcoin covered call ETF is that you're cashing in the tail risk to upside, but keeping the tail risk to the downside,\" said analyst at Morningstar Bryan Armour.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund will pay income to investors monthly. The ETF can also hold some traditional call option positions, according to its filing.\n\nRoundhill\u2019s move to launch the fund comes as multiple ETF issuers, including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, are vying to launch an ETF that tracks spot bitcoin. While the SEC allows ETFs that track bitcoin futures, the largest being the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has historically rejected funds that track physical bitcoin based on concerns of market manipulation.\n\nAfter the smashing success of JPMorgan\u2019s Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which took in $12.7 billion this year, firms have also been looking to call options as a way to generate income for investors. Goldman Sachs, as well as BlackRock, have both launched options writing funds this fall.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a regulated derivatives exchange that lists Bitcoin (BTC) futures, now stands just behind Binance in terms of notional open interest to rank second in the list of BTC futures exchanges.\n\nThe CME\u2019s open interest hit $3.58 billion on Oct. 30, pushing the regulated derivatives exchange platform to jump two positions from the previous week. The CME overtook Bybit and OKX with $2.6 billion and $1.78 billion in open interest, respectively, and is just a few million away from Binance\u2019s $3.9 billion.\n\nBitcoin Futures Exchange rankings by open interest. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe standard Bitcoin futures contract offered by CME is valued at five BTC, while the micro contract is worth a tenth of a Bitcoin. Perpetual futures, instead of ordinary futures contracts, are the main focus of open interest in offshore exchanges, as they come without an expiration date and use the funding rate method to maintain their price parity with the market price.\n\nBitcoin open interest refers to the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts in the market. It measures the amount of money invested in Bitcoin derivatives at any given time. The open interest measures the capital flowing in and out of the market. If more capital flows to Bitcoin futures, the open interest will increase. However, if the capital flows out, the open interest will decline. Hence, increasing open interest reflects a bullish sentiment, whereas a declining open interest indicates bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated: Blockchain congestion and transaction queues actually deter \u2018nefarious actors\u2019: Study\n\nThe CME\u2019s rising open interest not only helped the regulated futures exchange to climb to the second spot among futures crypto exchanges but also saw its cash-settled futures contracts exceed 100,000 BTC in volume. The rising interest of traders in the Bitcoin futures market has also propelled the CME to attain 25% of the Bitcoin futures market share.\n\nA majority chunk of investment into CME futures has come via standard futures contracts, indicating an influx of institutional interest as Bitcoin registered a massive double-digit surge in October, helping it reach a new one-year high above $35,000.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "content": "Update: This article has been updated to highlight that the UN report referenced the Mora et al. 2018 paper, which overestimated the emissions of mining operations by including unprofitable mining rigs in their analysis.\n\nA recent study conducted by the United Nations suggests a direct correlation between the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and the energy needed for mining operations.\n\nUN scientists evaluated the activities of 76 Bitcoin mining nations during the 2020\u20132021 period and found that the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 terawatt-hours of electricity. During this timeframe, the crypto ecosystem was undergoing a bull run, and Bitcoin rallied to mark its all-time high of $69,000. The UN report highlighted:\n\n\u201cA 400% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from 2021 to 2022 triggered a 140% increase in the energy consumption of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network.\u201d\n\nAt the time, fossil energy sources accounted for 67% of the electricity generated for Bitcoin mining. However, crypto entrepreneurs have taken proactive measures to increase their dependence on green energy.\n\nHydropower satisfied over 16% of the total electricity demand of the global Bitcoin mining network; nuclear, solar and wind energy sources provided 9%, 2% and 5%, respectively.\n\nHowever, members of the crypto community called out the UN report for referencing the Mora et al. 2018 paper, which had overestimated the carbon emission levels of Bitcoin mining rigs by including unprofitable mining rigs in their analysis.\n\nOne of the crazy things about the UN paper is that the authors did read the rebuttals to the Mora et al paper because they cite the Houy 2019 paper, but only to note that BTC price is a factor in determining BTC mining profitability. The UN authors completely ignored the opening\u2026 \u2014 Margot Paez / jyn urso (@jyn_urso) October 25, 2023\n\nNic Carter criticized the UN report for citing \"completely fake academia in their papers (mora et al 2018)\".\n\nAccording to the UN report, the top 10 Bitcoin mining nations at the time \u2014 China, United States, Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, Germany, Iran, Ireland and Singapore \u2014 were responsible for 92%\u201394% of the global carbon, water and land footprint of Bitcoin.\n\nThe global push for greener alternatives to fulfill the grid demand will also help reduce the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining is becoming more environmentally friendly\n\nRecently, Genesis Digital Assets Limited, a mining and data center company with over 400 megawatts (MW) of power generation worldwide, opened a new data center in Sweden running 1,900 Bitcoin mining machines, driven by the country\u2019s burgeoning renewable energy surplus.\n\nChristian Anders, founder of BT.CX, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin mining is not very common due to high energy prices. However, he added:\n\n\u201cSweden, Finland and Norway have a surplus of energy and negative energy prices from time to time, and primarily renewable energy in the form of hydropower in a remote location which is hard to distribute.\u201d\n\nIn parallel, Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers continue to deliver energy-efficient hardware. At the World Digital Mining Summit on Sept. 22, Bitcoin miners shared their plans to help decarbonize the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBitmain rolled out its efficiency-focused Antminer S21, while Nazar Khan, chief operating officer of TerraWulf, highlighted that the role Bitcoin rig manufacturers play \u201cis locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that\u2019s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "Hopes of approval for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission boosted Bitcoin\u2019s price by 27% in October. This improved sentiment, attracting aggressive buying by crypto investors.\n\nBloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the first futures-based ETF to get regulatory consent in the U.S. in 2021, saw its second biggest trading week ever at $1.7 billion. Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a volume of $800 million. The sharp uptick in volume in the existing instruments shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs are likely to witness huge volumes when they see the light of the day.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhen the leader starts performing, it generally lifts the entire sector. That is seen in the strong performance of altcoins, which have risen sharply from their multi-year lows.\n\nHowever, after the initial rally, some altcoins will struggle to maintain their up-move while a few will lead the markets higher. It is better to stick with the leaders as they are most likely to outperform during the next crypto bull phase.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may extend their rally in the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin pulled back from $35,280 on Oct. 24, indicating that higher levels are attracting selling by traders. The bears tried to start a deeper pullback on Oct. 27 but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAlthough the rising moving averages indicate advantage to buyers, the overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI) suggest that the BTC/USDT pair may spend some more time in consolidation.\n\nThe important level to watch out for on the downside is $32,400 and then $31,000. Sellers will have to pull the price below this zone to seize control.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $35,280, it will indicate the bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then surge to the next target objective at $40,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is gradually flattening out, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip in the near term. That could keep the pair range-bound between $35,280 and $33,200 for some time. If the bears yank the price below $33,200, the pair may tumble to $32,400.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns up and rallies above $35,280, it will indicate that the current consolidation was a continuation pattern. The pair could then skyrocket toward $40,000.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) climbed above the $1,746 resistance on Oct. 23 and reached $1,865 on Oct. 26. This level attracted selling by short-term traders which pulled the price back toward the breakout level of $1,746.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls successfully defended the retest to $1,746, indicating that the level may act as a new floor. The rising 20-day EMA ($1,693) and the RSI near the overbought zone, indicate that the bulls are in command. Buyers will then strive to push the price above $1,865. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could soar to $2,000.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to yank and sustain the price below $1,746. That could open the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The pair may continue to swing between $1,746 and $1,865 for some time.\n\nIf bulls kick the price above $1,812, the likelihood of a rally to the overhead resistance of $1,865 increases. On the other hand, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the bears will attempt to tug the pair below $1,746. If that happens, the short-term trend will turn bearish.\n\nAptos (APT) price analysis\n\nAptos (APT) rallied sharply in the past few days, indicating that the bulls are attempting to make a comeback.\n\nAPT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe APT/USDT pair witnessed profit-booking near $7 but a minor positive is that the bulls did not give up much ground. This shows that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will again try to overcome the obstacle at $7. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its march toward $8.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from $7, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then spend some more time inside a tight range between $7 and $6.20. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.\n\nThe pair has been finding support at the 20-EMA but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. If the price breaks and sustains below the 20-EMA, it will indicate the start of a deeper correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis remains the key level to watch on the downside because if it cracks, the pair may slump to $5.80. On the upside, the bulls will have to thrust the price above $7.02 to indicate the start of the next leg of the recovery.\n\nRelated: Ripple CEO criticizes former SEC Chair Jay Clayton\u2019s comments\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nQuant (QNT) rose above the breakdown level of $95 on Oct. 23, indicating that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The buying continued and the bulls propelled the price above the downtrend line on Oct. 25. This signals a potential trend change.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe short-term bulls seem to be booking profits after the recent rally. That may pull the price down to the downtrend line. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a drop below it may suggest that the rise above the downtrend line may have been a bull trap.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price snaps back from the downtrend line, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. If buyers clear the hurdle at $110, it will indicate the resumption of the rally to $120 and then to $128.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the QNT/USDT pair is facing selling near $108. The bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA, indicating that the short-term traders are booking profits. If the price slips below $103, the pair may drop to $100.\n\nInstead, if bulls sustain the price above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the price above $110 and start the next leg of the up-move.\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) broke and closed above the overhead resistance of $2 on Oct. 23, completing a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone indicating that bulls remain in command. However, in the short term, the RUNE/USDT pair may enter a minor correction or consolidation.\n\nIf the pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are holding on to their positions. That may improve the prospects of a rally to $3 and subsequently to the pattern target of $3.23. If bears want to prevent this uptrend, they will have to pull and sustain the price below $2.\n\nThe pair has been in a strong uptrend with the bulls buying the dips to the 20-EMA. Although the upsloping moving averages indicate advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening.\n\nIf the price skids below the 20-EMA, it could tempt short-term traders to book profits. That could pull the price to the 50-SMA.\n\nContrarily, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, it will signal that the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then try to resume the up-move with a break and close above $2.57.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Trading Sideways But $38600 BTC Price Expected - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin started a sideways movement on October 24.\n\nOn-chain evidence suggests a strong buying activity ahead.\n\nChart analysis shows a new high to come at $38,600.\n\nAfter reaching its new yearly high of $35,000 on October 24, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been trading sideways. It managed to maintain trading around this high and is now back slightly below the level.\n\nWith some new on-chain evidence suggesting investors\u2019 interest, there are reasons to believe it can continue rising to a new high. Can the BTC price make it to its next resistance at $38,600?\n\nOn-chain Data\n\nBitcoin\u2018s on-chain data suggests that significant investors, often referred to as whales, have been active during its recent surge above $35,000. According to blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock , there were 23,400 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving transfers of $100,000 or more in BTC, marking a yearly peak, as reported last week.\n\nThis peak occurred on October 24 and has since decreased to 12,230, but it continues to reflect a bullish sentiment.\n\nAnalyzing the distribution of holdings, there is a noticeable 4.85% increase in the category of large holders with holdings ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 BTC. This surge in supply distribution among whales has been observed since its peak on October 24, suggesting that whales have been accumulating the coin at these levels and are now likely providing price support.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nAnalyzing Bitcoin\u2019s price, the chart suggests there\u2019s room for a potential growth. The recent uptrend started on October 12 appears to be forming a five-wave pattern, with the last high on October 24 being the wave 3.\n\nThe sideways movement observed since the peak likely represents a consolidation phase, considered wave 4, preceding a potential upward surge that would mark the anticipated completion of wave 5.\n\nThis forthcoming ascent could approach just below the $40,000 mark, in alignment with a significant resistance level at $38,600. However, as this might conclude the final wave of a trend that commenced on November 21, a substantial decline could ensue.\n\nShould this signal the initiation of a new bullish phase following an extended downtrend, the next crucial step would be establishing the first higher low in this bull market. This may manifest as an ABC correction, signifying a higher-degree wave 2. Ideally, this dip should not dip below $25,000.\n\nIf the price nears the projected $40,000 peak and then experiences a 38% decline, it may prompt short-term traders to reevaluate their investments. Conversely, it could provide more favorable entry points for long-term holders and potentially stimulate another buying surge, essential for the next significant upswing.\n\nIn the short term, bullish momentum is likely to prevail in surpassing the current local resistance at the last high. Following an encounter with the $38,600 level, we will reevaluate our projections. However, for now, a more substantial downward movement is anticipated afterward.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Why a Bitcoin ETF Is Making BTC Miners Nervous - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF seemingly in sight, it has seemed like the entire crypto industry is optimistic about how such a product could bolster Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy in the investing world, ignite institutional adoption, and send the price of BTC to the moon.\n\nFor the most part, that includes Bitcoin mining firms\u2014companies that run large computer fleets dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network and earning newly minted coins. However, a key fact about the current Bitcoin investing landscape may leave investors in mining firms a bit concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about the ETFs, and there are indications it will be positive,\u201d Isaac Holyoak, CleanSpark's Chief Communications Officer, told Decrypt. Mining stocks, he noted, tend to inherit Bitcoin\u2019s positive momentum during bullish periods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough Bitcoin itself is up over 100% this year, public mining stocks have averaged even stronger returns \u2013 alongside other BTC-adjacent firms. Until now, such companies have acted as regulated, more traditional leverage plays on BTC for investors in the absence of an ETF.\n\nYet therein lies the rub: Though Bitcoin ETFs may appear promising, they may also suck capital away from stocks that investors have until now treated as the next best thing.\n\nFor their part, CleanSpark remains optimistic, keeping its focus on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cRecent developments\u2014both the false claim of an ETF and the hinting of one with the CUSIP listing\u2014both spurred an increase in the price of bitcoin,\u201d highlighted Holoyak.\n\nSince most of a mining firm\u2019s revenue stems from fixed BTC block rewards, a rising BTC price translates to higher USD-denominated revenue for the entire industry.\n\nAnticipating higher future prices, Cleanspark has been dumping millions of dollars into mining equipment this year to give it the greatest competitive edge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an October mining industry report shared with Decrypt, J.P. Morgan equity analyst Reginald L. Smith labeled CleanSpark (CLSK) an overweight stock, thanks to having acquired hardware and facilities at \u201cdeeply discounted prices,\u201d and running a highly efficient fleet. CLSK is up 122% year to date.\n\nAnother firm to make major infrastructure investments this year is Iris Energy (IREN)\u2014a renewable-focused miner that\u2019s particularly bullish on the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Smith also rated Iris shares, which are up 161% this year, as \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The halving] historically involved an additional price catalyst as coins become even scarcer,\u201d said Daniel Robert, co-founder and co-CEO of Iris Energy. \u201cAdd in a potential easing of macro monetary conditions over the next 6-12 months and we could be in for a very interesting period for Bitcoin.\"\n\nRegarding an ETF, Roberts noted that SEC approval could open \u201csubstantial pools\u201d of capital to the Bitcoin market, compounding with bullish effects from the halving and easing macro conditions.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF differs from existing Bitcoin investment products in the United States, in that its shares would be directly redeemable for a fixed amount of BTC held by the provider and its partners.\n\n\u201cA spot ETF would be infinitely preferable to the fund options on the market today,\u201d explained HIVE Digital CEO Aydin Kilic to Decrypt. \u201cIt would unlock this asset class for professional investors and retail retirement accounts.\u201d\n\nOne of the primary options in the stock market today is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has high fees and doesn't accurately track the price of Bitcoin.\n\nShares in the trust currently trade at a discount to the fund\u2019s underlying BTC holdings. This discount has narrowed over time as confidence grows that the fund\u2019s efforts to convert into a spot Bitcoin ETF will prove successful, and will vanish entirely if/when approved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile some might prefer to purchase and personally hold BTC outright, many retail investors may be less comfortable with buying coins from crypto-specific platforms, which are often unregulated. Furthermore, as Iris\u2019s Roberts elaborated, physical Bitcoin investment is outright impossible for many larger firms.\n\n\u201cBoth institutional investment mandates, as well as those of general retail stockbroking services, often prohibit investment of client capital outside specifically defined instruments and securities,\u201d he said. \u201cAn ETF is likely to solve this.\u201d\n\nAfter GBTC, some of these options include the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN.;+120% YTD) and the futures-based ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO; +64% YTD). Beyond them, however, are the more than dozen publicly traded miners that have performed well against Bitcoin\u2014so far.\n\nIn a podcast interview this week, J.P. Morgan\u2019s Smith highlighted Marthon Digital and Riot Platforms\u2014two of the largest Bitcoin mining companies\u2014as indirect Bitcoin investments that may be inferior to an ETF.\n\n\u201cIt gives you a cleaner play on Bitcoin than buying Riot or Marathon,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that type of purchase you\u2019re dealing with hashrate, outages, things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also could introduce a whole other realm of arbitrage opportunities, where maybe it's cheaper to buy Bitcoin outright and lever up versus buying indirectly through one of the miners,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked about this dynamic, Bitcoin mining firm and pool operator Foundry acknowledged how an ETF could produce \u201ccounterintuitive negative consequences\u201d for the industry.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years, mining companies have been used as proxies to get access to Bitcoin exposure in the public markets,\u201d said Alex Altman, CFA and Senior Manager of Corporate Development at Foundry. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how these new ETF vehicles will impact public miner valuations as investors will now have a more direct, cost-effective way to access the asset class.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

The spot version of the product is expected to draw substantial investments from investors seeking Bitcoin exposure via traditional asset managers.\n\nWith this new filing, VanEck joins a growing list of asset managers updating their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In September, Bitwise Asset Management also filed an amended application responding to the SEC\u2019s objections to the product.\n\nEarly this month, ARK Invest and 21Shares amended their joint application as well, providing additional information about their proposed spot Bitcoin ETF, including practices for asset custody and valuation.\n\nThe wave of amended filings may indicate that negotiations between asset managers and regulators are progressing. Commenting on filings awaiting regulatory approval, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently noted the changes in ETF proposals may reflect SEC requests for issuers to address concerns.\n\n\u201cIt means ARK got the SEC\u2019s comments and has dealt with them all, and now put [the] ball back in [the] SEC\u2019s court,\u201d Balchunas explained on X (formerly Twitter). \u201c[In my opinion] good sign, solid progress.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. SEC has delayed its decision on several proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country, including from BlackRock, Invesco, Bitwise, VanEck and Valkyrie.

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) educator based in Tanzania has scaled Africa\u2019s highest peak, Kilimanjaro, financing the entire trip through Bitcoin and Nostr donations.\n\nKweks poses with a Bitcoin and NOSTR flag at the summit of Kilimanjaro. Source: X (formerly Twitter)\n\nKweks (not his real name) crowdfunded over $1,700 in Bitcoin (0.0018 BTC) to cover the costs of the hike, which doubled as an announcement for a new Bitcoin education academy in Tanzania.\n\nKweks and his wife recently moved to a new city in Tanzania to open a learning center called the \u201cProof of Work Academy,\u201d or POWA. Kweks told Cointelegraph that while POWA is a pun on Bitcoin\u2019s consensus protocol, proof-of-work, it also refers to the Zwahili word \u201cPoah,\u201d which means fresh or cool.\n\nTo promote the new school and subtly hint at his affinity for decentralized protocols, including Bitcoin and Nostr (notes and other stuff transmitted by relay), Kweks funded the ascent to nearly 6,000 meters in satoshis or sats, which are the smallest denomination of Bitcoin equal to 100 millionth of 1 BTC.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Network donations streamed in from all around the world via crowdfunding on Geyser Fund and through Zapraising, which is Bitcoin Lightning Network crowdfunding via Nostr (also called Zaps.)\n\nThe moment Kweks reached the fundraising milestone. Source: X\n\nKweks carried and waved a giant Nostr flag while sharing status updates throughout the multiday hike on X, Nostr and WhatsApp. Speaking from Tanzania, Kweks explained to Cointelegraph that while the money raised was meaningful to cover the costs of the climb, the impact was primarily educational:\n\n\u201cI thought it [the ascent] would be a great case study to show what Bitcoin can do and then introduce some people to Bitcoin as well.\u201d\n\nThe ascent demonstrated to his local community that a global base of Nostriches (users of Nostr) and generous Bitcoin advocates worldwide were happy to support Kweks\u2019 climb and educational work on the ground in Tanzania.\n\nPlus, Kweks received a tip from one of the guides leading the party to the summit of \u201cKili,\u201d as it\u2019s known locally, showing that there is grassroots Bitcoin adoption in Tanzania.\n\nThere is, evidently, some understanding of Bitcoin in Tanzania, Kweks explained \u2014 but one of the key challenges is off-ramps into local currency. The likes of Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini do not operate in Tanzania, so swapping cash for Bitcoin and vice versa can be challenging.\n\nThroughout the hike, Kweks received questions and curious comments from Tanzanians about how he funded the adventure and the inevitable query: \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin adoption in Tanzania is very different from the United Kingdom, where Kweks spent 25 years of his life before moving to Tanzania.\n\nRelated: Hashing It Out: What happens when crypto meets fintech in Africa?\n\nThere is, he explains, more of a barter system in place in East Africa. It can be a challenge to explain money and hyperinflation and the reasons why a currency with a programmed inflation rate, such as Bitcoin could offer an alternative economic system to society.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived in Tanzania ten years ago, $1 was 1,500 hundred Tanzanian shillings. As of today, [$1 equals] 2,600. That\u2019s ten years later. It\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nUltimately, the key to unlocking Bitcoin education is to use terms relevant to people: \u201cI do speak to them about how much bread is going up and how much fuel is going up, and they understand that,\u201d Kweks explained.\n\n\u201cThey see that it\u2019s harder to make ends meet. So with these concepts, they understand that Bitcoin the tool can help them \u2014 and that\u2019s the work. That\u2019s the work that needs to be shared and explored.\u201d\n\nKweks continues to post and share educational resources on Nostr and X, while the educational resource POWA offers free educational classes to Tanzanians based near Kilimanjaro.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

Bitcoin, at time of publication, was up just under 1%, at $34,600, on Monday\u2014and is still up almost 13% over the past seven days.\n\nThat stellar performance is in part due to growing investor optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which could lead to a flurry of crypto inflows.\n\nThe surge led by Bitcoin has awoken the memecoin traders who were laying low over the past several months as crypto prices lagged. The pack leader, Pepe coin, has jumped 57% over the past seven days, reaching its highest level since August. Others like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also gained.\n\n$PEPE Massive move upon retaking that range. Now consolidating beneath the mid range.\n\n\n\nPlan unchanged on this.

The euphoria around regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing helped the crypto surge lately.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain firm as the largest crypto token gained about a per cent and managed to hover strongly above 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen half a per cent each but remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin sustained its position above the $34,000 threshold, driven by the prevailing positive outlook regarding the potential approval of Bitcoin Spot ETF applications in the United States, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) witnessed its second-largest trading week to date, racking up $1.7 billion in trading volume, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded $800 million in trading volume, possibly amplifying the overall market's positive sentiment. Ethereum, on the other hand, maintained its trading value above $1,700,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll of the majority of top crypto tokens were trading higher on Monday. Solana surged about per cent, while Chainlink and Polkadot gained 3 per cent each. Polygon, Cardano and XRP gained about 2 per cent each in the early trade. Even the dollar pegged stablecoins inched up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it jumped about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent to $27.37 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin concluded the week with a remarkable 15 per cent gain. Throughout the weekend, BTC maintained a positive stance but remained below its local resistance at $35,000. Currently, the price hovers around $34,300, while ETH is trading slightly above the local support level of $1,765, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"It's worth noting that this week carries significant weight for the crypto market due to various macro events, including the US FOMC meeting, the monthly announcement of the US unemployment rate, US job openings, and the US non-farm Employment Change.

LINK went from $5.9 in early September to $11.2 today, a 90% surge in price.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Chainlink\n\n\n\nThe token has broken the $10 key resistance level, and continued strong development is likely. The Bollinger Bands are currently wide as the price volatility increases near the $9 mark and the price action is trending well above the indicator\u2019s mean line. The upward shift has propelled the RSI index to the overbought territory and is currently sitting at 76.9. If the price manages to successfully surpass the $12 mark, this could lead to further increase towards the resistance level of $13.5.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $10, $9, $7.85\n\nResistance: $12, $13.5\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "IF THERE\u2019S one thing that crypto enthusiasts love more than the digital assets themselves, it\u2019s memes. A frenzy of crypto-based memes have gained fresh momentum last week as Bitcoin rallied.\n\nGrowing expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will authorise exchange-traded funds that invest directly in Bitcoin pushed the largest crypto by market value up by more than 25 per cent over the past two weeks to around US$35,000 on Wednesday (Oct 25) \u2013 its highest level in about 18 months. The breakout gives bulls some hope even as reminders of the industry\u2019s recent woes linger. Just last week, Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his own defence of criminal charges stemming from the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMemecoins such as Pepe Coin surged along with Bitcoin. The coin based on the Internet meme of a green anthropomorphic frog that has been around since the early 2000s increased 77 per cent on Friday from the week before, according to data from crypto market tracker CoinGecko. Pepe Coin, which was issued this year, soared to a market value of more than US$1 billion in May before reversing course and plummeting more than 60 per cent in the following days, according to data tracker CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u201cThe bear market put a dampener on meme activity, especially in terms of market value, but it stayed quite lively anyway,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. \u201cNow that sentiment is feeling more confident, the meme tokens will come to represent even more the fun, Yolo side of crypto investing.\u201d\n\nMemes, from Baby Yoda to Bob Ross, have been a part of the cryptocurrency space since its early beginnings \u2013 and in 2013, they began trading as digital tokens known as memecoins. Dogecoin, often cited as the first memecoin, was valued at as much as US$50 billion in 2021, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.com. Dogecoin ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, inspiring other dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu. Now, there are hundreds of memecoins that range from being worth almost nothing to having market values of US$100 million or more.\n\n\u201cCrypto attracts rebels who believe that money is not serious, legacy systems aren\u2019t to be trusted, the future is uncertain and those in charge are corrupt, so they might as well have fun,\u201d Acheson said.\n\nSEE ALSO MicroStrategy launches second note sale this month to buy more Bitcoin\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Monday, 3.30 PM Garage The hottest news on all things startup and tech to kickstart your week. Sign Up We have other newsletters you might enjoy. Take a look.\n\nThis is not the first time that memecoins are in lockstep with overall market sentiment. During the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the most popular memes, \u201cmoney printer go brrr\u201d, was about how the Federal Reserve was \u201cprinting\u201d an endless amount of US dollars and how that enhanced the value of Bitcoin, which has a capped amount of tokens. The demise of that meme came in October 2022, leaving the average investor caring little whether there is a finite amount of the digital asset.\n\n\u201cWe can roll our eyes at these tokens\u2019 lack of fundamental value, but in my opinion that overlooks that, in the end, the market decides,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cMeme tokens are cultural expressions with monetary value, and in the crypto market there will always be a degree of eager participation.\u201d BLOOMBERG"
