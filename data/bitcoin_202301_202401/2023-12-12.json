        "title": "Tesla and Block among Bitcoin-holding firms to get boost from accounting rule change in late 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "The Financial Accounting Standards Board, an outfit known as FASB that helps create rules for corporate bookkeeping, published a bulletin on Wednesday about implementing a long-awaited rule change that will benefit firms that hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnder the current accounting regime, firms such as Tesla and Block that hold Bitcoin must report a loss in earnings reports if the digital asset drops in value during a given time. At the same time, they can\u2019t record a profit if the price goes up. In practice, this means that a company that bought Bitcoin at $25,000 and saw it dip to $20,000 must maintain the lower value on its balance sheet\u2014even if the price soars to $40,000 right after.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, which jumped on the FASB news, was a little over $42,000 at midday on Wednesday. Tesla owns around 10,000 while Block has about 8,000, and as both firms acquired most or all of their Bitcoin holdings at a lower price, they stand to reap a gain when the new rules are enacted, according to FASB, \u201cfor fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2024.\u201d\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the rule change is set to be MicroStrategy, a onetime cybersecurity firm that pivoted to acquiring large amounts of Bitcoin several years ago. The firm says it currently owns nearly 160,000, which it acquired at an average cost of just under $30,000\u2014which at current prices would be a net of almost $2 billion.\n\nThe forthcoming rule changes have been expected for months, but the share price of MicroStrategy nonetheless jumped 5% on the news. Shares of Tesla and Block, whose Bitcoin holdings represent only a small portion of the value, were down slightly.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, historically volatile, is up around 180% this year as the crypto market appears to be recovering from a wave of scandals and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin fell to a low of around $16,000 last December after reaching its all-time high of roughly $69,000 in the fall of 2021.\n\nThe FASB announcement also may encourage other corporations to include crypto as part of their corporate treasuries since the ability to record it at fair market value will eliminate a significant impediment to holding it.\n\n\u201cThis upgrade to accounting standards will facilitate the adoption of [Bitcoin] as a treasury reserve asset by corporations worldwide,\u201d MicroStrategy cofounder Michael Saylor wrote in response to the news.\n\nFASB\u2019s forthcoming update will be the first it\u2019s issued for crypto in nearly a decade. When the body first issued guidance for crypto, it classified digital assets as \u201cintangible\u201d and in the same category of trademarks and goodwill, which likewise are marked down in the event of a drop in value but not marked up if the value rises."

        "content": "JPMorgan expects ether to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, although the bank remains generally \"cautious\" about crypto markets in the coming year.\n\n\"We believe that next year Ethereum ETH -6.37% will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"The main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024. We believe that this upgrade will likely prove a bigger step towards improving Ethereum network activity, thus helping Ethereum to outperform.\"\n\nProtodanksharding is an initial step toward the full implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the originally planned sharding technique, Danksharding avoids the complex process of splitting Ethereum into multiple shard chains. Instead, it introduces data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks, capable of holding more data than blocks but not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe upgrade is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, JPMorgan analysts reiterated, as it provides an additional temporary data space to increase network throughput and reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. In essence, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nBitcoin halving priced in\n\nJPMorgan analysts say factors that are seen to be bullish for bitcoin next year, including the possible approval of spot ETFs and upcoming halving, are already priced in.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that after the 2020 halving, the ratio of bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased and said a similar move after the 2024 halving would be reasonable.\n\n\"And given the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nDeFi's 'biggest disappointment'\n\nThe \"biggest disappointment\" of decentralized finance continues to be its inability to encroach into the traditional financial system, which is necessary for the crypto ecosystem to transition from crypto native to real world applications, according to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. In addition, tokenization is evolving \"rather slowly,\" and it remains at a \"largely experimental stage hindered by fragmentation, lack of cooperation and interoperability between platforms, delays in the introduction of central bank digital currencies by the Fed and the ECB and lack of regulations,\" they added.\n\nCrypto VC funding outlook\n\nWhile venture capital funding in the crypto space in the fourth quarter of this year has improved compared to a rather subdued rest of the year, the improvement appears \"rather tentative\" to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"That said, to the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024 that would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the crypto winter,\" the analysts said."

Only 11% of respondents who have not previously owned bitcoin described themselves as very likely or somewhat likely to buy a bitcoin ETF.\n\nTodaro's results indicate that an ETF launch is unlikely to bring in more capital flows unless this coincides with higher bitcoin prices/and other engagements, which spurs greater retail interest in the asset.\n\nAmong individuals who have owned bitcoin, respondents slightly preferred to buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange/platform than a prospective ETF through an equity brokerage, although this is age-dependent.\n\n40% would choose to purchase an ETF, while 49% preferred using a crypto platform, which suggests that an ETF will unlikely cannibalize COIN's higher-margin trading business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: COIN shares traded higher by 5.56% at $147.30 on the last check Wednesday.

        "content": "Wind and solar installations across the United States could reap millions of dollars from mining cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin during the early stages of renewable energy projects, according to a new study. The analysis suggests the potential to flip the script on cryptocurrency mining, which uses lots of electricity and therefore frequently generates high carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cCrypto operations such as Bitcoin mining, which are often criticized for their high energy consumption, hold the potential to play a significant role in promoting renewable energy development and aiding climate action efforts,\u201d says study team member Fengqi You, a sustainability researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\nAfter renewable energy projects are built, there is generally a period of time when they can generate power but are not yet hooked up to the broader electric grid, so they cannot generate any revenue. Bitcoin mining could ease the financial stress of this phase, the new study suggests.\n\nIn the study, You and his collaborators assembled data on the electricity generation potential for various wind and solar installations planned in the United States. They combined this with information about the energy and financial costs involved in Bitcoin mining, as well as the revenues that could be generated. They fed all this data into a mathematical model to determine the maximum profit that each planned renewable energy project could yield from Bitcoin mining, given the power available.\n\nAll 58 of the planned renewable energy installations assessed in the study could turn at least a small profit from Bitcoin mining, the researchers report in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.\n\n\u201cThe extent of profitability and the potential climate benefits of combining Bitcoin mining with renewable energy installations were more significant than we initially anticipated,\u201d You says.\n\nTexas emerged as the state with the greatest potential for the scheme, with 32 planned renewable projects that could generate a total of $47 million from Bitcoin mining in the pre-grid-connection phase. California also stands out as a good place to implement the system, and Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and Virginia have fewer installations but have significant potential for Bitcoin profitability as well.\n\n\u201cThis approach enhances the economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, thus contributing to the broader goal of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and also shifts the mining operations primarily relying on fossil-dependent grids to clean energy sources,\u201d You says.\n\nThe best renewable projects for Bitcoin mining are the ones with the most stable and consistent electricity generation, the researchers found. Solar projects tend to have greater profit potential than wind projects. The highest potential profits were seen at two solar projects in Texas, which could each generate a maximum profit of $3.23 million. The greatest potential profits for a wind energy project, also in Texas, were $2.65 million.\n\nPolicymakers could help facilitate the scheme by providing carbon credits or other economic incentives for environmentally responsible cryptocurrency mining, the researchers suggest. Policies to encourage cryptocurrency mining operations to reinvest some profits into further renewable energy development \u2013 perhaps in locations distant from the original installation \u2013 could further maximize the environmental benefits.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t without risks, the researchers say. \u201cOne primary concern is the increasing energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. As the complexity of mining increases, it requires more computational power, which in turn can lead to higher energy consumption,\u201d You says. This could result in more fossil fuel use if the energy required for Bitcoin mining outstrips the renewable power available. It could also create a strain on the electricity supply available for local communities. So implementing the scheme will require careful planning and regulation to avoid negative impacts, You says.\n\nSource: Lal A. et al. \u201cFrom Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action.\u201d ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering 2023.\n\nImage: \u00a9Anthropocene Magazine."

He has been a big believer that things like blockchain technology can be big disruptors. We can\u2019t afford not to be at the forefront of that revolution.\u201d\n\nAcheson pointed out that JPMorgan doesn\u2019t have any Bitcoin projects in the works \u2014 only enterprise, or private, blockchain projects.\n\nEnterprise blockchains generally aim to streamline business transactions between companies.\n\nDimon has often said in public that he\u2019s very excited about them, Acheson noted.\n\nPrivate equity firm Apollo revealed in November that it plans, in conjunction with JPMorgan, to launch the mainnet of an enterprise blockchain which will offer tokenised treasuries, stablecoins, and eventually tokenised money-market funds.\n\n\u201cCrypto and blockchain are very, very intertwined in our minds,\u201d said Acheson. \u201cBut operationally, they\u2019re very different.

        "title": "Bitcoin Has More Than Doubled in Value in 2023. Here's Why It Could Do It Again in 2024. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is Bitcoin (BTC -5.83%). And it's gotten a whole lot bigger in 2023. As of this writing, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $860 billion and the price is up 160% year to date.\n\nWhile a 160% gain is extraordinary, it's not necessarily surprising -- Bitcoin is following a pattern that's been going on for over a decade. Investors should first try to understand why there's a pattern. But once understood, there's reason to believe Bitcoin could double again in 2024, with an important caveat.\n\nWhy is there a Bitcoin pattern?\n\nInvestors in stocks would do well to disregard patterns. Stocks represent real-world businesses, and long-term price movements reflect what's going on in the business. There's no way some lines on a chart can predict the future for what these companies will do.\n\nBitcoin's pattern, however, is based on something going on in real life -- something that is predictable. And I'll explain. But I have to start at the top.\n\nAs a currency, Bitcoin is meant to change hands, paying for goods or services in theory. But because it's digital, computers have to process the transactions and keep track of it all.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized, which means there's no single centralized owner. Therefore, the computers processing transactions are doing so voluntarily. The process is called mining. And these volunteers do it because the system is set up to pay them Bitcoins for their efforts.\n\nThe Bitcoin network issues new Bitcoins to these miners, so there is modest inflation built into the network. There are over 19.5 million Bitcoins in circulation today. And at the current mining pace, about 900 new Bitcoins enter circulation daily.\n\nHowever, roughly every four years, the mining reward is cut by 50% -- this is known as the halving event. Therefore, there's a huge, sudden shock to the system. And this disruption is what has caused the aforementioned pattern in the past.\n\nWhy Bitcoin could double again in 2024\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving event should happen in the first half of 2024 based on the current pace of mining.\n\nIn past cycles, Bitcoin has seen huge gains in the year before the halving, the year of the halving, and the year after the halving. The second year after a halving has historically had a drop of 60% or more, as seen below.\n\nThis year is the year before the halving, and Bitcoin has followed the pattern with big gains. And that's why one would expect Bitcoin to continue its surge with big gains and new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nHow the entire pattern could fall apart\n\nI wouldn't be doing readers any service by simply pointing out a historical pattern and calling it a day. Even though Bitcoin's pattern has been predictable, there's something that could cause it to utterly disintegrate.\n\nI always talk about this in terms of supply and demand. The price of Bitcoin is rising, indicating that there are more buyers than sellers and that demand is higher than supply. When the supply gets cut in half, the imbalance is exacerbated and the price soars even more.\n\nBitcoin could skyrocket in 2024. This assumes that there will be consistently strong demand from investors. But this very human element is the thing that could unexpectedly change on a dime.\n\nI personally own some Bitcoin and I've been happy with my investment. But I'm still not satisfied with my ability to predict the human element. To best predict future demand, I wanted to see people actually using the cryptocurrency as, well, a currency. But it seems that for most, it's an investment.\n\nIf increasingly more people and businesses were adopting Bitcoin as a currency, I'd feel good about long-term demand. But as an investment, I'm much less sure. Changes in investors' perception could totally change market sentiment and the past Bitcoin pattern would fall apart.\n\nNo matter your personal view on the future of Bitcoin, I believe all investors can recognize things are volatile and subject to change. As mentioned, I do own some Bitcoin. But I believe all investors should still have a healthy appreciation of the risks, even though past cycles point to big gains for Bitcoin in 2024."

        "title": "Cardano (ADA): What It Is, How It Differs From Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof of work (PoW) networks. It is intended to evolve into a system with multiple use cases, governed by those who have staked their cryptocurrency.\n\nCardano\u2019s cryptocurrency is named Ada after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815\u20131852), commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada is used in the blockchain\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It is given as a reward for work done for the blockchain or can be purchased on exchanges.\n\nKey Takeaways Cardano is a blockchain platform that was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. It was launched in 2017.\n\nCardano aims to be a decentralized application (dApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.\n\nCardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol using its native token, Ada.\n\nHistory of Cardano (ADA)\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the platform in 2017. Cardano has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum. Both platforms are used for similar applications, such as smart contracts, and aim to build a connected and decentralized system.\n\nCardano considers itself an updated version of Ethereum and has anointed itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. The blockchain platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked.\n\nCardano vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are several key differences between Bitcoin and Cardano. Bitcoin was developed to be a peer-to-peer payment system. Cardano is an ecosystem that allows other developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), or any other uses a scalable blockchain network can host.\n\nThe Cardano platform runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Ouroboros, created by Cardano in its foundation phase, was the first proof of stake (PoS) protocol designed to reduce the energy expenditure required by proof of work (PoW) mining. It does this by eliminating the massive computing resources that the proof of work algorithm uses.\n\nCardano doesn\u2019t reward its cryptocurrency as an incentive in a competitive mining process like Bitcoin. This reduces the energy and waste footprints by not requiring large amounts of electricity to power computers specifically designed for mining. Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada, and begin earning rewards for participating.\n\n\n\nAda is Cardano\u2019s digital currency, named after Augusta Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century countess and English mathematician recognized as the first computer programmer.\n\nWhat Is Cardano Staking?\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s PoS system, staking determines a node\u2019s capability to open blocks on the blockchain. A node\u2019s stake is equal to the amount of Ada it holds over the long term. A stake is an interest a pool participant holds, secured with Ada that is pledged. Pledged Ada cannot be used or spent by the holder because it is held as collateral for honest validation behavior. Users with pledged Ada are given rewards based on the amount of Ada they have staked.\n\nUsers join or create staking pools\u2014groups of Ada holders who have pledged their coins\u2014and work together to update the ledger, open new blocks, and earn rewards.\n\nHow Do Cardano Staking Pools Work?\n\nCardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \u201cstake\u201d a coin for the opportunity to become a validator. Users can participate in the staking and validation process in two ways: You can stake your Ada in a pool or create your own. Stake pools are trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions. These pools can be either public or private. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to the owner(s).\n\nA stake pool must be run by an operator with the knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nCardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This testnet update was the first iteration of bringing the promised scalability and use cases to users. This update allowed users to create smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple assets. Future releases and forks will bring more capabilities to the mainnet.\n\nWhat Is the Best Place to Stake Cardano?\n\nThere are several staking pools you can choose from to stake your Ada. It\u2019s essential to thoroughly read through a pool\u2019s website, user reviews, complaints, or issues to be sure that you\u2019re joining a reputable pool.\n\nYou can also use the community-built tools ADApools.org, Cardanoscan.io, Pool.pm, Poolstats.org, or Pooltool.io to help you select a pool. You can also use the Yoroi, Exodus, or Binance wallets to stake your Ada. You can also use Daedalus, a full desktop application developed by IOHK that downloads a copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full node that acts as a wallet that verifies all transactions in its history and lets you choose a pool to join.\n\n\n\nFuture of Cardano\n\nCardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho is the era of scaling and optimization, intended to bring more capabilities to Cardano. As of 2023, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.\n\nVoltaire is the final era for Cardano development, intended to bring voting and treasury management of the blockchain and network through previously introduced smart contract functionality and system improvements. When Voltaire is complete, IOHK\u2019s goal is to release the blockchain and network to the community, as it will be fully decentralized and able to be developed, maintained, and kept secure.\n\n\n\nWhere Do I Get Cardano (ADA)? You can buy Cardano (ADA) on cryptocurrency exchanges or by participating in the network.\n\nHow Do I Mine Cardano (ADA)? Cardano cannot be mined in the way that other cryptocurrencies can. Instead, it must be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or earned.\n\nWhat Is the Cardano (ADA) Market Cap? Cardano (ADA) had a market capitalization of about $22.2 billion on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable.\n\nThe plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the best bitcoin stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our discussion on the bitcoin industry, head directly to 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIn November this year, bitcoin reached new highs and other top cryptocurrencies also experienced gains. The spike in cryptocurrency investments is attributed to the expectation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving the first spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a major U.S. exchange. At the same time, global regulators including the SEC are actively cracking down on digital assets, targeting crypto exchanges and high-profile executives such as Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Changpeng Zhao of Binance. However, with the historic settlement imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Binance, the cryptocurrency industry can potentially bring an end to a series of scandals and issues, according to Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN). Armstrong commented during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche:\n\n\u201cThe enforcement action against Binance, that\u2019s allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history. There are many crypto companies that are helping build the crypto economy and change our financial system globally. But many of them are still small startups. I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.\"\n\nDon't Miss: 11 Most Profitable Cryptocurrency Stocks\n\nExperts in the cryptocurrency space predict a new bullish phase, as an increasing number of individuals express expectations for bitcoin to reach record levels in 2024, surpassing $100,000. Bitcoin has experienced a surge of over 120% in 2023, leading to widespread optimism that this momentum will persist into 2024. Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC recently:\n\n\u201cIt feels that [2023] was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Vijay Ayyar, who serves as the vice president of international markets at the cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, shared with CNBC:\n\n\u201cA number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price.\u201d\n\nSee also: 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOn another positive note, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is expanding its cryptocurrency trading feature to the European Union, aiming to tap into international markets for growth. The new crypto product enables customers to trade over 25 tokens, including popular ones like bitcoin, ether, ripple, cardano, solana, and polkadot. Robinhood plans to add more tokens and introduce features such as transfer and \"staking\" for earning crypto rewards in 2024. This move follows the company's recent announcement about launching stock trades for U.K. customers by early 2024, with a waitlist already open and promising yields of up to 5% on deposits.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani expressed optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and said that the price of bitcoin could consequently reach $150,000 by 2025. The positive projection is approximately five times the present price and over twice the previous all-time high for bitcoin in November 2021. Chhugani also expects that the approval of the ETF would result in the allocation of up to 10% of bitcoin's circulating supply to ETFs. This approval would enable traditional investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin through their investment portfolios.\n\nNevertheless, there are still individuals who heavily criticize cryptocurrencies. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on December 6 strongly criticized bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, stating during a Senate Banking Committee hearing that he has always been vehemently against crypto. Dimon expressed the view that cryptocurrencies should be banned, emphasizing concerns about their primary utility being linked to criminal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and drug trafficking. Despite his stance against cryptocurrencies, it's noteworthy that JPMorgan is actively engaged in blockchain, the underlying technology supporting the $1.6 trillion crypto industry.\n\nSome of the best crypto stocks include CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ).

        "content": "After nearly two years of delays, El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Volcano Bond has been approved and could be issued as early as the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe country\u2019s National Bitcoin Office, or ONBTC, said in a post to Twitter/X on Tuesday that the country\u2019s Digital Asset Commission had approved the bond, triggering \u201cthe beginning for new capital markets on #Bitcoin in El Salvador.\u201d The bond is set to be issued on the Bitfinex Securities Platform.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING NEWS\ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nThe Volcano Bond has just received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD).\n\n\n\nWe anticipate the bond will be issued during the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nThis is just the beginning for new capital markets on #Bitcoin in El Salvador.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\udf0b\ud83d\ude80 \u2014 The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) December 12, 2023\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele retweeted several news stories on X, claiming the bonds would be issued early next year. He also posted about the approval.\n\nWen volcano bond? \ud83e\udd7a \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 12, 2023\n\nThe news comes after several previous attempts to bring it to fruition had stalled. Bukele first announced the Volcano Bond, named after a plan to use geothermal energy from a volcano to power Bitcoin mining, in 2021, shortly after the nation adopted Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nThe bond\u2019s scheduled debut in early 2022 was postponed and then temporarily sidelined by the nation\u2019s finance minister as crypto prices plummeted. After several other delays, El Salvador\u2019s congress passed a law in January that created a legal framework for the bond.\n\nIf successful, the bond could help the Central American nation avoid defaulting on its debt, although the International Monetary Fund has for years urged El Salvador to get rid of Bitcoin as a legal currency. The nation also is seeking new revenue by offering citizenship to investors who spend $1 million on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Volcano Bond is a key project for Bukele, who led the effort to designate Bitcoin as legal tender. Funds raised by the bond were designated for the creation of a \u201cBitcoin city\u201d and for investments in Bitcoin itself. The nation\u2019s current holdings, Bukele recently announced on X, without citing evidence, are now profitable.\n\nSince hitting a 20-month high last week, Bitcoin\u2019s price has retreated to about $41,300 as of Tuesday morning."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year, and the bull run is expected to continue into 2024 as investor sentiment remains high. Although Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, has declined more than 5% since Dec 11, it is still trading above the $41,000 mark.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rallied briefly above $44,000 before hovering around the $42,000 mark on renewed optimism. On Dec 12, it surged above $42,000 briefly, following the release of the consumer price index (CPI) data before settling slightly above $41,000.\n\nLast year saw the crypto market taking a hit, primarily because of a couple of unfortunate events, namely the FTX bankruptcy following a major fraud and the Tera Luna crash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) have staged a solid rebound this year. Year to date, Bitcoin has rallied more than 147%, while Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin have rallied 80.8%, 125.6% and 29.7%, respectively.\n\nThe rally continued for the first seven months of the year before stalling in August as investors failed to get a clear picture of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next course of action on interest rate hikes.\n\nAn increase in interest rates usually has a detrimental effect on growth-oriented sectors, which include technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the rally resumed in late October on renewed optimism that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a Bitcoin ETF is on the anvil. This could play a key role in giving the crypto market a fresh boost.\n\nInvestors are presently anticipating the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC, with expectations for this approval in as early as the first half of 2024.\n\nAlso, inflation has been steadily declining over the past several months. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.1% year over year in November, slower than October\u2019s jump of 3.2%. This has raised hopes that the Fed may likely end its monetary tightening campaign soon and start cutting rates in the first half of 2024, which definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nBlock Inc.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid back below $41,000 this week after advancing as much as 12% in December amid optimism that the SEC will approve its first spot bitcoin ETF early next year.\n\nAnd the rally has room to run, according to Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) CEO Greg Beard, who expects \u201ctens of billions of dollars of additional demand.\"\n\nBeard added: \"We're still in the early days of bitcoin adoption and so I'm quite bullish on what could happen to pricing when that manifests itself in the marketplace.'\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Bitcoin bulls were enjoying a nice ride last week. As of last Friday, 2023 was Bitcoin's best year since 2020 in terms of percentage gains, but we did see a bit of a reversal. Bitcoin erasing its week long rally after one of the worst crypto selloffs that we've seen this year. So with all this volatility in the crypto market, where are prices headed next? We want to bring in Greg Beard. He's Stronghold Digital Mining's CEO. Greg, it's great to see you.\n\nSo I think there's a lot of talk just about in terms of the pricing action that we've seen with Bitcoin, a number of headlines that have been driving some of this optimism as we look ahead to 2024. What do you think is the biggest driver of Bitcoin here over the next several months?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. Everyone's been paying attention to the prospect of ETFs being approved by the SEC and the prospective demand that will be brought to the Bitcoin market with those ETFs hitting the street, which if Bitcoin trades about $20 billion a day worth of coins in ETFs themselves, could be tens of billions of dollars of additional demand. So I think that's the reason for the recent run-up in Bitcoin in our view.\n\n- Is the potential for ETF approvals even bigger than the halving that is set to come forward or anticipated next year?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. So there's a lot talk about what the halving would do. And the halving really just reduces the amount of the mining reward for the Bitcoin miners that approve transactions on the network. And looking backward, that has been a big impetus for Bitcoin price to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as Bitcoin has gotten bigger over time, the mining rewards are less important. So I think I might have the minority view that the halving will have a big immediate impact on price. I think it's a much bigger impact on the demand from protective of ETF acceptance or from broader market use and acceptance as Bitcoin becomes more prevalent.\n\n- So Greg, when you talk about maybe broader use and acceptance, you talk about the fact that there is so much optimism surrounding the ETF approvals. How much of that optimism has already been priced in though when you take a look at the massive run-up that we have seen in Bitcoin?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. I think certainly, some will be priced in. But those ETFs actually have to go out and buy the bitcoins. And so I think the demand, the prospect for demand might be in the market a bit. But keep in mind, they actually have to go do it. And they can't do it until they're approved and created."

BlackRock reps spoke with the SEC on Monday.\n\nThe divisions of Trading and Markets as well as Corporate Finance have been involved, according to memos. These represent the two branches that need to approve an ETF. Bitwise Asset Management, ARK Invest and Valkyrie have also communicated with the SEC.\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise, said in an interview with etf.com that discussions with the agency are \u201cnarrowing down and getting to specifics.\u201d\n\nAnticipation is rising for potential approval of a spot bitcoin fund that would track physically backed bitcoin. While the SEC allows cryptocurrency ETFs that expose investors to futures contracts, they have rejected spot crypto ETFs on the grounds of potential market manipulation and investor protection.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Details\n\nThe SEC and the firms are ironing out the details of a spot bitcoin ETF structure as the Jan. 10 deadline on a decision on ARK's application approaches. The memos have pointed to discussions about redemption models to fund the exchange-traded fund.

The revised application allows banking giants like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to create new shares in the fund using cash instead of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis new redemption model, called \"prepay,\" enables authorized participants (APs) from major banks to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding Bitcoin or crypto directly on their balance sheets. By transferring cash to a broker-dealer, which then converts it into Bitcoin, the APs can participate in the fund. Coinbase Custody serves as the ETF's custody provider in BlackRock's case.\n\nPresented to the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) by six BlackRock members and three from NASDAQ in a meeting on November 28, the revised model aims to address concerns such as market manipulation and enhance investor protections. BlackRock believes that the new structure offers superior resistance to market manipulation, a key factor that has previously led the SEC to reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nBlackRock recently had its third meeting with the SEC on December 11, led by Chairman Gary Gensler. The previous meeting on November 28 was a follow-up to the initial meeting on November 20, during which the original in-kind redemption model was presented.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision on BlackRock's application by January 15, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "El Salvador says it's now making a profit on the Bitcoin investments at the center of President Nayib Bukele's economic and social reforms, a surprising turnaround for a country with a decades-long reputation for rampant gang violence and one of the highest homicide rates in the world.\n\nBukele said last week that the country is profiting from the investments he initiated over two years ago, posting on X, \"With the current #Bitcoin market price, if we were to sell our #Bitcoin, we would not only recover 100% of our investment but also make a profit of $3,620, 277.13 USD (as of this moment).\"\n\nIn 2021, El Salvador passed legislation to adopt Bitcoin as their legal tender, becoming the first country in the world to do so. The move became a key part of Bukele's dramatic social and economic reforms, with the president saying that the adoption of Bitcoin would \"grow the country's economy, providing access to credit, savings, investment and secure transactions.\"\n\nBukele tweeted in September 2021 that the country held 400 Bitcoin and announced that the country will be \"buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow.\"\n\nSome experts, however, have cautioned that Bitcoin's volatility makes it difficult to mitigate risk.\n\nBitcoin reached its all-time high in November 2021 at $68,789.63 -- two months after Bukele's initial investment into the coin. Nearly a year later, the coin's value plummeted nearly 75% to around $16,000, according to Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform. Bitcoin's value is currently about $41,000.\n\n\"Given the risks involved, you really would expect to have to double your money every year in cryptocurrency to justify the underlying risk,\" David Yermack, a professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business, told ABC News. \"They've really had very bad timing in the whole thing, and have only clawed their way back to even basically.\"\n\nDespite its apparent risk, the country has continued pushing cryptocurrency as a means toward economic reform, recently rolling out a new \"Freedom Visa\" program that would grant residency and a potential passport to 1,000 individuals per year that meet certain financial requirements.\n\nThe program is \"primarily designed for high-net-worth individuals or investors interested in contributing to building Bitcoin Country\" who have a \"financial threshold of $1 million in Bitcoin or USD,\" according to a government statement.\n\nMeanwhile, El Salvador's social reforms have also raised concerns that they've \"restricted and violated fundamental rights,\" according to a recent Amnesty International report.\n\nAn attendee wearing a Bitcoin necklace during the Adopting Bitcoin 2023 Summit in San Salvador, El Salvador, Nov. 7, 2023. Camilo Freedman/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn response to over 80 gang-related homicides in a three day period in March 2022, the country's \"security forces were empowered to arrest anyone suspected of belonging to a gang or providing support to gangs\" and \"suspended the rights to be informed immediately of the reason for detention,\" according to a 2022 U.S. State Department report.\n\nAccording to the U.S. report, over 52,000 individuals were \"arrested in the first six months of the state of exception, leading to allegations of overcrowding and inhuman treatment in the prisons.\"\n\nMari I, a 42-year-old El Salvadoran who declined to give her last name, told ABC News, \"We are talking about a real purge. El Salvador arrested more than 70,000 people including thousands of children,\" she said. \"[Bukele] has no idea what human rights means.\"\n\nFollowing the crackdown on crime, El Salvador reported 7.8 murders per 100,000 in 2022, one of the lowest in Latin America, down from 103.6 murders in 2015, one of the highest in the world.\n\nSome observers say the efforts have done little to enact meaningful change in the country.\n\nA second group of 2,000 detainees are moved to the mega-prison Terrorist Confinement Centre (CECOT), March 15, 2023, in Tecoluca, El Salvador. Presidencia El Salvador via Getty Images\n\n\"Because there's so much joy around being able to feel safe right now people don't want to think about what else might be happening behind the scenes that might really be mostly about supporting those who have always been in power in the country,\" said UCLA Professor Leisy Abrego, who was born in El Salvador.\n\nBukele has previously defended his administration from accusations he is governing in an authoritarian manner. Amid criticism from the Biden administration over his dismissal of judges on the Constitutional Court, Bukele tweeted \"[to] our friends in the International Community ... with all respect, we are cleaning our house ... and that's none of your business.\"\n\nA spokesperson's for Bukele's office did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nThe changes have drawn praise from some investors. Jack Mallers, the founder of Bitcoin payment provider Strike, says he believes the country is full of potential. Mallers says he advised Bukele on the country's cryptocurrency initiatives and Strike's global operations are based out of El Salvador.\n\n\"I liked the analogy that El Salvador is attempting to become, maybe the Latin American Singapore of sorts,\" he said. \"They're very tough on crime. They're very pro technology and innovation. They want to harbor entrepreneurs, businesses to innovate to create, they're very naturally rich and their resources, they're right on the water, they have beautiful land, they have a lot of natural resources they can utilize, and they've become an attraction to those that believe deeply in Bitcoin.\"\n\nPeople dance at Liberty Square in San Salvador, El Salvador, Dec. 1, 2023. Camilo Freedman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe country recently attracted the 2023 Miss Universe pageant to the country's capital, San Salvador.\n\n\"I was skeptical when they first approached us, particularly about safety. We've all seen the news stories in the United States,\" Miss Universe CEO Amy Emmerich told ABC News. \"But they just kept saying that we need to come and see what we're doing here for yourselves.\"\n\nEmmerich added that the government of El Salvador \"more than proved themselves as a partner.\"\n\nBut Bukele has continued raising concerns among his critics. He is currently on a six month leave from the presidency to campaign for reelection, despite a previous constitutional prohibition that forbids a president from running a second consecutive term. In 2021, El Salvador's Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber removed this ban, paving the way for Bukele to seek reelection.\n\nRoger Milano, a 36-year-old engineer in El Salvador, defended the government's reforms, telling ABC News, \"People can criticize as much as they want. I can walk freely in my city. It was not the case before. Bukele makes the difference between a criminal and a victim.\"\n\nABC News' Aicha El Hammar contributed to this report."

        "content": "Bitwise Prepping as if Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Coming\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer of crypto investment firm Bitwise Asset Management, said that while he's aware that regulators are yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, his team is \u201cpreparing as though there\u2019s going to be a launch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're preparing marketing and sales strategies and press and all those things, and we're working with regulators to try to push things ahead,\u201d he said in an interview with etf.com. \"But until you cross the finish line, you just don't know.\"\n\nAs the race to launch the first ETF that tracks physically backed cryptocurrency heats up, many firms are jockeying to grab market share, because multiple firms, including investment giants BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, could get Securities and Exchange Commission approval simultaneously. Bloomberg analysts give a 90% chance of a spot bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10.\n\nHougan said that he has met with regulators to discuss the firm\u2019s spot bitcoin filing in past months and that \u201call the firms\u201d are meeting with the SEC regularly.\n\nIndustry experts predict investors will pour billions into the funds once they are approved. Aspiring issuer VanEck, predicted $2.4 billion would flow in the first quarter after the funds' approval. Hougan sees more than $50 billion in the assets in the first five years after the ETFs launch and projected the funds will become among the \u201cmost successful ETF launches of all time.\u201d\n\nYet Hougan noted that as opposed to the launch of bitcoin futures ETFs, a few players will win the vast majority of market share, not just one firm.\n\n\u201cThere's this perception in ETF land that it's winner take all and that\u2019s built on a history where an ETF came to market first,\u201d he said. \u201c[But what] are the examples where ETFs lined up in Washington all at the same time? \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nHougan expressed confidence that Bitwise, which has $10 million in assets under management in four ETFs, can compete with big firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity, saying that Bitwise\u2019s crypto-centric approach and work with financial advisors will set it apart.\n\nStory continues\n\nHougan added he would be surprised if every firm filing with the SEC actually launches a product\u2014even if they are all approved\u2014pointing to formidable infrastructure and legal hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt's pretty easy to file, but it's not as easy to launch, and it's not as easy to sustain,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest Bitwise ETF that trades on U.S. markets is the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC) with $4.6 million under management.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "El Salvador\u2019s ambitious plan to issue $1 billion in sovereign \u201cVolcano Bonds\u201d backed by Bitcoin has cleared a significant obstacle, bringing the pioneering offering closer to fruition, according to a recent Coindesk report. The country\u2019s nascent Digital Assets Commission (CNAD) has granted regulatory approval for the bonds issued in early 2024 through Bitfinex Securities.\n\nThe approval represents a watershed moment for the experimental bonds first unveiled by President Nayib Bukele in 2021 following his government\u2019s historic adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender. Enshrined in legislation passed by a vast parliamentary majority, the bonds are intended to allow El Salvador to tap financial markets to build a geothermal-powered Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n\nInitially slated for issuance in 2022, complications surrounding El Salvador\u2019s negotiations with the IMF and designing a unique regulatory framework for the asset-backed offering delayed the bonds. Receiving the green light from CNAD, established in 2021 to govern El Salvador\u2019s crypto industry, is seen as an affirmation that the country has managed to construct a robust architecture for crypto financial innovation.\n\nEl Salvador is positioning itself at the bleeding edge of digital asset adoption.\n\nPositioning itself at the bleeding edge of digital asset adoption, El Salvador is moving forward with the bonds despite Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and the collapse of FTX demonstrating crypto\u2019s risks. The Bukele administration views pioneering government adoption as a differentiator that enhances El Salvador\u2019s investment attractiveness.\n\nIf successfully executed, the value of the bonds will be hedged to price stability while offering an attractive 6.5% coupon paid out in US dollars. The underlying bitcoin will be held in a transparent public wallet open to scrutiny, with El Salvador legally bound to redeem the bonds in traditional currency.\n\nThe issuance still faces challenges, like drumming up $1 billion in investment for an unproven crypto instrument issued by a developing economy. However, by clearing regulatory barriers, the Volcano Bonds have taken a major leap toward introducing the globe\u2019s inaugural Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt.\n\nFeatured Image: Pexels"

        "title": "Are your lost bitcoins gone forever? Here's how you might be able to recover them - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While Bitcoin spent the last decade soaring and making millionaires out of many people, other owners of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency have missed out. Why? One major reason: they\u2019ve lost access to their account. In fact, more than $100 billion in Bitcoin is estimated to be lost \u2013 but some is recoverable, says at least one firm.\n\nA 2020 report from Chainalysis, a forensics company, estimated that about 3.7 million bitcoins have been lost. That\u2019s out of a total of about 19.6 million in existence today, and a maximum supply of 21 million tokens when Bitcoin is fully mined. At the high end, that could be about 19 percent of today\u2019s supply that is gone forever. Or is it?\n\nTraders who have lost access to their Bitcoin or other digital currencies and assets may have the ability to recover them, at least with the help of one high-tech firm.\n\nBitcoins may be recoverable\n\nBitcoin\u2019s vaunted security cuts both ways, preventing the bad guys from getting your stash but also \u2013 and often \u2013 you, too!\n\nOne of the most highly touted aspects of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is their security. Not only are they nearly impossible to counterfeit, but transactions are almost irrevocable. Once someone has your bitcoins, they own them for keeps. It\u2019s a similar situation if you forget your password, it gets tossed out as part of a move or you throw away a hard drive holding the coins.\n\nBut Chris and Charlie Brooks, father-and-son founders of CryptoAssetRecovery.com, have been recovering Bitcoin and other digital assets since 2017 for people who have lost their passwords, despite the high security.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that about 2.5 percent of that approximately 20 percent of lost coins could still be recovered,\u201d says Chris Brooks. The figure amounts to as much as $4 billion in recoverable assets with Bitcoin trading near $44,000, he says.\n\nOf course, not all digital assets are recoverable. Corrupted hard drives or those that were thrown away are likely gone for good. But Crypto Asset Recovery says it has a decent chance of getting your lost loot back if you had encrypted private keys but forgot your password or if you had a failed hard drive with private keys.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, even if you have a wallet and they are able to pry it open, you may not have any coins in it at all. Former Bitcoin owners who dabbled in the cryptocurrency years ago may simply be hoping that they had long-lost treasure left on that old hard drive but weren\u2019t certain and decided to have a look just in case.\n\n\u201cAbout half the wallets we crack are empty,\u201d according to Chris and Charlie.\n\nHow your trapped crypto can be retrieved from a locked digital wallet\n\nAll kinds of digital assets could be trapped on a hard drive somewhere \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin or any number of popular cryptocurrencies. But also increasingly trapped are NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which might be digital art, a collectible, music or something else. These are all potentially recoverable.\n\nThe typical success story at Crypto Asset Recovery involves \u201can early Bitcoin adopter with a Blockchain crypto wallet,\u201d says Charlie Brooks. These wallets are more than half of what they see. An early enthusiast may have purchased a few coins and then forgotten about them. But now with a single bitcoin trading for big money, even just a few coins could be a nice haul.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve been contacted, Crypto Asset Recovery consults with customers, asks their best guesses for passwords and gets to work. Even if you only know part of your password or have a general idea of what it might be, the odds of accessing your lost crypto assets go up significantly.\n\nFrom there the team tries to \u201cbrute force\u201d your account, trying all kinds of potential passwords based on your suggestions.\n\n\u201cWe might run tens of millions to hundreds of billions of password variations before we get it, or we decide that it\u2019s not worth putting more computational resources into it,\u201d says Chris Brooks.\n\nWatch out for scammers advertising asset recovery services\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of the work, you may have to trust an asset recovery firm with potential passwords to your crypto account, which you may also be using elsewhere.\n\nThe promise of getting access to your lost bitcoins may entice even the most cynical owner to let down their guard around those who promise to help them retrieve their money. That\u2019s easy to do if you may have hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars, locked in a digital wallet somewhere.\n\nBut officials caution consumers to carefully verify any asset recovery firm they hire. Many supposed firms are simply scammers who access your account and then run off with the proceeds, if they can even access your account. They may ask for a fee upfront to do the work, with the promise that you\u2019ll eventually get your cryptocurrency and then run off with that cash.\n\nThe scams are highly sophisticated, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Scammers may even issue press releases and fake testimonials that seem to vouch for their asset recovery services.\n\nOfficials point to several red flags that consumers should pay attention to:\n\nYou\u2019re charged a fee before any services are provided.\n\nThe physical address for the firm is not provided or it\u2019s located outside the U.S.\n\nThe firm does not have a phone number and you\u2019re asked to communicate through chat apps.\n\nThe firm asks for your bank account details so that the recovered money can be deposited there.\n\nThose are some of the most important signs, though the CFTC offers other warning signs and tips to stay safe.\n\n3 common ways crypto traders lose access to their coins\n\nCryptocurrency has grown immensely popular over the last few years, and it\u2019s a trendy trading vehicle for many young people who are new to investing. A 2021 Bankrate survey revealed that nearly half of millennial Americans were at least somewhat comfortable with owning cryptocurrencies. But regardless of age, crypto traders may be unfamiliar with the different ways these digital assets can be held, meaning they could lock themselves out of their account.\n\nCryptocurrency owners can lose access to their assets in a variety of ways, and here are some of the biggest.\n\n1. Not fully understanding how custody works\n\nUnlike traditional assets such as stocks or bonds that are always held for you at a brokerage, cryptocurrency can be held directly by owners using a cryptocurrency wallet or a trading firm may hold them on your behalf. But this difference is crucial to recovering your assets.\n\nIf a firm has custody of digital assets for you, then you can work through its system to recover access to your assets. So it\u2019s like a traditional investment firm in this way. You can verify your identity and the company will reset your password, and you\u2019re ready to roll again.\n\nBut if you take custody of your digital assets, you won\u2019t have that luxury. Unfortunately, many of those who are new to cryptocurrency don\u2019t understand when they\u2019ve taken custody of their assets and the responsibilities that entails. To access your self-custodied assets you\u2019ll need your seed phrase, a collection of 12 to 24 words generated by your crypto wallet.\n\nBecause of the potential dangers of holding assets yourself, Chris and Charlie Brooks strongly recommend that those new to cryptocurrency sign up with a custodial wallet. With a custodial wallet, you could contact your trading firm and access your cryptocurrency relatively easily.\n\n\u201cUnderstand what is required to manage a Bitcoin wallet before diving in,\u201d says Charlie.\n\n2. Losing your seed phrase\n\nPeople misunderstand the risks with crypto, says Charlie. \u201cThe much more likely risk for most people is that they lose their seed phrase \u2013 not that it\u2019s stolen from a hacker, though that happens, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe largest misconception that gets people into trouble is not understanding that the seed phrase is a representation of your private key,\u201d says Chris Brooks. \u201cIf you lose that, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Many people don\u2019t realize that the seed phrase is that important, he says.\n\nThe seed phrase unlocks your wallet as well as all your crypto in the wallet. So it\u2019s vital that you maintain access to this seed phrase. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a bank account with a password that they can just reset,\u201d says Chris.\n\nMoving is a really common time for someone to lose their seed phrases, they say, but there\u2019s a simple solution.\n\n\u201cBuy a $30 safe from Amazon and store your seed phrases in there,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cYou need a place to keep them so that no one will think \u2018Hey, I need to throw this away.\u2019\u201d\n\n3. Self-sabotage\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles we face is that clients self-sabotage,\u201d says Chris.\n\nSelf-sabotage occurs when people try to fix the issues themselves and only succeed in making things worse.\n\n\u201cAbout 30 to 40 percent of the folks that we can work with have hard drive issues from an old laptop,\u201d says Chris. \u201cThey reformatted it or gave it away, for example.\u201d\n\nBut the solution here is relatively simple: \u201cStop touching stuff \u2013 don\u2019t reformat or reinstall a wallet,\u201d says Chris. Resist the urge to try to fix something, because you will likely end up making it worse.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile it appears that a substantial portion of Bitcoin is lost to the sands of time, your crypto stash may not be a casualty. So it may be worth your time to see if you can recover your lost assets. And it\u2019s certainly always worthwhile to understand what you need to do to correctly manage your account so that you don\u2019t run into trouble in the future."

        "title": "Are These Bitcoin's 2 Biggest Risks? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "One of the best-performing assets recently has been Bitcoin (BTC -5.97%). This top digital asset has seen its price skyrocket despite gut-wrenching volatility.\n\nAfter a bear market rattled cryptocurrencies in 2022, it's been a bounce-back year in 2023. As of the afternoon of Dec. 8, Bitcoin is up 160% year to date. The optimism surrounding the world's most valuable crypto is high right now.\n\nBut while it's easy to be bullish, Bitcoin HODLers must always be aware of the downside, as this is still a very early-stage technology with an uncertain future. Along the same vein, here are what I view as Bitcoin's two biggest risks.\n\n1. Government ban\n\nThe most obvious risk is that governments worldwide could ban Bitcoin, making it illegal to own or mine. This has happened in China, the world's second-largest economy.\n\nFor a completely digital asset like Bitcoin, a ban is more difficult to implement and enforce than physical gold, for example. But regulatory authorities can shut down centralized on-ramps into Bitcoin, like Coinbase or Block, making it that much harder to buy or sell.\n\nThe fear is that a major developed economy, like the U.S., in particular, will move to ban Bitcoin in some form or fashion. That's because Bitcoin, as a decentralized monetary network, threatens the entire existence of the Federal Reserve. A government's power is derived from its ability to control the money supply and tax its citizens. If Bitcoin gains in adoption, it could undermine this entire system.\n\nBut if the U.S. bans Bitcoin, I think people would be more inclined to want to own it because that would be an admission that it is something of value. Moreover, as a global asset, Bitcoin activity will just shift to a more friendly jurisdiction.\n\nTo be clear, it's becoming less likely that the U.S. will go this route. For starters, there's a risk of falling behind other countries when it comes to Bitcoin-related innovation. As more of the wealthy class starts to own Bitcoin, especially politicians and those who donate to political parties, the chance Bitcoin gets banned diminishes.\n\n2. Quantum computing\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin is basically just a massive database that keeps track of a history of transactions. The beauty of the network is that it is operated by a global and decentralized group of tens of thousands of computers, all running Bitcoin's software. Not having a central point of failure helps make the system antifragile.\n\nBut there could be a potential risk factor regarding Bitcoin's security: quantum computing. This is, essentially, an extremely powerful computer that can solve complex problems more rapidly than the strongest machines that exist today.\n\nIf these types of computers become cheaper to build in larger quantities, a bad actor could crack Bitcoin's cryptography, exposing everyone's private keys. And whoever does this would then be able to spend all this Bitcoin. At that point, no one would trust the network, likely causing Bitcoin's price to fall to $0.\n\nIt's hard to tell when we could see quantum computers go mainstream, but I believe the worries for Bitcoin are overblown. Developers aren't sitting around idle. They could come together to introduce technological updates to strengthen the network over time.\n\nAnd think of all the other mission-critical information that could be exposed by quantum computers besides Bitcoin. Financial information and even military secrets could be revealed. This could have far worse ramifications for society.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Bitcoin's network has never been hacked. The stories you've likely heard comprise of exchanges experiencing a data breach or something similar. Nonetheless, this proves that protecting data in an increasingly digital world is absolutely crucial. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of cyberattacks has nearly doubled from 878 in 2020 to 1,595 in 2022.\n\nEven the strongest Bitcoin bulls shouldn't ignore these two major risk factors."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure. During VettaFi\u2019s Alternatives Symposium on November 28th, industry experts discussed their positive outlook for crypto in 2024.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Cryptocurrencies Data (through December 12, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price slipped to $41,000 over the last few days but remains up ~150% year to date. Explore two of the factors behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge.\n\nXRP\u2019s current price is little changed compared to last week and is currently up ~82% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price jumped during the past week, reaching almost as high as $2,400, but has since fallen to ~$2,200. ETH is now up ~83% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "Fairlead Strategies: Bitcoin has bullish outlook despite pullback - CNBC",
        "content": "Things are still looking up for bitcoin despite an eye-popping drop in its price at the beginning of this week, according to Fairlead Strategies. Bitcoin fell 7% Monday as traders took profits from a two-month rally now at 54%, according to Coin Metrics. The selling took place days after bitcoin surpassed the $40,000 level, rising above $44,000 quickly for the first time since April 2022. On Tuesday, it was trading at about $41,000. That could just be a blip in the chart, however. \"It has yet to impact our short-term trend-following gauges, which point higher,\" Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner, said in a chart update Tuesday. She also said momentum in the intermediate term remains \"strongly positive,\" which suggests overbought conditions \"can be sustained without a major pullback in the weeks ahead.\" The drop began Sunday evening and at its lowest, pulled bitcoin down to $40,300, according to Coinbase. It'd have to fall even further, however, to warrant more concern by investors. Stockton said she's watching bitcoin's 50-day moving average, roughly $37,400, as the initial support level. Other chart analysts put it at $38,000 . The next level down is near $31,000, but Stockton said that's \"unlikely to be relevant near term.\" When prices reach new highs, Fairlead typically looks for them to sustain the new level for two weeks. The firm is looking to see if bitcoin can close this Sunday above $42,200 to confirm its recent breakout. That would make the next level higher to watch at about $48,600, which would be a 61.8% retracement, Stockton said in the note. Fairlead currently has a long-term neutral outlook on bitcoin. If the crypto can clear $42,700 for the month, that would support a shift to a long-term bullish bias, Stockton said. The key drivers that have been pushing crypto prices higher since the summer are still in place: primarily, the highly anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in the spring. Bitcoin may be the blue chip coin of the crypto market, but it's still a high risk bet compared to more traditional assets. Volatility is a key characteristic of the asset class, and pullbacks of as much as 10% are somewhat expected among more seasoned investors when bitcoin has big rallies. Bitcoin is currently up 9% in December, not a particularly strong month for bitcoin historically. It has gained 150% in 2023."

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -5.86% saw a second day of decline despite major equities posting an uptick after U.S. data showed November's inflation reading to be in line with expectations.\n\nThe world's largest digital asset by market capitalization slumped lower, down over 1.3% to trade at $41,283 at 10:40 a.m. ET. That came in contrast to early trading on Wall Street that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.2%, the S&P 500 gain 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite increase 0.1%.\n\nCPI rises 3.1% in November, as expected\n\nTuesday's inflation reading by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices across a broad range of U.S. goods and services edged higher in November but were mostly in line with expectations.\n\nThe reading could be encouraging investor anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the consumer price index increased 0.1% in November and was up 3.1% from a year ago. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 0.3% on the month and 4% from a year ago. Both numbers were in line with estimates and little changed from October. However, the figures are still far above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nPossibility of continued Fed rate pause\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nAccording to YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha, the market is expecting another rate pause at tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee. \"Such a decision will mean that everything is following Powell's plan toward a soft landing, but at the same time, the chairman's rhetoric may adjust market expectations, and may provoke a temporary correction,\" Lienkha told The Block.\n\nAccording to analysts at Bitfinex, the effect of a continued rate pause will not be limited to traditional markets but will extend to the cryptocurrency sector. \"Cryptocurrencies have previously experienced positive market movements following decisions by the Fed to keep interest rates steady. This trend is attributable to the perception of lower or steady interest rates leading to increased disposable income for investments, fostering an optimistic investment environment,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block\n\nInflation is still 'entrenched'\n\nHowever, one analyst believes U.S. inflation is becoming \u201centrenched\u201d and predicts the Federal Reserve will have a battle on its hands in 2024 and may still hike rates one more time.\n\n\"With services sector inflation now entrenched, and the labor market continuing to run incredibly hot, we expect to see inflation spike to 3.5% in December, which could lead to another rate hike from the Federal Reserve in 2024,\" Truflation Head of Product Oliver Rust said in a note sent to The Block.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool has set the probability of a rate pause at tomorrow's FOMC meeting at 98.5%."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to trade below its 2023 high, a sign that investors may have underestimated the strength of the $44,000 resistance. Even as BTC price trades below $42,000, it doesn't necessarily mean that reaching $50,000 and beyond is no longer possible. In fact, quite the opposite seems more likely to occur. Looking at Bitcoin derivatives metrics, it is clear that traders ignored the 6.9% drop and remained optimistic. However, is this optimism enough to justify further gains?\n\nThe $127 million liquidation of leveraged long Bitcoin futures on Dec. 11 may seem significant in absolute terms, but it represents less than 1% of the total open interest \u2013 the value of all outstanding contracts. Nevertheless, it's undeniable that the liquidation engine triggered a 7% correction in less than 20 minutes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s crash was accelerated by derivatives, at least in the short-term\n\nOn one hand, one could argue that derivatives markets played a crucial role in the recent negative price movement. However, this analysis overlooks the fact that after hitting a low of $40,200 on Dec. 11, Bitcoin's price increased by 4.2% in the following six trading hours. In essence, the impact of forceful liquidation orders had dissipated long ago, disproving the notion of a crash solely driven by futures markets.\n\nTo determine if Bitcoin whales and market makers are still bullish, traders should examine Bitcoin futures premium, also known as the basis rate. Professional traders prefer monthly contracts due to their fixed funding rate. In neutral markets, these instruments trade at a premium of 5% to 10% to account for their extended settlement period.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nData reveals that the BTC futures premium barely fluctuated despite the 9% intraday price drop on Dec. 11, as it remained above the 10% neutral-to-bullish threshold throughout. If there had been significant excess demand for shorts, the metric would have at least dropped into the neutral 5% to 10% range.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to gauge whether the recent correction has dampened investor optimism. The 25% delta skew is a telling indicator when arbitrage desks and market makers charge excessively for upside or downside protection.\n\nIf traders expect a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and periods of excitement tend to result in a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs shown above, the BTC options skew has been neutral since Dec. 5, indicating a balanced cost for both call (buy) and put (sell) options. It's not as optimistic as the prior couple of weeks when put options traded at a 10% discount, but it at least shows resilience after the 6.1% correction since Dec. 10.\n\nRetail traders remained neutral-to-bullish despite Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuations\n\nAfter covering two of the most relevant indicators for institutional flow, one should analyze whether retail traders using leverage influenced the price action. Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, include an embedded rate that is typically recalculated every eight hours.\n\nBitcoin perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Coinglass\n\nA positive funding rate indicates increased demand for leverage among long positions. Notice that data reveals a modest increase between Dec. 8 and Dec. 10 to 0.045%, equivalent to 0.9% per week, which is neither significant nor burdensome for most traders to maintain their positions.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin bond gets regulatory approval, targets Q1 launch\n\nSuch data is quite healthy, considering that Bitcoin's price has surged by 52% since October. It suggests that excessive retail leverage longs didn't drive the rally and subsequent liquidations.\n\nWhatever caused the rally to $44,700 and its subsequent correction to the current $41,300 appears to be primarily driven by the spot market. This doesn't necessarily mean that the bottom is in, but it significantly reduces the odds of cascading liquidations due to excessive optimism tied to the expectation of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval.\n\nIn essence, this is good news for Bitcoin bulls, as derivatives indicate that positive momentum hasn't faded despite the price correction.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin's water consumption: A new environmental threat? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, has long been under scrutiny for its environmental impact due to the energy-intensive nature of its mining process.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has never been hacked. Its tight security, provided by its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, provides value to the cryptocurrency.\n\nPoW, however, is energy-intensive and relies on complex cryptographic algorithms requiring vast computational power.\n\nThe global popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) has resulted in its network energy consumption sitting at 147.61 terawatt-hours per year as of Dec. 7, close to the yearly average energy consumption of countries such as Poland, Ukraine and Malaysia, according to the University of Cambridge.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s PoW consensus mechanism has become an immutable security guarantee, but some see it as an environmental nightmare.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin mining industry increasingly shifts to renewable energy sources to address these concerns, new studies now point toward another ecological problem: the high water consumption of crypto mining.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s growing thirst for water\n\nA recent study titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s growing water footprint,\u201d authored by Alex de Vries \u2014 a data analyst and researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) \u2014 found that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption has the potential to harm the environment.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry has grown yearly and continues to reach new all-time high hash rates. This trend is set to continue as the price of BTC surges.\n\nAs with any computer, cooling is essential for mining devices to work optimally.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs have hundreds of machines that reach very high temperatures as they try to solve the complex mathematical challenges PoW presents.\n\nWater is often used for cooling systems and air humidification systems. Additionally, water may be indirectly used to generate electricity.\n\nAs the study states, \u201cThe water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly increased by 166% compared with 2020.\u201d\n\nDe Vries admits the challenge of quantifying the direct water footprint due to limited public information. However, with the retrieved data combining direct and indirect water consumption, he estimates that the total annual water footprint for United States Bitcoin miners could range from 93 to 120 gigalitres (GL), equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around 300,000 U.S. households.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US\n\nFurthermore, Riot Platforms, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, is constructing a new mining facility in Texas, which will raise the total water footprint to 121.2\u2013147.8 GL, as per de Vries.\n\nBased on all the collected data, de Vries told the BBC that every Bitcoin transaction uses, on average, enough water to fill a backyard swimming pool. As he outlines in his study:\n\n\u201cWith the network handling 113 million transactions in 2020 and 96.7 million in 2021, the water footprint per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for those years amounted to 5,231 and 16,279 L, respectively.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, de Vries told the BBC that an estimated 6 million times as much water is consumed with each Bitcoin transaction than is used in a typical credit card swipe. The statement was based upon data from another recent report titled \u201cThe water and carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies.\u201d Per his calculations, conventional cashless transactions consume about 2.6 milliliters of water.\n\nDe Vries further introduces a controversial solution for the heavy resource consumption of Bitcoin: changing its validation protocol from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nEthereum recently made this crucial change, reducing its energy demand by 99%. But with it came an unavoidable expense: centralization. One of Bitcoin\u2019s core existential values is to remain decentralized and independent of any dominating party.\n\nIs the cost per transaction really accurate?\n\nFor ClimateTech investor Daniel Batten, this study is biased, as de Vries is an employee of the DNB, the Dutch Central Bank. As Batten stated on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nWhy the @BBCNews article on Bitcoin and Water is a monument to journalistic lazinesshttps://t.co/BRGRXzAeBW\n\n\n\nThe day after the Independent publish the results of a high quality independent study on Bitcoin, the BBC publish the junk-science of a known anti-Bitcoin lobbyist using\u2026 \u2014 Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) November 29, 2023\n\nBatten opposes de Vries\u2019 solution of switching Bitcoin to PoS, telling Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s energy usage has the potential to be a positive environmental externality on its own merits, because that energy use is predominantly sustainable, highly flexible, incentivizing renewable development (backed up by research and quantified now), using curtailed and stranded energy that others cannot, stabilizing the intermittency of renewable power on grids and, most importantly, allowing us to mitigate methane. PoS-based blockchains have none of these potential use cases.\u201d\n\nBatten also pointed out that Cambridge University has previously argued that criticizing Bitcoin based on the supposed energy cost per transaction is not entirely accurate, as \u201ctransaction throughput (i.e., the number of transactions that the system can process) is independent of the network\u2019s electricity consumption. Adding more mining equipment and thus increasing electricity consumption will have no impact on the number of processed transactions.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain could include hundreds of payments or \u201c\u200b\u200brepresent billions of timestamped data points using open protocols.\u201d\n\nHe contended that measuring the water use per transaction could therefore be similarly misleading.\n\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that the indicator is simply \u201can efficiency metric that captures the average water use per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for the years 2020 and 2021.\u201d\n\nBatten also claimed that no recent studies about Bitcoin\u2019s usage of renewable energy or similar positive aspects of crypto mining were considered in de Vries\u2019 reports.\n\nBitcoin mining can help nations with water scarcity\n\nIt is undeniable that Bitcoin mining requires a high amount of energy. Any industrial process that consumes energy will result in water consumption. However, unlike many other industries, Bitcoin mining is location-agnostic. Therefore, Bitcoin miners can operate virtually anywhere where electricity and the internet are available.\n\nBatten demonstrates in his blog how Bitcoin mining could, in theory, actually help countries facing water scarcity, noting it is estimated that almost 20 countries will suffer from high or extremely high water scarcity by 2040.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa are among the driest locations on earth. In this region, the situation is extreme, with a constant decline in rainfall in the last 30 years, which has resulted in nations using more water than they receive.\n\nAs David Hannah, a professor of hydrology at the University of Birmingham, told CNBC, the Middle East \u201chas very limited conventional water resources, and some of the groundwater resources are saline.\u201d\n\nThese countries have begun to use desalination, but making potable water through this process is expensive and energy-intensive.\n\nNaturally, the Middle East is the region most reliant on desalination. The industry is critical for residents\u2019 survival, so countries such as the United Arab Emirates have made ambitious plans to power these desalination plants. The UAE is in the process of constructing one of the most extensive solar infrastructures in the world, aiming for a capacity of 5 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nConsidering this information, how could Bitcoin mining benefit countries with water scarcity that require desalination? Batten builds his argument on two points.\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin miners could accelerate the buildout of renewable power for desalination. Any electricity provider will encounter the issue of excess capacity. The overproduced energy cannot be stored easily, so it becomes wasted if no consumers or buyers are available.\n\nRenewable energies such as solar power create virtually infinite electricity but do so irregularly. Additionally, the ideal location for producing energy may be isolated from its consumers.\n\nBitcoin miners are the perfect fit, as they are potential buyers of excess solar-powered electricity. This fact may accelerate the setup of new solar energy capacity, as developers can rest assured they have potential buyers to rely on before launching the project. Consequently, Bitcoin mining can help transition to renewable-powered desalination, and the UAE could meet its water security goals without endangering its emission-reduction goals.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin mining may increase the efficiency of the operational production of desalination. Efficiency gains in operating costs mean water can be desalinated close to the operating cost.\n\nBoth technologies can complement each other. Heat is used directly for desalination, and almost 100% of the energy used by Bitcoin mining rigs is transformed into heat.\n\nRecent: One-hour Bitcoin block times: What do they mean and are they frequent?\n\nThe emanated heat energy can be used directly for desalination, but with the caveat of earning revenue from Bitcoin mining. In conclusion, there is an improvement in the water-per-dollar ratio, resulting in more water desalinated for the same net cost.\n\nOverall, a point critics of Bitcoin mining tend to miss is the potential adoption by the renewable energy industry.\n\nBitcoin: To be or not to be\n\nBitcoin has long had a negative public image regarding its environmental impact. One way to promote its benefits and usability is to present empirical facts demonstrating that crypto mining can utilize all energy created and result in favorable economics.\n\nAccording to Batten, the Bitcoin mining narrative is already starting to shift. For him, \u201cthe higher use of sustainable energy, better data visibility and quality independent reporting, and publications such as the KPMG and IRM [Institute of Risk Management] reports and the ACS Sustainability Journal \u2014 authored by a decorated scientist who is highly regarded in his field \u2014 showing how Bitcoin mining \u2018supercharges\u2019 the renewable transition\u201d could be a catalyst for this new era for Bitcoin\u2019s public image.\n\nThe dilemma is whether Bitcoin or a decentralized digital currency is considered a valuable tool for global society. If not, then Bitcoin\u2019s mining energy is a complete waste. If yes, then its energy usage is a necessary investment for a future with a currency for the people."

        "title": "What to Expect from Bitcoin in 2024 - Morningstar",
        "content": "Valerio Baselli: Hello and welcome to Morningstar. 2024 could be a breakthrough year for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. To talk about that, today I'm joined by Ophelia Snyder. She is president and co-founder of 21Shares, the world's largest issuer of crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nSo, Ophelia, after the crypto winter experience in 2022, the crypto space has rebounded sharply, with Bitcoin up 140% for the year-to-date. Now, as 2024 approaches, investors are wondering whether this is just a flash in the pan or whether something fundamental has changed. What is your take on that? Do you think this positive trend on Bitcoin will continue overall next year?\n\nOphelia Snyder: I do. The market overall has changed quite significantly. There are a number of catalysts as we're heading into next year, which really do change the way crypto markets work and the Bitcoin order book and how we look at Bitcoin markets. Bitcoin halving is being coupled with an already quite illiquid supply, at the same point in time where we are expecting increased institutional adoption through the spot Bitcoin ETF, as well as increased adoption, potentially through another nation state, namely Argentina, incorporating Bitcoin more fully into their monetary policy. That combination of features is quite bullish in terms of providing both regulatory clarity as well as increased demand. The regulatory clarity is coming in a couple of formats. It's both a cleanup of some of the overhang from black swan events in the prior year, whether that's FTX and Binance. A lot of those situations are now becoming resolved. And I think that's kept a real dampener on sentiment in the market, which we're now seeing come off as a lot of those actions are now reaching their end. And it's positioning the market for a really interesting 2024.\n\nBaselli: Of course. You mentioned it, along with ARK Invest, 21Shares has the first application in the latest batch of bids to get a landmark spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, with BlackRock, Fidelity and others following. So, why would such approval be so important for the market? And what about being possibly the first issuer?\n\nSnyder: So, from a market perspective, the ETF is a really easy, simple to use on-ramp. And we've had them in other jurisdictions, especially in Europe for many years. Actually, the company is celebrating five years of offering these types of products. So, this is absolutely not our first try in this product category. And then, we're obviously a market leader in Europe.\n\nOne of the reasons this is such a big deal is that it helps provide both some of that regulatory clarity that I just mentioned, but also just an easier way for people to buy these products. And I think there's been a lot of focus on retail in the context of these ETFs. But actually, these are really important institutional tools. It provides simple solutions to custody, to trading, to tax, to tax reporting, to advisors' fiduciary obligations in America around how they do these allocations. That's a very, very big structural change.\n\nI think we'll likely see multiple issuers come to market hopefully early next year with products like these. And I think it's going to be very important to look at how these different issuers position themselves. I mean, for us, we've been doing this for many years. We were bringing that operational expertise to market and we're quite excited about it and hopefully seeing some real changes here.\n\nBaselli: Right. So institutional investment, regulation, artificial intelligence, which one of these trends will be dominant in the crypto space next year, in your view? And do you see any other possible drivers?\n\nSnyder: Regulations are an interesting one because I actually think that's a lot of what's happening right now. I think in the coming months we'll see that come to a head and complete its current cycle. But I think it's one of those things that once it's done, it's not going to be an ongoing driver of valuation. I think AI is really interesting because essentially AI and blockchain are very important compliments to each other and I think AI is taking over the world.\n\nThe reason I see them as so complimentary is that it's suddenly going to become really important to be able to prove that you're a person, to prove that you are who you say you are, to prove you aren't a machine, to ascertain ownership of certain things, or even as simply as to allow two computers to enter into a legally binding agreement together without a human being involved in that interaction. All of those types of things can really be enabled through blockchain tech. And I think that's going to be a big question we as a society need to answer in the coming months and years. And I think blockchain will play an important role in that discussion.\n\nBaselli: Very interesting. Finally, after that, the US authorities filed a lawsuit against Binance and other exchanges in June. A couple of weeks ago, Binance basically pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a roughly $4 billion settlement. Is this a watershed for the future of crypto world in your view? And more broadly, what is your judgment on the whole thing?\n\nSnyder: Maybe it's a contrarian opinion. I actually think it's great. Goes to regulatory clarity. I think the situation with Binance, and these lawsuits has been an overhang on the market for quite some time and a preoccupation of the market given some of the broken trust with other major institutions in the crypto space from the year prior. And I think this resolution is helpful. It's helpful for the market to move forward.\n\nI think we'll see more of that. I think a lot of these lawsuits are beginning to get cleaned up. Some of the stuff that's happening with XRP, you're seeing some early indications from the discussions with Coinbase and the SEC \u2013 I imagine also with Binance and the SEC who haven't settled yet in terms of providing that regulatory clarity. It's going to be an important component of the path forward. I think Binance is one piece of this, but if you take all the different elements of regulatory action that we've seen over the last 18 months and all the different events in crypto, I think together they make a watershed moment. I think they make for a change in how this market approaches regulation, approaches transparency and approaches its commitment to customers. I think that's a really positive thing for the industry as a whole.\n\nBaselli: Very clear. Thank you so much, Ophelia, for your time. For Morningstar, I'm Valerio Baselli. Thanks for watching."

It recently performed poorly in S&P Global\u2019s stablecoin stability assessment, with the second-lowest ranking out of eight U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins.\n\nThe assessment factored in the firm\u2019s management of assets, audits, risk appetite, primary market redeemability, secondary market payment rails and track record with maintaining its U.S. dollar peg.\n\nDespite the wariness around its long-term stability, Lutnick suggested Tether could benefit currency-collapsing countries like Argentina, where its new Bitcoin-friendly president, Javier Milei, has pledged to abolish the country\u2019s central bank and transition to the U.S. dollar.\n\nRelated: Ex-Cantor execs launch crypto lending platform in expectation of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSimilar ideas were echoed by James Check, lead on-chain analyst at blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, who referred to Tether as \u201cthe CBDC\u201d that will be controlled by the United States but could also be increasingly relied on by developing countries looking to dollarize.\n\nTether is the CBDC.\n\n\n\nTravis is dead on, if the USG can shut down Russia's reserves...hard to argue they are incapable of closing down tether's.\n\n\n\nMost probable reality is the USG just found an infinite bid for treasuries, exactly when they need a bail out from an unsustainable\u2026 https://t.co/0i903ARV9x \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \u26a1\u2622\ufe0f\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 13, 2023\n\nLutnick likes Bitcoin too\n\nThe CEO initially claimed that he was a \u201cfan of crypto\u201d but then backtracked to offer more specific praise for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\u201cThese other coins, they\u2019re not a thing [...] They\u2019re kind of make-believe, Maybe Ethereum is OK.\u201d\n\nLutnick referred to Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles and lack of a centralized entity as two main reasons he sees value in holding it.\n\n\u201cThe only asset people could have held where no one could take it?

        "content": "Update (Dec. 13, 12:05am): This article has been changed to reflect clarification from Luke Dashjr, who says he had requested Bitcoin inscriptions be given a CVE number, but did not have a part in it being added to the NVD.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions have received a 5.3 medium base severity score from the National Vulnerability Database \u2014 a repository of cybersecurity risks managed by the United States government.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions first appeared on the U.S. vulnerability database as part of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Assignment list on Dec. 9, which claimed it was a security flaw that enabled the development of the Ordinals protocol in 2022.\n\nOn Dec. 11, the NVD updated the listing by assigning inscriptions a base severity score of \u201c5.3 Medium.\u201d\n\nThe CVE List has assigned a 5.3 Medium score to the Inscriptions listing. Source: NVD\n\nAccording to data from software firm Atlassian, a medium score refers to a vulnerability where exploitation provides \u201cvery limited\u201d access to a network or denial of service attacks that are quite difficult to execute.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr said that a major factor in the NVD's 5.3 score was due to the vulnerability having a low availability impact on the Bitcoin network. Still, he argued the score could be understating its potential long-term effects.\n\n\u201cI think this [score] may understate the impact, failing to consider the long-term effects of blockchain bloat. If they had classified the availability impact as \u2018High,\u2019 the CVSS base score would be 7.5.\"\n\nWhile Dashjr has denied any part in getting Bitcoin inscriptions on the NVD, he admits he had initially requested the CVE number, which saw it added to the CVE list.\n\nNotably, the CVE list is designed so any developer can submit a potential vulnerability. It is typically listed as long as the CVE Assignment Team deems it important for public awareness. Once it receives a score from analysts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology it is then published on the NVD.\n\nDashjr courted controversy in a Dec. 6 post to X (formerly Twitter) claiming that inscriptions \u2014 used by the Ordinals protocol and BRC-20 creators to embed data on satoshis \u2014 exploit a Bitcoin Core vulnerability to \u201cspam the blockchain.\u201d\n\nPSA: \u201cInscriptions\u201d are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code,\u2026 \u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals could be stopped if blockchain bug is patched, claims dev\n\nThe debate around the nature of Bitcoin inscriptions continues to rage across social media. While many Bitcoiners claim that inscriptions are \u201cspamming the network,\u201d advocates of Ordinals such as Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wertheimer say Ordinals are crucial to the next major wave of adoption and revenue generation for the Bitcoin network.\n\nordinals are a bug pic.twitter.com/vU0CXgD9wY \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) December 12, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin network has seen increased congestion over the past few months due to a wider craze around Ordinals\u2019 nonfungible token inscriptions and BRC-20 token minting.\n\nAccording to mempool.space, there are more than 275,000 unconfirmed transactions, and average medium-priority transaction costs have increased to around $14 from roughly $1.50. If the so-called inscriptions bug is patched, it could potentially restrict future Ordinals inscriptions on the network.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

The droning, you can't sleep at night, it wakes you,' said Stephen Bodnar who lives about a mile away from the operation.\n\n'I have a little pond in front of my house where I used to sit and have my coffee at,' he added.\n\n'I can't even enjoy that because I can't even hear the water over the Bitcoin. It is louder than the waterfall.'\n\nTalen Energy won over locals with promises of hundreds of news jobs and an economic boom in the township of 6,000 when they announced plans for the operation last year.\n\n'Amazon, Google, all those cloud computing applications, those are the potential clients, customers that we will have in the data center buildings,' said Dustin Wertheimer, VP and Division CFO Talen Cumulus and Susquehanna Data Center.\n\n'On the coin mining side, there will be computers again located in those buildings and those computers will run computations that will trigger and generate the issuance of coins.'\n\nThe controversial cryptocurrency has been in the news again after a wild ride since the start of December.\n\nA rally last week saw it rise above $44,000 to reach its highest level in almost two years - then on Sunday it lost 6.5 percent of its value in just 20 minutes and dipped below $41,000.\n\nGlobal bank Standard Chartered thinks bitcoin could surpass $100,000 before the end of 2024 - yet well-known JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said last week that US lawmakers should 'close it down'.\n\nThe first 1,500 Bitcoins out of Salem Township were sold for $37.6 million after the 180 megawatt mine was plugged in this summer, but that was little consolation to residents at an angry town hall meeting on Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin was trading for $44,000 on Friday - the highest it had been in 20 months - before falling back down to about $40,500 on Sunday evening. It has since partially recovered\n\nThe power company sent director of operations Alex Brammer to promise that they are already working on making things quieter.\n\n'We're trying to do everything we possibly can to cut this down to as low as humanly possible,' he told them.\n\nHe said that most of the drone is coming from exhaust fans inside the building and promised a rebuild that will cut the noise in half by March of next year.\n\n'Well, I'm happy that they're doing this and they act like they actually care so, the proof is in the package,' said Bodnar."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt was the perfect viral story: an out-of-shape crypto billionaire was caught not just spending $62,000 a month on his favorite model\u2019s OnlyFans, but shortly thereafter tattooing her face on his leg. He also allegedly begged her for an open relationship in weeks worth of deranged, unanswered messages, and offered her 10 Bitcoin (almost $430,000) if she so much as texted him back.\n\nTurns out, it was all a little too perfect.\n\nDays after rapper and model Rubi Rose went viral for posting a string of text messages on Twitter that were purportedly from a desperate crypto whale\u2014who oscillated between professing \u201cI love you more than Bitcoin,\u201d screaming at her, and offering to follow her commands while wearing a \u201csissy maid outfit\u201d\u2014said lovestruck fan has now finally surfaced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd his side of the story sounds quite different from Rose's narrative.\n\ni ran into my #1 spender on onlyfans \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/5hH8b3IjqA \u2014 Rubi Rose (@RubiRose) December 1, 2023\n\nThe man, who also appeared in a photo with Rose tagged as her \u201c#1 spender,\u201d says he does not own thousands of Bitcoins, nor is he particularly wealthy. He\u2019s also never texted Rubi Rose in his life.\n\nHis name is Lamar, and he dogsits for porn stars.\n\nOn a podcast appearance yesterday, Lamar\u2014who didn\u2019t offer his last name due to privacy concerns\u2014claimed that he had never once used OnlyFans or engaged with Rubi Rose until weeks ago, when the rapper\u2019s agents approached him through mutual friends in the modeling industry and asked if he would be willing to take a photo with Rose for unknown purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLamar conceded he might have been offered the gig because he \u201clooks like a guy who would spend $63,000\" on a person he wasn't in a relationship with. But he says he engaged anyway after being offered an undisclosed payment. Soon after, he said he showed up at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood to snap dozens of photos with Rose, before getting smoked out and sent on his way.\n\nDays later, Lamar says, Rose\u2019s agents got back in touch, curious if he was willing to up the ante. Both parties eventually agreed that Lamar would get Rose\u2019s face tattooed on his leg, in exchange for a second, larger payment.\n\nLamar did not disclose the size of that follow-up fee, saying only that, in hindsight, he should have asked for more. Apparently in the midst of negotiations, Lamar sought the counsel of porn star Gina Valentina, whose one cat and four dogs he often watches. She reportedly told him to ask for no less than $15,000.\n\nLamar claims he got the tattoo, sent a video of it to the agents, and pushed the whole thing out of his mind.\n\nThen Rose made the post.\n\nTat my face on u so i know it\u2019s real pic.twitter.com/lE8pQrtwLx \u2014 Rubi Rose (@RubiRose) December 5, 2023\n\nRose\u2019s team inserted the real video of Lamar\u2019s tattoo together into a string of unhinged text messages that Lamar says he never wrote, triggering a viral phenomenon that whipped up outrage at wealth inequality, at male stalkers and sexual violence, and of course, at crypto. At writing, Rose\u2019s Twitter posts about Lamar have been viewed a total of 221 million times.\n\nLamar says he had no idea what Rose\u2019s team was planning to do with the content he made for them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what the storyline was,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was some \u2018Bitcoin billionaire.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the novelty of the experiment soon wore off, once he started being identified on the streets of Los Angeles as the supposed porn addict who said he\u2019d give up his crypto millions to be Rubi Rose\u2019s pet cuckold.\n\nHis friends\u2014many of whom work in the modeling and porn industries\u2014started asking him about the post, and questioning his character. Lamar says he couldn\u2019t sleep for days on end after the post was published.\n\nDecrypt reached out to Rose's representatives for comment, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for the dogsitter. He says he\u2019s since made peace with the ordeal, has no bitterness towards Rose, and that he intends to keep her face on his leg. And though he didn\u2019t make nearly as much as she presumably did off the Twitter posts, he\u2019s already cooking up ways to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThe hosts of the \u201cUgly Inside\u201d podcast\u2014on which Lamar appeared\u2014suggested Tuesday that he should double down on the crypto angle of the whole saga, and start selling trading courses.\n\n\u201cYou should scam them all,\u201d one host suggested. \u201cSay \u2018This is King Cuck, the Bitcoin guy,\u2019 sign them up [for] $10,000 each\u2026 and then just copy a course from YouTube.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually already started that,\u201d Lamar replied.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "In November, the cybersecurity collective vx-underground wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that unknown hackers were claiming to have breached Coin Cloud, a bankrupt Bitcoin ATM company.\n\nAccording to vx-underground, the hackers claimed to have stolen 70,000 pictures of customers taken from cameras embedded in the ATMs, as well as the personal data of 300,000 customers, which is alleged to include, \u201cSocial Security Numbers, date of birth, First Name, Last Name, e-mail address, Telephone Number, Current Occupation, Physical Address, and more.\u201d\n\nNobody has claimed the hack publicly. A month on, what really happened to Coin Cloud remains a mystery, even according to the company\u2019s new owner.\n\nCoin Cloud was a company that maintained thousands of Bitcoin ATMs across the U.S. and Brazil, according to its official website, until the company filed for bankruptcy in February. In July, Genesis Coin, another Bitcoin ATM provider, acquired 5,700 ATMs from the since-defunct Coin Cloud, according to a press release published at the time. Genesis Coin was itself acquired earlier in January by Andrew Barnard and an associate, who owned another cryptocurrency ATM company called Bitstop.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about the Coin Cloud hack? We\u2019d love to hear from you. You can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email lorenzo@techcrunch.com. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\n\nBarnard, who serves as the CEO of Bitcoin ATM, the re-branded company after the purchase of some Coin Cloud assets in the bankruptcy proceedings, told TechCrunch that his company launched an investigation after the vx-underground tweet, but it couldn\u2019t conclude when the breach happened or who was responsible, and he himself described the incident as \u201ca mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe data breach happened a while ago as Coin Cloud has been hacked multiple times in the past when they were still an operating company,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cI believe that data is just now being ransomed. It\u2019s impossible to say [when] as there were little controls throughout the software development process and multiple international contractors had access to source code that contained secrets within it to access the [database],\u201d Barnard said in an email.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the services which Coin Cloud kept alive were recently breached from what we were shown,\u201d added Barnard. \u201cTherefore it\u2019s reasonable to assume this is data that has already been stolen from one of the previous times Coin Cloud was hacked. It\u2019s an assumption, but a reasonable one. It\u2019s impossible to really say when the data was compromised or who did it. So many vendors and internal employees had access to it that it could have happened at many different times over the years.\u201d\n\nBarnard said that if someone obtained the source code, which contained the admin credentials to the database, the hackers \u201cwould have access to all the [Know Your Customer] information of customers.\u201d\n\nKnow Your Customer, or KYC, are checks carried out by tech and financial companies for verifying a person\u2019s identity to prevent fraud and money laundering. KYC checks often rely on customers submitting scans of their identity documents.\n\nA former Coin Cloud employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told TechCrunch that Coin Cloud was \u201can absolute disaster to work for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a security team,\u201d the former employee said, adding that she believes Coin Cloud got hacked at least once last year, and that the company stored a lot of data in plaintext, meaning it wasn\u2019t encrypted."

Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies provide a fairly high level of privacy, they cannot provide it completely. Bitcoin mixers eliminate the shortcomings of blockchains, making it possible to completely maintain anonymity in the transaction network.\n\nBlockchain Anonymity Is Exaggerated\n\nBlockchain was created as a confidential means of payment that has no restrictions. Bitcoin was the first to do this. No personal data is required, and transactions can be carried out worldwide, without increasing international transfer fees.\n\nDespite all its advantages, bitcoins have a significant drawback. It is pseudo-anonymous. What does this mean?\n\nThere is really no need to use personal data in the blockchain. It is enough to have public and private keys and coins directly to conduct a transaction. However, the blockchain itself provides a lot of indirect information that can be used to identify the names of the participants in the operation.\n\nKeep Reading Navigating US Oil Price Trends\n\nThe problem is that each transaction, despite passing through many nodes, records the addresses of the sender and recipient, the amount of coins, and the so-called UTXO. The last two points are of interest directly to the participants, as they give an understanding of the amounts that are stored in wallets.\n\nAs a result, attackers use a variety of software, tools and services to identify owners who are interested in their wallets.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to cut your connection with the transaction. Bitcoin mixers come to the rescue for this. They are services that use mixing and obfuscation technologies during operations. It is enough to conduct a transaction through them to ensure complete anonymity.\n\nHow Does a Bitcoin Mixer Work?\n\nTo understand how a Bitcoin mixer works, you need to understand how a transaction occurs. Operations in the blockchain are recorded in blocks along with data on them. Each block includes several transactions, which, when mined, are recognized as valid and reach the recipient.\n\nIt is impossible to change or falsify transactions, since they are stored in the blockchain chronologically. When a transaction occurs, it is entered into the blockchain registry - a kind of ledger. Just like in accounting, you can easily determine where these coins were before and who they belonged to.\n\nA special feature of Bitcoin is its identification. Each BTC has its own unique number. Therefore, tracking by address is not difficult.\n\nThe transactions themselves display a range of data. Add to this the digital footprint that absolutely everyone leaves on the Internet and even on the blockchain. Together, they make it possible to track the owner of the wallet right up to his real residential address.\n\nThe Bitcoin mixer breaks the transaction, replacing both part and absolutely all of the data in the operation, depending on the security level selected by the user.\n\nFirst of all, the service replaces the coins received from the address. After all, it is through them that it is easiest to track further movement. To do this, the coins are first split into satoshis, mixed with other such parts and new coins are generated.\n\nAfter the service action depends on the functionality selected by the user. The mixer can send them directly to the specified address or use additional options that the user has chosen:\n\n1. Time delay. Coins will be sent after a set interval. Its variability depends on the service itself.\n\n2. Splitting the amount into several parts. The mixer sends coins in batches from several crypto addresses.\n\n3. Sending to several addresses. The point is that the mixer also splits the sum into several parts. However, it already sends it to the addresses specified by users. As a rule, there are no more than five of them.\n\nThese functions can be combined. This makes it simply impossible to track the transaction. In addition, a good mixer uses data encryption methods. It does not require user registration, but issues special codes. When using the latter, the mixer ensures that your coins that you sent before will not reach you again.\n\nAre All Bitcoin Mixers Reliable?\n\nAs in any other industry, there are good and reliable service providers, and there are scammers or underqualified ones. This also applies to Bitcoin mixers. The risks of use are extremely high if you are not careful when choosing a service.\n\nA Bitcoin mixer aims to break the connection between the sender and the recipient in a transaction. However, if he has a database of his clients, which displays who sent funds and where, then the whole point of using them is lost.\n\nFraudsters easily sell this data to third parties, which then leads to the theft of cryptocurrencies from wallets. If the service is not qualified enough, then it is simply not able to provide the level of privacy protection that is necessary. It's enough to hack to get the information you need.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to approach the choice of Bitcoin mixer with caution.\n\nHow to Choose a Bitcoin Mixer\n\nFrom all of the above, you can already guess about the main accents that are worth paying attention to. Nonetheless, a more detailed list of parameters to consider when selecting a Bitcoin mixer is provided below:\n\n1. Anonymity. If a service asks you to register to gain access to functionality, avoid it. There is no absolute protection, therefore, any hack will cause your de-anonymization. Not to mention the fact that such services have a database of users, which they can transfer to third parties.\n\n2. Zero logs policy. The bottom line is that your transaction data and connection with the Bitcoin mixer must be completely deleted. Otherwise, there will be the same risks as in the previous paragraph.\n\n3. Security level. All data that connects you with the mixer must be encrypted at the highest level. This will hide your digital traces. There should also be no storage of cookies to improve the user experience.\n\n4. Functionality. The service should provide you with the necessary functionality so that you can completely anonymize your transaction. In this case, these functions must be performed with high accuracy.\n\n5. Commissions. Of course, no one wants to overpay. However, there should be variability here, since a fixed fee is a clear sign of using a mixer. Too low commissions with a large selection of functions should be alarming. This is a sign that the owners of the service make money somewhere else, for example, by selling user databases.\n\nIn addition, the mixer should be easy to use and offer various benefits. For example, have an affiliate program or discounts on services. There are services that not only provide this, but also provide special protection through a number of innovative technologies. Thanks to this, the user can receive discounts, but not have a direct connection with the mixer itself.\n\nHow is this ensured? The user is given a special encrypted code. It hides all data from third parties. At the same time, the service itself deciphers the code, receiving the necessary information.\n\nIs It Legal to Use a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nMany people associate Bitcoin mixers with money laundering and illegal activities. In reality, this is a completely erroneous opinion. Chainalysis, a research service, annually analyzes the use of mixers, and it's important to note that the overall volume of such transactions through mixers remains relatively small. This highlights that the majority of mixer users employ them for legitimate purposes, aiming to enhance the privacy and security of their transactions.\n\nThere is currently no law that would prohibit the use of Bitcoin mixers to conduct transactions and maintain anonymity in the blockchain. The Constitution of all countries states that every person has the right to privacy. Therefore, maintaining anonymity on the Internet and blockchain is also such a right.\n\nBitcoin mixers, generally considered legal in many places, can be used responsibly to enhance transaction privacy. It's always good to be aware of your local laws, but for the most part, you can use these tools confidently to secure your crypto activities.\n\nAdditional Protection\n\nTurning on a VPN while using Bitcoin mixers can add an extra layer of security to the process. It changes your device's IP address, eliminating one of the most significant types of digital footprint. When visiting different sites, the device leaves data about its IP address. It is assigned to each PC or smartphone by the provider for identification on the network.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to hide it from prying eyes. The IP address leaves a significant trace on the network, making it possible to determine a user's actions.\n\nA VPN allows you to change the IP address, essentially pointing to a completely different location of the device. For example, you are in London, and the VPN shows that your location is now in Tokyo. For the entire digital world, this is where you will be, as the IP address will correspond to this region.\n\nConsistently using a VPN can be beneficial for enhancing online security. At the same time, avoid free versions or cheap services. They can introduce malware onto your device and sell databases. VPN payments should also be made in cryptocurrency. This will help maintain your anonymity online.\n\nTop Bitcoin Mixers\n\nThe following is a curated selection of the best Bitcoin mixers known for their high-quality services. This list can save time for those who prefer a ready reference. However, do not forget to analyze it yourself to be sure that the service is exactly right for you.\n\n1. Tumbler.io\n\nA young service, Tumbler.io, thanks to its unique technologies, is poised to become the best next year. First of all, it is worth noting that no data is saved here. First of all, it is worth noting that Tumbler.io saves no data. The service supports the No-Log policies. Tumbler.io provides effective mixing through the use of a Tumbler code and temporary freezing of 'new coins'\n\nAdditionally, Tumbler.io's Tumbler code is fully encrypted and updated after each use. It works like this:\n\n1. You do the mixing and you are given a code.\n\n2. When reapplying, use this code to avoid receiving your own coins from the previous mixing.\n\n3. At the same time, the user is given a new code\n\nThe point is that with each new request the code changes. The service does not store a database of these codes, as all information is directly encrypted within the Tumbler code. In this way, the service ensures that the connection is broken, since after mixing, all data is deleted. When you enter the code, the system will decipher the amount of the deposit and discounts, which are also included in the code itself. All this is stored by the user, which eliminates the possibility of leaking the database on this issue.\n\nTumbler.io's encryption system employs innovative technology, including RSA encryption. It allows you to encrypt all critical traffic that could be used to track the user. It also prevents the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nA few more features:\n\n\u2022 Unique mixing algorithms. Not only the usual mixing is used, but also a hybrid of CoinJoin technology.\n\n\u2022 The developers took into account all Blockchair heuristics to ensure maximum confidentiality.\n\n\u2022 Full protection from ddosguard.net and other analytical services.\n\n\u2022 Transaction details are deleted within 24 hours of mixing.\n\n\u2022 Deposit addresses are permanently deleted to prevent the mixer from being compromised.\n\n\u2022 A letter of guarantee is provided to fulfill obligations. At the same time, it is encrypted using cryptography methods.\n\n\u2022 Wide variability of commissions. The minimum is only 0.4% + network commission.\n\n\u2022 The service reserve is 500 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Minimum sending from 0.0001 BTC.\n\nAt the same time, it offers a wide range of functionality, starting from three levels of protection. Here you can specify up to 10 addresses to receive payments. The delay in dispatch ranges from an hour to three days. You can distribute funds by interest. At the same time, an interactive calculator is provided that will accurately calculate the size of the deposit and payments.\n\nThe best Bitcoin mixer Tumbler.io is actively present on Bitcointalk and has its own thread. Provides a user-friendly and responsive website on Clearnet. It is possible to use Tor using a separate link.\n\nThere is a detailed FAQ where the user can get the maximum amount of information.\n\n2. Yomix\n\nA young service that was launched this year. However, it has already achieved fame and popularity. Here you can quickly mix coins and use a variety of functionality for anonymity. The service does not save user logs after services are provided.\n\nA version without Javascript is available on the site. The minimum amount for mixing is 0.001 BTC, and the maximum is unlimited. Various address formats are supported: Legacy, SegWit, P2SH and Native SegWit. The commission ranges from 0.7% to 5%, to which a network fee is added. There is also a thread on Bitcointalk. There are plans to expand the capabilities by adding other cryptocurrencies besides BTC.\n\n3. Coinomize\n\nThis service stands out for its cost-effectiveness among its peers: the commission ranges from 1% to 5% plus 0.0003 BTC. The minimum amount for mixing is 0.003 BTC. Only one confirmation is required to transfer funds. It is possible to set a time delay for mixing, which increases the level of privacy.\n\nBy selecting multiple receive addresses, each will have a random time delay, avoiding the possibility of tracking mixer usage. The service enjoys an excellent reputation online due to its high quality of work, user-friendly interface and prompt transactions.\n\n4. UniJoin\n\nThe service uses CoinJoin technology to mix funds. Currently only supports Bitcoin, but plans to expand capabilities to include Ethereum, Litecoin and USDT in the future. Absolutely does not store any logs or data about transactions performed.\n\nService features:\n\n\u2022 Commission varies from 1 to 3%, additional network commission is charged.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for transactions varies depending on conditions.\n\n\u2022 There is absolutely no need to create an account to use the mixer.\n\n5. Blindmixer\n\nThis Bitcoin wallet is designed to mix transactions while providing complete privacy thanks to the use of Schnorr circuit technology. Its uniqueness lies in its status as the most private mixing service on the market. However, to use this function, you must create a wallet on this platform.\n\nImportant aspects:\n\n\u2022 Instantly exchange assets with other users without waiting for network confirmations.\n\n\u2022 The wallet works on the principle of custodial storage, which requires trust in Blindmixer to store funds. All users' cryptocurrency funds are stored offline.\n\n\u2022 The user has the ability to retrieve his seed phrase at any time.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for transactions is 100 satoshi.\n\n\u2022 There are no commissions for mixing amounts from 0.01 BTC; for smaller amounts the commission is 100 satoshi.\n\nHowever, Blindmixer has a significant drawback: it is possible to get back some of your own coins due to the nature of the mixing process. All coins are \"blinded\" and it becomes impossible to determine who owned which of them. If this situation does not suit you, consider other services.\n\n6. CryptoMixer\n\nBitcoin mixing service CryptoMixer is a platform aimed at serving the needs of its community and strives to gain the trust of a large number of users.\n\nPlatform features:\n\n\u2022 Use of unique mixing algorithms.\n\n\u2022 Providing the ability to mix large amounts thanks to the presence of a reserve of 2000 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Low commissions and discount system.\n\n\u2022 24/7 technical support.\n\n\u2022 Personalized settings for the percentage of funds distribution and delays in the execution of operations.\n\n\u2022 Affiliate program availability.\n\n\u2022 Ability to reuse input and output bitcoin addresses.\n\n\u2022 Active presence on Bitcointalk.\n\n\u2022 Commission: 0.5% + 0.0005 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Minimum amount: 0.001 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Support for mobile devices.\n\nThis platform is one of the most popular Bitcoin mixers. Has a lot of positive reviews.\n\n7. MixTum\n\nMixTum.io, created in 2018, is a Bitcoin mixer that is unique due to its integration with the Jambler.io platform. Unlike typical BTC mixing services, MixTum.io does not mix its own funds in its accounts, but rather uses coins purchased from crypto exchanges. Thanks to this approach and the huge volumes of trading on exchanges, all transactions are guaranteed to remain transparent and flawless. Algorithms built into the system check the purity of incoming coins, ensuring a high level of reliability and security.\n\nFeatures of the site:\n\n\u2022 Money is merged in pools without using special mixing codes.\n\n\u2022 The service does not record order identification data and their characteristics.\n\n\u2022 The user is not able to set the time frame for mixing products.\n\n\u2022 Coins are purchased on exchanges such as Binance, OKX, DigiFinex, Cryptonex and others.\n\n\u2022 Each request has unique parameters. The mixer randomly determines the values of time delays (from 1 to 6 hours), selects intermediate wallets, sets the number of output transactions, the commission fee (from 4 to 5% + 0.0007 BTC) and determines what part of the funds will be returned to the user-specified wallets.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for mixing is 0.005 BTC.\n\n\u2022 There is a link to a discussion on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nWhen placing an order, by default, two addresses are provided for delivery, but the system also supports individual settings, if necessary. When returning clean coins, the system automatically determines the best option for using an intermediate wallet, from which 10% to 90% of the total amount is transferred. Clear coins are sent through multiple transactions, each of which occurs at different time intervals for different amounts. This method is designed to complicate the process of cluster analysis.\n\n8. Anonymixer\n\nThe creators claim that their service provides complete anonymity when using the Bitcoin mixer. Key features include:\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for mixing is only 1 satoshi.\n\n\u2022 Commission ranges from 1% to 2%, plus network commission.\n\n\u2022 No log storage.\n\n\u2022 Ability to use up to 10 addresses for deposits and up to 20 addresses for withdrawals.\n\n\u2022 Presence on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nThe service provides a letter of guarantee in PDF and text formats. Working with a resource is possible both using JavaScript and without it, and the second option is considered safer. The site is also convenient for use on mobile devices.\n\nIn conclusion, when evaluating the landscape of Bitcoin mixing services, it becomes evident that each platform offers unique features catering to diverse user needs.

        "title": "Bitcoin price: BlackRock's bitcoin application shreds its ESG credibility - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "In October, a United Nations University report estimated if bitcoin were a country it would rank as the 27th most energy intensive in the world by consuming 173.4 terawatt hours of electricity annually during 2020 and 2021. This means the bitcoin network consumes more power annually than a country like Pakistan, which has 231 million people.\n\nBitcoin has little utility, other than as a store of value, or synthetic asset price bubble where early adopters sell to later adopters at a profit. Ironically, it was invented in 2009 as a permissionless network to transfer money free from interference from the likes of establishment giants such as BlackRock.\n\nIt cannot work as money in practice because it is too volatile, with owners reluctant to spend it if they anticipate its price will rise.\n\nCarbon footprint\n\nStill, to be fair to BlackRock, the size of bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint remains contentious.\n\nAcademic studies have reached varied conclusions, and they tend to align with whatever motivates or incentivises their authors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decentralised and anonymised nature of bitcoin mining means it\u2019s impossible to know what percentage of miners are drawing on renewable energy sources versus those drawing electricity from coal-powered sources, for example.\n\nThe UN report estimated bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption to be equivalent to burning 84 billion pounds of coal annually, which would require the planting of 3.9 billion trees to offset.\n\nSelf-styled climate saviour Fink won\u2019t like research that points to bitcoin as closer to digital coal than digital gold.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s supporters claim it is increasingly mined from renewable power. This trend may be correct, but it\u2019s still hard to justify allocating renewable power to bitcoin mining ahead of industries that deliver industrial value or improved living standards.\n\nFor example, in 2022 multiple Canadian provinces banned bitcoin miners from building new renewable power operations on the basis they diverted time, energy and capital resources away from projects that serve a greater utility to society.\n\nAsked about the work BlackRock has undertaken on bitcoin\u2019s ESG credentials, a spokeswoman said the company could not comment on issues related to the token or regulatory filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed to a 2023 KPMG report titled Bitcoin\u2019s Role in the ESG Imperative and other literature linked to BlackRock\u2019s commitment to sustainable investing. In addition, she said, BlackRock had praised a business called Energy Web, which lessens bitcoin\u2019s environmental damage.\n\nThe KPMG report says bitcoin uses around 110 terawatt hours of electricity a year, equal to 0.55 per cent of total global electricity consumption. It also argues bitcoin incentivises the increased integration of renewable energy into power grids as it attracts capital, with a conclusion that bitcoin can provide other benefits across an ESG framework.\n\nStill, others like Tesla abandoned their promotion of bitcoin in 2021 as it is too environmentally destructive for a company genuinely committed to climate protection.\n\nSo, even if we accept that some of bitcoin\u2019s required power is now sourced from renewable sources, its net contribution to society remains debatable.\n\nFink told CNBC in 2017 that bitcoin was an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d, with the currency\u2019s reputation as a preferred choice for online hackers and terrorist financiers still sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut perhaps the Damascene conversion is explainable by arguments that bitcoin is no more amenable to money laundering than ordinary fiat money. This is also what KPMG finds.\n\nWhatever Fink\u2019s thinking, bitcoin looks a dubious bet for an executive who has positioned the world\u2019s largest asset management group as an arbiter of other corporations\u2019 commitments to fighting climate change."

        "content": "The crypto market, especially Bitcoin (BTC), has recently declined. Amid these fluctuations, the flagship cryptocurrency has been intensely scrutinized.\n\nDespite its decline from the recent peak of $44,000, a crypto analyst urged the community not to \u201csuccumb to panic.\u201d The current market situation reflects a typical correction phase rather than a long-term bearish trend.\n\nAccording to Ali Charts, a prominent crypto analyst, Bitcoin has established a \u201crobust\u201d support zone between $37,150 and $38,360. This critical range is bolstered by the activity of approximately 1.52 million addresses that collectively purchased roughly 534,000 BTC at that price point, as indicated by Ali.\n\nThe analyst suggests that the significant accumulation forms a \u201cstrong\u201d foundation, potentially preventing further declines in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Resistance And The Road Ahead\n\nDespite the recent market downturn, Bitcoin\u2019s potential for recovery and continued growth remains a subject of interest. Ali has also identified two key resistance levels at $43,850 and $46,400 that could challenge Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nThese points represent significant thresholds where selling pressure may intensify, potentially hindering Bitcoin\u2019s ability to reclaim its recent highs.\n\nIn case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the past 24 hours have seen Bitcoin\u2019s price dip by 0.3% with a price below $42,000, continuing its retreat from the $44,000 mark. This reduction in value is mirrored in the crypto\u2019s trading volume, which has fallen from $37 billion to $21 billion. This decline indicates a decreased trading activity, suggesting a cooling-off period following the recent market rally.\n\nThe Positive Side Of The Bitcoin Pullback\n\nAmid concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations, experts like William Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, offer a different perspective. Clemente emphasizes that the current pullback, potentially bringing Bitcoin\u2019s price to around $40,000, is not necessarily a negative development.\n\nClemente argues that this correction is essential for \u201cshaking out weak hands\u201d and reducing leverage in the market, ultimately laying a more solid foundation for future growth.\n\nThe Co-founder of Reflexivity Research further noted that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a feature, not a bug.\u201d\n\nBTC just ~doubled in 2 months with no pull backs, a correction is not that surprising. Corrections shake out \u201cweak hands\u201d and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is a feature, not a bug.

After plummeting to around $15,000 per coin in November 2022, it nearly trebled to $42,000 as the year-end approaches (5-year performance: 1,150 per cent).\n\nEthereum, the second of the big two and also a leading smart contract platform, has also seen a strong recovery in 2023 to reach the $2,220 level, having fallen as low as $895 last year (5-year performance: 1,500 per cent).\n\nMost major cryptoassets are up significantly from their low points, but some have done better than others.\n\nThe optimism building over what 2024 may bring has many different aspects to it, but there are two in particular capturing the imagination.\n\nCrypto has found its feet in 2023 once again after a brutal 2022\n\nFirstly, the next bitcoin 'halving' is due in April 2024. This occurs approximately every four years. Emissions of new bitcoin paid to the 'miners' of the network will be cut in half. This increases scarcity and helps support price rises.\n\nDuring the months before and after a halving, large rises in bitcoin's price have occurred historically.\n\nSecond, several bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to be approved by US financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nGiant investment firms like BlackRock will be able to directly offer bitcoin investment to their millions of clients, following the approvals. This could vastly expand the pool of potential investors in crypto.\n\nThere will continue to be wild swings in price and crypto will remain high risk, but the potential for big profits is there.\n\nSimon Peters, an analyst at eToro , says: '2024 has the potential to be one of the biggest years we've seen for crypto asset prices.'\n\nSimon Peters, an analyst at eToro, says: '2024 has the potential to be one of the biggest years we've seen for crypto asset prices, if the bitcoin four year cycle is anything to go by, as well as potentially more robust regulation which could give investors confidence to invest into the crypto space.'\n\n'Focusing on the four-year cycle, historically the crypto bull and bear markets revolve around the bitcoin block reward halving.\n\n'There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin mined into existence. With decreasing new issuance, if demand increases then bitcoin prices should go up,' Peters continued.\n\n'The supply shock will come from the block reward halving which will take the reward per block down from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, and the annual inflation rate from around 1.7 per cent down to around 0.85 per cent.\n\n'The demand shock could come from a wave of retail and institutional investors gaining exposure to the space via an approved bitcoin spot ETF for example.'\n\nThe biggest crypto risers of 2023\n\nSo which are the biggest crypto risers of 2023 so far?\n\nTurning back to what we have seen in 2023 so far, it is not bitcoin that has risen the most, despite the hopes of what next year will bring.\n\nHere are the top ten cryptos by market cap ranked by the amount they have risen year to date.\n\n'Stablecoins' which do not move in price have been excluded. It should also be noted that some other cryptoassets outside the top ten in total size have risen by much more.\n\n1. Solana\n\nSolana is up 560 per cent year to date to $68 for a market cap of $29 billion (5-year performance: 4,700 per cent). It is the native token of the Solana blockchain, an alternative smart contract platform that offers similar functionality to Ethereum. It was dragged down heavily by the collapse of the FTX exchange last year but has since recovered strongly.\n\n2. Chainlink\n\nChainlink is up 145 per cent this year to $14.50 for a market cap of $8 billion (5-year performance: 18,000 per cent). Chainlink is a network of 'oracles' which provide real word information to blockchains, such as the price of gold for example.\n\n3. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is 148 per cent higher year to date at $41,250 for a market cap of $807 billion. The original crypto then kicked the whole thing off. Many expect 2024 to be a great year for BTC for the reasons discussed earlier.\n\n4. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche is up 157 per cent year to date at $38 for a market cap of $14 billion (3-year performance: 829 per cent). A smart contract platform that aims to be faster and cheaper than Ethereum while offering similar applications.\n\n5. Tron\n\nTron is up 86 per cent to 10 cents for a market cap of $9.5 billion (5-year performance: 670 per cent). Another smart contract platform. Tron was founded by Chinese businessman and investor Justin Sun in May 2018.\n\n6. XRP\n\nXRP is up 69 per cent this year to 61 cents for a market cap of $33 billion (5-year performance: 100 per cent). This is a coin distributed by software company Ripple as a vehicle for making international bank transfers. It is yet to be widely used in this way but has a loyal following.\n\n7. Ethereum\n\nEther is up 75 per cent year to date to $2,200 for a market cap of $264 billion. The first and most widely used smart contract platform. The decentralised finance space (DeFi) and non-fungible token industry (NFTs) began life on Ethereum.\n\n8. Cardano\n\nCardano is 116 per cent higher in 2023 so far to hit 57 cents for a market cap of $19.5 billion (5-year performance: 2,600 per cent). An alternative smart contract platform. Adoption of Cardano remains light years behind Ethereum but its has a dedicated community of supporters.\n\n9. Dogecoin\n\nDogecoin is up 50 per cent in 2023 so far to 9.4 cents for a market cap of $13.3 billion (5-year performance: 2,149 per cent). The original 'memecoin.' Doge was started as a joke and has no real use but its price rises have been powered by internet virality - and kind words from Elon Musk.\n\n10. Binance Coin\n\nBinance Coin is the one top tenner down for 2023 so far. It is 5 per cent lower at $256 for a market cap of $38 billion (5-year performance: 4,755 per cent). The native coin of the Binance crypto exchange and smart contract blockchain. The coin has struggled this year due in part to legal troubles in America.\n\nWant to explore crypto investing?

        "content": "The Bitcoin price has risen around 80% this year, bringing it to its highest levels of 2023. However, the leading cryptocurrency has still not reached its all-time high of $69,000. Nevertheless, this has not stopped the asset from hitting multiple new all-time high prices in as many as six countries.\n\nSix Countries See New Bitcoin All-Time Highs\n\nThe official X (formerly Twitter) account of Middle-Eastern restaurant Tahini\u2019s, which has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, took to the social media platform to share an interesting development. Tahini\u2019s post which came with multiple screenshots showed how Bitcoin has risen to new all-time highs across six countries.\n\nThis is what #Bitcoin looks like for the citizens of Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon and Pakistan.\n\nA combined population of\n\n725 MILLION people\n\nTry to convince them Bitcoin is not useful. Good luck \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/z8poh2C7Wb \u2014 Tahini\u2019s (@TheRealTahinis) December 13, 2023\n\nThe charts shared carried the all-time performance of Bitcoin against the local currencies of these countries which were identified to be Egypt, Nigeria, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey, and Argentina. In every single one of these countries, the Bitcoin price has rallied continuously. Where Bitcoin has failed to reclaim its all-time high in terms of dollar value, it has reached new ATHs against the Egyptian Pound, Nigerian Naira, Lebanese pound, Pakistani Rupee, Turkish lira, and Argentine Peso.\n\nTahini\u2019s post showed the BTC price had hit new all-time highs in these countries in a single day on December 12. But one interesting fact from the post was about the Argentine peso. At the time of the initial post, one BTC was worth 15,176,100 Argentine pesos. However, following Argentina\u2019s currency debasement, it surged more than 100% again to reach a new high of 33,677,222 Argentine pesos.\n\nBTC price still trending below $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Is Driving This Increase?\n\nThe significant Bitcoin price increase being experienced in these countries is a result of the high inflation rates that are currently plaguing these countries. As inflation takes hold and these currencies fall against the US dollar, the price of Bitcoin rises drastically.\n\nFor example, Lebanon\u2019s inflation rate is currently sitting at 208%, one of the highest in the world. Argentina\u2019s inflation rate is the second-highest on this list at 135%. This is why President-Elect Javier Milei seems to take a strong stance on Bitcoin as he aims to combat these high inflation rates during his time in office.\n\nIn the same vein, all of the other countries on this list are also seeing inflation rates of at least 29%. Egypt is sitting at 35.7%, Nigeria, at 30.6%, Turkey At 64%, and Pakistan at 29.4%.\n\nGiven this data, perhaps it is also not surprising that these countries also boast some of the highest crypto adoption rates in the world as residents try to protect their wealth. Argentina, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey all appear in the top 20 of the Global Crypto Adoption Index released by Chainalysis in 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com"
