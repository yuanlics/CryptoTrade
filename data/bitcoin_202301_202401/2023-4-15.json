        "title": "Michael Saylor Buys Another $150 Million in Bitcoin: Is the Crypto a Screaming Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto markets had a rough 2022, and Bitcoin (BTC 0.02%) wasn't spared -- the cryptocurrency fell nearly 65% last year. But 2023 has become a comeback story, with Bitcoin up 83% since January.\n\nBitcoin mega-supporter and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor recently revealed that his company bought 6,455 Bitcoin in late March, a transaction worth $150 million.\n\nShould investors follow Saylor's lead? One shouldn't base their investment decisions on someone else's, but there are some excellent reasons to consider adding Bitcoin to your portfolio today. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA hefty vote of confidence\n\nAlthough investors should make their own decisions, there's no denying the influence that well-known investors such as Warren Buffett can have on a stock's sentiment. Saylor is arguably the Buffett equivalent to Bitcoin investors, and his latest $150 million investment is a vote of confidence if anything.\n\nMicroStrategy now owns 138,955 total Bitcoin worth almost $4.2 billion. The company's average Bitcoin cost is $29,817, just a bit below where it trades today. In other words, you could argue that Saylor sees value in Bitcoin at its current price; a $4 billion investment would imply an expectation that the asset's value will increase over time.\n\nHowever, one shouldn't automatically mirror Saylor's sentiment on Bitcoin, just as one shouldn't blindly buy Coca-Cola stock just because Buffett owns it. Instead, look at it as a prompt to revisit your investment thesis.\n\nRevisiting Bitcoin's investment case\n\nThe overarching theme for Bitcoin is that it's a store of value, similar to gold or silver. Ideally, Bitcoin can protect investors from two critical problems of the fiat-based financial system. First, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, a hedge against inflation that continually devalues fiat currency as more is created. Second, it's decentralized, independent of central control like the U.S. financial system, which is dominated by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAdditionally, banks use a fractional reserve system, where they leverage their deposits to lend more money than they have. That's fine until too many people try to pull their money out of the banks at once. Bitcoin's scarcity and independence from any person or party controlling it have driven demand and fantastic investment returns. Bitcoin has easily outpaced the S&P 500 despite the coin's dramatic decline in 2022.\n\nSome might ask whether Bitcoin's volatility disqualifies it as a store of value, but Bitcoin doesn't seem any more volatile than silver and gold. You can see below that gold and silver have experienced similar declines from their highs, a reminder that asset prices fluctuate.\n\nYes, Bitcoin has been more volatile than gold, but it's a less-known commodity than a precious metal that has been sought after and valued for thousands of years. Perhaps Bitcoin will become less volatile as it ages -- it's a fair question, at the least.\n\nIs Bitcoin's comeback just beginning?\n\nFor now, markets seem to value Bitcoin as a riskier asset, which declines when investors flee to safety. Gold is near its all-time high, while Bitcoin is far from it. Bitcoin's early 2023 comeback could signal that the crypto winter, as some call it, is nearing its end.\n\nInvestors will only know for sure in hindsight, but it appears Bitcoin's long-term appeal is still intact, especially after the near-miss of another crisis in the modern banking system. Bitcoin will likely remain a volatile asset, but it could have more up days than down if the market's sentiment toward riskier assets turns positive."

        "title": "Healthy Bitcoin rally: What does a margin lending ratio drop mean for BTC price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied over 10% between April 9 and April 14, marking the highest daily close in over 10 months. While some analysts may argue the move justifies a degree of decoupling from traditional markets, both the S&P 500 and gold are near their highest levels in over six months.\n\nBitcoin price breaks $30,000 despite macro headwinds\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains and rally above $30,000 also happened while the U.S. Dollar Index (DYX), which measures the currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, reached its lowest level in 12 months.\n\nThe indicator fell to 100.8 on April 14 from 104.7 one month prior as investors priced in higher odds of further liquidity injections by the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price teases $30K breakdown ahead of US CPI, FOMC minutes\n\nThe latest Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy meeting minutes, released on April 12, made explicit reference to the anticipation of a \u201cmild recession\u201d later in 2023 due to the banking crisis. Even if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nEven if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nStrong macroeconomic data explains investors\u2019 bullishness\n\nWhile the global economy may deteriorate in the coming months, recent macroeconomic data has been mostly positive. For example, the European Union\u2019s statistics office reported that industrial production in the 20 member countries increased 1.5% month on month in February, whereas economists polled by Reuters expected a 1% increase.\n\nFurthermore, China\u2019s latest macroeconomic data showed an encouraging trend, with exports increasing 14.8% year on year in March, snapping a five-month decline and surprising economists who expected a 7% decline. As a result, China\u2019s trade balance for March was $89.2 billion, far exceeding the $39.2 billion market consensus.\n\nThe contrast between the current economic momentum and the forthcoming recession triggered by higher financing costs and a reduced appetite for risk among lenders causes Bitcoin investors to question the sustainability of the $30,000 support.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.\n\nBTC derivatives show no excessive leverage from longs\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio decreased between April 9 and April 11. That is extremely healthy as it shows no leverage has been used to support Bitcoin\u2019s price gains, at least not using margin markets. Moreover, given the general bullishness of crypto traders, the current margin lending ratio of 15 is relatively neutral.\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nInterestingly, despite Bitcoin breaking $30,000 for the first time in 10 months, pro traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nFor instance, the ratio for Huobi traders stood firm near 0.98 from April 9 until April 14. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short slightly increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 9 to the current 1.14. Lastly, at crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio slightly declined, from 1.00 on April 9 to the current 0.91.\n\nRelated: Tesla selling Bitcoin last year turned out to be a $500M mistake\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin futures traders were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions. Thus, even if Bitcoin\u2019s price retests $29,000 in terms of derivatives, bulls should be unconcerned because there has been little demand from short-sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin\u2019s market structure is bullish, where BTC\u2019s price can quickly rally another 10% to $33,000, given sellers are currently reluctant to short it.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Stacks (STX): What if Bitcoin Had Smart Contracts? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin maxis, beware! The Stacks crypto project is here to extend the Bitcoin blockchain beyond its limitations, bringing improved functionality to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns about Bitcoin (BTC) is its lack of utility outside of being a self-custodial digital asset payment network. The Stacks blockchain liberates Bitcoin from these limitations, building DeFi apps and NFTs on top of Bitcoin\u2019s impenetrable security.\n\nWhat is Stacks (STX)? How does this innovative Bitcoin layer work behind the scenes? Is it truly a threat to other smart contract-capable networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)?\n\nWhat Is Stacks (STX)?\n\nStacks is a Layer-1 blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts. It aims to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin by providing an ecosystem of dApps and products that are settled on the world\u2019s most secure and decentralized blockchain.\n\nNot only does the Stacks network bring greater utility to Bitcoin, but it also seeks to resolve its scalability issues with higher transaction throughput. Could Stacks be the ultimate solution to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s symbolic blockchain trilemma?\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Stacks?\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s position as the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency, it\u2019s often criticized as being nothing more than a decentralized store of value. As a payment network, many alternative blockchains like XRP are faster and more affordable.\n\nOn top of that, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn\u2019t support smart contracts, making it infinitely less useful than a network like Ethereum that hosts a multitude of DeFi apps. Apart from sending and receiving BTC between wallets, there\u2019s not much you can do with Bitcoin.\n\nAs a digital asset, BTC represents over $500 billion of liquidity but offers no way to leverage this value creatively. For example, there are no decentralized exchanges or lending platforms on Bitcoin.\n\nStacks solves this problem and brings integral blockchain functions, like decentralized finance and NFT technology, to the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow Does Stacks Work?\n\nThe Stacks network is an execution layer that settles complex transactions using the Bitcoin blockchain as a base layer.\n\nAt the core of this process are two unique features of the Stacks protocol. These are the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus algorithm and the Clarity programming language.\n\nProof-of-Transfer (PoX)\n\nThe Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism is the key link between Stacks and Bitcoin. It\u2019s an extension of the Proof-of-Burn algorithm, wherein miners burn crypto as a proxy in exchange for computing resources to secure the chain.\n\nInstead of burning tokens in exchange for computing resources, tokens are committed to the Stacks protocol and transferred between network participants. We call these Miners and Stackers.\n\nSource: Stacks\n\nMiners transfer BTC to Stackers, hoping to win block rewards and transaction fees from the Stacks network. The chances of winning the block correspond to the amount of BTC committed.\n\nOn the hand, Stackers lock their STX tokens to the network in exchange for BTC committed to the network by Miners. After their lock-up period is complete, Stackers reclaim their STX tokens.\n\nClarity\n\nClarity is a smart contract programming language unique to the Stacks network. It\u2019s optimized for predictability and security and was specifically designed to combat common exploits seen in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s dominant language.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the Clarity programming language:\n\nUncompiled \u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities.\n\n\u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities. Decidability \u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction.\n\n\u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction. Bitcoin compatible \u2013 Clarity smart contracts are designed to read the state of the native Bitcoin blockchain. This means developers implement Bitcoin transactions directly into their applications for seamless smart contract triggers.\n\nThe STX Token\n\nSTX is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks blockchain. The Stacks token is used to pay transaction fees on the network and can be \u2018stacked\u2019 to earn BTC through the Proof-of-Exchange consensus mechanism. It\u2019s also used in the network\u2019s various dApps as collateral and a currency of exchange.\n\nInterestingly enough, Stacks STX emissions replicate Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle. Stacks block rewards are synchronized with Bitcoin halvings and cut in half roughly every four years.\n\nStacks History\n\nOriginally named Blockstack, the company was founded in 2013 by Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali with the vision of solving pain points in web applications. Coming out of Princeton University, the startup was approved through the Y Combinator accelerator in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, Blockstack became the first company ever to receive approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell digital assets. The SEC-regulated token offering raised over $23 million.\n\nFollowing a full rebrand to Stacks in October 2020, the company published a new white paper outlining its plans for Stacks 2.0, the Bitcoin-adjacent execution layer we use today.\n\nThe Stacks Ecosystem\n\nThe Stacks ecosystem is home to a range of decentralized applications, wallet software, and NFT collections. While the Stacks network is still relatively young, the Stacks Foundation offers plenty of grants and funds incentivizing developers to join the ecosystem.\n\nStacks DeFi\n\nDecentralized exchanges and lending platforms are typically the cornerstone DeFi apps on emerging blockchains. Apps like StackSwap, Alex, and Zest Protocol are basic DeFi providers within the Stacks network.\n\nSource: StackSwap\n\nThe Arkadiko Protocol creates the leading stablecoin, USDA, on Stacks. Like Tether (USDT), USDA is pegged to the value of the U.S. Dollar.\n\nStacks NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs continue to gain traction in the Web3 world. While Ordinals have been the main driving force behind Bitcoin NFTs, the Stacks NFT ecosystem has been witnessing its own renaissance.\n\nGamma.io has established itself as the leading NFT marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals and Stacks NFTs. Megapont Ape Club is the most well-known NFT collection on the Stacks network, generating over five million STX in trading volume.\n\nStacks Wallets\n\nHiro Wallet is undoubtedly the most widely used and trusted Stacks Wallet. With over 280,000 downloads, it tracks the value of your account in real-time and is the best place to store Ordinals and Stacks NFTs.\n\nUsers can also participate in the Proof-of-Exchange consensus and \u2018stack\u2019 STX coins to earn BTC rewards. The Hiro Wallet is available as both a desktop app and a browser extension.\n\nStacks Pros and Cons\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of the Stacks protocol and how it works, let\u2019s briefly recap its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nScalable \u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability. By breaking down blocks into micro blocks, Stacks can reach high transaction throughput and significantly reduce transaction fees when compared to the native Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability.

Secure Native Programming Language \u2013 Clarity is designed to solve the pitfalls and common exploits of other smart contract languages. While this doesn\u2019t guarantee that every contract on Stacks is watertight, it leaves less room for error and offers increased user security.\n\nCons\n\nLow user count \u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked). According to DefiLlama, the Stacks network has amassed less TVL than other small networks like Hedera Hashgraph, despite targeting the biggest source of liquidity in the space.\n\n\u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked).

Small ecosystem \u2013 The range of applications available within the Stacks ecosystem pales compared to other blockchains. Coins with similar market caps, like Fantom, have almost ten times the number of dApps while similarly valued to STX.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe issues facing the Stacks network are, at face value, easily solvable. Generous incentive programs and grants are already in place to kickstart the growth and development of the blockchain.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin is the face of the cryptocurrency industry, and its lack of utility is a poor reflection of the incredible progress being made in other realms of blockchain technology. By bringing new utility to BTC, the Stacks network is a net positive for the entire blockchain industry.\n\nFAQs"

He spoke during a recent episode of the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast.\n\nHere are Marks' 8 best quotes from the interview, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"The declining interest rates were responsible for the majority of all the money that's been made in the last 45 years.\" (Marks hailed the Federal Reserve's embrace of lower rates as a \"sea change\" for financial markets, as it made borrowing cheaper and debt financing easier.)\n\n2. \"The rates are high today to fight inflation. I don't think they're going to stay this high. But they're through coming down in any major way, and they're through being ultra-low.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"I just think it's too good to be true to think we can have a credit card we never have to pay the balance on.\" (Marks was warning that continued growth in the US federal debt will likely have serious consequences down the line.)\n\n4. \"AI, just like passive investing and machine learning \u2014 even maybe to a greater extent \u2014 will knock out everybody who doesn't add value. It should be harder and harder and harder to run money and be paid highly for producing inferior. But hopefully there will still be a small group of people who can do something that the machine can't do.\"\n\n5. \"Can an AI-enabled computer sit down with CEOs and figure out which one is Steve Jobs? Can it sit down with five business plans and figure out which one is Amazon? I just don't think so. This is an art form.\"\n\n6. \"There are people who believe that when you have a bank crisis, like we did with Silicon Valley Bank and some of the others, that the weakness of the banks shows the strength of bitcoin. It's in many ways an anti-bank play. It does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be the one in the lead so far.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"Humility is a really important thing, especially in the market, which humbles us all. Anybody who doesn't allow for humility, in a field where there's randomness and uncertainty, and qualitative and subjective things are important, is riding for a fall.\"\n\n8. \"People used to talk about the factory of the future, which would have one man and one dog, and it was the dog's job to keep the man from touching the equipment. It was the man's job to feed the dog. I would like to have the Fed keep its hands off the machinery most of the time.\""

The latest CPI data shows inflation is easing in the U.S. and that is encouraging, he said.\n\nHowever, Brian Santos, the founder of the non-profit Bitcoin Business Alliance said the token remains in bearish territory and he expects a price correction if Bitcoin does not break out well above US$30,000.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, agreed that Bitcoin could still be in a bear market due to thin volume.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.28 trillion on Friday at 9:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, up from US$1.18 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$594 billion market cap accounted for 46.4% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$252 billion accounted for 19.7%.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms hardpressed to find U.S. bank partners as industry blames \u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019\n\nBiggest gainers: RNDR and WOO\n\nThe Render Network\u2019s token (RNDR) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rallying 24.83% to US$1.61. The token started gaining momentum on April 9, three days after the network announced the community approval of its migration to Solana.\n\nThe Render Network allows idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to be used for the digital rendering needed in fields like 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nThe WOO coin, the utility token of crypto trading platform Woo Network, was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer with a rise of 23.14% to trade at US$0.25. The token started its rally on April 10, days after crypto exchange Kraken announced the launch of WOO perpetual contracts.\n\nNext week: Market eyes US$32,000 Bitcoin price\n\n\u201cAll eyes are on US$32,000, a resistance that may determine the beginning of a bull run. A break above this brings US$38,000 within a reachable scope,\u201d wrote Isige.\n\nBut Ikrom Ergashev, co-founder of blockchain investment analytics firm Neironix, expects Bitcoin to move sideways next week at US$29,000-32,000, he said in emailed comments.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum stands firm as Shapella upgrade rolls out"

        "title": "Bitcoin Tops $30K, Here\u2019s the Next Target If Bulls Keep it Up (Bitcoin Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has been increasing consistently lately, continuing its bullish phase since the beginning of the year. However, the market is currently at a key resistance level, and its reaction is essential for the trend in the next few months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy:Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has finally broken out of the tight consolidation range around the $28K mark, aggressively attacking the $30K resistance. This level is both a crucial psychological and technical resistance area and would likely shape the short-term future of the crypto market.\n\nA breakout could result in a bullish continuation towards the next significant resistance zone, which is located around the $38K mark, while a rejection would lead to a drop towards the 50-day moving average located around the $26K level and even the $25K support area.\n\nEither way, the bulls can still be optimistic while the price remains above the 200-day moving average, which is an important bull/bear market indicator.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price is struggling to break past the $30K resistance level after rebounding from the $28K support area a few days ago.\n\nThe RSI indicator also demonstrates a clear bearish divergence signal, which hints at a potential consolidation or correction in the short term.\n\nIn this case, the $28K level could once more be counted on to hold the price, while the $25K area might also be retested in case of a deeper correction. All in all, there is no shortage of support levels, and the bulls could finally relax after almost a year of a gruesome bearish market environment.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nBitcoin Short-Term Holders SOPR\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been constantly rising, and many investors who bought at prices lower than $30K are now in profit. These holders are now expected to realize at least some of their profits, and the SOPR metric validates this analysis.\n\nThe short-term holders\u2019 Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is a useful on-chain metric that measures the ratio of realized profits by holders who have bought their coins in the past six months. Values above 1 indicate profit-taking, and values below one are interpreted as investors selling their coins at a loss.\n\nIt is evident that short-term holders who bought their Bitcoin in the past few months have realized profits aggressively at a rate similar to the $69K all-time high range. While profit realization is a natural behavior in a bull market, it could result in a bearish reversal and even a bear market continuation towards lower prices if supply is not met with sufficient demand.\n\nTherefore, this metric should be monitored constantly to determine whether the market is in the beginning stages of a new bull run or just another bull trap."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been seeing bullish trends in recent months. However, experts believe that other cryptocurrencies, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ), may be ready for a surge in 2023. In this article, we will explore why experts are bullish on SHIB and RENQ and what factors may contribute to their potential growth.\n\nBTC sees bullish trends\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge to a nine-month high is a positive indication that the medium-term bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market is starting to shift. While the daily charts show a bullish trend, there may still be some short-term consolidation to consider.\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, BTC/USD surpassed the 200-day moving average, the 89-day moving average, and the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, signaling the start of an uptrend. The downward correction in March was halted at the 200-day moving average, further supporting the emerging uptrend.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $30,400, after peaking at a 10-month high of $30,540 last week.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) Overview\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020. It was created as a decentralized alternative to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB has gained popularity due to its low value, which allows investors to buy large quantities of the cryptocurrency at a relatively low price.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ), on the other hand, is a DeFi token that aims to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges. It offers a comprehensive solution that is accessible to all types of traders, from novices to seasoned professionals. Its innovative features, strong community support, and potential for growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the DeFi space.\n\nBullish Trends for SHIB and RENQ:\n\nExperts believe that both SHIB and RENQ are poised for a surge in 2023. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nGrowing Popularity : SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature. It has also been listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, which has increased its exposure and legitimacy in the market. RENQ has also been gaining popularity due to its innovative features and potential to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges.\n\n: SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature.

        "title": "What is Mining in Crypto? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "15 years after the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper was published, \u2018What is mining in cryptocurrency?\u2019 is still the question on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue. The birth of blockchain technology and the crypto market began with Bitcoin mining.\n\nInitially, Bitcoin miners could mine new coins with a laptop in their bedrooms. Today, professional mining operations are worth millions, with ASIC mining farms burning through a huge amount of energy to earn new Bitcoin payouts.\n\nCrypto mining isn\u2019t only about earning digital currency through block rewards; it also helps secure the blockchain network.\n\nDespite crypto mining being an iconic industry staple, the mining process remains complicated and inaccessible to most people. In this article, we\u2019ll break down cryptocurrency mining for beginners and unpack how it works.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency Mining?\n\nCryptocurrency mining is the process by which new blocks are added to a blockchain and new coins are \u2018minted\u2019, or created. In the case of the Bitcoin network, miners receive new bitcoins in exchange for validating transactions on a decentralized public ledger.\n\nCrypto mining is a competitive game. Miners want to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible, so having large mining rigs with powerful mining hardware gives them a better chance of earning the right to create new blocks.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nWhen you have thousands of individual miners and mining farms trying to create new blocks for a distributed ledger like the Bitcoin blockchain, there needs to be an algorithm that decides who \u2018wins.\u2019 We call this the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat Is Proof-of-Work?\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, Bitcoin miners compete to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. In its simplest definition, powerful computers work to solve complex mathematical problems and validate Bitcoin transactions. The first miner to find the answer creates the new block and earns their mining rewards.\n\nDiving a bit deeper, every new block generates a target hash. The target hash is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. These digits are made up of not only numbers from 1-10 but also letters A-F. The first miner to guess a number lower or equal to the target hash gets to create the next block and earn the reward.\n\nSource: Union Journal\n\nWith trillions of possible solutions, the odds of guessing these numbers are extremely difficult. Miners with powerful mining equipment can make more \u2018guesses\u2019 faster, giving them a better chance of being the first to find the number.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the classic example of a Proof-of-Work chain in action, there are plenty of other examples. These include altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and pre-merge Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBefore taking a closer look at the specifics of crypto mining, let\u2019s have a quick recap:\n\nCryptocurrency mining creates new blocks for a blockchain network and mints new coins to the circulating supply.\n\nMiners compete amongst themselves to solve complex equations, verify new transactions and earn mining rewards.\n\nHigher computing power increases the chance of being the first miner to solve an equation.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin white paper, bitcoin mining was far more democratized than now. Anyone with a computer could start mining at home with a half-decent GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).\n\nBitcoin mining has since become a serious business, with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) mining farms reaching explosive hash rates and boosting mining difficulty.\n\nIndividual miners struggle to compete with the larger players. To compete in the crypto mining monopoly, smaller miners often join forces to create mining pools, where each miner gets their fair share of new coins.\n\nMining Difficulty\n\nAs the name would suggest, mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the problem each miner is trying to solve. Remember the hexadecimal number that every miner tries to find that we mentioned earlier? The more miners competing to create new blocks, the more possible solutions there are that miners have to guess correctly.\n\nWhen mining difficulty is high, that generally means that market conditions are bullish for Bitcoin or whichever PoW cryptocurrency is being mined. Another way of looking at crypto mining demand is a network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nHash Rate\n\nA blockchain\u2019s hash rate is an indicator of its computational power. Put simply, a network\u2019s hash rate measures how many guesses all miners in the system make per second. To give you an idea, in Q1 2023, Bitcoin averaged a hash rate of roughly 310 million terahashes per second.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nA hash rate can also refer to the computational power of individual mining units or groups of miners. Powerful ASIC miners with high hash rates have a better of solving the mining puzzle first, making them far more desirable than smaller CPUs.\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is an event that happens every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. After each halving, the number of new bitcoins in each block reward is cut in half.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin blockchain first went live, each newly minted block paid out 50 bitcoins to miners. Since then, we\u2019ve witnessed three Bitcoin halvings, bringing the block rewards to 6.25 bitcoins per newly created block.\n\nSome miners anticipate that the last Bitcoin will be mined sometime around 2140. If this eventually comes to pass, miners will still earn rewards paid in BTC. However, these rewards will come from network transaction fees rather than newly minted block rewards.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving is considered a significant event that historically marks the start of a new bull run. This is because when new emissions of BTC are cut in half, the selling pressure that miners generally provide evaporates. After every recorded halving, the price of Bitcoin has reacted positively.\n\nCrypto Mining Pros and Cons\n\nWhile crypto mining can be a good way to acquire new coins and help secure a blockchain network you want to support, many drawbacks remain.\n\nPros\n\nEarn Crypto Rewards\n\nThe main benefit that attracts people to crypto mining is simple. Crypto mining can be a profitable enterprise if managed correctly. Mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Dogecoin gives investors a revenue stream of their chosen cryptos.\n\nFor miners with a long-term outlook, this is a great way to accumulate new coins without buying them from a crypto exchange like Coinbase.\n\nSecure and Decentralize a Network\n\nOn top of earning rewards, miners also help to keep the blockchain safe from hacks and malicious actors. Moreover, running a mining operation also helps to decentralize and further distribute the blockchain, making it less reliant on central points of failure.\n\nThis aligns with the original vision of the Bitcoin network, which is to provide a distributed public ledger owned and operated by the people, for the people.\n\nCons\n\nSustainability Problems\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue facing Bitcoin and its mass adoption is its monstrous energy consumption. The Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism demands an enormous amount of power. For example, when Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, the network reduced its power consumption by 99%.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, the network consumes as much energy as the entire nation of Kazakhstan over a year and has a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Singapore.\n\nHigh Costs\n\nStarting a mining operation is a risky business. First, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to turn a consistent profit through crypto mining. Volatility in the crypto market presents a constant and significant risk to new miners trying to enter the mining business.\n\nNot to mention the expensive mining equipment and high electricity costs associated with crypto mining.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s immense energy consumption concerns, emerging blockchains are moving away from crypto mining and the Proof-of-Work algorithm. Top blockchain protocols like Ethereum, Cardano, and Avalanche all use a variety of a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, which is far more energy efficient.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nWith time, crypto mining outside the Bitcoin blockchain might cease as emerging networks opt for more sustainable alternatives.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "After struggling to hit $25,000 just one month ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has surged in value, breaking the $30k barrier and becoming one of the most profitable assets in the world once again.\n\nWhile the traditional banking market has remained turbulent, Bitcoin (BTC) has consistently increased in price, taking projects like Solana (SOL) and Collateral Network (COLT), which has already seen 40% returns, with it.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Hits $30k, But How High Will It Go?\n\nIn the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC) has increased in price by 7.58%, adding an extra $2,113.32 to its value with one Bitcoin (BTC) now selling for $30,014. This is the highest value Bitcoin (BTC) has reached since July 2022 and suggests that the crypto bear market is coming to an end.\n\nHaving increased in price by 34.47% in the last thirty days alone, market analysts are now asking how high Bitcoin (BTC) will go. Most believe that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit $32k before the end of April, though not all are as optimistic. Some experts have stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could have hit a new price barrier, which would limit returns for investors who get involved now.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSolana (SOL) Up 20%, But Could It Be Too Late To Profit?\n\nSolana (SOL) experienced a turbulent month in March following a fork in the Solana (SOL) blockchain, which caused throughput to crash. This created security concerns among holders, though Solana (SOL) has since bounced back in line with Bitcoin (BTC) trends.\n\nOver the past 30 days, Solana (SOL) has increased in price by 20.26%, with a 15.31% price increase in the last five days alone. One Solana (SOL) token, at the time of writing, is worth $23.72, its highest price since February 2023. However, with Solana (SOL) relying on market trends, analysts believe it could be too late to make short-term profits on Solana (SOL), with many expecting the project to hit a price wall in April.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Offers Strong Returns Despite Market Trends\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a new DeFi project with great potential. Having already increased in value during its presale, analysts believe that Collateral Network (COLT) could offer a massive ROI of 35x for bullish investors.\n\nUnlike many DeFi projects, which increase in value based on the market, Collateral Network (COLT) looks to offer great returns with its unique utility. Collateral Network (COLT) looks to influence the crowdfunding market by allowing borrowers to unlock liquidity quickly from their valuable real-world assets. Jewellery, cars and fine art are a few examples of usable, physical assets.\n\nEach asset is brought on-chain in the form of a fractionalized NFT. Once on-chain, lenders can loan money in the form of NFT fractions instead of offering the full amount upfront. The borrower then repays the lenders to have their asset returned. However, should the borrower default on their payments, the asset will be auctioned to Collateral Network (COLT) token holders to ensure lenders are paid.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) showcases several benefits for users, including 2FA security options and secure transactions that never impact the borrower\u2019s credit rating. Borrowers can also acquire funds quickly, receiving cash in just 24 hours.\n\nCollateral Networks (COLT) native token COLT is currently selling for $0.014 during its presale after a recent price increase. Holders will earn several benefits throughout the Collateral Network (COLT) ecosystem and will have the potential to profit from the 3,500% price increase predicted over the next six months.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Over the past few years, meme coins have taken the crypto industry by storm by offering ways for investors to generate huge profits from tokens that seem to have no intrinsic value.\n\nHowever, as we move into 2023, many meme tokens with exciting prospects and real-world utility are now providing limitless growth opportunities.\n\nOne of these meme tokens with an exciting prospect is DigiToads, a recent toad-featuring token revolutionizing the crypto industry with its deflationary, utility-rich, community-oriented features.\n\nCompared to major crypto projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), DigiToads (TOADS) has proven to be a high-growth token.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look at the new token, DigiToads (TOADS), as it compares to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) is a deflationary meme coin with a focus on real-world utility. DigiToads is a high-growth token. And holders of its native token, TOADS, will earn residual income through NFT staking and P2E gaming.\n\nThe DigiToads\u2019 P2E Gaming features an exciting web3 game that allows players to collect, nurture and battle other unique DigiToads.\n\nEach DigiToad has its own characteristics, giving players a wide range of options. Players will acquire these DigiToads by buying, trading, or winning them.\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to make their DigiToads the strongest in the swamp arena. They can achieve this by using their TOADS tokens to purchase food and training equipment for their DigiToads.\n\nThese items will help their DigiToads learn new abilities, increase their size and strength, thereby helping the players compete better in battles against other players.\n\nAt the end of the DigiToads season, which lasts for one month, the platform allocates 50% of the funds raised from sales to the prize fund and distributes it among the top 25% of players. This provides the players with an opportunity to earn real money while enjoying the game.\n\nThe DigiToads ecosystem also incorporates NFT staking. This is a well-designed system that guarantees that the community is always rewarded.\n\nThe platform ensures that 2% of every TOADS transaction is put into the staking pool allowing users who stake their NFTs to get rewards depending on how much time their tokens are staked.\n\nDigiToads also plans to support the Amazon rainforest, home to many species of toads and frogs. The platform will donate 2.5% of the money raised from its sales to charities dedicated to replanting trees and preserving the rainforest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency which one can use to purchase, sell, and exchange directly with other users without any intermediary.\n\nThe token\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, said that there is the need for \u201can electronic payment system based on crypto proof instead of trust.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is open-source; nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can participate. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without any need for a central authority; managing transactions is carried out by the network.\n\nThrough its special properties, Bitcoin includes many exciting features not covered by previous payment systems.\n\nSince its launch, Bitcoin has risen dramatically in value. Although it once sold for under $10 per token, as of April 11, one BTC sells for about $30,000.\n\nBecause its supply is limited to only 21 million tokens, many crypto experts expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to keep rising, especially as more big investors begin to treat it as digital gold to hedge against market inflation and volatility.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is an open-source blockchain developed in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, who wanted a project that would deliver much more possibilities against Bitcoin\u2019s design for storing and transferring money.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s thinking was: if one can use blockchain technology to decentralize money, why can\u2019t we use the same blockchain to decentralize other things?\n\nEthereum introduced the decentralized app (DApp) system, enabling developers to create applications that expanded the use of blockchain to many uses.\n\nThe Ethereum network is the leading system for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi). The system aids smart contracts in executing secure financial transactions. Smart contracts allow decentralized applications to run automatically on the blockchain when specific predetermined conditions are met.\n\nThe supply of ETH is infinite, and there are currently more than 121 million in circulation. The 2022 Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d will dramatically slow the creation of new tokens and possibly make Ether deflationary.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TOADS token is a high-growth asset that offers tremendous growth opportunities for investors to earn passive income through holding the tokens, NFT staking, and P2E gaming.\n\nDigiToads presale for the TOADS has just started, with over $1.2m raised so far. The token is currently selling at the price of $0.016.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity for early investors to achieve higher returns on their investment as the presale will go through ten stages, with the token\u2019s price increasing at each stage.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As the 2023 Bitcoin (BTC) rally continues, the cryptocurrency has recently achieved a 10-month high, surpassing $30,000, benefiting from generally positive market sentiment. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the next price target for Bitcoin, especially with the ongoing economic uncertainties.\n\nIn this line, in a tweet on April 15, Stockmoney Lizards, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, said the current gains are part of a pre-halving rally that mirrors the 2020 surge of around 320% after reaching a bottom. During both periods, Bitcoin has also attained a Fibonacci retracement of 38.2%.\n\nLooking ahead, the analyst noted that Bitcoin hitting $49,000 remains a \u2018possible target for the next months\u2019 based on historical price movements.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIt is worth noting that the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April or May 2024, when the block reward will fall to 3.125. The halving events are considered a bullish sentiment for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s new resistance levels\n\nBitcoin\u2019s latest surge has partly emerged as the world economy is witnessing a decline in inflation, leading to expectations that central banks may soon shift their policies towards monetary easing. Therefore, crypto trading analyst Michael van de Poppe, in a tweet on April 14, suggested that Bitcoin looks strong overall but cautioned investors to expect \u201cshallow corrections in an upwards trend\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve marked $31.7-32K as important resistance point. However, $25K was the level everyone wanted to buy. This will probably shift to $28.5K, and then nobody buys. I\u2019d prefer to focus on $29.7K,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart.

According to the chart, as of April 15, BTC is currently in the \u2018Accumulate\u2019 zone after a period of consolidation in the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 area.\n\nBitcoin rainbow chart. Source: Blockchaincenter\n\nInterestingly, this pattern resembles a previous trend in March 2020, days before the halving event. In March 2020, Bitcoin emerged from the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 zone while trading below $6,000. This event marked a significant turning point for the cryptocurrency, triggering a price bottom that eventually led to a surge in value towards the 2021 bull run. Ultimately, this upward trend culminated in BTC reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nThe tool serves as a valuable resource for investors to track future price fluctuations of Bitcoin. It uses color bands that follow a logarithmic regression and assesses the historical price performance of Bitcoin, providing insight into the asset\u2019s long-term movements.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin gains come after the asset positively reacted to the banking crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike, resulting in consolidation. At the same time, following the release of the non-farm payrolls report, which showed a decline in March, the market started to experience renewed bullish activity. Inflation data also indicated a drop in consumer prices in China, which helped to push Bitcoin above $30,000 once again.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,446 with slight corrections of over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up almost 9%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

A summary of the gauges is for \u2018buy\u2019 at 14, while \u2018moving averages\u2018 recommend \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin proponents believe the asset is at a pivotal phase in its adoption journey, especially with the U.S. dollar facing an onslaught over its status as the world reserve currency. Bitcoin\u2019s possibility to hit $50,000 will also rely on the broader economic trajectory and external factors like regulatory outlook.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
