        "title": "Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million in just 7 years according to a new report from Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest - Fortune",
        "content": "FTX customers still don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to get their money back; Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial is ongoing; and the Crypto Winter of deflated coin values continues to drag on. But one of cryptocurrency\u2019s biggest optimists still says the coin that started it all is primed for a massive comeback.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management, the firm that has continued to buy crypto and shares of crypto companies even during the sector\u2019s historic downturn over the past year, is betting on Bitcoin rising to new heights soon enough. All investors need is a little patience and faith.\n\nARK forecasted Bitcoin to bounce back from its current lows to eventually be worth $1.48 million by 2030 in a new report published this week, a bullish scenario that would see Bitcoin\u2019s value rising by more than 6,300% in just seven years.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $23,000, a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $70,000 achieved in November 2021. Those were good times for crypto bulls, when up to a quarter of holders were convinced that Bitcoin could exceed $100,000 in fewer than five years. Cathie Wood was exceptionally upbeat about Bitcoin\u2019s chances, even predicting in 2021 that it could hit $500,000 by 2026 if institutional investors and investment banks began piling in.\n\nThat was also peak crypto, as it turns out. As inflation rose last year and enthusiasm for speculative assets including cryptocurrencies dwindled, the Crypto Winter began and coins tumbled in value.\n\nIn the 12 months after its November 2021 peak, the sector shaved off over $2 trillion in value, with Bitcoin in particular down 65% since then. Crypto companies that had become mainstays, including Coinbase and Genesis, began cutting back and laying off staff. A number of crypto companies including Three Arrows Capital and Celsius filed for bankruptcy, while the entire industry was rocked in November when FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, collapsed and lost over $8 billion in customer funds.\n\nBut through it all, Cathie Wood and ARK have held firm on their big Bitcoin bet. Even during the cataclysmic FTX implosion, ARK research director Frank Downing said the firm\u2019s conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology had \u201conly increased\u201d in the wake of the crash. In December, Wood tweeted that the Bitcoin blockchain \u201cdidn\u2019t skip a beat\u201d during the FTX debacle, which she took to signify the coin\u2019s transparency and resilience during downtimes.\n\nOver the next seven years, ARK expects Bitcoin to become a \u201cmultitrillion-dollar market\u201d because of its strong fundamentals, according to the new report, as the firm expects the crypto asset to outperform \u201cevery major asset class over longer time horizons.\u201d The sector\u2019s recent difficulties may even help restore trust in Bitcoin in the long term as exchange companies become more transparent with their finances to avoid a similar fate that befell FTX, ARK argued. Institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity have not wavered on their commitment to Bitcoin despite the market downturn, the report also found, reinforcing the coin\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nEven in ARK\u2019s \u201cbear case\u201d scenario, Bitcoin\u2019s value is expected to rise to a record $258,500 by 2030. In the firm\u2019s \u201cbase case\u201d scenario, Bitcoin will grow to be worth $682,800."

        "title": "Five reasons why millionaires are back investing in Bitcoin - FinTech Magazine",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the leading decentralised digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority, has become the focus of investors recently due to several factors.\n\nIn fact, a recent report by the financial services company deVere Group, analysed data that revealed an astonishing 82% of millionaires are now seeking advice on Bitcoin investment.\n\nAccording to the report, Eight out of 10 high net worth (HNW) individuals have asked their financial advisers about including cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, into their portfolios over the last 12 months - despite the market experiencing a difficult year in 2022.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains a highly speculative and volatile investment, its growing mainstream acceptance and increasing institutional adoption have made it a focus for investors looking for alternative investment opportunities. It is important for potential investors to thoroughly understand the risks and volatility associated with Bitcoin before investing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive reasons why HNW investors are buying up Bitcoin\n\n# 1 Scarcity\n\n\n\nBitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, making it a scarce asset, which has attracted investors looking for an alternative to traditional investments. Its \u2018limited edition\u2019 availability means that even though its value has risen, and plummeted, and risen over the years, as the world\u2019s most popular crypto currency, it will, most likely, always hold a reasonable price.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2 Volatility\n\n\n\nStrangely enough, Bitcoin's volatility is one of the reasons why its so popular with investors. The price can fluctuate greatly in short periods of time, creating potential for high returns, but also higher risk. For big ticket market players who can afford to watch and wait for the value to rise, it's a good bet.\n\n\n\n\n\n#3 Decentralisation\n\n\n\nThe decentralised nature of Bitcoin has made it attractive to investors who are seeking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional financial systems that are often subject to government control and regulation. Privacy is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as governments continuously seek to regulate and control the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n#4 Increased institutional adoption\n\n\n\nIn recent years, major financial institutions and corporations have shown increasing interest in Bitcoin, lending credibility to the asset and further fuelling investor interest. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2022, while banks are expanding their cryptocurrency services in a bid to keep up with the more agile and innovative fintechs.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan, like many other major legacy financial institutions, including Fidelity, BlackRock and New York Bank Mellon, have also begun to offer crypto-related services to their clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n#5 Macroeconomic factors\n\n\n\nThe economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as low interest rates and increased monetary stimulus, has also contributed to a rise in Bitcoin's popularity among investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Bitcoin is growing in popularity again?\n\nSpeaking about the results of the recent study, Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of deVere Group, notes: \u201cIn 2022, the crypto market delivered its worst performance since 2018, with Bitcoin, the headline-grabbing market leader, falling about 75% during the year.\n\n\u201cThe price drops came as investors reduced their exposure to risk-on assets, including stocks and crypto, due to heightened concerns about inflation and slower economic growth.\n\n\u201cYet against this backdrop of the so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019, HNWs were consistently seeking advice from their financial advisers about including digital currencies into their portfolios.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cInterestingly, this typically more conservative group was not deterred by the bear market and adverse market conditions. Instead, they were looking to either start including or increasing their exposure to crypto.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that these high-net-worth clients are increasingly aware of the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which has the core values of being digital, global, borderless, decentralised and tamper-proof.\n\n\u201cWealthy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money, and they don\u2019t want to be left in the past.\u201d\n\nMany of these HNWs who were polled will also have seen a consistent surge in interest being expressed by institutional investors, including Wall Street giants, who bring further capital, influence and confidence to the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the crypto winter thawing?\n\nThe deVere CEO believes that this momentum of interest is set to build further as the \u2018crypto winter\u2019 of 2022 is thawing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is on track for its best January since 2013 based on hopes that inflation has peaked, monetary policies become more favourable, and the various crypto-sector crises including high-profile bankruptcies are now in the rear-view mirror,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is up over 40% since the turn of the year and this will not go unnoticed by HNW clients and others who want to build wealth for the future.\u201d\n\nGreen added, \u201cIf HNWs were expressing such huge interest in the 2022 bear market, as market conditions steadily improve, they\u2019re going to be amongst the first to capitalise in the forthcoming bull run.\u201d\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "With a gain of 39.4% this month, Bitcoin is closing out its best month since a 40% rally in October 2021 and its best January since 2013.\n\nCurrently changing hands at $22,910, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been trading over the past week at its highest level since August of last year. The largest cryptocurrency hasn't given holders such an uplifting January in a decade.\n\n\u201cWe started January off with some explosive price action the week of December's CPI print,\u201d said Christopher Newhouse, options trader with crypto market maker GSR.\n\nFrom Newhouse's perspective, buyer side demand from institutional takers \u2014 whether macro driven traders or hedge funds \u2014 returned in the first two weeks of the month, which sparked initial short seller liquidations.\n\nIn the 12 days following December's inflation report released on Jan. 12, $1.3 billion worth of short positions on bitcoin were liquidated, or $611 million as net of long positions, according to crypto derivatives aggregator CoinGlass. Over the past week, the trend has reversed with $331 million in long positions liquidated, or $108 million net of short positions.\n\nBetween January 10 and 20, which is when bitcoin saw its largest moves higher, speculation-driven momentum traders returned to the market, spearheading bitcoin breaking out from a range of between $15,700 and $18,000.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s pushes above $20,000 and $22,000 both happened on Fridays as dealers had large amounts of negative gamma exposure and forced to hedge towards the end of U.S. hours trading,\" Newhouse observed.\n\nAnalysts say the next leg for bitcoin will likely be determined in the days following the Federal Reserve's monthly rate hike decision.\n\n\u201cThis market is going to start to trade very technical,\u201d Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda told Yahoo Finance, \"Volatility is coming back.\"\n\nThe return of bitcoin buying looks similar to what occurred from July through early August according to Michael Safai, co-founder and partner with crypto trading firm, Dexterity Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It takes about two months or so for the crypto market to stabilize after a major shock, and we\u2019re at that point post-FTX,\" Safai said over email.\n\n\"The worst of the damage has been inflicted, investors are relatively confident that there are no more shoes to drop, as reflected in the muted reception to the Genesis bankruptcy, and risk appetite is starting to slowly return.\"\n\nNEW YORK, US - JANUARY 03: Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the court in New York, on January 03, 2023. (Photo by Fatih Aktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nYear to date, the total market capitalization for cryptocurrencies is up 24% to $1.05 trillion, according to Coinmarketcap. Across spot exchanges worldwide, global crypto volume has risen to $5.5 trillion, which is up 61% since the beginning of the year, according to crypto indexing platform Nomics.\n\nData collected by blockchain analytics platform Glassnode finds since bitcoin regained a price above $21,000, the current market rally has pushed buyers of the largest cryptocurrency from 2019 and earlier back above breakeven.\n\n\"These psychological levels matter,\" Moya added.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, DeFi and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube"

Overall, it suggests the company\u2019s bitcoin investment resulted in a net loss of $140 million throughout the course of 2022, TechCrunch reports.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s small in comparison to Tesla\u2019s initial bitcoin investment announced in February 2021, when it said it had bought $1.5 billion of the digital currency and planned to start accepting it as payment for its vehicles. But it didn\u2019t hold on to the bulk of this investment for long. Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed in June 2021 that it had already sold 10 percent of its bitcoin holdings, apparently to confirm it \u201ccould be liquidated easily without moving [the] market,\u201d and by July 2022 the company had sold three quarters of its bitcoin purchases.\n\nAs of December 31st, 2022, Tesla says it held $191 million in bitcoin at fair market value. That\u2019s compared to $1.99 billion on December 31st, 2021.\n\nMusk said Tesla had sold 10 percent of its bitcoin as of June 2021. Screenshot: Twitter\n\nThe company\u2019s experiment with accepting bitcoin as payment for its cars lasted an even shorter period of time. It went live in March 2021 but was pulled in May less than two months later, with the company citing the carbon emissions associated with mining the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Tesla recorded a $204 million impairment loss in 2022 on its bitcoin holdings, according to regulatory filings. The loss was offset by $64 million in profits from bitcoin trading, leaving the automaker with a net loss of $140 million.\n\nTesla had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the first quarter of 2021, stating that it believed in the longevity of the cryptocurrency. At the time, the company said bitcoin was a great place to store cash and still access it immediately, all the while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central banks. In fact, after its initial purchase, Tesla promptly trimmed its position by 10%, making the automaker a quick $101 million.\n\nIn March 2021, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would start accepting bitcoin as payments for Tesla vehicles, causing the price of the crypto to boom. A few weeks later, Musk and Tesla backpedaled on that decision, expressing concern for the amount of energy needed to mine bitcoin. The price of bitcoin then subsequently sank.\n\nLast year, as the value of bitcoin began to plunge, Tesla sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings and used the proceeds to buy traditional currency. The automaker today owns about $184 million worth of bitcoin, and may be holding out for a rebound.\n\nThe crypto market has experienced a dramatic drawdown over the past year. Today, bitcoin is trading at $23,045.50, which is about 66% below the all-time high of $68,789.63. Despite losing over half its value, some experts say bitcoin has remained resilient and may experience a comeback, especially as buyers spooked by the crypto market in general gravitate toward household names and more mature ecosystems, like bitcoin or ether.\n\nTesla disbanded its press department and could not be reached for comment."

        "content": "A New York City woman has been charged with using cryptocurrency to provide financial support to terrorist groups in Syria, a rare prosecution involving virtual currency to fund terrorism.\n\nThe 11-count indictment charged Victoria Jacobs, 43, who was known as Bakhrom Talipov, with providing support for an act of terrorism, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nJacobs provided material support to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S. State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization, and provided more than $5,000 to the terrorist training group Malhama Tactical, which fought with and provided special tactical and military training to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the indictment said.\n\n\"This case marks the first time that terrorism financing is being prosecuted in New York State Court and is one of the rare cases worldwide where cryptocurrency is alleged to have financed terrorism,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement.\n\nJacobs allegedly laundered $10,661 on behalf of Malhama Tactical by receiving cryptocurrency and Western Union and MoneyGram wires from supporters around the globe and sending the funds to Bitcoin wallets controlled by Malhama Tactical. In addition to sending cryptocurrency, she also purchased Google Play gift cards for the organization, according to the indictment.\n\nIn October 2018, the defendant saved notes on her cellphone, which the indictment quoted as saying \"Assalamu aleykum my dear brothers and sisters, we currently are buildings new place (train camp), it's getting cold and we need new place, who want help us and support can do this safely and anonymously by Bitcoin wallet. Send me DM for details. Retweet.\"\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, DogeCoin, Ripple and Litecoin are placed on PC motherboard in this illustration taken, June 29, 2021. Dado Ruvic/Reuters/Illustration, FILE\n\nIn December 2019, Jacobs provided a comprehensive U.S. Army Improvised Munitions Handbook to an online group -- which she believed was associated with both Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda affiliated Jihadist group Hurras al-Din -- to facilitate their bomb-making efforts in Syria, the indictment said.\n\nProsecutors said Jacobs bought military-style combat knives, metal knuckles and throwing stars in August 2021 that were found in her Upper East Side apartment.\n\n\"Disturbingly, approximately one month later, on September 21-22, 2021, the defendant, in a Telegram chat, claimed to be a 'brother' who was 'behind enemy lines' and asked for prayers for the 'courage, strength, guidance, and wisdom to carry out certain missions,'\" Assistant District Attorney Edward Burns said in a court filing.\n\n\"Along with these statements, defendant posted a 15-second video clip of an unknown person ominously moving around with a firearm,\" he continued. \"The timing of this post and the defendant's acquisition of the weapons supports the conclusion that she intended to use the weapons in an unlawful manner.\"\n\nJacobs is being held without bail.\n\nIn a parallel investigation, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged four defendants in December with crowdfunding support for ISIS using cryptocurrency, Bitcoin wallets, GoFundMe and PayPal to collect what they called \"blood money.\""

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management said bitcoin could hit $1.48 million by 2030, a 6,326% increase from its current price.\n\nThat's under its bull-case scenario, while its base case sees bitcoin reaching $682,800 by that time. The crypto is currently trading flat at $23,031 on Wednesday, according to Messari.\n\nArk detailed the token's outlook in a new report, which predicted that bitcoin could \"scale into a multi-trillion dollar market\" by the end of the decade. Even the famed money manager's bear case for bitcoin is a price target of $258,500 in the next seven years, a 1,022% increase from the crypto's current price.\n\nThe firm maintained that bitcoin's fundamentals are sound despite a turbulent 2022. To support its bold calls, the report pointed to continued institutional adoption, higher hash rates, and long-term holder supply of bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bullish estimates come amid a severe and lengthy crypto market rut. Bitcoin is down 65% from its all-time high in November 2021, with the industry's total market value off over 64% from its peak.\n\nCrypto markets took hits in the past year on inflation concerns, leaving traders with little risk appetite, along with a series of industry bankruptcies, which caused widespread contagion. Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, and centralized lender Celsius all landed in bankruptcy court.\n\n\"Contagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin's value propositions: decentralization, auditability, and transparency,\" the report said. \"Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused.\"\n\nThis isn't Wood's or Ark's first eyebrow-raising price prediction. In May of 2021, Wood told Bloomberg that bitcoin will likely rise to $500,000 in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We think bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose,\" she said after FTX's market-moving bankruptcy filing.\n\nArk continues to double down on its crypto-related bets despite the downturn in digital assets. Since the start of the year, Ark's flagship exchange-traded fund, ARKK, bought 108,548 Coinbase shares, worth $6.3 million at its current price. ARKK surged 28% in January, notching its best monthly performance ever."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) had a rough time all throughout 2022.\n\nBut fresh on-chain and futures market data show positive signs that the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has started to recover.\n\nAfter a bevy of short liquidations, the futures market is pointing toward renewed equilibrium. According to data from Glassnode, short position liquidations cleared out unhealthy market speculators, on-chain and exchange data now point to an improving spot market and exchange netflows.\n\nA large group of investors that were previously at a loss is now back in the category that Glassnode analysts label as \u201cunrealized profits.\u201d\n\nMassive short liquidations set the groundwork for new investors to thrive\n\nFutures data typically hold an equilibrium between longs and shorts. As the market moves, investors tend to update their futures to avoid liquidation. Conversely, in mid-January, investors were caught off guard which resulted in an all-time high of 85% short liquidations.\n\nFutures liquidation long versus short ratio. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe short liquidation dominance has helped fuel the current Bitcoin rally. In January, over $495 million in short futures were liquidated. Liquidated shorts create automatic Bitcoin purchases, thus driving up the BTC price. The year-to-date liquidations have three large waves that peaked at $165 million in one day of liquidations.\n\nTotal liquidations. Source: Glassnode\n\nAfter the historic amount of short liquidations, the futures market is trending toward longs. On Jan. 30, 51.46% of open interests are long positions rather than shorts.\n\nLong versus short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe liquidation of shorts not only helped Bitcoin price rally but also seemingly suggests a return of positive sentiment in the BTC market.\n\nGlassnode researchers said:\n\n\u201cAcross both perpetual swap, and calendar futures, the cash and carry basis is now back into positive territory, yielding 7.3% and 3.3% annualized, respectively. This comes after much of November and December saw backwardation across all futures markets, and suggests a return of positive sentiment, and perhaps with a side of speculation.\u201d\n\nBitcoin annualized premium. Source: Glassnode\n\nCentralized exchange netflows reach equilibrium\n\nIn March 2020, centralized exchange (CEX) Bitcoin balances reached an all-time high. Since then, Bitcoin has flowed out of spot exchanges. Approximately 2.25 million BTC are currently held across 21 of the top exchanges, which is a multi-year low. The 11.7% of the total Bitcoin supply held on centralized exchanges was last witnessed in February 2018.\n\nBitcoin exchange balance. Source: Glassnode\n\nTypically throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history, exchange inflows and outflows are similar, creating an even balance. This balance was disrupted in November when net outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges reached $200 million to $300 million per day. The large outflow during this period was historic, resulting in 200,000 Bitcoin leaving exchanges ovethe month.\n\nBitcoin net position change on exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nAs Bitcoin started gaining bullish momentum in January, centralized exchange inflow and outflow has normalized. The net flows are now closer to neutral, with a reduction in the high outflow trend.\n\nMultiple Bitcoin investor cohorts return to the \u201cunrealized profit\u201d zone\n\nBitcoin\u2019s movement in and out of exchanges helps provide analysts an estimate for investors\u2019 BTC acquisition price. During the 2022 bear market, only investors from before 2017 were in potential profit. Investors arriving to Bitcoin after 2018 were all at an unrealized loss.\n\nAccording to Glassnode researchers:\n\n\u201cThrough the 2022 downtrend, only those investors from 2017 and earlier avoided hitting a net unrealized loss, with the class of 2018+ seeing their cost basis taken out by the FTX red candle. The current rally however has pushed the class of 2019 ($21.8k) and earlier back into an unrealized profit.\u201d\n\nBitcoin average withdrawal price. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe fact that a growing number of investor cohorts have returned to profitability is a good sign, especially after Bitcoin witnessed record realized losses in December.\n\nTwo of the largest investor groups, those who purchased BTC on Coinbase and Binance, hold an average BTC acquisition price of $21,000. As Bitcoin continues to try to reach $24,000, any upcoming correction caused by macro factors may push down the unrealized profits in these groups.\n\nExchange average withdrawal price. Source: Glassnode\n\nPositive signs of Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery can be seen in on-chain, spot exchange and futures data. The futures market is indicating a renewed equilibrium following a record-high amount of short liquidations.\n\nThe market is now showing improved exchange netflows and spot market activity suggests that investors are slowly trickling back into the crypto market.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

Throughout, concerns have called for an imminent come-down, and even new macro BTC price lows as disbelief swept the market. That grim turnaround has yet to come to fruition, and the coming days could yet turn out to be a crucial period for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trend. It\u2019s going to be a busy week for the markets as the United States Federal Reserve will decide on its next rate hike this week, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell giving much-anticipated commentary on the economy and policy. The European Central Bank will make the same decision a day later. Add to that the psychological pressure of the monthly close, and it is easy to see how the coming week could be more volatile in Bitcoin\u2019s recent history. So, buckle up as our experts break down the five key things to know in Bitcoin this week.\n\nBitcoin premium hits 60% in Nigeria as country limits ATM cash withdrawals\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of 1 BTC on the Nigerian crypto exchange NairaEX is 17.2 million nairas, equating to a whopping $37,341. That is a hefty premium over the current market price of Bitcoin, around $22,874 at the time of writing. It comes as the Central Bank of Nigeria has continued to impose limits on ATM cash withdrawals amid an ongoing effort to accelerate its shift to a cashless society. Will this have any impact on the price of Bitcoin, considering more and more people will be flocking to purchase the top digital currency, and how will it impact the rest of the markets?\n\nElon Musk wants Twitter payments system built with crypto in mind\n\nTwitter chief Elon Musk has reportedly instructed his developers to build the platform\u2019s payments system in such a way that crypto functionality can be added in the future. The payment feature will support fiat currencies to start with but will have the capability to accommodate cryptocurrencies if the opportunity arises. For now, things are still pretty vague as to whether the system will involve blockchain or crypto technology, but people are hopeful considering the Twitter CEO has had a lot of influence in the crypto space.\n\nOur experts cover these and other developing stories, so make sure you tune in to stay up-to-date on the latest in the world of crypto.\n\nNext up is a segment called \u201cQuick Crypto Tips,\u201d which aims to give newcomers to the crypto industry quick and easy tips to get the most out of their experience.

        "title": "New Bitcoin protocol may shake up the NFT market - Forkast News",
        "content": "A new protocol released on Bitcoin is bringing wider NFT capabilities to the world\u2019s largest blockchain, with the potential to reshape the NFT market and the dynamic between some of the biggest blockchains, industry officials tell Forkast.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, which was released after a Jan. 21 post by developer Casey Rodarmor, allows users to insert relatively large amounts of data into transactions, which can be used for creating collectible images on the network, similar to many popular NFT projects.\n\nThis capability was previously available on Bitcoin, but on a scale too small for workable NFTs. However, Bitcoin upgrades like 2021\u2019s Taproot and 2017\u2019s SegWit allows the Ordinals protocol to expand this functionality.\n\nJonathon Miller, Australia managing director of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said Ordinals is a positive development for the network, but it has also generated controversy.\n\n\u201cThere are purists who say [Bitcoin] should always just be peer-to-peer cash, but I think that\u2019s possibly not the story when it comes to the reality, which is that people experiment with Bitcoin all the time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt really is exciting to see people build things on top of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWithout this experimentation, the network would not have Layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network, which greatly increases transaction speeds on Bitcoin, he added.\n\nNew killer?\n\nNFTs are regarded as a crucial component of the reimagined internet of Web3 \u2014 in which gaming, social media and financial services are run through decentralized blockchain applications controlled by users\u2019 wallets. And NFTs have long been the domain of the Ethereum blockchain that hosts roughly 70% of all NFT sales value.\n\nMany blockchain networks \u2014 from Cardano to Solana \u2014 have been labelled \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in recent years, or networks hoping to eat into Ethereum\u2019s dominance in Web3 or NFTs, but so far none have made much headway.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist for blockchain data aggregator CryptoSlam, said one reason for that is Ethereum has a multi-year head start. But that is not a factor that hinders Bitcoin as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] been around longer than any others \u2014 ten years now, plus \u2014 they have a huge, huge base of users. So, I almost think there\u2019s potential it could compete with Ethereum more quickly than the others could, simply because of adoption.\u201d\n\nMiller had a different view, saying Ethereum has excellent tools for creating NFTs, whereas Ordinals is just the protocol for creating tools on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cPerhaps [Ordinal\u2019s] not going to be something that competes directly with those networks,\u201d he said. And it may well act as a reminder that Ethereum is a really strong and well-tooled network for creating NFTs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nPetscher said the real change from Ordinals may not be about creating new types of collectibles, but proving that developers can build upon an old blockchain and change the market dynamics in the process. That could prove to be the real innovation in the project, he added.\n\n\u201c[Ordinals] certainly gives Bitcoin as a currency itself more utility,\u201d he said, \u201cit strictly was almost a financial asset and people were very happy with that. It now has another and one that I expect like on Ethereum and these other blockchains will grow exponentially now you can transact collectibles.\u201d\n\nSome of Ordinal\u2019s critics argue that it will increase the demand on the network, driving up fees for regular transactions. Petscher agrees this is a risk, but said the added utility of being able to purchase the NFTs with Bitcoin could also serve to increase the price, helping many miners and long-term holders within the community.\n\nOthers argue that these are frivolous ways to use the network, however, and detract from the intention Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, had in mind when releasing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt can be all of these things at the same time,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cIt certainly can be frivolous and it can be silly and it could be pointless and it can still be awesome at the same time and important to building a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd especially in a decentralized world, not only does it not matter but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d"

        "title": "Miami's Mayor Went All In on Cryptocurrency. His Constituents Suffered. - Truthout",
        "content": "In 2021, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said that Sam Bankman-Fried, the now disgraced former head of FTX, embodied the \u201cethos of Miami.\u201d\n\nSuarez was inadvertently right.\n\nMiami is a sunny place for shady people and Bankman-Fried\u2019s shameless grift does indeed embody the corruption that is so commonplace in the city \u2014 a place where con artists, corrupt politicians, drug traffickers, money launderers, and all sorts of white-collar criminals make their homes. Crypto scammers love Miami, hiding their greed and grift behind empty libertarian rhetoric about a war against central banking and promising to establish a parallel financial system accessible to those who are \u201cunbanked,\u201d despite never providing a compelling case for how it could work.\n\nThose of us who live in Miami know that serious issues plague the city. It has the most unaffordable housing market in the country, skyrocketing rent costs, a crumbling property insurance market, chronic flooding even when there is a light storm, a complete lack of public transportation and out of control corruption.\n\nInstead of addressing any of these actual problems, Suarez has been singularly focused on pushing cryptocurrency to the detriment of his other responsibilities as mayor. At a recent Bitcoin conference hosted in Miami Beach, Suarez articulated what he referred to as the \u201cvision for Bitcoin America 2024,\u201d calling for the next president of the United States to be \u201cpro-Bitcoin\u201d and for Bitcoin to be integrated into \u201cevery aspect of our society.\u201d None of it has aged well after the recent spectacular collapse of the crypto market in which about $2 trillion in wealth has been wiped out, likely sending Suarez idol Bankman-Fried to prison and decimating the life savings of working people.\n\nSuarez is the epitome of what it would be like to have a stereotypical Miami bro in office. He is the son of former Miami Mayor and County Commissioner Xavier Suarez, who is probably most well known for being removed from office after being associated with a voter fraud scheme. In 2009, Suarez, who is a registered Republican, followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and using his family connections and name recognition, was elected to the City of Miami Commission.\n\nAfter serving mostly unremarkably as a commissioner, he followed in his father\u2019s footsteps in 2017 to become the mayor of Miami. Since then, Suarez has ridden the boom of the cryptocurrency market to a sort of national prominence, positioning himself as the \u201cmost Bitcoin friendly\u201d politician in the United States and proposing outlandish plans to fund the city\u2019s activities through crypto mining. While on the \u201cDecrypt Media\u201d podcast with Bankman-Fried, Suarez embodied the cavalier attitude of Miami politicians \u2014 who are often willing to do the bidding of anyone throwing a substantial amount of money their way in order to skirt rules and regulations.\n\nDuring the interview, Bankman-Fried was asked how FTX could possibly and reasonably be given a 19-year contract to the naming rights for the arena where the Miami Heat play. Suarez himself wasn\u2019t a direct decision maker in the deal, as the arena is owned by Miami-Dade County and he is mayor of the smaller City of Miami, but he encouraged its approval. Bankman-Fried fumbled through a completely gibberish non-answer claiming that FTX made so much money in one year that they don\u2019t need to worry about the other 18 years. Suarez was completely distracted by his phone the whole time, and looked up just at the end to give a double-thumbs up. It was truly beyond parody.\n\nThis is not the only time that Suarez propped up Sam Bankman-Fried. The Miami New Times documented several instances in which Suarez showered the disgraced former billionaire with sycophantic praise in efforts to bring further FTX investments to Miami. After FTX secured the naming rights for the Heat Arena, Bankman-Fried ridiculously tweeted that he looked forward to bringing \u201cpeace and prosperity\u201d to Miami residents, prompting Suarez to weigh in.\n\n\u201cOverjoyed that your commitment to our community advances our efforts to be the most crypto friendly city on the planet. All I need to do now is figure out how to put the red laser dots on my eyes,\u201d Suarez responded.\n\nIn another online exchange that has not aged well, Suarez welcomed FTX after Bankman-Fried announced the company would be moving its headquarters to Miami.\n\n\u201c[FTX] is one of the most innovative companies on the planet and you [SBF] are one of the most innovative technologists. Welcome HOME!\u201d Suarez tweeted.\n\nOn top of his vocal support of Bankman-Fried and his ridiculous announcement of a Bitcoin political platform, Suarez also made ludicrous promises to Miami residents regarding the city\u2019s own cryptocurrency: MiamiCoin. Despite its name, MiamiCoin is not actually owned by the City of Miami but by a company called CityCoins, which proposed that when people minted this token, 30 percent would be automatically sent to the Miami\u2019s digital wallet and the remainder would be kept by the user per an agreement between Miami and CityCoins. MiamiCoin has since lost 99 percent of its value and is now worthless.\n\nOther cities like New York and Austin have explored similar cryptocurrency partnerships with sketchy entities like CityCoins, but none with the same level of enthusiasm as Miami. That\u2019s largely because of Suarez\u2019s endorsement of the project and his promotion of MiamiCoin to residents and investors.\n\nQuartz obtained emails between representatives of CityCoins and Suarez\u2019s staff showing that the mayor\u2019s media appearances promoting MiamiCoin were creating problems for the project and could cause regulatory red flags:\n\nWe need to get an hour with the Mayor for a comms training session on CityCoins and MiamiCoin. It\u2019s great that he is doing press but he would greatly benefit from an hour session with Patrick on how to best communicate the project. There are a few regulatory wires the Mayor has tripped in recent interviews and it\u2019s really important for the sustainability of the project that he is better prepared. We really care about the Mayor and his role in making MiamiCoin a success\u2014it\u2019s critical that we get time with him as soon as possible.\n\nSuarez\u2019s promotion of the MiamiCoin grift reached such a ridiculous crescendo that he actually claimed during an appearance on Fox & Friends that the revenue generated by the City of Miami\u2019s stake in MiamiCoin would be given \u201cas a dividend to all of our residents in Bitcoin\u201d through a \u201cdigital wallet.\u201d Even more absurdly, he added that \u201cif this thing continues to grow, there is a world under which we can actually run the city without taxes.\u201d\n\nYes, he actually claimed that this crypto scam \u2014 which lost 99 percent of its value \u2014 would lead to the abolition of taxes in Miami.\n\nOne of the most infuriating parts about this crypto scam is that Suarez doesn\u2019t seem to have much faith in cryptocurrency when it comes to putting his own skin in the game. In February of 2021, Suarez proposed paying city employees in Bitcoin and offered to take his own paycheck in the cryptocurrency. The plan fortunately never got off the ground, but financial disclosures later revealed that Suarez only held about $11,000 in cryptocurrency by December of 2021, a miniscule amount compared to his two investment properties worth a combined $700,000.\n\nDespite the collapse of FTX and the broader cryptocurrency market, Suarez shows little remorse for his role in legitimizing Sam Bankman-Fried and promoting MiamiCoin. In an appearance on CNBC, he was completely unapologetic, saying, \u201cWhen people lose money, they want to blame someone,\u201d and \u201cA lot of this is media driven. Maybe in 6 months Bitcoin is at 30,000, or 40,000. Are you going to have me back on and say \u2018Mr. Mayor, you\u2019re super smart?'\u201d\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election cycle heats up, Suarez is actually gearing up to run for president himself. It\u2019s hard to discern if he actually believes he can be elected to the highest office in the United States or if this is just another grift to elicit campaign donations for other future political campaigns. What we do know is that his promotion of cryptocurrency seems to be paying off as his 2021 mayoral campaign drew donations from the industry, including a $25,000 donation from former child actor turned blockchain mogul Brock J. Pierce.\n\nSuarez is doing his best to do damage control but at the end of the day MiamiCoin, which was preposterously sold to residents as something that could have ended city taxes, is a scam that lost 99 percent of its value and is now worthless.\n\nWhen it comes to Miami\u2019s ruinous flirtation with crypto scams, acclaimed documentary filmmaker and hometown gadfly Billy Corben put it best when quoted in a Washington Post article. \u201cA bunch of con men selling imaginary coins and magic beans is not that interesting of a story,\u201d said Corben, a longtime skeptic of Suarez\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin. \u201cBut the fact is the government and its elected officials were complicit in it and dragged the city in it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one thing for cryptocurrency to be the hobby horse of gamblers and speculators hoping, and mostly failing, to make a quick buck. It\u2019s another for elected officials, who are supposed to be good stewards of our public assets and have our best interest in mind, to be peddling these grifts so shamelessly and unapologetically.\n\nTired of reading the same old news from the same old sources?

        "content": "Despite bitcoin's strong January, the cryptocurrency just suffered one of its biggest and longest drawdowns in its history. Ark Invest CEO and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood is still bullish on the cryptocurrency, however, and continues betting its price will eventually reach $500,000, she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday. Her outlook is even \"a little higher than that.\" \"Starting with [the financial crisis of] 2008-2009, which is when bitcoin really debuted, and even more so after the crypto fallout this past year [and] the collapse in many companies, this idea of transparency and decentralization is taking hold, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two best manifestations of that in the crypto world,\" Wood said. Wood also said that Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of fallen crypto exchange FTX, whose alleged fraud has shaken investors, \"didn't like bitcoin\" and that his views were at odds with the crypto pillars of decentralization and transparency. \"What companies went under? They were the highly centralized, nontransparent, opaque companies: FTX, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital,\" Wood said. Whereas \"if you look at what happened to Bitcoin, the network, and Ethereum, the network, they really didn't skip a beat at all. Transactions were completed. All smart contracts opened and closed.\" Wood is also a big investor in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , known by its ticker GBTC, through the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) . Investors have grown concerned about the harm GBTC could do to shareholders, with the shares trading at a growing discount to net asset value and the structure of the trust being such that shares can't be redeemed. \"There's a huge discount there that will close at some point,\" Wood said. \"I have no idea how the lawsuit's going to play out. I do think it's good that this discussion is taking place.\" Last year, Grayscale sued the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to block the conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an exchange-traded fund. The D.C. Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments for March 7. \"The SEC has dragged its feet in terms of a bitcoin ETF, while approving a bitcoin futures ETF \u2014 it just doesn't make any sense to us,\" Wood added. \"This discussion is going to be a very good one and the news around the trial is going to be very good for bitcoin generally, as more and more people begin to understand bitcoin itself and GBTC particularly.\" Wood just posted her best month ever as her beaten-down favorite stocks staged a big comeback in the new year. Her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) jumped 3.7% on Tuesday, bringing its January return to 27.8% and marking its strongest month since its inception in 2014."

This will allow for fast, secure and low-cost money transfers between the U.S. and the Philippines, which is one of the world's largest remittance markets. The Philippines relies on more than $35 billion annually in money sent from abroad, with over $12 billion coming from the U.S. alone.\n\nStrike has partnered with Pouch.ph to enable transfers from U.S. dollars to Philippine pesos, which can be received in a bank or mobile money account in the Philippines.\n\nStrike uses the Lightning Network to make digital payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible, particularly in countries with a high number of unbanked individuals. With Send Globally, dollars are converted into bitcoin, sent via the Lightning Network to a third-party partner in the recipient's country, then converted into local currency and sent directly to the recipient's bank or mobile money account. This eliminates the need for both the sender and recipient to worry about bitcoin's tax treatment, dollar volatility or custody implications.\n\n\u201cRemittances are a broken system and Strike delivers an incredibly empowering experience for people to send money around the world in nearly an instant,\u201d Jack Mallers, founder and CEO of Strike commented. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Pouch.ph to advance financial inclusion and bring fast, low-cost cross-border payments via the Lightning Network to the Philippines. Our technology allows us to both improve on the existing cross-border experience and include those that have previously been excluded by legacy payment rails.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Magazine was fortunate enough to interview Mallers on the development, which can be viewed below:\n\nSend Globally was launched in December 2022 starting with transfers from the U.S. to Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. CoinCorner has also partnered with Pouch.ph to enable remittances for European customers.\n\n\n\nWith the integration of Pouch.ph and Strike, the cross-border payment experience has been revolutionized and has further empowered people to easily send money to their loved ones back home. Lightning will continue to expand into more markets with more partners to provide better payment services to communities around the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "In this issue\n\nValkyrie: Riding high Sam Bankman-Fried: Time to lay low? Chinese NFTs: On display\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, One of the greatest gifts Bitcoin gave the world was its underlying technology: blockchain. It has birthed a financial revolution, channeled capital to parts of the globe that need it, and untethered the power to transact from the few to the many. And now, as we see, in Bitcoin\u2019s strong start to 2023, those long-awaited beams of sunlight have come out to shine on crypto\u2019s firstborn. The question is: Why? What makes tokens work at the most basic level is the technology that underpins them. Yet behind the impressive recent recovery in the value of the world\u2019s original cryptocurrency lies tech that is decidedly old school. The proof-of-work protocol that makes the Bitcoin network tick has long been surpassed on the energy use front by the proof-of-stake mechanisms that power other networks, and the network\u2019s scalability remains limited. Given the ever-higher premiums accorded to sustainable energy and the steady forward march of new technology in the digital asset industry, one might ask: Why still Bitcoin? This is where birthright comes into play. BTC feels like an assuredly different bet \u2014 not just a pure play based on technological dominance, but one that also captures pent-up pressure for change in the wider macroeconomy and the crypto industry. The value of digital assets will be redefined in the coming years, and tokens must prove their fundamental utility and merit beyond the speculative dynamics we\u2019ve seen drive prices higher in the not-too-distant past. Some have proven worthy, but others will fail. Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence is a demonstration that, for some, it is held in higher regard simply for being the coin that started the revolution \u2014 an expression of intrinsic value that combines technology with economic defiance amid the confines of the traditional financial universe. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. BTC boom\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin mining ETF surge has been accompanied by gains in the valuations of other crypto-related fund products Image: Valkyrie\n\nBy the numbers: Valkyrie \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nAlternative asset management firm Valkyrie\u2019s Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin Miners exchange-traded fund (ETF), WGMI, has doubled in value over the month of January, as the best-performing U.S. fund of any kind in 2023 so far.\n\nWGMI\u2019s January rally is around 25% higher than that of the second-best performer, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nWGMI closed trading on Tuesday at US$8.88, up nearly 100% from US$4.56 at the beginning of the year, though it is still a long way off its all-time high of US$26.68 last February.\n\nWGMI, an acronym of the popular crypto rallying cry, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make it,\u201d tracks the performance of crypto mining companies, including Hive Blockchain Technologies, Digihost Technology, Bitfarms, Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Platforms and Hut 8.\n\nOther crypto-related ETFs, including investment manager VanEck\u2019s Digital Assets Mining (DAM) ETF and Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP), alongside the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), also ended January higher, up 75%, 64% and 64%, respectively.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, has gained 38.4% since the beginning of the year, having enjoyed its best January since 2013 after reaching a five-month high of US$23,918 early morning Hong Kong time on Monday before retracing to US$23,009 at mid-week.\n\nBitcoin broke through the US$23,000 price ceiling last week for the first time since last August.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The Bitcoin mining industry spent much of last year in retreat. As the price of Bitcoin collapsed, dozens of mining companies began defaulting on loans, while some collapsed completely. Core Scientific, the largest publicly-traded U.S. Bitcoin mining company by computing power, went bankrupt, joining Compute North, another prominent North American miner. The dire situation left lenders that had underwritten the industry to the tune of US$4 billion forced to keep machines running to help recoup debt. Although the fortunes of Bitcoin mining firms have improved somewhat, the situation for the industry remains grim. The era of cheap energy has ended, and authorities in a number of jurisdictions are taking an increasingly dim view of the energy drain \u2014 and sometimes even heightened social tension \u2014 that comes with Bitcoin mining. If the Bitcoin mining industry is to survive, it needs to reconsider the energy-intensive requirements for keeping the network secure. Bitcoin is now the only major digital currency still using a consensus protocol that forces machines to compete against one another to solve puzzles, consuming as much energy as Sweden does in the process. Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake slashed its energy usage to a fraction of its former level, despite the fact that Ethereum is a bigger network in terms of on-chain activity. Bitcoin miners might be singing now, but the current relatively good times likely won\u2019t last forever.\n\n2. Who helped post SBF\u2019s bail?\n\nImage: FTX founder and former Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried is facing mounting legal challenges nine months out from his trial date. Getty Images/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the now-bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, is now accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of tampering with a witness in the criminal fraud case against him, potentially bringing new bail restrictions.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried had been communicating with the current general counsel for FTX US, who may be a witness at trial, through encrypted messaging app Signal and via email, suggesting \u201can effort to influence\u201d the witness\u2019s potential testimony.\n\nThe prosecutors urged the judge to impose new restrictions on Bankman-Fried to prevent him from contacting any current or former employees of FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, and bar him from using \u201cany encrypted or ephemeral call or messaging application.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s lawyer, Mark Cohen, dismissed the prosecutors\u2019 allegation, saying that his client\u2019s communication with the witness on Signal was \u201cmerely an innocuous attempt to offer assistance in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy process,\u201d and he sought to remove a bail condition that denies Bankman-Fried access to FTX or Alameda assets or cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis week, Judge Kaplan also signaled he may reveal the identities of two benefactors who helped Bankman-Fried post his US$250 million bond, which has allowed him to be confined to his parents\u2019 home in California rather than sit in jail. Two of Bankman-Fried\u2019s four bail surety backers have been identified as his parents, but there are two others whose identities are currently unknown to the public.\n\nBankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, related to the implosion of FTX, and his first trial is currently scheduled to begin in October.\n\nIn another court filing, lawyers for FTX and its debtors said certain insiders at the company were not providing information \u201ccritical to the debtors\u2019 and committee\u2019s recovery efforts,\u201d and asked for authorization to issue subpoenas, including to Bankman-Fried, his parents, his brother, and several of the company\u2019s former top executives.\n\nLast week, FTX released a complete list of its creditors. The 115-page document named not only Web3 companies such as Coinbase, Yuga Labs and Chainalysis but also entities in a wide range of industries, including tech giants Apple, Meta, Google and Amazon. FTX\u2019s creditors also include media companies New York Times and Wall Street Journal, which asked the court to unveil Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail sponsors as a matter of \u201cpublic interest.\u201d\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bankman-Fried\u2019s relative liberty since his arrest has, reasonably enough, allowed the former FTX chief plenty of time as well as access to digital communications to protest his innocence. While under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in California, Bankman-Fried has set up his own Substack page and has used his 1.1 million-strong following on Twitter to highlight what he describes as flaws in the prosecution against him. The latest allegation that he has been trying to influence a potential witness is another example of the challenge law enforcement faces when it comes to running multiple cases against a sophisticated accused party fighting the charges against him. While FTX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings are under way, there also are civil actions by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These come in addition to the criminal case brought against Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty. Bankman-Fried has asserted he\u2019s innocent as prosecutors build a growing case against him. His freedom to do so and to try to sway public opinion in his favor is guaranteed under the rules of due process, no matter how unpalatable some may find the extent to which he is exercising those freedoms. Time will tell whether his efforts to shape the narrative regarding his criminal culpability extend to improper interference in legal processes \u2014 and whether the court of public opinion has any bearing on the court of law that will ultimately decide his fate.\n\n3. Image matters\n\nChinese social media app Xiaohongshu now allows its users to showcase their \u2018digital collectibles\u2019 on their profile pages. Image: Image: Xiaohongshu/Conflux\n\nA Chinese social media application and e-commerce platform that is widely described as the Chinese equivalent of Instagram has integrated layer-1 public blockchain Conflux Network, allowing users to showcase non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on their profile pages, according to Conflux.\n\nConflux said that more than 200 million active monthly users on Xiaohongshu, or \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d which takes its name from a collection of Chinese former leader Mao Zedong\u2019s quotes and writings, can present NFTs minted on Conflux on its digital collectibles section R-Space.\n\nR-Space went online in November 2021, allowing users with real-name accounts to buy and display digital collectibles created by artists on Xiaohongshu and give them out as gifts. The platform does not allow trading between owners of \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d \u2014 a euphemism in China for NFTs.\n\nSince imposing a strict mining and trading ban on cryptocurrencies in 2021, China has stayed mum when it comes to issuing rules on NFTs, the trading in which state-backed media outlets have frequently criticized. Chinese firms have taken to using the term \u201cdigital collectible\u201d to avoid inviting further government ire.\n\nThe Chinese province of Hainan recently announced that it would step up its oversight of digital collectibles, including cracking down on fraud and copyright infringements, censoring on-chain artwork, and curbing financial risks related to trading in digital collectibles.\n\nDespite there being no shortage of rhetoric against NFT speculation, the China Digital Asset Trading Platform, the country\u2019s first state-backed and regulated secondary market for digital collectibles, was supposed to have launched in January 2023, although its website was still displaying the message \u201ccoming soon\u201d on Feb. 1.\n\nSingapore-registered Conflux has gained government endorsements in some parts of China, where it has collaborated with brands such as McDonald\u2019s."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has been trading above $22,500 for 12 days. Of course, this situation can change even if Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issues positive statements about the economy in today\u2019s post-FOMC presser.\n\nEven if the decision matches the market consensus, the post-meeting statement should be investors\u2019 primary area of focus. Specific areas to focus on would be clues for the next meeting in March.\n\nTroubling news for the largest stablecoin Tether (USDT) could also cause a meaningful impact after a Celsius bankruptcy examiner report showed that \u201cTether\u2019s exposure eventually grew to over $2 billion\u201d in September 2021. However, it is unclear if iFinex \u2014 Tether\u2019s issuer \u2014 suffered any losses. iFinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino denied exposure to Celsius and suggested that the examiner had \u201cmixed up\u201d prepositions in the report.\n\nIs a strong correction in stock market ahead?\n\nLegendary portfolio manager Michael Burry, known for being one of the most vocal critics of the subprime mortgage crisis from 2007 to 2008, posted a short note on Twitter on Feb. 1, suggesting that investors \u201csell.\u201d\n\nWhile the message lacks a supporting thesis, one could conclude that Burry expects a meaningful correction in traditional markets. Considering the 40-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index at 75%, the odds of a BTC price retrace become evident.\n\nConsequently, this week\u2019s $1 billion BTC options expiry on Feb. 3 can go either way because bears can still flip the tables even though the tide currently favors the bulls.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught entirely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 3 options expiry is $1 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were caught by surprise after the 9.6% rally between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 3. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.61 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $640 million call (buy) open interest and the $400 million put (sell) options.\n\nIf Bitcoin price remains above $23,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 3, less than $7 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference occurs because the right to sell Bitcoin at $22,000 or $23,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Retail giant Pick n Pay to accept Bitcoin in 1,628 stores across South Africa\n\n$23,000 Bitcoin would give bulls a $180 million profit\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb.3 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $21,000 and $22,000: 2,700 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $165 million.\n\n2,700 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $165 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 4,400 calls vs. 4,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options.\n\n4,400 calls vs. 4,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 7,800 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $180 million.\n\n7,800 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $180 million. Between $24,000 and $25,000: 12,400 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls extend their gains to $300 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin bears need to push the price below $22,000 on Feb. 3 to flip the tables and secure a $165 million profit. But, for now, bulls are well positioned to profit from the BTC weekly options expiry and use the proceeds to further defend the $23,000 support.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "5 altcoins that produced double-digit gains as Bitcoin price rallied in January - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The rally in cryptocurrency markets started in early January with a spike in heavily-shorted altcoins and Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens due to the upcoming network upgrade in March. Soon gains started to show across the board as buyers started to play catch up.\n\nThe improving macroeconomic conditions, such as reduced inflation and a stable job sector in the United States, provided additional tailwinds for the positive rally. Bitcoin (BTC) is en route to its most impressive closing for January since 2013. Its price has gained 40% year-to-date from the opening value of $16,530.\n\nAnother important catalyst for January\u2019s rally was a short squeeze across the crypto market. After the FTX debacle and the lack of bullish narratives for the niche space, most investors expected growth to slow down in 2023.\n\nThere are unresolved issues such as potential Digital Currency Group fallout, geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine and recession risks due to the Fed\u2019s aggressive quantitative tightening policies. Thus, most traders didn\u2019t expect strong price rallies so early inthe year.\n\nAs it turns out, negative sentiment and crowded positions in the futures market continued to fuel more upside. There\u2019s a strong chance of a pullback soon after steep gains. It remains to be seen if the pullback levels are attractive enough for buyers to turn it into a medium-to-long-term bullish trend. Let\u2019s take a look at the top performing cryptocurrencies for January.\n\nTop crypto market gainers in January. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAptos (APT)\n\nLaunched in October, Aptos is a relatively new blockchain in the space that leverages the technology of Facebook/Meta\u2019s discarded crypto project, Libra. It carries significant face value based on its executive team, composed of former Meta engineers who also built the Move programming language to make the chain scalable and decentralized.\n\nWhile the project carries much reputation, its fundamentals do not justify the price. The disbelief among investors is part of the reason behind the APT price rally. A market capitalization of $3 billion for a four-month-old project has surprised many onlookers. There\u2019s also suspected market manipulation in the APT/KRW pair on Upbit, giving rise to the Kimchi premium. It is difficult to pinpoint a specific factor driving its demand in South Korea.\n\nAPT/USD broke above its previous peak of around $10, recorded around its launch. Technically, the token is in price discovery mode right now. Thus, there are few sell-side resistance levels besides the latest peak of $20 and the psychological level at $25. Unless the positive catalysts in the negative funding rate for perpetual swaps and the Kimchi premium cool off, the rally may still have wings.\n\nBut the token\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), a price momentum indicator, has spiked to oversold territory, suggesting the possibility of a pullback. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator shows a slight bullish deviation with a less steep rise in the metric compared to the price. Still, the presence of buying volume is reassuring for APT bulls. The support for the token lies at $14.75 and $10.40.\n\nAPT/USD daily price chart with RSI and MACD indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nGala (GALA)\n\nSimilar to Aptos, Gala (GALA) also benefited from the excess negative positioning in the futures market. The gain in GALA/USD from $0.02 to $0.07 can be primarily attributed to wipe out of short positions.\n\nGALA price (yellow) and funding rate. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe token suffered significant inflation of around 17,123,286 GALA daily, which accounts for around $28.2 million monthly at current prices. This raises concerns that the recent price pump could be short-lived.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Gala\u2019s team introduced a new roadmap of the project in which they seek to update the tokenomics to reduce inflation and introduce a new burn mechanism. They are working on an independent Gala chain, where GALA tokens will be used to pay transaction fees.\n\nOn top of that, the daily issuance of GALA may also reduce after a vote is passed to change the time-based halving schedule to a supply-based one, bringing the halving closer than July 21.\n\nThe upgrade announcements have added to the buying pressure in GALA/USD, evident in a spike in buying volume. The token is trading above its 200-day exponential moving average at $0.052. If buyers build support above this level, the price can run toward the July 2022 breakdown levels near $0.164.\n\nGALA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThreshold (T)\n\nThreshold was born from the merger of two projects, Keep Network and NuCypher, which have combined their technologies to build a decentralized bridge network. Node operators on the Threshold network stake the platform\u2019s native T token and Ether to validate the transfers between Bitcoin and Ethereum. This technology was borrowed from Keep Network, while NuCypher adds a layer of privacy to the protocol.\n\nIn January, the project\u2019s native token nearly tripled in price, benefiting from the v2 launch and Coinbase\u2019s listing announcements. The upgraded version of the Threshold protocol will enable tBTC (threshold Bitcoin) mints on Ethereum, which are backed by Bitcoin and pegged 1:1 to the BTC price.\n\nThe beginning of tBTC mints on Ethereum via Threshold Network will likely increase the network\u2019s total locked value (TVL), making Threshold nodes more valuable. Initially, the project will launch a semi-decentralized version, Optimistic Minting, and gradually move to a decentralized system of nodes.\n\nThere\u2019s a significant market opportunity for Threshold after the dissolution of RenBTC. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) currently commands a dominant share of 93.6% of the total Bitcoin bridged to Ethereum.\n\nStill, the recent 190% increase is starting to show signs of a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news type of event, especially factoring in the Coinbase-led rise. The support for buyers lies at $0.027, with the next level of resistance at $0.145.\n\nDecentraland (MANA)\n\nThe metaverse-themed projects Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND) witnessed a revival of the VR narrative as Apple is rumored to be launching its VR headset collection this spring. More recently, the Decentraland team released its manifesto for the current year, with a focus on growing its developer and creator community.\n\nWhile Decentraland is one of the earliest metaverse projects with a massive opportunity to capture the future Web3 market, the present rally is showing overbought characteristics in the short-term.\n\nThe RSI indicator shows a reading above its bullish resistance. The MACD indicator shows a divergence with little to no-change in the metric to complement the Jan. 28 surge of 16.5%.\n\nMANA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, the breakout above 200-day moving average and resistance from the FTX breakdown levels at 0.70 is encouraging for technical buyers. It remains to be seen if the surge was a just stop hunt of short orders or stemming from actual demand. Support for the token lies at the 50-day EMA, current at $0.54, and 2022 lows of $0.27.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) benefited from excessive negative sentiment around the blockchain\u2019s future. The price rally was a classic case of a short squeeze in the futures market. While the fundamentals pointed toward a death spiral in its price, the market played out differently. By leveraging low liquidity conditions, buyers were able to push the prices higher until few sellers remained.\n\nThe market maker and venture capitalist entity, Alameda Research, was the primary source of liquidity for Solana\u2019s DeFi projects. It was also one of the largest backers of its ecosystem projects. The DeFi community will face significant challenges within Solana due to a lack of liquidity.\n\nSolana developers and the foundation have been working hard to make the network stable and more decentralized. While the network remained stable through the FTX debacle, it appears to have lost the market\u2019s trust thanks to frequent downtimes. Moreover, Alameda/FTX owns around 10.7% of the total supply of SOL, which will likely add to the selling pressure for the next few years.\n\nTheir NFT space, while placed second in terms of trading volume across blockchains, is starting to see the departure of top performers like DeGods, y00ts, and most recently, F Studio. It remains to be seen if the community can build back up. The task will be challenging without the support of its most prolific backers.\n\nOn long timeframes, the $30 level is a crucial resistance and support level for SOL/USD. If buyers consolidate above this level, the positive momentum in the token\u2019s price will likely stretch into Q1 2023. However, given that the rally is mainly driven by a short-side wipeout in the futures market, there\u2019s a higher likelihood for a significant correction, followed by a period of accumulation, until a meaningful run can take form.\n\nLast but not least, the LSD-narrative tokens deserve a mention in the monthly winners list. The native tokens of Ethereum LSD platforms nearly doubled in price across the board thanks to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Frax DAO was the highest gainer among LSD tokens, benefiting from a strong rise in the staked Ether on its platform. The platform is able to attract liquidity by providing additional yield on staking ETH through leveraging its position on Curve Finance.\n\nThe Frax DAO is the largest owner of CVX tokens, which gives them priority control over Curve emissions. Currently, staking frxETH on Curve earns around 9-10% annual yield, which is two times higher than the average LSD yield of around 4%.\n\nGiven that Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is still a month away and there\u2019s room for growth of LSD platforms, the attention toward LSD tokens could likely sustain through February.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "According to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 31, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla disclosed that it had recorded a $204-million gross impairment loss during 2022 on its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. Simultaneously, Tesla recorded a gain of $64 million from converting BTC into fiat currency at various points during the year, resulting in a net loss of $140 million from its cryptocurrency trading activities.\n\nThe filing further explained the impact of volatile crypto prices on Tesla\u2019s bottom line:\n\n\u201cDigital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase.\u201d\n\nRelated: Elon Musk lays out when Tesla will begin accepting Bitcoin payments\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. At the time, its founder, Elon Musk, announced that the electric vehicle manufacturer would start accepting BTC payments from U.S.-based consumers.\n\nThe policy was retracted just months later, as Musk cited the need for \u201cconfirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by [Bitcoin] miners with positive future trend\u201d before the company would accept the means of payment again. Tesla reportedly sold 75% of its BTC holdings in the second quarter of 2022."

        "content": "Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, is taking the fight for hearts and minds on Bitcoin mining to Washington, D.C., and beyond in an effort to support friendly legislation.\n\nPorter, who first discovered Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017, told Cointelegraph his path advocating the benefits of mining has taken him to support bills in at least six U.S. states, with federal lawmakers also in his crosshairs. The Satoshi Action Fund CEO met with U.S. senators and representatives on Jan. 25 in support of proposed legislation aimed at eliminating discrimination against miners.\n\nAccording to Porter, the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act \u2014 a bill introduced in June aimed at addressing the roles of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission on crypto regulation \u2014 has a provision addressing taxation for BTC mining rewards. He said the legislation could close a loophole allowing the Internal Revenue Service to have two bites of the apple on miners\u2019 revenue.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Bitcoin mining is being unfairly targeted and double taxed by the IRS currently,\u201c said Porter.\n\nThe conversations between Porter and members of Congress \u2014 including Senators Ron Wyden, Cynthia Lummis and Ted Budd \u2014 marked the first time the Satoshi Action Fund had stepped up in person to the national stage in defense of BTC miners. However, the organization has also stood behind bills being considered in New Hampshire, Montana, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma.\n\nCrypto mining operations in the United States have many critics among lawmakers and citizens alike, with complaints about the energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as well as the noise pollution from crypto-mining machines. In November, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law a two-year moratorium on PoW mining.\n\nDennis Porter. Source: Twitter\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining revenue jumps up 50% to $23M in one month\n\nPorter added leaders in Montana have attempted to push miners out using zoning laws and considered policies including higher electricity rates. The legislatures in Mississippi and Missouri have separately introduced bills aimed at protecting certain activities of miners following visits from the Satoshi Action Fund, while Texas is home to many major blockchain firms following a crackdown in China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep pushing hard until we get actual policy passed,\u201d said Porter."

        "content": "Strike, a Bitcoin-based payment network and financial app, is expanding to the Philippines to grow cross-border payments and remittance markets.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines is one of the biggest remitting markets in the world, especially from the United States,\u201d Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, said to TechCrunch. In 2021, about $12.7 billion in cash remittances was sent from U.S.-based Filipinos to the Philippines, according to Statista data.\n\n\u201cAs far as the technology we build, it\u2019s one of the lowest-hanging fruits \u2014 international payments are a huge pain and always have been. There\u2019s been incremental innovation from SWIFT and Western Union, but it\u2019s still incredibly difficult.\u201d\n\nEven across Western countries, traditional cross-border money transfers services are slower as bank transfers can take multiple days for funds to move from one account to another.\n\nStrike uses instantaneous, low-cost micropayments through the Lightning Network, a layer-2 payment protocol on top of Bitcoin, which allows millions to billions of transactions per second to transpire across the platform. The app\u2019s platform also allows users to transfer U.S. dollars to local fiat currencies, like the Philippine peso, for less than 1 cent per transaction through the network, Mallers noted.\n\n\u201cNone of our users have to touch Bitcoin,\u201d Mallers said. The app uses Bitcoin to transfer money from one user\u2019s account to another, regardless of its price. \u201cThe aspiration of the business is to hide Bitcoin under the hood\u201d so users could benefit from its payment network, he added.\n\nFor example, if a customer wants to take $5 and send it to a country like the Philippines, the Bitcoin is converted over the Lightning Network and reconverted into the local currency \u201cin the order of seconds to minutes as opposed to days or weeks,\u201d Mallers said.\n\nAside from the Philippines, Strike plans on expanding further in the Latin American and African regions as well due to the \u201cextreme amount of demand,\u201d Mallers shared. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing partners pop up all over the world.\u201d\n\nNow, Strike is gaining demand and partners seeking out integrations from everywhere between the U.K. and throughout Europe all the way to \u201c20 new countries we\u2019ll potentially add in February in Africa,\u201d Mallers added.\n\nEarlier this month, Strike partnered with payments provider Fiserv, the parent company of Clover (the fancy white digital register at many small businesses today), to expand its services.\n\nLast year, it raised $80 million in a Series B round to drive its efforts to grow payment solutions for merchants, marketplaces and financial institutions, the company said. Strike also joined forces with Visa in August 2022 to launch a rewards card that pairs with its application.\n\nIn general, the company\u2019s partnerships and announcement point to its focus on growing the remittance market through its application and other alternative avenues, like Clover.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to make cross-border payments and global payments cheaper and faster,\u201d Mallers said. \u201cBut also more accessible. There\u2019s huge value here for financial inclusion.\u201d\n\nSome Strike users will send amounts as little as 10 cents to their families, Mallers shared. But through a traditional financial system, the fees would outweigh the benefits, he added. \u201cWe can process a 10-cent payment\u2026and you don\u2019t have to log into Chase for an international wire transfer.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, there are opportunities to improve the existing remittance markets while also unlocking new markets, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to see a renaissance of tools really closing that big delta gap and you\u2019ll start seeing more financial institutions like Square and CashApp take advantage of this.\u201d\n\nOver the next decade, Mallers thinks remittance networks and applications like Lightning and Strike will expand opportunities from the 2 billion to 3 billion people that are \u201cgenerally included in the global international payments system\u201d to all 8 billion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be like a renaissance moment,\u201d Mallers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really huge deal.\u201d"

        "content": "Is cryptocurrency \u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d that is related to the Antichrist mentioned in Revelation (Revelation 13:17)? Is blockchain biblical? What is the Christian to make of the digital economy?\n\nThese were questions about new wealth that Jason Lee addressed when he spoke at the N5 Conference 2022.\n\nN5 is short for Nehemiah 5, a part of the Bible which deals with economics and personal finance. The conference has been so named because it deals with biblical perspectives of personal wealth.\n\nIs cryptocurrency \u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d?\n\nRunning on two consecutive years, the N5 Conference is the largest annual Kingdom-focused personal finance conference.\n\nDelegates from four countries came together over two days with Kingdom-minded business and ministry leaders to share their insights over more than 20 sessions.\n\nThe theme for the second conference was Arise and Build for Generations to Come.\n\nJason spoke on the topic Blockchain and the Bible. Jason is the Global Head of Community for the Algorand Foundation as part of the Algorand blockchain protocol. Algorand is an open-source, decentralised blockchain network.\n\nAn advocate for emerging technologies, Jason was on the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2018.\n\nHe is a board member of the Lausanne Movement, an international organisation that aims to connect influencers and ideas for global mission. In addition, he stewards a community called Christians in Crypto and Blockchain Community.\n\nWhy should we care?\n\nCryptocurrency is an example of new wealth that is a \u201conce-in-the-history-of-the-human-race kind of thing\u201d, stated Jason.\n\n\u201cWe are here to learn about how we can be good stewards of our wealth, including cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 50% of the world is persistently connected to the Internet.\n\nIn 10 years\u2019 time, 90% will be persistently connected.\n\nPeople are already starting to transact and live their lives online.\n\nVirtual traffic will only increase.\n\nPart of the transactions that takes place happens in the world of blockchain and much wealth will be generated from this.\n\n\u201cWe are here to learn about how we can be good stewards of our wealth,\u201d said Jason.\n\nKey terms in the world of digital economy\n\nBlockchain\n\nBlockchain is a shared ledger of all transactions across a distributed peer-to-peer network, or computers and devices.\n\nIt is the equivalent of the centralised book-keeping of old where records of properties, taxes, births, marriages, stocks and debts were kept. An example of such records is the genealogy of Jesus, spanning over 42 generations all the way to Adam.\n\nIn the past, because the records were kept in physical books, they could be easily destroyed or lost. Blockchain addresses this problem with new technology that allows the records to be kept simultaneously across many computers.\n\nSo, even if one computer is destroyed, others exist to maintain the record. The idea is so powerful that blockchain has become a US$3 billion industry.\n\nBlockchain has become the infrastructure in which many applications take place. There are over 100 blockchains in the world and many of the world\u2019s most recognised companies use blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe most popular application of blockchain technology is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first successful decentralised cryptocurrency and payment system where you can buy, sell and exchange without an intermediary.\n\nIn a seminal white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto, it was mentioned that there are 21 million bitcoins in the world which can be mined. 18-odd million have already been mined. Each time a bitcoin is mined, the person who mines it receives a cryptocurrency. Because the demand for bitcoin is so high, its value has also risen.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the value of bitcoin rose from US$6,000 to US$60,000. But cryptocurrency is very volatile. The value of bitcoin has since fallen to US$20,000.\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency. There are others.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nA cryptocurrency is a representative store of digital value that lives on a given blockchain. There are 13 to 15,000 cryptocurrencies. Crypto comes from the word cryptographic much like what is used in Morse code.\n\n\u201cSo, when you transfer cryptocurrency, there\u2019s a level of pseudo-anonymity, meaning no one knows who is the owner. But you can track it because it\u2019s on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWhile cryptocurrency is rising in popularity, it is but a fraction of the world stock market. The cryptocurrency market capitalisation, which is the total value of all the coins that have been mined, is US$1 trillion. The global stock market is a US$70-odd trillion industry.\n\nNFT\n\nA Non-Fungible Token is a digital asset that confers ownership of a virtual good that cannot be divisible. An NFT is like a cryptocurrency except that it cannot be broken up. Bitcoin, for example, can be divided up to eight times.\n\nNFTs can be anything from art to event tickets, music, gaming items and sports.\n\nThe NFT market was valued at US$11.3 billion in 2021. The sector is predicted to grow 33.7% over the next 10 years. As a result, there will be a lot of new wealth generated.\n\nDeFi\n\nDeFi is a financial system based on blockchain technology that reimagines transactions by removing intermediaries. This is a play on CeFi which is centralised financed where banks are needed as the go-between when you want to transfer money from one person or organisation to another.\n\nThe financial market size of DeFi is US$11 billion and it is expected to grow at a rate of 42.5% over the next 10 years.\n\nCryptocurrency Wallet\n\nTo transact in cryptocurrency, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet to store your cryptocurrencies. Every wallet comes with a password and a private key.\n\nWho holds the key determines the type of wallet you have. A hot wallet is one where a third party holds the key. A cold wallet is one where the owner holds his own keys.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange\n\nA cryptocurrency exchange is a marketplace platform where cryptocurrencies can be bought, sold and exchanged. It is the third party in the hot wallet.\n\nThere are over 520 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, many of which are regulated.\n\nWeb3\n\nWeb3 is the entire decentralised online ecosystem based on blockchain technology.\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, there was only Web 1.0 from the 1990s up to 2004. Then, we could only read what was on the web. With emails came the era of Web 2.0. We could not only can read but write and respond on the web.\n\nWeb 3.0, which started in 2014, allows us to read, write and own.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer users of products. Now, we have an opportunity to own a part of the network. When you own a cryptocurrency, you own a part of the network because the cryptocurrency lives on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nShould we invest in cryptocurrencies?\n\nGiven the vast amount of wealth involved in the digital economy, should the Christian be involved? Should a Christian buy cryptocurrencies? Which cryptocurrency would make a worthwhile investment?\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is at the top end of risks, alongside private investments in companies.\u201d\n\nJason gave this advice: \u201cThere are three considerations when you are thinking about this.\n\n\u201cOne, your ability. Do you have the ability to learn and understand it? Two, your liquidity. Do you have money in the bank so you won\u2019t fall into debt? Three, your suitability. This is a very high-risk profile.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is at the top end of risks, alongside private investments in companies.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrecny also has the VUCA element \u2013 volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.\n\n\u201cSo, you need to take a lot more time to learn about it instead of jumping into it.\u201d\n\nWhat does the Bible have to say about the digital economy?\n\n1. Stewardship over speculation\n\n\u201cIf Jesus was living with us in 2022, I have little doubt that Jesus would have told The Parable of the Bitcoin (Matthew 25:14-20),\u201d said Jason to laughter amongst the audience.\n\n\u201cWhat would Jesus do if He were a crypto native?\u201d\n\nThere are three mentalities that we have to be aware of, continued Jason. The first is the Get-rich Quick Mentality which 1 Timothy 6:9-10 warn us against.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is a form of digital money,\u201d said Jason, adding that he knows of Christians who got badly burnt in the cryptocurrency market and walked away from the Church as a result, as well as those who have gotten confused and have asked to learn what the Bible has to say about cryptocurrency.\n\nThe second is the Greed is Good Mentality which Luke 12:15 speaks against.\n\n\u201cNow people are trying to define themselves by the possessions that they have, and the digital world and identity is linked to how they see the crypto space as well.\n\nFinally, there is the Trap of Debt Mentality (Proverbs 22:7). Don\u2019t borrow to invest, warned Jason.\n\n2. Technology as a tool\n\nDrawing from the story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), Jason talked about the power of collaborative effort.\n\n\u201cEven the Lord acknowledged that when people collaborate, nothing is impossible for them (Genesis 11:6). That is why the US$1 trillion industry exists which did not exist before 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hands that built the golden calf also built Israel. The question is: How can we use the technology as a tool?\u201d\n\nBut the technology that has made all this possible has also resulted in workaholism for the people working in the cryptocurrency industry, hyper opportunities where people are constantly on the look-out for cryptocurrency investments and even criminal behaviour such as scams, frauds and unethical behaviour.\n\nAn example is the massive cryptocurrency scam by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in 2022.\n\nTechnology is but a tool used to extend human capabilities, like any other tools, Jason pointed out. Cain built a city, Noah built an ark, the people built the Tower of Babel and King Solomon built the temple with tools. Jesus used tools as a carpenter. Paul used letters and numbers to write letters and those can be considered a type of tool.\n\nTools can be used for good or bad.\n\n\u201cThe same hands that built the Tower of Babel also caused the destruction that caused them to scatter. The hands that built the golden calf were also the ones that built Israel. The question is: How can we use the technology as a tool?\u201d\n\n3. Bible over bitcoin\n\n\u201cFollow Christ not crypto, the Bible not bitcoin,\u201d said Jason.\n\n\u201cFollow Christ not crypto, the Bible not bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs godly stewards of our money, we should not squander it even though we received it. We should say, \u2018What would Jesus do if He were a crypto native?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are some Christians in the cryptocurrency space who are passionate about seeing how God works in that space.\n\nOne such organisation is the Christians in Crypto and Blockchain Community, of which Jason is a part.\n\nThey have a WhatsApp group of some 175 people who communicate regularly and meet over Zoom to pray over major cryptocurrency events.\n\nIs bitcoin the one-world currency of Revelation 13?\n\n\u201cWe will never know. What we know is that if it is really true, then as Christians we should be part of something like this.\n\n\u201cWe should be light in the darkness, and we should know and understand the workings of this. So, I want to encourage you not to shun this but to look into this,\u201d said Jason.\n\nHow should we view the power that comes with technology?\n\nThe power that technology affords us today is \u201cGod-like\u201d in its proportions, says Jason.\n\nJesus knew of such limitless power. Yet, He chose to humble Himself even if it meant He had to die on the cross.\n\n\u201cThis Christian virtue of humility was actually revolutionary. In the language of tech, it is disruptive.\n\n\u201cIt is against the winner-takes-all, blitzscaling strategy, having first-mover advantage, building the next unicorn.\n\n\u201cSo, we do not need to become like God and choose all this technology because we have Someone who walked among us and has unparalleled power to be like God. So, I want to remind us to go back to Jesus when times are difficult for you with your personal finance, and in your quest to find financial success and stewardship.\u201d\n\nIssues of concern\n\nThere were questions from the floor which Jason answered as well.\n\nIs investing in cryptocurrency a zero-sum game? If I invest in it, will I cause others to lose money?\n\n\u201cSee cryptocurrency as an extension of money. So, the question is the same as: Is the stock market a zero-sum game? Is investments into other opportunities a zero-sum game? It is as much a zero-sum game as any other investments.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, cryptocurrency is a lot more volatile and speculative. But it also moves in a cycle.\n\nIt has gone as low as US$1,200 and as high as US$60,000. So, as with all investments, research is important.\n\nCryptocurrencies have made it possible to be very rich, very quickly. What do you think of overnight millionaires?\n\n\u201cGo back to the fundamentals. Be discipled. Jesus had his 12. We need discipleship particularly among those who are in the industry.\n\n\u201cThis form of discipleship has helped people to understand things better and to create faith-based crypto and blockchain applications to be light in the darkness,\u201d said Jason.\n\nHow do you stop yourself from getting scammed in the crypto market?\n\n\u201cAs with traditional scams, ask people around you. Have a good close-knit community whom you can approach.\n\n\u201cDo proper due diligence. Check with people you can trust,\u201d said Jason.\n\nRELATED STORIES:"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTesla lost over $140 million betting on Bitcoin last year, according to a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The electric car manufacturer took a $204 million impairment charge while gaining $64 million through converting Bitcoin in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our Bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us,\u201d Tesla said in the filing.\n\nAn impairment charge describes a reduction or loss in the value of an asset. It can occur because of a change in economic circumstances, like the crypto winter that gripped the market after the collapse of Terra Luna in May 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe annual disclosure to the SEC comes less than a week after Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings report, which included no Bitcoin transactions but nonetheless saw the value of its holdings decline, generating a $43 million loss for the last four months of 2022.\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla invested a staggering $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, making it one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency\u2014second only to MicroStrategy. At the time, Bitcoin traded at $46,364 per coin. By November 10, 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of $69,044 per coin, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBut the good times did not last as Bitcoin, and the rest of the cryptocurrency market, went into freefall in 2022. As of January 31, 2023, Bitcoin is trading at around $23,051.\n\nTesla\u2019s impairment losses nearly doubled since 2021 when, in an SEC filing that year, Tesla reported a $101 million impairment loss on digital assets and $128 million gains after selling Bitcoin in 2021.\n\nBy October 2022, Tesla reported to investors that the company still held over $218 million in Bitcoin after selling 75% of its holdings in July\u2014around $936 million at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions,\u201d the company said in Monday\u2019s filing.\n\nIn the filing, Tesla calls its Bitcoin holdings indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets are periodically reviewed to determine if their value on the balance sheet exceeds their fair market value. As Tesla explained, these impairment charges may affect the company\u2019s further investment in Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cFor any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase,\u201d the company said.\n\nNeither the quarterly earnings report nor the SEC filing identified any specific digital assets besides Bitcoin. The company is believed to hold Dogecoin, however, as it accepts the meme-coin as payment, and CEO Elon Musk is a self-avowed fan."

        "title": "How Did Bitcoin's Price Change During the New Year's Period? - FinSMEs",
        "content": "Bitcoin has not been in a very strong position throughout 2022, and now that the year has come to a close, many people are wondering what 2023 holds in store for the original cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance during the New Year\u2019s period is of particular interest due to the fact that it may set the stage for the rest of the year, and as you are going to find out today, Bitcoin might finally be getting the break it needs.\n\nIn this article, we will be taking a look at the current BTC price and seeing how it changed throughout the New Year period, as well as extrapolating the results to give us an indication of what we might see from Bitcoin this year. Let\u2019s get straight into it.\n\nImage by MichaelWuensch from Pixabay\n\nA Small But Noticeable Upwards Trend\n\nFor all of you bitcoin investors out there, we may have some good news. Over the New Year\u2019s period, bitcoin experienced a small but noticeable increase in value, and this may give some evidence to suggest that 2023 is going to be a much better year for bitcoin when compared to 2022.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees in investing \u2013 this should be a concept that you are more than familiar with if you have been in the investing scene for any reasonable length of time.\n\nThere are a plethora of factors that have had an impact on its price, and the fact that bitcoins value is currently on the rise after New Year might not be the ray of light that crypto investors are looking for.\n\nHowever, bitcoin\u2019s current performance can certainly give a glimmer of hope to those who want to see bitcoin return to its former glory. Only time will tell whether or not this upwards trend will continue and whether it will break its previous ATH (All Time High)..\n\nAny Differences Are Not All That Impactful\n\nWhile bitcoin\u2019s increase in value is most definitely going to be taken as a good omen by most, there are a few extra factors you need to consider before you start liquidating your portfolio. New Year has historically been an incredibly prosperous period for crypto as well as all investments, and the fact that bitcoin has seen a rise is only in line with most of its competitors.\n\nAlmost all of the top ranked cryptocurrencies experienced growth during the New Year period, as this is the time when people are the most likely to invest due to New Year\u2019s resolutions and promises. That goes without even mentioning people\u2019s general willingness to spend money during the New year\u2019s holiday \u2013 this is one of the few times of the year when people just allow themselves to splurge.\n\nWhatever the reasoning may be, bitcoin\u2019s growth is not as impressive as you may first suspect. You most definitely do not want to base any of your decisions when it comes to buying/selling bitcoin on the small increase in value it experienced during the New Year\u2019s period.\n\nThe difference in value really is minuscule, and when you pair this with the fact that the vast majority of the reasons as to why bitcoin rose in value were nothing to do with bitcoin, it just becomes all the less significant.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Investors?\n\nSo, what does bitcoin\u2019s increase in value mean for you and I? Well, as we have already explained, not so much. Barring the several external factors that could have had a positive influence on bitcoin\u2019s price, the value increase it experienced is still minuscule at best, and there is next to no evidence to suggest that bitcoins price increase was due to increased demand.\n\nHowever, just because the New Year\u2019s period might have not impacted bitcoin as much as some would like is not to say bitcoin is in a bad position. On the contrary; bitcoin looks to be in much better shape when compared to the state it was in just a few months ago, and it seems as though the upwards trend it is currently on might be set to stay.\n\nWhile we can never say for sure what the markets have in store, bitcoin is looking incredibly promising in the early months of 2023. we can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\n\nWe hope we have been able to give you a better insight into how Bitcoin\u2019s price changed over the New Year\u2019s period. While any changes are minimal, there certainly is an upwards trend taking place with bitcoin\u2019s value, and this may be able to give us an indication that bitcoin is finally beginning to gain the investor confidence it needs.\n\nHowever, to play devil\u2019s advocate; there are numerous reasons why bitcoin\u2019s price went up, most of which have nothing to do with bitcoin at all. Most cryptos saw an increase in value over the new year period and bitcoin was already in green before New Year\u2019s came, meaning this period might have had little to no effect on price.\n\nWe will just have to wait and see to find out if bitcoin is on the road to recovery. There just isn\u2019t enough data on hand to suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s value increase over New Year\u2019s is of any significance."

A first experiment with cryptocurrencies took place in 2017, when the company began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in Cape Town, but transaction costs and wait times hindered the process.\n\nDuring its pilot program, Pick n Pay partnered with Electrum and CryptoConvert to enable customers to pay via the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a second layer added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that allows off-chain transactions\n\nAmong the African nations, South Africa appears to be making considerable progress in adopting cryptocurrency. South Africa ranks 30th globally in terms of cryptocurrency adoption according to Chainalysis\u2019 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index. It has been estimated that about 10% to 13% of the South African population holds crypto assets."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is rapidly regaining its lost dominance in the crypto market so far into 2023.\n\nOn Jan. 30, Bitcoin accounted for 44.82% of the total crypto market capitalization, the highest since June. In September, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance index was as low as 38.84%.\n\nThe index typically rises when most crypto investors reduce their exposure to smaller tokens and seek safety in Bitcoin.

In comparison, the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), gained 30% in the same period, showing most investors remain gravitated toward Bitcoin so far in 2023.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Bitcoin dominance index may rise further in the coming weeks as it reclaims its 50-week exponential moving average (the red wave in the chart below) as support.\n\nBitcoin dominance index weekly performance chart.

But whereas kids in Henry\u2019s class had given talks on coding or space, Henry settled on Bitcoin.\n\nSusie explained that the talk was a success: \u201cHe was buzzing when he came out; so so pleased. His classmates enjoyed it because it was funny.\u201d The presentation is a quirky example of Bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity and understanding among younger generations.\n\nHenry\u2019s Bitcoin blinged cat, Molly.\n\nHenry had included a gif of his cat Molly and pictures of himself dressed up as a gangster \u2014 much to his classmates\u2019 amusement \u2014 to demonstrate that Bitcoin is not for criminals.\n\nHowever, was Henry successful in \u201corange pilling\u201d his classmates about Bitcoin? Susie said that when he asked her son how it went, Henry replied:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know. You never really know with kids!\u201d\n\nHenry will be reassured by the efforts of organizations like My First Bitcoin, the El Salvador-based education program for kids, or even the Bitcoin toys, books and games that are available to help children learn about money and Bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, despite Henry\u2019s best efforts, his friend Willliam said he might be interested in Dogecoin (DOGE). William joins Elon Musk in supporting the crypto token created for fun but still pumps every time multibillionaire Musk mentions the meme in his tweets.\n\nAs for Henry, he doesn\u2019t have a phone, so he cannot stack sats (save in Bitcoin) just yet. \u201cHis older sister does have a Wallet of Satoshi account, but the only place she can spend sats is at her dad\u2019s osteopath,\u201d Susie joked.\n\nThe osteopathic practice near London, U.K. Source: BTCmapdotorg\n\nThe osteopathic practice is one of the few places that accept Bitcoin in the Chelmsford area, as shown on BTCMap.org. Nonetheless, more and more merchants are joining the network as the U.K. slowly warms up to the decentralized currency.\n\nHenry\u2019s teacher shared encouraging feedback on his presentation, and there\u2019s now some discussion on whether Henry could deliver the Bitcoin talk to the students in the year above as a real test of his skills.\n\nRelated: UK Bitcoin community reacts to incoming CBDC and digital pound rollout\n\nThe teacher even left an encouraging note saying that Decentrasuze should be \u201cvery proud\u201d of her son\u2019s activities. Judging by the Bitcoin community\u2019s reaction on Twitter, they are too."

        "content": "00:00\n\nYeah, well, 2023 is setting up to be a pretty good year for crypto assets after last year 64 percent plunge in January alone. Bitcoin is heading to a roughly 40 percent gain. But the question is, will these gains stick around? Bloomberg's Abigail Doolittle has a look at the charts for us. Abigail and Matt. There is some reason to think these gains may stick around. So here's the monthly gain that we're looking at in January. As you mentioned, nearly 40 percent. At one point it had been more than 40 percent. And we're looking at the best month since 2020. Right now we're looking at the best month since the fall of 2021. Importantly, the RSI. This is a monthly chart. So that monthly RSI not anywhere near overbought. It has been overbought fast back in 20, 2013, suggesting that the buyers are not tired yet. We combine that chart with this chart. This, too, is a monthly chart. We're really taking a longer view here. You can see a nice uptrend. You can see that Bitcoin is basically at all times hugging that 50 month moving average. You can also see these areas of consolidation that come down and triangles that they tend to cause the buyers to completely sell and then reload and take bitcoin higher. We're looking at a similar pattern right now, Matt, suggesting that 2023 might be a great year for Bitcoin. You could even see bitcoin take a run at its all time high. And given the fact that in the past this has been used as a risk on risk off sentiment. Maybe 2023 is going to be a little bit more risk on than many would have thought last year, Matt."

        "title": "Crypto Narratives and the Bitcoin Anti-Narrative - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The word narrative is overused in crypto, and it might elicit a roll of the eyes if uttered in dialogue with a committed Bitcoin maxi. It refers to a story, in this case about a coin, protocol or product, that will drive attention and attract buyers.\n\nYou could argue that rather than narratives, crypto needs concrete real-world utility, but still, when sentiment picks up and bullishness stirs for certain, the reality, whether we like it or not, is that narratives have a gravitational effect on incoming traders.\n\nAs for when crypto bullishness might return, opinion is split. Some observers reckon the early stirrings are already upon us, and that BTC\u2019s recent price rise is indicative that the bottom has been reached and the cycle is rotating us into a fresh phase. Others, meanwhile, maintain that recent pumps are the result of an oversold market in which too many traders were positioned short, and don\u2019t represent a meaningful shift in structure.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s worth being ready for incoming storylines that can become prominent when bulls are back in control, and, regardless of whether or not we actually believe in them, we can already get an idea of what those narratives might be.\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nCrypto Narrative and Bitcoin Anti-Narrative Explained\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAt the tail-end of 2021, the metaverse was a hot topic, and accordingly, any coin that was connected via metaverse notions briefly rode the waves of that hype.\n\nWith the rise of ChatGPT, and with investment channeling into AI and Machine Learning Machine Learning Machine learning is defined as an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that looks to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that also focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.This has many potential benefits for most industries and sectors, including the financial services industry. Machine Learning ExplainedMachine learning can be explained Machine learning is defined as an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that looks to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that also focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.This has many potential benefits for most industries and sectors, including the financial services industry. Machine Learning ExplainedMachine learning can be explained Read this Term development, we can expect next time around that any crypto protocols related to AI will perform well. This has, in fact, already played out in miniature, with coins such as Fetch and AGIX experiencing gains while ChatGPT has dominated tech news, and that dynamic can perhaps play out more dramatically under bullish conditions.\n\nGaming and the Metaverse\n\nSpeaking of the metaverse, we should not imagine that it\u2019s a bygone topic from an earlier cycle. Development continues on metaverse projects across several companies, including Yuga Labs, The Sandbox, Decentraland and Meta (formerly Facebook), and though media attention has shifted for the moment, there\u2019s every chance that another bout of hype, hopefully with inviting products attached, will bubble up again in the future.\n\nGaming and metaverse coins, such as GALA and NAKA had strong runs in 2021, and that was without even having mainstream adoption to showcase. Should some genuinely enjoyable-to-use products start picking up momentum (and there is plenty of development on this front), then gaming can become a strong narrative.\n\nOn this note, another one to watch might be the TreasureDAO gaming ecosystem and its MAGIC token, operating on the Arbitrum network, which has stated that it wants to build a decentralized version of Nintendo.\n\nWatch this recent FMLS22 panel on reimagining the crypto market structure.\n\nDecentralized Storage and Oracles\n\nIf blockchains are to enable decentralized computing (and, as a caveat, not everyone agrees that this is the main purpose of crypto development), then there are practical considerations around how to store and recall data in a securely decentralized manner, and how to gather information from the web to be used in on-chain applications.\n\nStorage protocols deal with the issue of keeping and accessing files without the need for centralized entities and include the likes of Filecoin, Sia, Arweave and Storj. Robust permissionless storage is particularly relevant to NFTs, as, at the moment, while NFTs are crypto tokens, many simply link to image files kept on regular, centralized servers.\n\nThen there are Oracles, which are protocols to connect decentralized applications with the wider world by retrieving outside data for smart contracts. Leading the way is Chainlink, with projects such as Band Protocol and UMA also in the running.\n\nDecentralization should be at the core of the crypto discussion, it\u2019s a fundamental driving concept, and if there\u2019s a refocus on basic principles after the multiple wayward shambles of 2022, then achieving full decentralization, utilizing storage and oracles, could be prioritized.\n\nThe Bitcoin Anti-Narrative\n\nThere is also the anti-narrative of having no narrative at all, which is embodied most clearly, or perhaps uniquely, by Bitcoin. In this case, there is a refreshing simplicity: Bitcoin is sound money, digitally decentralized, for making payments Payments One of the bases of mediums of exchange in the modern world, a payment constitutes the transfer of a legal currency or equivalent from one party in exchange for goods or services to another entity. The payments industry has become a fixture of modern commerce, though the players involved and means of exchange have dramatically shifted over time.In particular, a party making a payment is referred to as a payer, with the payee reflecting the individual or entity receiving the payment. Most commonl One of the bases of mediums of exchange in the modern world, a payment constitutes the transfer of a legal currency or equivalent from one party in exchange for goods or services to another entity. The payments industry has become a fixture of modern commerce, though the players involved and means of exchange have dramatically shifted over time.In particular, a party making a payment is referred to as a payer, with the payee reflecting the individual or entity receiving the payment. Most commonl Read this Term, saving, and preserving wealth. It\u2019s an attractive, no-nonsense proposition and doesn\u2019t require any decorative elaboration.\n\nOther Stories\n\nOther niches and narratives are at play, some of which can gain traction. Among these, there are Layer 2s (Polygon and Arbitrum are notable), Ethereum competitors (Solana, Avalanche, Cardano and more), privacy coins (Monero is most prominent), and Cosmos present itself, ambitiously, as the internet of blockchains, which, as with TreasureDAO aiming to become the blockchain Nintendo, sounds compelling.\n\nIt\u2019s also plausible that NFTs will, at some point, go on another run to match, or even exceed, that of 2021. Many seasoned crypto traders remained on the NFT sidelines last time, caught unawares by the sudden explosion of interest, and unsure what to make of what appeared, from a certain perspective, to be limited-supply meme coins with JPEGs attached.\n\nNFTs have established themselves more robustly since then, some projects are building prolifically, and there is a better understanding of what they are and how they can perform. In fact, if buyers are searching for crypto utility and crossover appeal, it may even be NFTs that can lead the way."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Greenidge Generation Holdings has significantly reduced its debt with the investment management firm New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG).\n\nOn Jan. 30, Greenidge entered into several agreements associated with its secured debt with NYDIG, transferring ownership of Bitcoin mining hardware and certain credits to NYDIG. The transaction reduced the principal and accrued interest balance of debt with NYDIG from about $76 million to roughly $17 million, resulting in total aggregate debt reduction of around $59 million.\n\nOne of the agreements, the senior secured loan agreement, also enables an opportunity for a voluntary prepayment of the loan by transferring ownership of certain mining infrastructure assets. Subject to a binding agreement by NYDIG, the loan agreement can potentially reduce the principal balance of the debt to approximately $7 million.\n\nAs previously reported, Greenidge originally signed the deal in mid-December 2022, expecting to reduce its NYDIG debt by at least $57 million and up to $68 million.\n\n\u201cThe debt restructuring we\u2019ve announced today significantly improves our balance sheet and provides us with a clear path forward as we enter 2023,\u201c Greenidge CEO Dave Anderson said. The executive expressed confidence about the strong mining industry development ahead, stating:\n\n\u201cThe completion of this debt restructuring, coupled with the execution of the new hosting agreements, has significantly improved our immediate liquidity and allows us to continue participating in the future upside potential of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDespite essentially restructuring the company into a hosting firm for Bitcoin mining rigs, Greenidge continues to own about 10,000 miners, maintaining a capacity of 1.1 exahashes per second (EH/s), the firm said.\n\nAmid a tough cryptocurrency winter, many mining firms have been moving to decrease their debt using similar strategies. In late December 2022, Argo Blockchain reduced its total debt by $41 million by selling its flagship Helios mining facility and getting a $35 million loan from Mike Novogratz\u2019s crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital.\n\nRelated: Public Bitcoin mining companies plagued with $4B of collective debt\n\nIn addition to the debt reduction, Greenidge also released preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022, reporting $15 million in revenues and up to $130 million in losses. The firm produced approximately 683 BTC ($15.7 million) during Q4 2022.\n\nGreenidge also mentioned the sale of its software subsidiary Support.com on Jan. 17. The sale generated approximately $2.6 million net proceeds."

CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company had holdings in Dogecoin during 2022, but only the Bitcoin holdings appear in the legal paperwork.

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin 4-Year Market Cycle Real? - Benzinga",
        "content": "Happy birthday, Bitcoin! On Jan. 3, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain reached the age of fourteen. In some ways, 2009 seems like a lifetime ago and in other ways like it was yesterday. After 14 years, Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, is still the king, and, as king, the rest of the crypto market follows it.\n\nThroughout Bitcoin\u2019s short history, its price has experienced enormous swings to new all-time highs, followed by retracements that take back most of the gains. Studying the four Bitcoin market cycles, it becomes clear that other than the first cycle, the others are relatively consistent regarding timing.\n\nThis trend is especially true of the last two cycles, which are very close to 4 years each from peak to peak and bottom to bottom. Some have speculated that this timing results from the Bitcoin halving that occurs approximately every four years (210,000 blocks mined). The question now is: Is the Bitcoin 4-year cycle a real phenomenon or just a coincidence? And if it is real, will it continue?\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nDissecting Bitcoin\u2019s Market Cycles\n\nFor clarity, this article defines a market cycle from one bear market bottom to the next.\n\n2010 to 2011 Market Cycle\n\nThe first accurate Bitcoin price tracking occurred in July 2010. By October, Bitcoin's price started to rise and peaked on June 8, 2011, at $31.90. The price began to fall over the next five months and bottomed at $2.01 on Nov. 19, 2011. This first cycle was the shortest of all the cycles to date.\n\n2011 to 2015 Market Cycle\n\nCycle #2 began at the 2011 bear market bottom on November 19, after which the price bounced higher almost immediately. After the bounce, there was a six-month period of consolidation. After BTC broke out of the consolidation, it peaked at over $268 on April 10, 2013; a 76% drop followed that peak.\n\nBTC recovered almost immediately and hit a bull market peak of $1,177 on Nov. 30, 2013. An 86% drop followed that peak; the bottom was hit on Jan. 14, 2015.\n\n2015 to 2018 Market Cycle\n\nThe third cycle began at the 2015 bear market bottom on January 14. For the first 9 \u00bd months, the price of Bitcoin accumulated in a range of about $100. After the price of Bitcoin broke out of the accumulation range, it re-tested the range once before moving higher.\n\nThe move higher culminated in the bull market peak at just under $20,000 on Dec. 17, 2017. Once again, a price drop of 84% followed the peak and the bottom was hit almost one year later, on Dec. 15, 2018.\n\n2018 to 2022 Market Cycle\n\nThe fourth cycle began on Dec. 15, 2018, and after about four months of accumulation, the price of Bitcoin broke out in a dramatic fashion. Over the next three months, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 200% and hit a high of $13,831 on June 26, 2019.\n\nOver the remainder of the year, Bitcoin\u2019s price slowly dropped but still finished up about 90% for the year. The start of 2020 saw a 45% increase in the price of Bitcoin, which peaked in mid-February. That was followed by the COVID crash, which bottomed in mid-March.\n\nThe recovery from the COVID crash was swift and eventually led to the next bull market. This bull market was reminiscent of the 2013 bull market. After pushing higher throughout much of 2020, the price of Bitcoin peaked on April 14, 2021. This peak was followed by a 55% pullback that bottomed on July 20.\n\nOver the next month, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 134%, which led to the ultimate bull market peak on Nov. 10 at $69,000. Bitcoin\u2019s price immediately began to drop and just over a year later, on Nov. 21, 2022, it hit what appears to be the bottom at $15,495.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Entire Price History - Weekly Chart\n\nBy zooming out and looking at the entire price history of Bitcoin, you can calculate the timing of each market cycle. In the chart above, the green vertical lines mark the bull market peaks and the time intervals between them. The yellow dashed lines mark the bear market bottoms, with the time intervals between them.\n\nTake note of the timing of the last two market cycles. They are close to a four-year cycle, from one peak to the next and from bottom to bottom. Another interesting observation is the time of year when the peaks and bottoms occur.\n\nOther than the very first peak in 2011, all the others occurred in November, December or January. November has the most with two peaks and two bottoms, assuming that Nov. 21, 2022, marks the bottom for this bear market. Is this timing a coincidence, or is there a reason behind it?\n\nAnother observation is that each bear market low is higher than the previous low. Will that continue? Below is another chart showing the entire price history of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Entire Price History - Weekly Chart\n\nThe vertical lines on this chart mark each peak (green), when each halving occurred (red) and the date one year before each halving (yellow). The percentage increase in price is then measured between the vertical lines for each cycle. It is calculated for the year leading up to the halving and from the halving to the following peak.\n\nIt is clear that with each successive cycle, the percentage increase in price for the year leading up to the halving is declining. The same pattern is evident from the halving to the following peak. Again, with Bitcoin\u2019s short history, it is unclear whether or not this pattern will continue. Visually, it is easy to see the diminishing returns with each successive cycle.\n\nTiming for Bitcoin Bottoms - Halvings - Peaks\n\nThis chart shows how consistent the timing is from the bottom to the halving and from the halving to the following peak. The next halving is estimated to occur on March 28, 2024. Just for fun, extrapolating the data from the other cycles puts the next bull market peak in late October 2025.\n\nIs there a meaning behind these patterns? Will these patterns continue? Can you even call these patterns with the limited amount of data? So many questions and because no one has a crystal ball, all people can do is watch as the next Bitcoin market cycle unfolds. It should also be noted that because many altcoins follow Bitcoin\u2019s price action, there is also a crypto market cycle.\n\nWill Bitcoin\u2019s 4-Year Market Cycle Continue or Evolve?\n\nAnother important question is how the changing investor demographics will affect the Bitcoin market cycle. Over the last couple of years, the number of institutional investors has been increasing. The number of corporations holding Bitcoin has been growing as well. As more regulation is brought into the sector, institutional investment will grow.\n\nThe days of only retail investors and traders buying Bitcoin are over. Will this trend affect Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle? As investor demographics change, the steep bear market pullbacks may become shallower. If this does occur, it will affect not only Bitcoin but also the entire crypto market cycle.\n\nRetail buyers will come in late and panic sell when the market turns against them. As they become a minor part of the overall investor pool, their effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price will diminish.\n\nInstitutional investors and corporations will be more likely to hold onto their Bitcoin. And depending on their average cost, they may even hold through bear markets. Together, these changes may significantly impact Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin\u2019s Current Market Condition?\n\nThe bottom of the 2018 bear market occurred two days shy of the one-year anniversary of the 2017 bull market peak. The low set on Nov. 21, 2022, at $15,476 (Binance), is one year and eleven days after the bull market peak on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nIt may be too early to say that Nov. 21, 2022, is the bottom for this bear market. But, after 49 days of sideways price movement, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged over 50% to just under $24,000. The likelihood of that being the bottom continues to increase.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Daily Chart\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s history, a macroeconomic environment like the past 12 months has not occurred. Inflation has soared to levels not seen in 40 years. To combat this, central banks worldwide increased interest rates to slow economic growth. The unknown now is whether this policy will result in recessions in some countries or worse worldwide.\n\nA severe recession would drop markets worldwide and most likely put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. If a severe downturn can be avoided, 2023 should be a year of recovery for BTC. January has only a few days left and Bitcoin is up about 45% for the month, which marks an excellent start to the year.\n\nHistorically, the meat of bull markets has occurred after each halving. The next halving is estimated for the end of March 2024, so if this cycle follows past cycles, the next macro bull market should begin soon after.\n\nMark Twain is credited with saying, \u201cHistory never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.\u201d This does appear to be true for Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles. Whether or not rhyming continues is anyone's guess. What is becoming more evident is that with each day inches closer to the most exciting time in crypto. Will you be prepared for liftoff?\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin\n\nNow that you know how to use Bitcoin market cycles to get an idea of what the future holds for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general, here's how to buy Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is the largest and most popular crypto in the world, it is offered by essentially all crypto exchanges. Some of the best exchanges that offer Bitcoin trading are eToro, WeBull, Gemini, Binance, Uphold and HYCM. Once you buy your Bitcoin, you should keep the coins off of the exchange to custody your crypto yourself for the best security. Ledger hardware wallets are all you need to keep your crypto safe and they support more than 1,800 cryptos including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple and all ERC-20 tokens."

        "title": "Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 14-Month High as Bitcoin Climbs - TradeStation Market Insights",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin tumbled in the last year as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, but now spirits could be improving.\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which includes factors like Volatility and Momentum, hit 61 on Monday. It was the highest reading since November 2021, when Bitcoin was 150 percent higher.\n\nThe increase followed a three-week rally in the cryptocurrency. BTCUSD now finds itself back above $22,000 and is testing peaks from last August. Investors could find it interesting for a few reasons.\n\nFirst is the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow. Cryptocurrencies shot to new highs in late 2020 after policymakers cut interest rates near zero. They also fell in late 2021 as investors braced for higher rates. In that respect, they\u2019ve been leading equities \u2014 especially growth stocks on the Nasdaq-100.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index, courtesy of Alternative.me.\n\nThe market broadly expects the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, with the possibility of one more hike on March 22. (According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.) Any indications of central bankers pausing earlier could potentially impact Bitcoin because it would probably lower borrowing costs. Softer monetary policy could also depress the U.S. dollar, increasing the appeal of assets like precious metals and cryptos.\n\nSecond, fundamentals of the crypto market have tightened. Data from CryptoQuant.com shows fewer than 2.2 million Bitcoin available on public exchanges, down from 3.1 million three years ago. That suggests less supply is available, which may help support prices.\n\nCharting Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has been pushing against its September high around $22,750. Traders could next eye the August peak of $25,200.\n\nTo the downside, chart watchers could focus on the $21,500 level. That was a level from November that Bitcoin broke on January 20.\n\nStill, participation has been narrow as other digital assets like Ethereum, BNB and Polygon struggle. That\u2019s different than Bitcoin\u2019s last bull run. At that time (December 2020) Bitcoin rallied but shrank as a percentage of the total crypto market. So-called Bitcoin dominance slid from over 70 percent to under 40 percent by May 2021, according to TradingView data. The move resulted from money streaming into the broader market. This time, it\u2019s mostly going to Bitcoin.\n\nThere could be three ways to view the relative strength of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin (BTCUSD), daily chart, with key levels cited above, courtesy of TradingView.\n\nA pessimistic view would be that investors have lost interest in cryptos overall and Bitcoin is the \u201clast man standing.\u201d\n\nAn optimistic view would note that Bitcoin dominance tends to peak as bear markets end. Therefore if other tokens like Ethereum gain versus Bitcoin in coming weeks, it could suggest investors are returning to the broader space.\n\nA mixed view could be favorable toward Bitcoin alone. After all, BTCUSD was the first major crypto and has always boasted the largest market capitalization. It\u2019s received the the most attention by large investors. It could also have the least risk of being regulated as a security, according to regulators.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin could be nearing a turning point as sentiment brightens and markets look for the interest rates to stop rising. Investors who\u2019ve abandoned cryptocurrencies could start looking again."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin SV More Efficient Than Bitcoin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Efficiency has been a heavily-discussed topic in the blockchain space for some time. BSV promotes several elements which enable efficiency within the platform. BTC on the other hand, is enhanced by layer-2 applications which operate atop the network.\n\nPayment transactions on BTC have been enabled by the Lightning Network (LN). LN enhances Bitcoin through micropayments and by allowing instant transactions at low costs and across blockchains. It should also be noted that there have been inconsistencies and defects identified with the platform according to some reports, one of the most recent by researchers at the University of Illinois in a paper published in August 2022.\n\nBitcoin SV and BTC have long been compared. BTC, represents the largest blockchain and digital asset ecosystem in the world. On the other hand, BSV states its claim as being the original Bitcoin network which preserves the vision and mission of Satioshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Makes A Blockchain Efficient?\n\nWith so much emphasis on Proof-of-stake (PoS) versus Proof-of-work (PoW) in the ongoing blockchain consensus algorithm debate, it is quite easy to mistakenly consider efficiency as being affected by network mining standards. The fact is, efficiency is more related to the ability of the network to process transactions in an efficient manner, not the standard.\n\nWhile the mining standard does affect the carbon footprint of the network based on the energy utilised in the process, network efficiency hangs upon entirely different metrics.\n\nHow Does Efficiency Differ Between Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBoth Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin utilise PoW blockchain consensus mechanisms. In the model, miners join the networks and use powerful computing machines that are leveraged to solve complicated mathematical problems in a race for block rewards. The nature of how transactions are handled and processed in the block generation methodology is what reflects differences between the efficiency of each network.\n\nThe throughput, or power of the Bitcoin SV network is significantly higher, and therefore more efficient, than that of BTC. Bitcoin SV promotes lightning fast, instantaneous blockchain transactions. This is largely supported by larger block sizes enabled on BSV. Transactions on Bitcoin SV are processed with a max, 4 GB block size, compared to BTC, with 1 MB. The block size affects the amount of transactions included in each block. More transactions are able to be grouped in BSV blocks, while only a limited amount can be processed per BTC block.\n\nThe daily average block size for the BSV network is referenced as being between 25-286 MB according to the most recently available metrics, well under its maximum allowable capacity. Comparatively, BTC is noted as being under 1.5 MB for its daily average block size. Each blockchain has a network token associated with its platform. While each holds intrinsic value as tokens to reward miners, power applications and more, like all cryptocurrencies traded on the open market, BTC and BSV price is influenced by trading and associated market factors.\n\nGreater Mining Efficiency After All\n\nAs a bonus, the larger data capacity subsequently means that miners on the BSV network are also more energy-efficient, which again, is a separate measurement altogether. This is because the same power emitted by BSV miners is able to be used in order to process more transactions simply because more network transactions can be added and into each block that is mined on-chain. This enables the referenced fast, instantaneous transactions of the BSV platform.\n\nWhich Network Processes More Transactions?\n\nIn a side-by-side comparison between BSV and BTC, it is made evident that a much larger number of transactions are processed on the BSV blockchain platform than BTC. It is estimated that around 260,000 transactions are processed on the BTC network per day, as compared to around 3.5 million on BSV.\n\nTo demonstrate the differences between the two more plainly, BTC is referenced as having the ability to process around 4.6 transactions per second (tps), versus close to 100,000 transactions per second on the BSV platform. This certainly helps to demonstrate the effect of larger block sizes and how they work to dramatically enhance the efficiency of the BSV blockchain.\n\nWhat About Additional Data Processing?\n\nBSV is noted for being able to enable data in its transactions. Data processing is supported by the presence of Script and Turing code, which empower the implementation of smart contracts within the network scheme. This makes the BSV network ideal not only for fast, instant transaction processing, but also for Bitcoin-enabled applications\n\nBitcoin-enabled applications provide organisations, businesses and individuals the ability to create data-dependent innovations such as decentralized gaming platforms, NFT (non-fungible token) ecosystems, and more. BTC is only able to achieve such functionality with layer-2 applications which are needed to scale the underlying platform.\n\nSummary And Conclusion\n\nEfficiency remains a hot topic in the blockchain industry. Now that the elements which go into network efficiency have been carefully disclosed, it seems BSV greatly outdoes the BTC network in the area of true network efficiency. With immensely larger block sizes that work to enhance transaction capacities and the throughput of the network, BSV presents as a clear example of the type of efficiency sought in today\u2019s ever-increasing blockchain-integrated global business and social environments.\n\nNot only is the efficiency greater, but in the area of blockchain mining, BSV has been measured as using only 765.31 PH/s (Peta Hash per second) of power in its network mining model, compared to BTC\u2019s 136,270 PH/s. While the mining standard does not reflect the efficiency and throughput, the superior throughput of BSV enables such efficiency to be captured in the mining standard as well.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "UK-native stablecoin integrates into 18,000 ATMs nationwide - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A partnership between Poundtoken and BitcoinPoint will make the country\u2019s first 100%-backed British pound stablecoin, GBPT, accessible to retail consumers via a network of 18,000 ATMs across the United Kingdom. The move marks another step toward the U.K. becoming a \u201ccrypto hub\u201d and is in line with the government\u2019s push to use stablecoins for wholesale settlements.\n\nBitcoinPoint is a Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency exchange, licensed and registered in the United Kingdom. Poundtoken is the sole issuer of GBPT, which it states is fully backed in pounds at all times, with monthly attestations provided by auditor KPMG.\n\nCryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) can already be swapped for cash at ATMs across the United Kingdom. However, listing GBPT on BitcoinPoint means that users can now access retail and wholesale payments using the pound stablecoin and use a currency familiar to Brits as an on-ramp into crypto.\n\nThere are thousands of ATMs in London alone. Source: ATM Map\n\nBenoit Marzouk, CEO of BitcoinPoint, told Cointelegraph that the move could democratize \u201caccess to crypto for non-tech savvy people in the United Kingdom.\u201d He explained that:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also fully in line with the government\u2019s consideration to integrate stablecoins with the U.K. economy.\"\n\nThe U.K. is the second-largest economy in Europe. Its government is recruiting for senior roles in central bank digital currencies as well as a digital pound rollout, while Prime Minister Rish Sunak has been vocal in his support for \u201cdigital settlement assets,\u201d the country\u2019s new, preferred terminology for crypto.\n\nCrosbie explained to Cointelegraph that Poundtoken came about as a result of the \u201crise in USD stablecoins\u201d such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) and the fact that there is no U.K.-based alternative.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of GBPT is really to bring the blockchain and crypto to the U.K. and make it easier for adoption in the U.K. [...] It\u2019s time the U.K. started to realize its potential as a world leader in crypto.\u201d\n\nThe partnership works to normalize the use of stablecoins to conduct everyday financial practices. Marzouk explained, \u201cWe are Bitcoiners at BitcoinPoint, and we really see value in stablecoin projects \u2014 it really makes sense.\u201d\n\nUsers require a phone number and a BitcoinPoint account to use the service. Source: Marzouk\n\nStablecoin use has proliferated around the world, from inflation-ridden Argentina to European financial hub Switzerland. However, the scars of the Terra algorithmic stablecoin crash are still fresh for the crypto industry, forcing some jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, to outlaw their use entirely.\n\nScoring systems from traditional finance risk assessors such as Moody\u2019s may give credibility to the burgeoning stablecoin ecosystem, while efforts from Bitcoin-advocate groups such as the Bitcoin Policy Institute may pave the way toward a crypto- and stablecoin-based future.\n\nRelated: United Kingdom banks are a threat to crypto, and that's bad news for everyone\n\nMarzouk told Cointelegraph that in the U.K., cashing out via an ATM off-ramp using BitcoinPoint remains low \u2014 less than 5% \u2014 and it is unlikely that there will be a dramatic uptick in numbers of users taking advantage of GBPT to hold physical cash. However, he is \u201cquite confident about the on-ramp [into crypto].\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see Bitcoiners opting out from the banking system and becoming Bitcoin only. You could also have people who don\u2019t want to have a bank account and could therefore use GBPT. So, when they need cash, they can off-ramp into GBPT to get cash.\u201d\n\nThe move could allow more and more crypto enthusiasts to participate without a bank. The integration is now live across the United Kingdom\u2019s 18,000 ATMs."

        "content": "A lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York has taken aim at London, England-headquartered Argo Blockchain PLC and its directors over a September 2021 initial public offering that investors claim went bust.\n\nDuring and after the IPO, Argo\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) mining business took several nose dives that investors said were foreseeable and that the company failed to disclose in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, thereby damaging purchasers of NASDAQ-traded Argo American Depository Shares (ADSs).\n\nArgo\u2019s cryptocurrency mining business is worldwide, the complaint says, noting that Argo maintains a fleet of thousands of BTC mining machines at facilities in Canada and Dickens County, Texas, the latter of which is called the \u201cHelios\u201d facility.\n\nIn September 2021, Argo conducted its IPO, issuing 7.5 million ADSs to the public at the price of $15 per share for approximate net proceeds of $105 million. Yet less than a year later, the shareholder contends that the company began to face significant production obstacles, each of which caused the stock price to tumble when publicized.\n\nIn June 2022, Argo announced that it had mined approximately 25% fewer BTC in May 2022 compared to April 2022 because of increased network difficulty, higher electricity prices, and the curtailment of mining operations at its Helios facility. Then, in October 2022, it announced a change to an equipment contract, its intent to sell 3,400 mining machines for \u00a36 million, and its intent to raise approximately \u00a324 million from a \u201cstrategic investor.\u201d\n\nA few days later, the company came forward with more disappointing BTC mining results from lessened operations at the Helios factory. After this news hit the market, ADS were trading at $2.19, well below their $15 offering price.\n\nThe shareholder argues that Argo and its board kept material information from the public including that the company was \u201chighly susceptible to and/or suffered from significant capital constraints, electricity and other costs, and network difficulties.\u201d This impacted Argo\u2019s ability to deliver on BTC mining goals, and showed that Argo\u2019s business was less sustainable than believed to be and its prospects overstated.\n\nThe suit seeks damages under federal securities laws for the omissions or misstatements that caused American consumers to invest to their detriment. The plaintiff and putative nationwide class are represented by Pomerantz LLP."

        "content": "Bitcoin is the King of the crypto market, and around 45% of the money is invested in it. All currencies are dependent on its price as they follow its unique pattern.\n\nAfter a long bear market, things have been picking up a bit of pace as BTC looks to recover. If you got hit badly in the crash, Bitcoin might not be able to surprise your wallet in 2023.\n\nHowever, if you want to get huge returns this year, invest in MEMAG, FGHT, TARO, and CCHG. Don\u2019t get flustered if you see money pouring in after buying these coins.\n\nBitcoin Price Surges through the Roof\n\nThe year 2022 wasn\u2019t for Bitcoin as it saw its price at $16k, the lowest ever in the last four years, plunging from $67k. It was all due to bad news and unexpected crashes that forced traders to pull out their money. But 2023 brought new hopes, as Bitcoin surged to almost 43% of its price from $16,500 to $23,800 in a month.\n\nThis price increase is the revival of BTC after the continuous bear market, as it will help other altcoins to gain momentum. One main reason for the BTC to get a huge pump is the positive CPI report and BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) showing a decline in Inflation.\n\nHowever, the price of BTC has not recovered to the pre-FTX crash point but is on its way to breaching important resistance levels. The market may pump even more if there\u2019s a positive CPI report and a stoppage of interest rate hikes.\n\nWhy Buying Crypto Right now is a good option?\n\nAs the price of BTC is increasing with every passing day, it\u2019s a great opportunity to set foot in the crypto market as it seems to stabilize once again after massive crash reports. If you are quick enough to analyze the situation and get in and out on time, you\u2019ll be able to make a hefty profit from this pump.\n\nSome experts think that BTC might fall under $20k once again, but until then, you can take full benefit of it as almost all the altcoins follow the pattern of BTC, and they might be pumping soon. Also, check out the news, as you\u2019ll find potential tokens releasing new features, and the world would be interested in buying them.

        "content": "The king of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, is trading against USDT on the aforementioned 1-day technical chart. At the time of writing, the price of one bitcoin is $22,987. Since the beginning of 2023, the cryptocurrency has finally risen above its 200-day Moving Average after trading below it for a protracted period. This has sparked speculation about the probable start of a positive trend.\n\nFurthermore, if the 50-day Moving Average also crosses above the 200-day Moving Average and continues to trade higher, it is likely that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience a significant upward movement from its current level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Technical Analysis (Source: TradingView)\n\nThe initial resistance level on the 1-day chart is also prominently located close to the $25,000 price mark. It is anticipated that the price of Bitcoin will increase to the second resistance level of $32,000 and even higher than resistance 3, the $40,000 price level in 2023 if it is trading close to this resistance level and successfully smashes it.\n\nHowever, the present Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is at 68.17, near the overbought territory of 70. When the RSI reaches the overbought region, it is typical for the digital asset to experience temporary price corrections. In such an event, it is likely that Bitcoin\u2019s price will retrace and find support at its 200-day Moving Average price zone of $19,701.\n\nIn the event that the first support level is breached, will this signify a renewed bearish trend for cryptocurrencies? Will Bitcoin\u2019s price retrace to the low of $16,000, similar to its levels in 2022?\n\nHowever, despite its growth and popularity, Bitcoin remains a highly speculative investment and its value is influenced by a wide range of factors, both internal and external to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ghana has the 9th highest rate for cryptocurrency ownership out of 27 countries - ZAWYA",
        "content": "According to the latest Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, conducted by Finder.com, Ghana stands 9th among 26 other countries in terms of adopting cryptocurrency!\n\nThe study was conducted among 27 countries, which says that Vietnam has the largest percentage of adults owning cryptocurrency \u2013 29%.\n\nIn the same list stands Ghana, with a percentage of 17% of adults owning cryptocurrency. Ghana has stood just behind countries like Australia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Malaysia, Russia, etc.; but leads in front of countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil, Norway, Canada, United States of America, New Zealand, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, etc!\n\nBefore digging a bit deeper, we should try to know about cryptocurrency in a bit more detail. A cryptocurrency, or simply crypto is a digital currency, tailored to work as a medium of exchange (like other assets) but through a computer network. Interestingly enough, cryptos aren\u2019t reliant on any sort of central authority, such as any government or bank or whatever that is, to maintain it.\n\nAs mass people own these currencies as individual assets, the ownership records are kept in a digital ledger. The ledger is computerized and uses strong cryptography so that all the transactions are safe and secured. It\u2019s important to understand that, cryptocurrencies don\u2019t necessarily have to be \u2018currencies\u2019 in the traditional sense. These are completely digital, don\u2019t have physical existence. Notably, such currencies are decentralized in terms of control, unlike CBDC.\n\nWe need to understand how this works. Usually, most cryptos use a blockchain system. The computer networks have two principal functions: the first one that processes all sorts of transactions, and the second one that maintains the database that stores all these data. Generally, the transactions are batched into \u2018blocks\u2019 which are afterward connected in an unbroken \u2018chain\u2019 in chronological order. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created before getting issued by anyone, it is considered to be centralized. After that, the decentralized control system is implemented, which allows each crypto to work through distributed ledger technology.\n\nNow, you may wonder why so many people across the globe own such a thing that doesn\u2019t even exist physically. Well, those who support cryptos see these as the currency of the future, and are in a race to buy them right away, in the hope they will become more valuable soon enough! Some of the supporters like the fact that there aren\u2019t any governments or banks controlling it for management. More people are getting attracted towards it as the value of cryptos is going upwards.\n\nNow that we have a basic knowledge about what cryptocurrency is, let\u2019s get back to where we started. To be specific, 17.3% of the adults in Ghana own at least some time of cryptocurrency. In terms of number, it is 3.1 million adults. This is above the global average of 15% of adults owning cryptocurrency. Let\u2019s dig a bit deeper. We know that there are multiple types of cryptocurrencies, among whom Bitcoin stands out to be the most popular one.\n\nApart from that, we have Dogecoin, Etherum, Solana, and many more. In the case of the 3.1 million people of own cryptos, about 52.1% of them own Bitcoin as a form of cryptocurrency. 18.1% of these people own Ethereum as cryptocurrency. In the case of Dogecoin as the form of crypto, almost 19.7% of the adults own it. 13.4% own Ripple, another type of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe study shows that young people are the ones who are mainly interested in owning cryptocurrency. Globally speaking, 56.1% of the total owners are aged between 18 to 34, 29.5% are aged between 34 to 54, and the rest of the 14.4% are of 55+ age. If we look into Ghana\u2019s situation, the percentage of owners aged between 18 to 34 is 70.4%! 16.6% are aged between 34 to 54, and the rest of the 13% are of 55+ age.\n\nVery often, Africa is ignored as a potential market for cryptocurrencies. Little do they notice that Africa is a pretty big market because of its high inflation rate compared to the other regions of the world. Those facing inflation tend to choose cryptos over the traditional currency because of its decentralized system. This is probably one of the reasons why the inflation rate in Ghana has been decreasing for a couple of years!\n\nHence, it\u2019s clear why more and more Ghanaians are getting interested in cryptocurrency. Logically speaking, it indeed is convenient for economies like the one Ghana has. The whole of Africa is perfect to adopt this system. Most importantly, one doesn\u2019t need to buy cryptocurrencies. One can even invest in cryptocurrencies as well. The best thing is, buying or selling things in exchange for cryptos is becoming popular day by day. Some sellers sell commodities or other kinds of stuff, and in exchange, they charge in cryptocurrencies. Finance giants like Paypal have started a new section, where they allow transactions via cryptocurrency. Undoubtedly, this sector is full of potential, and that justifies so many Ghanaians adopting this interesting mode of the transaction!\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 AfricaBusiness.com - All materials can be used freely, indicating the origin AfricaBusiness.com Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

        "title": "Bitcoin starts new geometric cycle; $150k within reach? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In line with the sentiment on the general cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) has been seen slowly consolidating from its bullish movements that started at the turn of the year, but some signs indicate the possibility of a parabolic rally in the future.\n\nAs it happens, Bitcoin has recently started a new geometric cycle, which suggests that there is a chance its price could soar to as high as $150,000, according to the detailed examination of its current activities by the cryptocurrency analytics team TradingShot using the finance tracking website TradingView published on January 31.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nAs they explained, Bitcoin has been seen \u201caggressively rebounding,\u201d after the logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) on the one-week time-frame hit and bounced on its historic support that formed the 2015 and 2018 cycle bottoms, suggesting a new bull cycle has started.\n\nIllustrated by the geometric shapes from bottom to top and accompanied by the indicators, including the Ichimoku Cloud and Fibonacci moving averages (MA), the resulting pattern appears for the possible Bitcoin movements from Tuesday, January 31 onward.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis and predictions. Source: TradingShot/TradingView\n\nAs the analysts explained:\n\n\u201cFirst, consider that the next cycle bottom could be around October 2026 if the (approximately) 1,430-day (205-week) time range holds. The next (and final, according to this model) bullish confirmation of the new cycle is the price entering the (red) Ichimoku Cloud.\u201d\n\nSix-figure predictions align\n\nAccording to the team, \u201cwhen this happened in June 2012, October 2015, and May 2019, the bull cycle never looked back (an obvious exception, of course, is the March 2020 crash due to COVID).\u201d Furthermore, a break above multiple three of the Fib MAs will most likely kickstart the parabolic rally (but most likely, this will be after halving 4), as it has done during all previous bull cycles.\u201d\n\nTaking into account the plotting of the past cycles, this geometric adjustment places them \u201cfairly easily\u201d within the projected current one, and the experts add that \u201cwe should see the next cycle top around August 2025.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the above analysis goes in hand with the predictions of Bloomberg\u2019s senior commodity expert Mike McGlone, who earlier said on January 30 that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 sometime around the next halving or by 2025, as Finbold reported.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is currently changing hands at the price of $23,068, which represents a decrease of 0.11% in the last 24 hours but nonetheless an increase of 0.36%, and a more significant 39.46% gain over the previous month.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIt is also important to note that the maiden crypto has been profitable for its holders almost 90% of the time in its traded history, as it recorded close to 4,000 profitable days in nearly 12 and a half years, thanks to the aggressive adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Established in 1695, it is one of the oldest British banks. Today, it offers a wide range of banking and financial services to both individuals and businesses.\n\nBank of Scotland\u2019s homepage.

However, customers can use their Bank of Scotland online banking account to deposit or withdraw funds from regulated crypto brokers without worrying about the bank freezing their account.\n\nShould I invest in Bitcoin and crypto?\n\nWhether investing in Bitcoin and crypto right now is a good idea depends largely on your personal risk tolerance, investment style, and financial goals. Investing in digital currencies does have the potential to generate profits; however, it also carries a high risk due to its volatile nature.\n\nDespite its risks, the pros of investing in cryptocurrencies include:\n\nDiversification: Including Bitcoin in your investment portfolio can help spread risk through diversification. Bitcoin\u2019s price movements have demonstrated a relatively low correlation with asset classes like stocks and bonds; The potential for future growth: Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth and appreciation in value. Its limited supply attracts investors looking for price appreciation; New technology: Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, offering multiple possible applications besides digital currencies; Privacy: Cryptocurrencies provide more privacy than traditional financial systems, as transactions are associated with cryptographic addresses rather than real-world identities; Alternative to traditional financial systems: Bitcoin operates independently of centralized regulatory bodies like governments or banks. It utilizes a decentralized blockchain network, providing more freedom and reducing reliance on traditional financial systems; Accessibility: Bitcoin and other digital currencies offer more accessibility and cost-effectiveness for international fund transfers. Traditional wire transfer costs associated with fiat currencies are absent; Markets are open 24/7: Unlike traditional financial markets like stock markets with fixed trading hours, crypto markets allow investors in different countries and time zones to participate in the market as they operate around the clock.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that the value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, much more than more traditional and established assets like stocks or bonds.\n\nBitcoin price today\n\nPrice volatility is nothing new to the crypto space. Two of the largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, have witnessed significant price drops. However, since the considerable decline in value in 2022, the price of Bitcoin has stabilized.\n\nHow to buy crypto safely\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have become widely popular, it\u2019s worth remembering that they have only been around for just over a decade. As such, they are considered a much riskier investment than stocks or commodities, and you need to be brave to enter these uncharted waters as an investor.\n\nIn addition, although FCA-licensed crypto brokers are required to have anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing procedures in place, crypto assets themselves are not regulated in the UK. In fact, with most cryptocurrencies, investors are unlikely to have access to protections from the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if something were to go wrong.\n\nTips for starting out with crypto\n\nFortunately, there are steps you can take to ensure you\u2019re being careful when buying crypto. So, let\u2019s look at a few tips on what you should do when getting started with digital assets and how to best protect yourself and your hard-earned cash:\n\nResearch the cryptocurrency you want to buy: Make sure you understand how it works and what the risks are;\n\nMake sure you understand how it works and what the risks are; Only use a safe device: Avoid public computers and Wi-Fi networks.

        "content": "Despite the success and mainstream popularity that the cryptocurrency sector and the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset have achieved so far, notable critics have continued to declare Bitcoin (BTC) worthless, including four times in 2023.\n\nIndeed, these critics, which include individuals with a significant following or sites with substantial traffic, have declared Bitcoin \u2018dead\u2019 471 times so far, according to the data retrieved by Finbold from cryptocurrency information platform 99bitcoins on February 1.\n\nBitcoin 30-day obituaries vs. price chart.

It\u2019s the IT version of what Bernie Madoff did in a mutual fund fraud in New York City in the 1980s and \u201890s, which was the greatest Ponzi scheme of all time \u2212 until now.\u201d\n\nOther eulogies include \u2018Bitcoin is a hyped-up fraud\u2019 by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on January 19, \u2018Bitcoin will go negative\u2019 by geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan during The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on January 7. On January 6, TV personality Jim Cramer and former attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) John Reed Stark stated that \u2018Crypto is one big hussle.\u2019\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin was also declared dead at the height of its success on November 8, 2021, when it was changing hands at $67,567.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry has started the new year on a bullish note, although it has been consolidating slightly in recent days. Senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone shared his views on the future of the market and its representative asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIndeed, McGlone admitted that he was not yet bullish on cryptocurrencies in the short term, but that Bitcoin could reach six figures in the next couple of years, as he told Scott Melker, a.k.a. Wolf of All Streets, in an interview published on January 30.\n\nCommenting on the market movements in general, he explained that:\n\n\u201cThe correlations have all gone almost one-to-one, certainly on the way down and bounced back up this year, and the key leading indicator has been crypto. So with that view, I just can\u2019t get bullish on cryptos yet in the short term.\u201d\n\nAs for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, McGlone has retained his well-known optimistic attitude for the long term, previously stating that Bitcoin could outperform gold as its top competitor in the future. According to him:\n\n\u201cI fully expect Bitcoin in the next couple of years, by probably around the halving, maybe 2025, to get to $100,000.\u201d\n\nCrypto shakeout = long-term success?\n\nMcGlone added that the recent \u201cmassive shakeout in the crypto market has cleansed it,\u201d getting \u201crid of some of the bad players, and unfortunately, some innocents get hurt,\u201d reiterating that this \u201creally cleanses the market for a good longer-term run,\u201d which, as he said, wasn\u2019t witnessed in the stock market.\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin, its fourth halving event, which is set to take place in May 2024, further halving the award of every block created to 3.125 BTC apiece, is widely regarded as a critical event that could trigger a significant upward pump for the price of the maiden crypto.\n\nIn December, the commodities expert also predicted a \u2018warm spell\u2019 for Bitcoin, suggesting it would resume its rally in 2023 and potentially outperform the financial markets, under the influence of the Federal Reserve pivoting to easing its aggressive monetary policy.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, at the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at the price of $22,898, which represents a decline of 0.39% on the day and 0.38% over the previous week but still a notable gain of 38.44% compared to 30 days before, according to the data retrieved on January 31.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, it is also worth noting that Bitcoin was profitable for its holders nearly 90% of the time since it started trading, recording 3,984 profitable days out of 4,545 (close to 12 and a half years), fueled by the asset\u2019s aggressive adoption, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
