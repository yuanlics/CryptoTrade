        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted conspiracy theorist, vaccine skeptic, and Democratic candidate for president, is an undisputed fan of Bitcoin. And on Tuesday, Kennedy, who recently was condemned by his very own family for claiming that COVID-19 was engineered to target certain ethnic groups, unveiled two policy proposals to further endear himself to fans of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nSpeaking virtually during an event hosted by Heal the Divide, a super PAC with ties to far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green and embattled Rep. George Santos, Kennedy said that he both wants to \u201cexempt the conversion of Bitcoin to the U.S. dollar from capital gains taxes\u201d as well as \u201cback the U.S. dollar with real finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe said the two policy proposals would be part of his \u201cadministration\u2019s mission of making America the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe continued boosterism of Bitcoin from the presidential candidate, whose uncle was President John F. Kennedy, follows recent news that Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s family trust had between $100,000 and $250,000 in the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. (The investment generated an income of less than $201.)\n\nHis family\u2019s Bitcoin investment pales in comparison to the millions of dollars he and other members of the political dynasty have in real estate, cash, and other assets; however, Kennedy said during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, the first public appearance of his campaign, that he \u201cnot an investor\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t onstage \u201cto give investment advice.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy\u2019s campaign previously told Fortune that \u201cMr. Kennedy\u2019s investments in Bitcoin were made AFTER he made his speech and BEFORE the June 30th reporting deadline. There is no conflict.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate is not the only high-profile politician to hold and boost Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate for president, owns up to $300,000 in Bitcoin and Ether, has invested in crypto firms MoonPay and Shipyard Software, and said he will accept donations to his campaign in Bitcoin. And Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and another Republican presidential hopeful, also has put his weight behind the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Kuwait\u2019s capital markets regulator banned bitcoin mining this week as they reiterated prohibitions on crypto activities.\n\nThe prohibition came down via an official circular released on Tuesday. Kuwaiti authorities had previously only expressed disapproval of crypto payments.\n\nAs early as 2017, the local regulator had warned banks and other intermediaries that crypto wasn\u2019t legal tender and prohibited institutions from handling digital assets.\n\nKuwait is now reinforcing restrictions on institutions and other payment services touching crypto, but so far it seems to have stopped short of outright criminalizing interactions with crypto for individuals.\n\nStill, regulators stated the use of crypto as a form of payment is strictly prohibited, and residents are advised against engaging in any transactions involving cryptocurrency.\n\nBut until now, the regulatory status of crypto mining had been ambiguous. The recent circular changes that.\n\nKuwait shuns crypto as neighbors open arms\n\nBitcoin mining is a resource-intensive process, requiring specialized equipment and substantial energy consumption \u2014 so low energy costs can greatly impact profitability.\n\nGauging realistic costs of mining bitcoin is difficult. Large-scale operations are often vertically integrated with their own power sources, or have specialized deals for cheaper rates, which can bring down costs.\n\nStill, estimates have previously dubbed Kuwait the most affordable location to mine bitcoin (BTC) worldwide. One roundup suggested the cost of mining in Kuwait was just $1,400 per BTC in 2022 compared to more than $18,000 in Texas (bitcoin was worth more than $40,000 at the time).\n\nLocal reports indicated some crypto miners had exploited Kuwait\u2019s low electricity tariffs by disconnecting home cooling devices in favor of mining rigs to avoid drawing suspicion with high electricity usage.\n\nThe Ministry of Electricity and Water reportedly took measures to curb such practices, including cutting off power supplies.\n\nBitcoin mining aside, Kuwait regulators emphasized that they\u2019re banned from granting licenses to entities for the purpose of offering crypto services as a commercial enterprise.\n\nThe capital markets authority warned that any violation of this regulation would be subject to penalties in accordance with the rules pertaining to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn contrast, neighboring Dubai has taken a more inclusive stance towards crypto, positioning itself as an attractive destination for the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Dubai\u2019s \u201ccrypto zone\u201d had already attracted over 500 crypto companies.\n\nMore specific to mining, major outfit Marathon recently pledged to open two facilities in nearby Abu Dhabi.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The CEO and Founder of financial advisory, asset management and fintech organisation deVere Group, Nigel Green, says the price of Bitcoin is set to soar.\n\nThis is based on a belief that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will imminently approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhy spot ETFs could boost Bitcoin\u2019s value\n\nSpot ETFs allow for investment in underlying assets \u2013 usually stocks or bonds \u2013 at the current market or \u2018spot\u2019 price, replicating a particular asset class or performance by giving investors a portfolio of the actual securities that make up a particular asset class/index.\n\nSimilar to a mutual fund, ETFs differ in that they are bought and sold from other owners on stock exchanges as opposed to purchases from the issuer.\n\nEssentially a way to hedge your investments across multiple companies of a particular industry, the question remains: why could the regulation of spot Bitcoin ETFs boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s value?\n\ndeVere\u2019s Green offers four reasons: \u201cFirst, a Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning or trading the cryptocurrency. Such increased accessibility for both can lead to a larger pool of potential investors entering the market, driving up demand for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cSecond, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF will undoubtedly attract institutional investors who have strict regulatory requirements and risk management policies. They\u2019ll bring with them capital, expertise and clout.\n\n\u201cThird, ETFs are traded on established stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of trading. This liquidity will attract more traders and increase market efficiency, reducing price volatility. As such, increased liquidity and market efficiency can positively impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cAnd fourth, a Bitcoin ETF will generate significant mainstream attention and media coverage which will drive up demand and prices in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nThe path to spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently unapproved, the SEC has, for the first time, acknowledged the applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity, BlackRock and Bitwise, adding the request from regulated spot trading to the Federal Register.\n\nIt is usually a 45-day review process, and application requests can stretch as long as 240 days. So, while ETF traders will be hoping for a quick resolution, the result of these applications may stretch out longer than usual.\n\n\n\nA stretched review for spot Bitcoin ETF regulation may be more likely than in other cases, given the current temperature from crypto trading assets at the SEC, following the Ripple case over its XRP cryptocurrency."

The possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. looks far more likely since BlackRock submitted an application to list one with a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d agreement, which the SEC sees as necessary to prevent market manipulation."

But inflation increased to 0.6% for housing, from 0.5% in May, according to Hong Kong\u2019s statistics department.\n\nMost U.S. stock futures fell during Thursday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both declined.\n\nOn the corporate front, Netflix shares tumbled 8% on lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Investors now await earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories, scheduled for release later today.\n\nInvestors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on monetary policy on July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nRobert Kennedy wants to back the US Dollar with \u2018hard currencies\u2019\n\nHow Kennedy plans to fight off inflation with gold and Bitcoin\n\nWhy was the US Dollar removed from the gold standard?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential candidate is doing the rounds for his campaign. Among his main talking points is his strong support for Bitcoin as a legible form of payment within the US.\n\nBesides being a Bitcoin holder, Kennedy Jr. sees the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential as a way to stabilize the value of the US dollar and counteract the rampant inflation occurring in the nation.\n\nDuring the Heal-the-Divide PAC event on July 19th, Kennedy Jr. discussed the potential for Bitcoin, alongside gold and silver, as backing for the US dollar, claiming it\u2019s a \u2018hard currency\u2019.\n\nBitcoin Is The Future Of Finance, Says Kennedy Jr.\n\n\u201cThe Kennedy administration will begin to back the US dollar with real finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin, which is the world\u2019s hardest liquid asset, to strengthen the US dollar and guarantee its success as a world reserve currency,\u201d said Kennedy Jr. during his Heal-the-Divide PAC virtual event.\n\nThe Democrat presidential candidate is an avid supporter of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, as a viable payment and investment option in the US. RFK has reportedly invested over $250,000 in Bitcoin, which is a sign that he personally supports the crypto token movement, not just a presidential campaign gimmick.\n\nHowever, RFK\u2019s speech floated more than just the idea of stabilizing the value of the US dollar using Bitcoin and precious metals.\n\n\u201cBacking dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation, and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nKennedy Jr. also talked about the idea of removing taxes when converting Bitcoin to fiat USD. The idea is to remove the financial barrier for individual investors to invest in Bitcoin and altcoins by creating a seamless financial environment without overcharging fees. On top of that, RFK is a strong supporter of creating individual crypto wallets and home-based crypto nodes that would provide Americans with freedom over their finances, eliminating the threat of governments \u201ccontrolling freedom of speech using the threat of inflation\u201d.\n\nAs president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable. Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rPkMARieYu \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) June 27, 2023\n\nIs Relying On \u2018Hard Currencies\u2019 A Good Idea?\n\nThe US Dollar was removed from the gold standard back in 1971 by President Nixon as part of an economic movement now known as the Nixon Shock. Ever since, the US never fully returned to a fixed exchange rate system or a strict gold standard. The US dollar has since been a fiat currency, meaning that its value is based on trade activities and international demand.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that there have been some subsequent efforts to reintroduce aspects of the gold standard or alternative systems with ties to gold, including the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971, and the Jamaica Agreement in 1976.\n\nHowever, all attempts made by various politicians, economists, and advocates have failed to return the fiat currency to a fixed gold standard.\n\nIt\u2019s rather unorthodox to include Bitcoin in a list of \u2018hard currencies\u2019 that include gold and platinum as financial instruments to support the US dollar\u2019s value. The main reason behind that is that the inflation-adjusted return of gold annually has been about 3.3%, and the total return has been about 57%. At the same time, Bitcoin has an inflation-adjusted annualized return of nearly 145% and a total return of 33,983,965%.\n\nGold and other precious metals may seem like an outdated form of currency valuation, but it holds the advantage of longevity. The value of precious metals does fluctuate, but often by minute percentages, simply because it has been tried and tested for countless years.\n\nBitcoin and altcoins, on the other hand, are relatively infant value deposits. Hence, these tokens tend to fluctuate in value in far larger margins.\n\nGranted Bitcoin\u2019s future does look to be more secure since the involvement of major financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who promise to \u201cdemocratize crypto\u201d, perhaps leading to a potentially more stable financial future."

        "title": "Ben McKenzie needs a hug: The \u2018OC\u2019 star\u2019s crypto book is an ill-informed flop - Fortune",
        "content": "You probably remember Ben McKenzie as the 27-year-old playing a 17-year-old on the early aughts soap opera \u201cThe O.C.\u201d (Just kidding. If you\u2019re reading the Fortune Crypto beat, odds are you were watching Survivor during that time slot.) Anyway, by Ben\u2019s account, during the COVID-19 pandemic he took some bad financial advice from a friend, smoked legal marijuana, and came up with the idea to write a cryptocurrency book called Easy Money as he lost over $200,000 in the market.\n\nLord, grant me this much confidence in the face of failure.\n\nEven without knowing the backstory, the many contradictions and half-baked arguments suggest this book grew out of a stoned idea. McKenzie claims, for instance, that Bitcoin is only owned by a small set of people and repeatedly compares crypto to the most recent banking crisis that devastated the global housing market. He makes an unintentionally credible defense that cryptocurrencies are not securities: \u201cCryptos aren\u2019t tied to anything of real value, unlike shares in a company or a commodities future. They\u2019re computer code uncorrelated with any actual asset.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have put it better myself!\n\nMcKenzie likes to mock online cryptocurrency believers for using the word \u201ccommunity\u201d when they only share a \u201cutopian vision of financial freedom,\u201d but takes great pains to laud his own legitimate \u201ccommunity\u201d of skeptics who have dorm room-style conversations over beers. There\u2019s a constant insistence that cryptocurrencies have no use case while citing capital flight from authoritarian regimes and war-torn regions. McKenzie also can\u2019t seem to decide if FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is a PR genius or a bumbling weirdo.\n\nEasy Money does touch on many valid criticisms of the cryptocurrency industry. McKenzie is correct that the prevailing crypto culture revels in conspiratorial thinking and has more than a tinge of misogyny and anti-semitism. He\u2019s correct to note that many Bitcoin \u201cmaxis\u201d are happy to embrace authoritarians who embrace the token. Likewise, the crypto industry does provide leverage to unsophisticated actors who get fleeced by established traders, while both crypto exchanges and venture capitalists are rife with conflicts of interests. These aren\u2019t novel observations, but they are fair. I wish McKenzie had expanded upon them, rather than rushing to paint everything with vague accusations of fraud. Brief encounters with industry folks later found to be fraudsters\u2014not found by McKenzie, of course\u2014get more airtime than technical explanations that would be more useful to a general audience.\n\nThere are also numerous mischaracterizations within the book that point to either shoddy editing or insufficiencies in McKenzie\u2019s decades-old BA in economics\u2014the poor sheepskin is mentioned so often that it feels like a character in the book\u2014to explain cryptocurrencies. I dispute McKenzie\u2019s basic definition of a cryptocurrency wallet, his confusing characterization of FDIC insurance, his understanding of smart contracts, and his market research on crypto fees. The one section of the book that comes off even less believable than an alleged encounter with drunken CIA officers is his account of a hypothetical Bitcoin OTC trade with a 60% haircut. (Girl, those are 2009 numbers!)\n\nMy real beef, though, is with the bitterness that seeps through the book\u2019s pages. McKenzie\u2019s contempt for anyone sympathetic to the book\u2019s subject matter only serves to clarify why he\u2019s so befuddled by it. To him, no crypto-enthusiast could possibly have a credible intellectual defense for their position, rather they\u2019re just all \u201cboosters\u201d (a potentially interesting historical concept to define, which the author doesn\u2019t) or na\u00effs. Basic terms from economics are defined with snarky graphs, while more sophisticated activities like ETF market-making are characterized in a single line as akin to \u201cplaying video games.\u201d McKenzie mocks emerging markets for their potential to host technical innovation hubs and makes pains to paint \u201cpeople of color\u201d as unsophisticated victims, inexplicably highlighting the ones gifted Bitcoin by Jay-Z.\n\nAnother reason to avoid Easy Money is the final third of the book, which is a wordy report of things like Twitter feuds that took place late last year as the FTX exchange and the TerraLuna \u201cstablecoin\u201d saw their chickens come home to roost. It\u2019s lazy. McKenzie should have tried to coauthor with Dirty Bubble Media, a Twitter account manned by someone with the actual hustle to unearth some of the sinews connecting the cryptocurrency world\u2019s nasty underbelly.\n\nSome people have the chutzpah to call out bullshit when they see it, even at great risk. Others wait 10 months to write a seething account of how \u201caverage Joes\u201d making money convinced them that they should examine the global financial system for the first time. It\u2019s a pity the wrong party wrote this book.\n\nAnd, my goodness, could the timing be worse? McKenzie\u2019s assured claim that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities was upended by last week\u2019s court ruling in the case SEC v. Ripple. Meanwhile, the excesses of the last crypto bubble have long since popped and the market seems to be renewing after a period of deleveraging. The time to write a warning or a screed based on the instability of the market was July 2022.\n\nThe next time I see McKenzie and his Emmy-award winning film crew at something like a near empty SXSW panel, I will offer him a hug. The one thing this book convinced me of is that he needs one.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "content": "Ben McKenzie is an unlikely anti-crypto crusader. The actor is best known for his role as a teen heartthrob on The O.C., which is not exactly a harbinger of technological or economic rigor.\n\nBut McKenzie also has an economics Bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Virginia, and has studied the long history of financial frauds around the world. Based on that foundation of knowledge, McKenzie became obsessed with crypto\u2019s rise in 2021, convinced that it was little more than a house of cards that would inevitably topple.\n\nThat August, McKenzie reached out to the journalist Jacob Silverman and proposed collaborating together on crypto journalism that would expose its potential dangers and seedy underbelly. McKenzie believed he could wield his public profile to add some nuance to a crypto discourse that mostly surfed high on optimism and euphoria.\n\n\u201cI told Jacob: \u2018If I have a superpower, it\u2019s as a mid-level celebrity and econ dork,'\u201d McKenzie recounted in an interview over the phone with TIME. \u201cThose two skills don\u2019t often overlap. But they seemed to be potentially particularly powerful here, because crypto had gathered up so much momentum with the help of lots of people pouring money into it, that it was drowning out other voices. If there\u2019s one thing I felt like I knew how to do, it was to make a little splash\u2014quite frankly because I\u2019m a public person\u2014but also explain economic concepts relatively simply.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie and Silverman co-published several articles together, including in the Washington Post. This week, they released the book Easy Money, a culmination of their reporting which traces crypto\u2019s stunning recent rise and fall. McKenzie interrogated leaders of crypto who have since been arrested\u2014including FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius\u2019s Alex Mashinsky\u2014and traveled to El Salvador to monitor their mostly disastrous Bitcoin experiment. Many crypto enthusiasts argue that the current lull in prices is temporary, and that Bitcoin rises upwards in a cyclical pattern. McKenzie and Silverman, in contrast, make that case that crypto\u2019s downfall last year was inevitable, and that its markets rest on unsustainable economic models. \u201cThe system was so fragile, and based on such faulty economics, that mass liquidations and bank runs and all manner of contagion were practically expected,\u201d they write in the book.\n\nMcKenzie spoke to TIME about Hollywood\u2019s embrace of crypto, his strange encounter with Bankman-Fried and his response to pro-crypto critics of the book.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nHow does crypto\u2019s rise and fall in the last few years mirror a long history of financial bubbles?\n\nThe title of the book is Easy Money. When people can get money easily\u2014either directly, in the case of COVID stimulus payments or in the form of credit\u2014they have incentives to gamble with it. It\u2019s basically free money, so you might as well try to see if you can get a return.\n\nThe line between investing and gambling is quite fuzzy. Some of the things people invest in, or gamble on, are truly innovative technologies that actually do change things. And those people make a lot of money. But some of them are fraud. Charles Kindleberger is an economic historian who studied this extensively.\n\nOnce I understood that essential element\u2014that this followed a long history of bubbles\u2014it made a lot more sense why crypto took off like wildfire in a particular time period: during the easy money time period after the global financial crisis, and then after COVID hit and the government pumped trillions of dollars into the economy. There was just so much money flooding around looking for a home that it was pretty natural that people would gamble with it.\n\nCrypto advocates often argue that crypto will help developing nations. During your reporting, you traveled to El Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. What did you learn about crypto\u2019s impact on the people it was supposed to be helping?\n\nThat was a real eye opener. The pro-crypto argument I was most sympathetic to was that there are other countries where their currencies are much more unstable, and there are people who lack access to banking. Potentially, cryptocurrency could provide a bridge for those people.\n\nBut the things I had been told in the abstract were not true, at least in El Salvador. The day that the law went into effect, the price of Bitcoin crashed 10% in hours. The Chivo wallet system didn\u2019t work: Every citizen was given $30, but a lot of people were immediately defrauded. Someone took a picture of their dog still got $30, so the system was not exactly tightly run.\n\nBy the time I\u2019d gotten there around 9 months later, it was basically being ignored. Less than 2% of remittances were using Chivo wallets, according to their Central Bank\u2019s own figures.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like crypto was being used as a vehicle of corruption for a quasi-authoritarian state. El Salvador has the highest incarceration rate in the world. And so it\u2019s deeply ironic to me that the only place where this quote-unquote currency\u2014that was supposed to be democratizing and decentralizing\u2014was also a place that was locking people up on meaningless charges. That felt deeply ironic.\n\nRead More: Why El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Is Doubling Down on Bitcoin Despite the Crypto Crash\n\nHaving been part of entertainment industry for so long, why do you think Hollywood was so susceptible to the crypto and NFT boom?\n\nThe easy money was very appealing to Hollywood. Also, crypto is just a story, of how these things are going to do all this amazing stuff they don\u2019t actually do. Where better to sell that story than the land of storytelling, and tell it through the most famous people on earth?\n\nEconomically, it\u2019s a good fit for the parties involved. But it\u2019s not such a good fit for the people that end up buying these worthless links to JPEGs.\n\nYou were able to score a one-on-one interview with FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been criminally charged with fraud among other allegations. In your interview, did you sense an aura or a charisma that Sam seemed to captivate the rest of the world?\n\nI think what Sam did brilliantly was cut against what we think of as the profile of a fraudster. We think of older, tough men who project an aura of uber-confidence and slickness.\n\nSam cut the other way. He\u2019s this kid who always wore a t-shirt and cargo shorts. If you didn\u2019t know who he was, you\u2019d think, \u2018He\u2019s a kid who\u2019s coming in to fix my computer, or like, is hanging out on message boards.\u2019 And so it forces you to go, \u2018Well, he must be brilliant because he clearly doesn\u2019t care about the way he looks. He\u2019s not fitting into some Wall Street stereotype of a really wealthy person.\u2019\n\nBut as soon as we started talking, I found the actual substance of his answers, or lack thereof, really quite shocking. I really had a hard time getting to anything that resembled true conversations of the merits of crypto that he could articulate in a real way.\n\nI asked him, \u2018Show me one company that does anything that\u2019s useful here.\u2019 He initially said remittances, but I had just come back from El Salvador. So I called bull on that. We went around again, and he named Solana. But he happened to own a lot of that currency\u2013and Solana breaks down all the time. He was advocating for it while potentially just pumping his bags.\n\nAnswers like that really left me aghast. It\u2019s one thing for Joe Schmo on the floor of the Miami Bitcoin conference to say stuff like that. But for Sam, it was shocking, because he\u2019s supposedly the titan. I left not knowing what to feel, but feeling very unsettled.\n\nRead More: Where Did FTX\u2019s Missing $8 Billion Go? Crypto Investigators Offer New Clues\n\nJournalists more sympathetic to crypto have unsurprisingly criticized the book in the last few weeks. Brady Dale wrote in an Axios newsletter: \u201cIt\u2019s a book where the two writers knew their conclusion before they did any reporting.\u201d Would you like to respond?\n\nWe knew that it was one of the biggest frauds in history. Then we did 2 years of reporting and found out that was true. If that\u2019s your \u2018gotcha,\u2019 okay. I guess we\u2019re pretty smart, then. We certainly found a lot of fraud.\n\nCoinDesk\u2019s Daniel Kuhn called you a \u201chypocrite\u201d for writing this book after placing a $250,000 bet against crypto, arguing that your crusade against crypto is \u201cessentially the same type of arrangement that McKenzie often criticized others [including Kim Kardashian] for.\u201d\n\nI put my money where my mouth was. I was trying to warn people there was a lot of fraud, and that I suspected it was a bubble. Whether people heard that or not is really not up to me. But I wasn\u2019t out there potentially selling unregistered, unlicensed securities. I was warning people it would go belly up, I thought\u2014and sure enough, it did."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining is becoming more environmentally friendly - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining\u2019s environmental impact has always been a controversial topic. On the one hand, critics emphasize that securing the Bitcoin network takes more power than some whole countries\u2019 annual electricity consumption. On the other hand, much of the crypto community argues that it is a necessary activity that has enabled the Bitcoin blockchain to remain extremely resilient against external attacks with an almost 99.99% uptime throughout over 14 years of its history.\n\nHowever, recent developments in the market have provided an opportunity for participants to make Bitcoin mining finally sustainable.\n\nBitcoin mining doesn\u2019t deserve its bad reputation\n\nBefore going over the benefits themselves, it\u2019s essential to first get some facts straight about Bitcoin mining. With comparisons to nations\u2019 energy consumption and estimates that a single BTC transaction has a carbon footprint of nearly 820,000 Visa transactions, it should be highlighted that this activity doesn\u2019t actually produce any emissions.\n\nBitcoin energy consumption, February 2017-July 2023. Source: BitcoinEnergyConsumption.com\n\nInstead, this \u201cdirty work\u201d is done by the power plants that supply the electricity to the mining rigs. Similarly to households or other business entities, miners only use the electrical infrastructure that exists in any given location.\n\nEver since Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin payments in May 2021, citing environmental concerns, many have jumped on the bandwagon to criticize the blockchain network\u2019s energy consumption. However, while it is important to address Bitcoin mining\u2019s high electricity usage, it should not be done in a vacuum, as it is not the only power-hungry industry out there.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Mining Council, BTC mining consumes only a fraction of the energy required to power industries, such as construction (3.77%), finance and insurance (4.45%), shipping (5.41%) and aviation (5.43%). It even takes nearly 2.6 times the electricity to mine gold than to secure the Bitcoin network. And that\u2019s without even discussing the disposal of electronic devices, as well as the agriculture and livestock industries, which are among those with the most significant environmental footprints.\n\nConsidering the above, it seems unfair to point out Bitcoin mining\u2019s high electricity usage without mentioning how much power other industries consume each day.\n\nMining is becoming an increasingly sustainable industry\n\nDespite controversies around the topic, the fact remains that it takes a significant amount of electricity to secure and maintain the Bitcoin network. The question is how to make Bitcoin more sustainable.\n\nOne solution would be to combine Bitcoin mining with other business activities in a beneficial manner. For example, hydro-cooling mining farms can supply heat to greenhouses, fish farms, buildings and even entire communities. While only eight WhatsMiners are needed to warm a 10,000-square-foot greenhouse, increasing water temperature by 10 degrees Celsius via mining rigs can shorten the period of growth of salmon in fish farms by up to three times. Another potential use case includes developing small hydropower plants to co-consume electricity with local communities.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nUsing associated petroleum gas (APG) to power Bitcoin mining rigs is also a key highlight in this field. As you may already know, APG is a byproduct of oil drilling. As it is not always worthwhile for producers to use it, they regularly burn it on-site. The latter process is called gas flaring, which led to 2.7 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2021, along with the gas wasted in venting and methane leaks.\n\nInstead of wasting this resource, Bitcoin miners can transform APG into energy to power their rigs. By preventing flarings, this activity can have a favorable effect on the environment. In fact, a report revealed that Bitcoin mining can decrease the percentage of flared gas by each oil producer by 80%.\n\nAt the same time, researchers have also found that it is by far the most cost-efficient way to decrease emissions, surpassing the values of wind and solar by multiple times. This is probably why many smaller oil and gas companies in the United States are mining BTC with flared gas.\n\nThe road to a greener Bitcoin\n\nAs Bitcoin miners have been migrating to countries where they have access to cheaper energy in the form of renewables, this has presented an opportunity for market participants to increase the industry\u2019s sustainability.\n\nWith initiatives like preventing gas flaring and combining it with other business activities, the long-term goal is to make Bitcoin mining eco-friendly. Ideally, every industry should become as sustainable as possible while minimizing the harm caused to the environment. Putting in effort to make this possible is what being responsible market participants is about.\n\nBitcoin mining is already doing a lot to transform the energy sector due to miners being very flexible in their electricity consumption. And as this industry\u2019s sustainability improves in the years ahead, it will attract many large-scale investors who are interested in investing in eco-friendly businesses.\n\nDidar Bekbauov is the CEO of Bitcoin mining company Xive, which he co-founded in 2019.

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does It Work? - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Bitcoin mining is the process of adding and verifying blocks of transactions to Bitcoin\u2019s public blockchain.\n\nBitcoin uses the \u201cproof of work\u201d consensus mechanism, which demands commitment from miners in the form of expensive mining hardware and electricity.\n\nMiners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle, and are rewarded with newly-minted Bitcoin.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which blocks of transactions are added to the public blockchain and verified. It\u2019s also the process by which new Bitcoin is created\u2014a mechanism that both secures the integrity of the blockchain and incentivizes participation in the network.\n\nMiners compete to add new blocks to the blockchain. Mining Bitcoin demands a substantial commitment on the part of miners; it\u2019s a costly, time-consuming task, and one that\u2019s necessary for the cryptocurrency to work and for people to have faith in its legitimacy.\n\nOver a decade since Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, most people have heard of mining. But what does it really mean\u2014and how do you go about mining Bitcoin?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nMining Bitcoin isn\u2019t like digging for gold or coal deep underground. It refers to verifying the transactions made using Bitcoin. Miners are those individuals or companies that sustain and audit the blockchain network that supports the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey do so by completing \"blocks\" of verified transactions, which are added to the blockchain; when a miner completes a block, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.\n\nDid you know? Approximately every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is halved, an event known (unsurprisingly) as the \u201chalving\u201d. In May 2020, the block reward dropped from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC.\n\nMining for Bitcoin isn\u2019t as cheap as it once was, but this still doesn\u2019t prevent investors from carrying out this activity. The block reward of Bitcoin is the incentive that powers cryptocurrency transactions through legitimizing and monitoring the network. Because this responsibility is carried out by many users throughout the world, Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning that it relies on no central authority such as a government or bank for its trustworthiness.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin need miners?\n\nMining is, in effect, a process of auditing and verifying Bitcoin transactions to prevent the problem of \u201cdouble spending\u201d. Double spending is where someone with cryptocurrency tries to spend the same coin twice. With physical currency, you can\u2019t buy a drink in a pub with a \u00a320 note and then pop to the shops to buy some groceries with the same \u00a320 note.\n\nWith cryptocurrency, there is a risk that someone with Bitcoin could make a copy of that Bitcoin and send that to a merchant instead of the real thing. In the real world, the cashier looks at a \u00a320 note to ensure it is not fake\u2014and this is what Bitcoin miners are trying to do with cryptocurrency; they are checking to ensure that a transaction has not been made twice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the process of Bitcoin mining and what can you do with it?\n\nBitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof of work.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin works as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f A miner\u2019s computer, called a node, collects and packages individual Bitcoin transactions from the last ten minutes into a block.\n\n\ud83d\udda7 This node competes with other nodes in the network to solve a complicated cryptographic problem to be the first to validate the new block for the blockchain.\n\n\ud83d\udce1 The first miner to solve the problem broadcasts their success to the entire network.\n\n\ud83e\uddee Other nodes then check if their solution is correct. If correct, the new block is added to the blockchain and the whole process starts again.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 As the miner was first to solve the problem, it gets rewarded with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining hardware runs a cryptographic hashing function on a block header.\n\nWhat that means is that each miner creates a \u201ccandidate block\u201d with unconfirmed transactions from the node\u2019s memory pool, or mempool. This block includes a block header that summarizes the data inside the block, along with a reference to an existing block in the blockchain and a nonce (\u201cnumber only used once\u201d). In Bitcoin, the nonce is a whole number somewhere between 0 and 4,294,967,296.\n\nThis block header is then put through the SHA256 hash function; if the resulting number is higher than the current target hash, the miner adjusts the nonce and tries again. Miners do this many thousands of times per second. The difficulty target is a 256-bit number; it is adjusted every 2016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), to ensure that a block is mined on average once every 10 minutes.\n\nWhen a lucky miner\u2019s hash function spits out a result that\u2019s lower than the current target hash, the block is broadcast to the network. Each node checks that the block header hashes to meet the target, and if confirmed the newly mined block is added to the blockchain. The miner receives a reward of Bitcoin; this transaction, which creates new Bitcoin out of thin air, is known as the \u201ccoinbase transaction\u201d and is included in the candidate block.\n\nThese rewards serve to incentivize participation and keep things running smoothly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rate at which coins are issued is set by the mining code, ensuring that the time it takes for a miner to win a block is always approximately 10 minutes. This is to protect the system and prevent miners from creating their own Bitcoin.\n\nEvery time Bitcoin is mined, the cryptographic problem becomes harder to solve, meaning that miners will require a higher hash rate to succeed in earning block rewards. This means that more computing power is needed to earn the same amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first Bitcoin miners used their computers\u2019 CPUs to complete the cryptographic problems. Soon, miners discovered that graphics processing units (GPUs) were more effective than CPUs, sparking an arms race in mining hardware. Now, Bitcoin miners use dedicated hardware known as ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners\u2014though miners of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies still typically use GPUs, which has led to shortages of graphics cards.\n\nSolving cryptographic problems is necessary to protect the Bitcoin network from attacks. To reverse transactions in the blockchain would require 51% of the whole network\u2019s computing power. This ensures that any attack is difficult and pointless as an attacker would have to own more mining hardware than anyone else.\n\nChina's Bitcoin mining crackdown, and beyond\n\nAs Bitcoin mining has matured, the barrier to entry for individual miners has been raised. Now, most mining is carried out by \u201cpools\u201d of miners who combine their resources and attempt to use their cumulative computing power to earn Bitcoin rewards.\n\nUp until mid-2021, the majority of mining pools were based in China. That changed in May 2021, when China's State Council included Bitcoin mining in a list of financial risks that required monitoring. It marked the start of a sweeping crackdown on crypto mining across China, prompted by the country's commitments to carbon neutrality and the imminent launch of its digital yuan, a central bank digital currency and Bitcoin rival.\n\nA succession of mining bans imposed by provincial governments including Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan followed, causing a collapse in the Bitcoin mining hash rate. Since then, Chinese miners have relocated to countries including Kazakhstan, while miners in other countries have picked up the slack, with the result that by October 2021, the U.S. had overtaken China as the world's largest market for Bitcoin mining.\n\nMiners are heavily influenced by electricity prices, since proof of work mining uses large quantities of electricity; many miners relocate their operations to make the most of cheap electricity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDid you know? The supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. When all 21 million BTC are mined, in around 2140, miners will be rewarded with transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin mining has come in for criticism over its high energy consumption, which in 2021 was around 11.8 GW or 103.31 terawatt-hours\u2014more than the output of twelve nuclear power plants.\n\nSome advocates of the cryptocurrency argue that it functions as an \u201cenergy currency\u201d that incentivizes the use of surplus energy; indeed, several power plants in the USA and Iran are now using surplus natural gas to operate large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Other miners are looking to nuclear power. The government of El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, has even started mining Bitcoin using geothermal energy from volcanoes.\n\nFigures for how much of Bitcoin's total energy consumption comes from renewables vary, with estimates ranging from 39% to as much as 75% (though the higher estimates typically come from firms involved in the crypto industry). Bitcoin miners currently generate a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Bangladesh.\n\nStung by this criticism, some cryptocurrencies are switching from a proof of work consensus mechanism to a system known as proof of stake (PoS).\n\nInstead of miners, proof of stake cryptocurrencies have validators. These validators stake their cryptocurrency on betting which blocks will be added next to a chain. If successful, the validators get a block reward in proportion to what they have staked. Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, is switching to a proof of stake model with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nBitcoin, however, is sticking with the tried-and-true proof of work consensus model espoused by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, over a decade ago."

In fact, Melker declares that Twitter \u201cstopped being fun\u201d when he reached 100,000 followers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I went through a phase of a real love-hate relationship with Twitter because that\u2019s when I guess 10% of the people who respond to comments were trolling at any given time.\u201d\n\nAll you can really post to 900,000 followers is \u201cBitcoin and inspirational quotes\u201d because \u201ceverything else\u201d will land you in hot water.\n\nAfter graduating from Penn State University with an Anthropology degree in 1999, Melker tried his hand at a \u201cmillion\u201d other things \u2014 finding the most success in his 20-year stint as a DJ.\n\nShortly after finishing university, he also started his own magazine in Philadelphia called 101 Magazine, focusing on street culture and city vibes.\n\nIt caught the attention of a \u201chuge\u201d magazine called Frank 151, which acquired it, and Melker became the editor-in-chief of both.\n\nDuring that time, he had the opportunity to attend \u201cinsane\u201d parties and rub shoulders with legendary acts like the Wu-Tang Clan and Outcast.\n\nThe music industry led him to try crypto trading in the first place.\n\n\u201cI just happened to look into crypto because there was a bunch of DJs trading it,\u201d he says.\n\nHe first started trading on the Gemini crypto exchange in 2016 and recalls buying Bitcoin to send it to another exchange, Bittrex, so he \u201ccould buy Ethereum and Ripple.\u201d ETH was \u201cunder 20 bucks\u201d back then, he notes in a cheeky humble brag.\n\nRather than some lofty higher purpose, he says the main attraction was making cold hard cash.\n\n\u201cI was really just trading, trying to make money to support a new family; it had nothing to do with what Bitcoin was or what the asset class was.\u201d\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nMelker initially started stacking up followers when he was \u201ctrading the market well\u201d and posting about it on Twitter. At that point in time, his content was \u201c100% charts and trades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Melker didn\u2019t want his account to be based on trades because it\u2019s \u201cfickle.\u201d\n\nSo, he transitioned toward a more holistic approach to his content within the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cI would love to tell you there was some strategy that I took to grow my account, but it was always just me doing whatever I enjoyed doing the most at any given time.\u201d\n\nMelker has observed a direct correlation between his follower growth and the performance of the crypto market.\n\nDuring previous bull markets, he has experienced an insane influx of daily followers.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I was getting a hundred thousand [followers] in two months,\u201d he says.\n\nMelker used to \u201cliterally respond to everybody\u201d who commented on his tweets or messaged him, but that ship has now sailed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like a full-time job, and then you just get to the point where you literally can\u2019t open all your DMs anymore,\u201d he says.\n\nBut it\u2019s best not to refer to him as an \u201cinfluencer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate the term influencer because, to me, I\u2019m just a student of crypto, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m passionate about and want to learn more about.\u201d\n\nWhat type of content do you do?\n\nMelker\u2019s content revolves around crypto news and keeping people up-to-date with what\u2019s happening in the market.\n\nHe likes to share his take on what\u2019s important, and \u201cwhat\u2019s kind of noise and not signal.\u201d\n\n\u201c[My content includes] all the lessons that I\u2019ve learned in my streams and podcasts, but I would say it\u2019s generally educational/informational content about this market.\u201d\n\nMelker emphasizes the overwhelming pressure he faces whenever he decides to \u201cfire off a tweet,\u201d considering how many followers he has amassed on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter is like a movie where you throw a grenade in a room and walk away, and there\u2019s a huge explosion behind you. That\u2019s how I feel every time I send a tweet now,\u201d Melker says.\n\nExtreme beef: Gary Gensler\n\nMelker is not a fan of United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nHe admits that his Twitter is filled with many \u201cangry tweets against Gensler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally contributed to aggressively getting #firegarygensler trending on Twitter,\u201d he declares.\n\nHe explains that his problem with Gensler is his recent regulatory actions, which he perceives as a \u201cmassive overcorrection\u201d targeting crypto firms.\n\nHe believes that it stems from a sense of embarrassment over the fact Gensler was meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried before the collapse of FTX and didn\u2019t realize \u201che was a fraud.\u201d\n\nSpicy beef: ZachXBT\n\nZachXBT, a pseudonymous on-chain researcher, accused Melker of pumping and dumping shit coins to his followers in 2021. It was a troubling time for Melker, who received threats and became the target of white-hot anger.\n\nMelker vehemently refuted the claims and announced he would steer clear of tweeting about projects with small market caps altogether.\n\nMelker says he doesn\u2019t want his audience to get the wrong idea and prefers to focus on the educational stuff. He reiterates that he \u201cwas passionate\u201d about trading altcoins, but says it can be difficult to navigate the boundaries of what you should and shouldn\u2019t talk about as your following grows.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just show up with 900,000 followers one day and understand what you can and cannot tweet about.\u201d\n\nPrice predictions?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that makes you look dumber than a price prediction,\u201d Melker states. He should know, given he took an optimistic swing at predicting Ethereum would hit five figures in 2021.\n\nI think $ETH will hit 5 figures this year. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) February 15, 2021\n\nHowever, he is bullish on Bitcoin hitting six figures in the next bull run.\n\n\u201cI think the next cycle would be somewhere between 100 (thousand) and 250 (thousand),\u201d he declares.\n\nBut Melker believes that after that, the market will see another huge decline before it hits half a million.\n\n\u201cThen we drop down to 60 (thousand), and it\u2019s boring forever. Then, we pop up to half a million, like we continue these four-year cycles.\u201d\n\nHowever, Melker doesn\u2019t want \u201cto live in a world where Bitcoin is a million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe faster it happens, the worse the world is,\u201d Melker says.\n\n\u201cBecause if Bitcoin goes to a million dollars. It means that everything else has exploded, including the United States dollar, and we\u2019re living in some Mad Max dystopian future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you and I are those guys without faces painted going to gas town, fighting off the enemies,\u201d he describes, referring to the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nBut maybe in a couple of decades.\n\n\u201cI would like to see Bitcoin at a million dollars in 20 years, following reasonable cycles,\u201d he adds."

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls, heads for weekly loss; Ether flat, Matic leads gainers, Solana the losers - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Friday morning in Asia as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Bitcoin again slipped below support at US$30,000 after a week that saw buyers retreat. Developments in applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate fresh investment, though some commentators say the pent up demand is there. Ether traded flat and is also a loser for the week. Matic led the early gainers on Friday, but is also in the red for the week.\n\nBitcoin backs off\n\nBitcoin fell 0.18% to US$29,824.09 as of 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has lost 4.53% in the past seven days.\n\nThe drop came amid further developments in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by U.S. asset managers.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree on July 19 were published in the Federal Register, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has up to 240 days to accept or request the applications, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg research analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter that while this sets the clock ticking, the SEC may still reject all the applications.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15, sparking a round of buying of cryptocurrencies on expectations more institutional funds will start investing in the asset class.\n\nWhile that enthusiasm has faded, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro said latent demand for cryptocurrencies remains, although \u201cthe momentum is far from euphoric.\u201d Kuptsikevich added that Bitcoin continued to find support this week on dips below $30,000. \u201cA move to the upper boundary at $31,300 is most likely in this environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAsia Pacific institutional investors \u201cremain constructive across the digital asset complex following last week\u2019s positive news on [ETFs],\u201d said Matt Long, the APAC general manager of California-based international crypto brokerage FalconX. \u201cThey are well positioned for further appreciation in markets,\u201d said Long in an emailed statement to Forkast.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S.-based digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said in a Friday report that about half of Bitcoin\u2019s 80% increase from December to mid-July relates to macro developments, while the rest is due to Bitcoin-specific positives.\n\n\u201cCrypto no longer behaves as its own ecosystem: Bitcoin and other digital assets are now more correlated with other market indicators,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cSince January 2023, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US Dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d Grayscale said.\n\n\u201cValuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report said.\n\nBack in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed \u2014 Polygon\u2019s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711. However, it posted a weekly loss of 8.46%.\n\nPolygon Labs is currently working on developing Polygon 2.0, a series of updates to the blockchain that the company says aim to make network governance more open and inclusive.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10, declining 3.53% to US$25.49, amid a 0.72% weekly loss.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged down 0.15% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, while trading volume jumped 19.19% to US$37.15 billion.\n\nNFTs fall; OpenSea launches swap feature\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.56% in the past 24 hours to 2,696.41 as of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained a flat 0.01% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 1.62% to US$18.69 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\nOn Thursday, NFT marketplace OpenSea announced that it is launching \u201cDeals,\u201d a new peer-to-peer NFT swap function. The company said in a tweet that this will help users avoid falling victim to \u201csketchy DMs & websites\u201d as OpenSea will provide the platform for users to directly engage with each other.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, says this feature is \u201cmore significant than people may realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the primary ways people are scammed in the NFT space is through fake trades. Often, legitimate trade sites are spoofed, and then trades offered through there,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cNow collectors will be able to trade using a platform they\u2019re already familiar with and trust, and the best part is there are no fees involved other than gas.\u201d\n\nCurrently, OpenSea allows only ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum from verified collections to be traded on Deals. To make a \u201cdeal,\u201d a user can offer one or more NFTs in return for another user\u2019s NFTs, where one can also choose to add wrapped Ether (WETF) as part of the offer. The user accepting the deal will have to pay gas fees, according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cEasy to use, and hopefully will have a major impact on lowering scams. This was long overdue.\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club topped CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 3.80% in the last day to US$1.4 million.\n\nEthereum was the top performing blockchain network by NFT trade volume, gaining 5.63% to US$13.73 million. Solana placed second, up 4.41% to US$1 million.\n\nU.S. equity futures gain after mixed session\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nThe three major U.S. stock futures indexes gained as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, after equities had a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nThe Dow Jones gained on top of strong Q2 earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 slipped as Tesla tumbled on weak second-quarter gross margins and Netflix reported less-than-expected revenue.\n\nIn Asia, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index gained, partially recovering from disappointing economic growth data for Q2. Investors are betting on Beijing to step up its economic stimulus measures, according to Trading Economics. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index also rose on China news of authorities possibly easing home buying limits in big cities.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dipped after its inflation rate rose slightly in June. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also slipped.\n\nOn macro events, the next U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting is next week on July 26 when the central bank will make its next move on U.S. interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take rates to the 5.25%-5.50% range, which will be the highest since January 2001.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin slipped under US$30,000 in Wednesday morning trading in Asia on the back of profit-taking and liquidation of long positions after the recent run up on optimism spot exchange-traded funds for the token may win approval and attract institutional investment. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also declined in lower trading volume. Ripple\u2019s XRP token was the exception, gaining almost 4% in early Asia trade as the tailwind continued from the company\u2019s partial victory last week in the lawsuit brought by the U.S. securities regulator.\n\nBitcoin, Ether retreat\n\nBitcoin fell below the US$30,000 line that has offered floor support since late June and lost 2.46% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. As of 06:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency traded at US$29,784.42, down 1.22% over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe token continued to fluctuate around the US$30,000 line later in the Asia morning as overall trading volume in cryptocurrencies fell more than 9% on the day.\n\nData from Coinglass showed large liquidations in long positions in Bitcoin, or bets that prices for the token would rise further.\n\nEther dropped 0.76% to US$1,898.40, though it is still logging a 1.15% gain for the week.\n\nInvestors seemed unimpressed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreeing on Monday to review the application by digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments Inc. to launch a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe SEC agreed the same for the application by BlackRock on July 13, which along with several other Bitcoin ETF applications set off a bullish run in crypto for the past month. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$9.4 trillion in assets. Tennessee-based Valkyrie had more than US$1 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nIn more background noise for crypto markets later today, Brian Armstrong \u2013 the chief executive officer of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. \u2013 is expected to sit down with Democratic members of Congress to discuss regulation of digital assets, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming that the exchange breached federal securities laws by offering unregistered financial securities to investors. Armstrong and other Coinbase executives have said they will fight the SEC allegations in court.\n\nThe SEC on July 13 received a setback in another lawsuit, filed more than two years ago, against Ripple Labs, when a U.S. district court ruled that Ripple Labs\u2019 programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as offerings of financial securities.\n\nThe Ripple ruling is a \u201cpotential watershed\u201d for the broader crypto market, wrote Robert Quartly-Janeiro, the chief strategy officer of Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitrue, in an email statement shared with Forkast Tuesday.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 cryptocurrency to gain on Wednesday morning, adding 3.89% to US$0.7678, further extending its weekly surge of 61.26%.\n\nLosses were led by Polygon\u2019s Matic and Solana. Polygon dipped 5.81% to US$0.7363, falling 0.36% in the past seven days.\n\nSolana lost 5.24% to US$25.33, but it\u2019s holding gains of 15.01% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.50% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dipping 9.49% to US$32.17 billion.\n\nNFT trade sinks toward yearly low\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Forkast NFT market indexes measuring the performance on Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano blockchains all dropped, while the Solana index rose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThe top collections are struggling to even reach $500k in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see.

The Shanghai Composite fell for the third consecutive session. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi also posted losses as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nU.S. financial heavyweights Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co. both beat analyst estimates in Q2 earnings, lifting investor sentiment.

        "content": "Bitcoin edged higher in Thursday morning trading in Asia, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, but the token has lost much of its support at the US$30,000 line. Investors said buying enthusiasm for Bitcoin has faded after recent gains sparked by exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and Ripple\u2019s favorable court ruling in the case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ether fell back.\n\nBitcoin flatlines\n\nBitcoin rose 0.44% to US$29,919.68 as of 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fluctuated around the US$30,000 support price earlier in the morning, but is now down 1.45% in the past seven days.\n\n\u201cCrypto has been relatively flat following a stream of good news,\u201d Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of Singapore-based blockchain infrastructure platform ContentFi Labs, said in emailed comments. \u201cThe Bitcoin ETF news has been priced in and the market is waiting to see the financial products in action.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock and several other U.S. financial institutions started filing applications for Spot Bitcoin ETFs from mid-June, helping move Bitcoin\u2019s price north of US$31,500 at one stage last week.\n\nRuck added that the U.S. court ruling last week in favor of Ripple Labs and its XRP token also helped drive the price gains, but the case isn\u2019t the end of the regulatory war since the SEC can appeal the case to a higher court.\n\n\u201cThis case also didn\u2019t finalize whether XRP and other tokens are securities, but instead added more regulatory confusion on how and when a token can be considered a security in some cases but not others,\u201d said Ruck.\n\nAdrian Wang, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based digital asset manager Metalpha, agreed the optimism around XRP and ETFs looked to have run out of steam. He added in emailed comments that XRP had only a partial victory as the district court said \u201cinstitutional sales of the tokens violated federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Ripple was the biggest gainer among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies Thursday morning. The token jumped 8.02% to US$0.8275 and added to a weekly surge of 75.85%.\n\nOther gainers included Cardano, which added 5.81% to US$0.3224 and is up 12.04% for the week. Solana rose 4.67% to US$26.53 for a weekly gain of 20.62%.\n\nOn Wednesday, Solana Labs, the blockchain infrastructure developer behind the token of the same name, introduced a new developer tool named Solang that it said will make smart contracts on the blockchain more accessible.\n\nEther was the main loser in early Asia trading, with the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization slipping 0.37% to US$1,892.30. However, it is still up 1.17% in the last week and has gained 57% for the year to date.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.01% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dipped 3.50% to US$31.11 billion.\n\nNFTs trade thin, but expansion into art world continues\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

The index rose 0.47% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 16.91% to US$15.87 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\n\u201cSales are very slow across all blockchains, which allows for newer mints like Garbage Bags to enter the top 10 collection rankings with just over US$200,000 in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain-based Garbage Bags placed seventh on CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 19.75% to US$281,775.

ImmutableX\u2019s trading card game NFT collection Gods Unchained placed second with US$679,479.\n\nTotal trading volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, dropped 22.08% to US$10.52 million, with 12,244 buyers.\n\n\u201cEthereum has managed to cross 10k unique buyers, a number it has only fallen below a few times this year,\u201d commented Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher. However, there is now a sense that the 10,000 unique buyer threshold could soon be under threat.\n\n\u201cWith NFTs losing steam it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see it fall below this threshold soon, especially as NFTs enter the slower time of the NFT market in the second half of the year,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTrading volume on the Bitcoin network also fell 8.14% to a thin trade of US$1.12 million. That figure is less than half the sales volume recorded on the network at the beginning of this month.\n\nDespite the general decline in market activity, NFTs continue to make an impact in the art world. New York\u2019s Jackson Pollock Studio released an art collection on Wednesday that includes both NFTs and physical prints of the late painter\u2019s abstract expressionist work.\n\nNamed \u201cBeyond the Edge,\u201d the 500 Ethereum-based NFT artworks were released in collaboration with digital art platform Iconic Moments.\n\nPublic mint is live for The Jackson Pollock Studio Collection.\n\n\n\nMint: https://t.co/tIrYx4wJOq pic.twitter.com/zUw65k8WES \u2014 Iconic (@Iconic_NFT) July 19, 2023\n\nElsewhere, at Wednesday\u2019s Art+Tech Summit held in New York\u2019s Christie\u2019s modern art museum, a group of digital art experts gathered for a panel discussion titled \u201cAI, Digital Assets and the Future of Museums and Galleries.\u201d\n\nOne theme central to the discussion was the use of blockchain technologies including NFTs as a way of making art institutions more accessible to audiences.\n\nSpeaking during the panel, Miami Institute of Contemporary Art\u2019s Anthony Troisi said that the decentralized nature of NFT art offers vast possibilities for institutions, and that they are now \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d in the exploration of the technology \u2014 a potentially positive omen for the future of the wider NFT market.\n\nU.S. equity futures fall as heavyweights post mixed Q2 earnings\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 gained while the Nasdaq index dipped. The three major U.S. stock futures indexes dropped as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq declining the most at 0.50%.\n\nTesla shares dropped despite reporting record-high quarterly revenue in Wednesday\u2019s Q2 earnings call, as lower operating margins outweighed concern for investors. Elsewhere, stocks in Netflix plunged as the streaming giant posted lower-than-expected revenue.\n\nGoldman Sachs also reported missed estimates in its earnings report. The report revealed a 60% drop in profits during the second quarter due to write-downs in consumer business and real estate. However, with shares rising 2%, the firm\u2019s CEO David Solomon nonetheless anticipates an imminent recovery in the investment banking sector.\n\nReuters reports that Solomon told a group of analysts via a conference call that he had noticed an increasing sense of positivity over the past six to eight weeks. \u201cThe inflation data\u2019s been better, the client sentiment is better, and now we\u2019ll have to watch and see,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobal information technology conglomerate IBM reported mixed results in the second quarter. While earnings exceeded expectations, revenue fell short.\n\nInvestors now await more earnings reports on Thursday from U.S. heavyweights including Johnson & Johnson, Philip Morris, Lenovo Group and American Airlines.\n\nThe main stock markets in Asia were mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index jumped back up from a two-day decline. South Korea\u2019s Kospi index also edged upward.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will use the meeting to announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take the interest rate to the 5.25%-5.50% range.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "This week\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry on Friday, July 21, could solidify the $30,000 resistance level and give the bears the upper hand for the first time since the 21% rally between June 14 and June 21.\n\nBitcoin options expiries coincide with volatility\n\nA review of Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action shows that three out of the last four BTC options expiries triggered significant price movements, making it crucial for traders to pay close attention to these events.\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 4-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s price has consistently shown strong reactions following the weekly 8:00 am UTC options expiry. While causation cannot be established, the magnitude of these price swings warrants extreme caution leading up to the weekly expiry on July 21.\n\nBitcoin bears benefit from stricter regulations\n\nWhile this week\u2019s options expiry could give bears control of Bitcoin\u2019s price in the short term, bulls have the potential advantage of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission reviewing spot exchange-traded fund proposals.\n\nAlthough these proposals are still in the early stages of regulatory scrutiny, the slow progression could partially explain why the bears have managed to defend $31,000 multiple times since late June.\n\nHowever, their best chance of keeping Bitcoin\u2019s price below $30,000 lies in the worsening regulatory environment. On July 19, the global securities exchange Nasdaq suspended the launch of its cryptocurrency custodian solution due to a lack of regulatory clarity in the United States. This change of plans was justified by Nasdaq\u2019s CEO, Adena Friedman.\n\nRelated: Bipartisan bill to regulate DeFi, crypto security risks introduced into US Senate\n\nFurthermore, on July 14, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced the suspension of its staking services for clients in California, New Jersey, South Carolina and Wisconsin. This decision followed a June 6 lawsuit from the SEC that accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered security broker since 2019.\n\nBitcoin bulls\u2019 overoptimism leads to a disappointing outcome\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price briefly surpassed $31,000 on July 13 and July 14, fueling bullish bets by traders using options contracts. However, a four-hour correction brought the price back down to $30,000.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for July 21. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.39 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $430 million call (buy) options and the $170 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower than the $600 million total open interest since the bulls were overconfident.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s price trades at $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on July 14, only $18 million worth of call options will be accounted for. This distinction arises from the fact that the right to purchase Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 becomes invalid if BTC trades below those levels upon expiration.\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on July 21 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $28,000 and $30,000: 100 calls vs. 2,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $70 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 2,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $70 million. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 600 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $35 million.\n\n600 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $35 million. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 3,100 calls vs. 1,400 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $55 million.\n\nConsidering the recent weak macroeconomic indicators, it\u2019s likely that bears will continue suppressing Bitcoin\u2019s price until Friday\u2019s expiry. Moreover, China\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product grew by 6.3% year-on-year, falling short of the 7.3% market expectation. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales in June increased by 0.2% from the previous month, below the 0.50% consensus.\n\nConsequently, the bulls find themselves in a challenging position, as their call (buy) instruments will be invalidated if Bitcoin\u2019s expiry price falls below $30,000. Therefore, the bears\u2019 $35 million favorable outcome may not be a significant win, but it does increase the chances of $30,000 becoming a new resistance area.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCrypto analyst claims Celsius creditors may get full refunds if they just wait\n\nWhat could lead to the desired crypto bull run?\n\nIs Celsius\u2019 Chapter 11 the perfect way out?\n\nEver since the collapse of Celsius, a failed crypto lender, which led to the suspension of $4.7 billion in client funds, the company\u2019s customers have been scrambling to get their money back, or at least a bit of it.\n\nAt first, the company was ordered by the court to repay 72.5% of what it owes Custody clients, i.e. clients who just deposited their crypto with Celsius for safekeeping. Then, as part of the company\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy application, the company was ordered to partially refund Earn customers, who represent a majority of Celsius\u2019 creditors.\n\nAs part of the company\u2019s refund plan, Celsius aims to repay its Earn clients in part Bitcoin and Ethereum, part NewCo shares, and part litigation fees.\n\nSimon Dixon, founder of Bnk To The Future, now claims the failed crypto lender may have enough liquidity to pay all creditors in full if Bitcoin and Ethereum manage to surge in value.\n\nBetter Crypto, Better Refunds\n\nDixon tweeted a financial breakdown of the liquidity needed to pay back Celsius customers in full. Focusing on the company\u2019s new acquirer, Fahrenheit, Bnk To The Future\u2019s founder estimated the values Bitcoin and Ethereum would need to reach for Fahrenheit to completely refund Celsius\u2019 customers.\n\nI was asked in my Space what price of #Bitcoin & $ETH would allow #Celsius & the bankruptcy code to rug pull us by using #BTC & $ETH price appreciation to pay off our $USD claims & keep all other assets. The Investment Banking team at @BankToTheFuture gave me the numbers today\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EW8fuBVhLG \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023\n\nDixon first focused on the biggest gains acquired by Fahrenheit as it takes over Celsius, mainly mining operations.\n\n\u201cNewCo under @FahrenheitHldg includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion. This includes $450 million in liquid crypto.Net equity value, therefore, is $950 million.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of Assets. Key difference between the 2 options are: \u2013 NewCo under @FahrenheitHldg includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion. This includes $450 million liquid crypto. Net equity value therefore is $950 million.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/srDjsbWJOF \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023\n\nThe crypto analyst then provided a breakdown of the crypto values required to reach the liquidity that would enable Celsius to pay back its customers in full. Among the most notable numbers is a potential future value of Bitcoin at $54,879, which is almost double its value at the time of writing of this article of ~$30,000. Dixon also based his argument on an ETH value that would need to reach $3,750, as opposed to the current value of ~$1,900.\n\nAnalysis of Assets. Key difference between the 2 options are: \u2013 NewCo under @FahrenheitHldg includes Mining, Institutional Loans & Investments & is valued at approximately $1.4 billion.

The Toronto Police Service said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested and charged four men on counts of kidnapping for ransom and other charges: Mr. Heywood, Tyler Fast, 37, and Deren Akyeam-Pong, 24, all of Toronto, as well as Rakeem Henry, 24, of London.\n\nMr. Heywood was among dozens who invested with Mr. Pleterski, who was supposed to invest their money in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange positions, according to court documents. But after spending money feeding a lavish lifestyle, buying three Lamborghinis and three McLarens, Mr. Pleterski filed for bankruptcy in August, leaving investors wondering what had happened to their money."

With this strategic move, Flooring Hut demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and adapting to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nFormed in 2015, Flooring Hut stocks a wide range of carpet, laminate and vinyl flooring solutions, and is obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that\u2019s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\n\nBy diversifying its asset holdings to include Bitcoin, Flooring Hut embraces innovation and positions itself at the forefront of the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Companies House filings, the privately-owned company has four shareholders and two employees.\n\nFlooring Hut recognises the growing interest and demand from stakeholders, including investors, partners, and customers, who value transparency and progressive approaches to financial reporting. Including Bitcoin holdings on the balance sheet ensures that the company remains responsive to the expectations of its diverse stakeholders.\n\nIts 2023 accounts showed a loss of \u00a3173,423 and cash reserves of \u00a375,105, which at spot pricing is enough to buy 3.2 bitcoins.\n\nDavid Greaves, CFO at Flooring Hut says: \u201cOur decision to include Bitcoin on our balance sheet exemplifies our commitment to embracing digital transformation and being at the forefront of technological innovation. We recognise the potential of cryptocurrencies and their impact on the future of finance. By including Bitcoin holdings, we not only diversify our assets but also demonstrate our dedication to transparency and meeting the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nNews of Flooring Hut\u2019s endorsement of bitcoin follows an announcement on Tuesday that it would be \u201chonouring the legacy of Nelson Mandela\u201d through initiatives that combine \u201cthe principles of social responsibility with their expertise in flooring solutions.\u201d On Monday it press-released the donation of a wall clock to K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley, West Sussex.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin and Ether both returned above key levels. But market sentiment remained lackluster despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepting the second Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application for review earlier this week.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin rises past US$31,000, cryptos rally after Ripple\u2019s win against U.S. SEC\n\nBitcoin, Ether return above key levels, top 10 cryptos mixed\n\nBitcoin rose 0.75% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$30,008 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, after it dipped to a daily low of US$29,693 in the early morning.\n\nEther inched up 0.57% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,909, struggling to stay above the US$1,900 support level.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, rising 5.52% to US$0.7849. The coin is up 65.3% on the weekly chart, as traders remain upbeat after the ruling that the sale of XRP did not constitute a security.\n\n\u201cThis victory marked a significant milestone as the first-ever win for a cryptocurrency company in a case brought by the SEC,\u201d Simon Schaber, the chief commercial officer of Spool DAO, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cLike the rest of this industry, the SEC is in new territory and is therefore creating new guidance and proposing new laws as it goes, which is why we\u2019re unlikely to see the end of this by 2024.\u201d\n\nMarket sentiment appeared to lack conviction, despite positive news like the SEC accepting a second spot Bitcoin ETF application for review, from asset management giant Valkyrie.\n\nThe SEC agreed the same for the application by BlackRock on July 13, which along with several other Bitcoin ETF applications set off a bullish run in crypto for the past month. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$9.4 trillion in assets. Tennessee-based Valkyrie had more than US$1 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.46% to US$1.2 trillion while market volume decreased 11% to US$32.28 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales inch up, Ethereum NFT sales fall along with Opepen Edition\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.14% to 2,695.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and slipped 0.4% during the week.\n\nAfter a weak Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 1.67% to US$1.33 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rallied 44.03% to US$851,915.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell after yesterday\u2019s strong session, declining 24.11% to US$11.48 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 38.39% to US$323,542. CryptoPunks sales also fell 38.43% to US$472,222.\n\nThe Opepen craze also subsided, as the collection\u2019s 24-hour sales fell 59.02% to US$324,841.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe top collections are struggling to even reach US$500,000 in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see. The index reflects a flat market.\u201d\n\nAll the Forkast Labs NFT indexes were in the red, with the Forkast POL NFT Composite sustaining the biggest daily loss of 1.76%.\n\nDespite the market slump, interest in NFTs is surging. Last week, American rapper Snoop Dogg\u2019s NFT music platform, Sound.xyz, secured US$20 million in a series A funding round led by a16z crypto, including participants like Coinbase and Scalar Capital.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures rise on strong earnings reports\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities were mixed as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and the Shanghai Composite inched up while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index and the Shenzhen Component declined.\n\nInvestors remained concerned about China\u2019s post-pandemic recovery, as economists believe that Beijing\u2019s plans to boost consumer spending will not translate into a meaningful boost for the economy.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, bolstered by strong earnings reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened.\n\nU.S. financial heavyweights Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co. both beat analyst estimates in Q2 earnings, lifting investor sentiment. Later on Wednesday, Tesla, Netflix, United Airlines and Goldman Sachs Group all report earnings for Q2.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting on July 26. U.S. interest rates are now at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nThe euro inched down 0.03% to US$1.12, remaining near a 17-month high, ahead of another expected rate hike to tackle inflation. Eurozone inflation declined to a 17-month low of 5.5% in June, but core inflation remained at 5.4%, near its all-time high of 5.7% in March.\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose 0.25% to stabilize above the 100 mark, remaining near a 17-month low against the euro.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies are employing derisking strategies by offloading BTC to exchanges, according to a market report from Bitfinex.\n\nThe cryptocurrency trading platform\u2019s latest newsletter addresses the Bitcoin mining sector at length, highlighting a recent surge in miners selling large volumes of BTC to exchanges. This has led to a corresponding increase in the value of shares in Bitcoin mining companies as institutional interest in BTC picks up in 2023.\n\nThe report notes that Poolin has accounted for the highest amount of BTC sold to the market in recent weeks. Bitfinex analysts also note that the Bitcoin mining difficulty recently hit an all-time high, which it labels as an indicator of \u201crobustness and miner confidence.\u201c The report states:\n\n\u201cMiners are clearly bullish on Bitcoin as they commit more resources to mining, hence triggering the mining difficulty, but they are hedging their position, hence the despatch of more Bitcoin to exchanges.\u201c\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that miners are hedging positions on derivatives exchanges, with 70,000 BTC in 30-day cumulative volume transferred in the first week of July 2023.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners raked $184M in fees in Q2, surpassing all of 2022\n\nWhile miners historically transfer BTC to exchanges using derivatives as a hedge for large spot positions, the report labels the high volumes as uncharacteristic:\n\n\u201cA transfer to exchanges on this scale is extremely rare and potentially showcases new miner behaviour.\u201d\n\nBitfinex also cited data from Glassnode indicating that Poolin has been responsible for a large portion of this activity, with the mining pool offloading BTC to Binance.\n\nThe analysts note that several plausible reasons could be behind recent mining behavior. This could include hedging activities in the derivatives market, carrying out over-the-counter orders or transferring funds through exchanges for other reasons.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty and corresponding market price. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThe increase in mining difficulty also indicates new mining power being added to the Bitcoin network. Analysts suggest that this is seen as a sign of increased network health, as well as increased confidence in the profitability of mining, either by increased BTC prices or improved hardware.\n\n\u201cThus, miners are at a peculiar situation where they are rapidly increasing their mining potential as the Bitcoin halving inches closer whilst simultaneously hedging their exposure to an extent which is higher and more cautious than previous cycles.\u201d\n\nThe report also suggests that on-chain Bitcoin movements reflect a transfer of supply from long-term holders to short-term holders. This investor behavior is said to be commonly seen in bull market conditions, as new market traders look for quick profits while long-term holders capitalize on increased prices.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to a handful of mining companies and pools to ascertain why Bitcoin outflows from miners have increased over the past month. As recently reported, miners sent over $128 million in revenue to exchanges at the end of June 2023.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "7 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "While there was talk of a \"crypto winter\" in 2022, it seems that spring has sprung in the digital assets space in 2023. Bitcoin, by far the largest and best-recognized cryptocurrency, has surged more than 80% year to date to regain some of its lost luster. The popular alternative cryptocurrency ether, colloquially known as ethereum, is also up almost 60% since the start of the year. (All year-to-date gains in this piece are current through July 18.)\n\nInterestingly enough, though, some crypto-related stocks are up even more \u2013 with some mining-related companies having doubled, tripled or even quintupled already in 2023. In fact, in the wake of a big court decision on July 13 that found Ripple (XRP) was not a security, some stocks immediately tacked on double-digit percentage gains.\n\nThere's admittedly a much different risk profile for cryptocurrency stocks vs. cryptocurrency itself. It's in many ways similar to the differences between owning physical gold that is tied to commodity market pricing trends and a gold miner that extracts that physical gold from the ground and is measured by its revenue, profitability and other fundamentals.\n\nIf you prefer the more tangible nature of stocks as an alternative to owning cryptocurrency like bitcoin directly, consider one of these seven names:\n\nStock Year-to-date return through July 18 Block Inc. (ticker: SQ) 25.8% Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) 195.5% Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE) 288.9% Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA) 391.5% MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) 214.9% Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) 225.1% Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) 439.2%\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ)\n\nThough the core business of Block is its leading digital and mobile payment platform Square, co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey rebranded the company as Block in part because of his strong support for the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. This includes the company's development of Cash App, a platform where users can buy, sell, send and receive bitcoin. On top of all this, the latest quarterly filings show SQ has invested a cumulative $220 million directly in bitcoin. Shares have actually underperformed this year relative to other companies on this list, thanks to continued operations in the red along with regulatory scrutiny of Cash App. That said, aggressive investors could see this as a buying opportunity based on long-term potential.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 25.8%\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (COIN)\n\nCoinbase provides financial infrastructure and technology for the \"crypto economy\" in the United States, including operating one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Particularly after the 2022 collapse of rival exchange FTX, Coinbase remains one of the only \"lit\" markets \u2013 a market showing the bid and ask prices of participants \u2013 providing a regulated venue in the digital assets space for domestic participants. Though the regulatory environment is always uncertain, the willingness of Coinbase to engage with the regulatory community including the Securities and Exchange Commission gives it a measure of legitimacy in an industry that is admittedly still a bit rough around the edges.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 195.5%\n\nHive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE)\n\nThe smallest stock on this list at only about $500 million in market value, Hive operates as a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada, Sweden and Iceland. It recently rebranded from Hive Blockchain to Hive Digital Technologies to emphasize that it does more than just digital assets (it also offers cloud computing services). Hive also uses its tech know-how to operate data centers and offers other infrastructure solutions. It's not the first reinvention of this company either, as it was formerly known as Leeta Gold Corp., mining physical metals prior to its 2017 shift in strategy. Whatever the history though, you can't argue with the tremendous performance of this stock year to date as it benefits from its current business model.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 288.9%\n\n\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA)\n\nMarathon is currently one of the largest bitcoin mining companies in the U.S. It also provides general services to the crypto industry including transaction and custody verification as well blockchain security work. The company currently operates 150,000 or so miners at locations ranging from Texas to North Dakota to Abu Dhabi, and in July reported production of 5,120 BTC year to date in 2023. It also bills itself as one of the most sustainable miners in the world, making big investments in renewable energy such as wind power. If you are interested in investing in publicly traded bitcoin miners but don't particularly like the size of their carbon footprints, the $3 billion MARA is worth a look.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 391.5%\n\nMicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR)\n\nThough MicroStrategy's core operations include providing business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based enterprise technology services, it has become popular these days thanks to a heavy reliance on digital assets to boost its corporate balance sheet. Back in 2020, then-CEO Michael Saylor announced his intention to stop holding cash and instead rely on crypto to fund its corporate treasury \u2013 beginning with buying $250 million worth of bitcoin. Considering bitcoin is up threefold since then, history seems to have proven out that move. And going forward, investors who want to play stocks as a proxy for direct bitcoin investment can take a stake in MSTR and its current hoard of roughly 140,000 bitcoin as of the end of its fiscal first quarter.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 214.9%\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nThough it is a bit of an indirect play on the crypto frenzy, high-octane momentum stock Nvidia nevertheless earns a place on this list because of its amazing performance in 2023 and its nearly indispensable role as the semiconductor manufacturer of choice for the industry. Nvidia's legacy business of graphics processing units evolved from high-end video gaming graphics cards to \"superchips\" for data-intensive tasks like running artificial intelligence and machine learning software, performing cryptocurrency mining and other cutting-edge applications. If you're looking to play crypto stocks tangentially without owning a direct stake in bitcoin or ethereum, NVDA is a top performer worth a look.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 225.1%\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n\nRiot Platforms is a Colorado-based cryptocurrency mining company that independently mines bitcoin along with providing co-location services for institutional-scale bitcoin mining companies and other critical infrastructure for related operations. Though it previously operated as a medical device maker known as Bioptix, the company changed its name and its fundamental business model back in 2017 to ride the crypto wave. It's now valued at more than $3 billion and is one of the preeminent publicly traded mining companies."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t lost much by selling most of its BTC a year ago\n\nWhat Did Tesla Make by Selling its Bitcoin?\n\nIs Tesla Still Interested in Crypto?\n\nIs Dogecoin Elon\u2019s favorite?\n\nTesla, the world\u2019s leading EV manufacturer, just released the company\u2019s earnings report for the second quarter of 2023. Within the report, the company details its expenditures and income from various sources, including returns on investments. However, the report shows that the company has made no sales of digital assets \u2014 not for this quarter, nor the two quarters prior.\n\nTesla reports that it holds $184 million in digital assets, a figure that hasn\u2019t changed since Q3 of 2022.\n\nConsidering the huge push both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk made for crypto in 2021, the company\u2019s inactivity in the crypto market tells a story about its change of attitude towards digital asset investment.\n\nTesla Dumped Bitcoin\n\nIf we rewind the clock all the way to 2021, we\u2019ll remember how Tesla shocked the crypto market when it invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. According to the US Securities and Exchange filing , the company said that it \u201cinvested an aggregate $1.50 billion in Bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe move shocked the market as Bitcoin immediately rose in price by over $3,000.\n\nShortly after, Musk tweeted that the company \u201chas suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\u201d adding that \u201cCryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\u201d\n\nFast forward just over a year, in Q2 2022, the company sold 75% of its Bitcoin stash for $936 million, realizing a profit of $128 million.\n\nThe company then released its earning report reflecting the sale, stating, \u201cAs of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThe company also commented on the huge Bitcoin offload, saying it was meant to \u201cprove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThrough quick maths, we can assume that Tesla sold its Bitcoin stash for an average of $29,000 per token. The figure is shockingly close to the price of BTC at the time this article is being written, floating around $30,000.\n\nSo, had Tesla held onto its Bitcoin stash for a year longer, the company would\u2019ve sold the same tokens in 2023 for $968 million, rather than $936 million.\n\nMeme-ing The Crypto Market\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk has been fickle about his support for DogeCoin. As the company was making its huge purchase of Bitcoin, Musk posted a series of tweets to show support for DogeCoin, even momentarily including \u201cDogecoin\u201d in his Twitter bio.\n\nDoge \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nNo highs, no lows, only Doge \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021\n\nAs a result, DogeCoin saw a staggering 50% surge in price. Elon even gave another 30% boost to DogeCoin earlier this year when Twitter decided to change its logo from the typical blue bird to the DogeCoin logo.\n\nTesla still accepts DogeCoin as a form of payment on its websites. A whole FAQ page on Tesla\u2019s website is dedicated to DogeCoin.\n\nPerhaps, as a result, Evan Spencer of Evan Spencer Law, A New York plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, filed accusations against Tesla and its CEO, claiming market manipulation.\n\nThe complaint states that Musk and Tesla used eight crypto wallets to sell DogeCoin after hyping up the token through Twitter shenanigans.\n\nMusk has responded with proof that he had disclaimed these wallets prior to the DogeCoin sale."

        "content": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim its psychologically important level of $30,000 as analysts predict that choppy accumulation may last for months.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) soared to a new yearly high of over $31,800 on July 13, driven by optimism surrounding the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States and Ripple\u2019s landmark legal victory in its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the classification of XRP (XRP) as a security.\n\nHowever, five days after the pump, BTC closed below $30,000 as buyers struggled to push the price back above the crucial support level.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s price showing weakness in the short term, historical on-chain movements and empirical data suggest that the worst days of the bear market are likely over.\n\nLong-term holders are unmoved, but short-term investors could sell\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest report shows that Bitcoin\u2019s price action in the first half of 2023 was mainly dominated by short-term investors.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, 88% of short-term holders\u2019 supply is in profit, as this cohort is \u201cbecoming increasingly likely to spend and take profits.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s short-term holder SOPR ratio. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe short-term holders\u2019 profit spiked significantly after BTC took off from $25,000 after BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing instilled optimism among buyers.\n\nThe metric met resistance as its reading surpassed the 90% mark with Bitcoin\u2019s break above $31,000, suggesting that almost all short-term holders were in profit. A correction in BTC was required in the short term to reset this metric for further gains.\n\nHowever, despite the price surge in the first half of 2023, long-term investors refrained from selling. The net realized profit/loss metric reflects a noticeable difference in the levels of profit booking between the bullish phase and the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s net realized profit/loss metric. Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analyst wrote, \u201cThis reflects the first sustained profit regime since April 2022,\u201d which is \u201csimilar in scale to both the first half of 2019, and also late 2020.\u201d\n\nWhile selling pressure from long-term holders is minimal and the asset has witnessed on-chain positive accumulation since the start of July, the profit levels of short-term holders suggest the risk of further correction.\n\nInvestors anticipate the Bitcoin halving pump\n\nDespite the current price action, many investors and analysts still expect the upcoming Bitcoin block reward halving to positively impact price.\n\nPlanB\u2019s stock-to-flow (S2F) model shows how Bitcoin\u2019s halving affects its price. The basis of the theory is that an asset\u2019s price grows as it becomes scarce.\n\nThe stock-to-flow ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock (total supply) of Bitcoin by the annual flow (new supply). Gold has a stock-to-flow ratio of around 62, meaning newly mined coins would take approximately 62 years to equal the total amount of gold in existence.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s stock-to-flow model analysis. Source: Lookintobitcoin via Jesse Myers\n\nAs predicted in PlanB\u2019s original analysis, Bitcoin\u2019s S2F value reached parity with gold at the end of 2020. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s S2F reading is at 57.\n\nHowever, gold\u2019s price is still 20 times higher because it has built trust over generations and Bitcoin might need \u201ca generation or even two before Bitcoin\u2019s valuation\u201d catches up to gold\u2019s, wrote independent market analyst Jesse Myers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s S2F model was invalidated during the last cycle because BTC did not reach the model\u2019s predicted target of $100,000, Myers found that the new target of $100,000 was an ambitious upgrade to the original model.\n\nStill, the real hint lies in the first version of PlanB\u2019s S2F model from 2019, which predicted a Bitcoin price of $55,000 with an S2F of 50 after the May 2020 halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining difficulty hits all-time high as BTC miner selling peaks\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price is set for another supply shock at the next halving in April 2024, the S2F model shows that the price will likely surge after the event. Still, Myers wrote the price usually follows a \u201cmuch less sexy version of the stock-to-flow model.\u201d\n\nHe also added that \u201cit takes longer than four years for the changed stock-to-flow reality of each halving to be fully digested by the world\u201d and reflected in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s updated S2F model by Jesse Myers.

Source: TradingView\n\nMore recently, the 20- and 50-period weekly moving averages staged a bullish cross, as the shorter-period MA moved above the longer. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price has continued to form new local highs during this event, further confirming a long-term positive trend.\n\n$btc $eth Weekly 20 & 50 EMA crosses in the past.\n\n\n\nProbably nothing though pic.twitter.com/JHdu0u7GA9 \u2014 Mohit Sorout (@singhsoro) July 18, 2023\n\nThe 20-period weekly MA at $28,150 forms the first line of defense for buyers, followed by the 200-day MA at $25,940.\n\nThe risk of selling from short-term holders, who are currently sitting on historically high profit levels, could drive the price down to the above-mentioned support levels. The price should hold these support levels given the positive ongoing accumulation and strong conviction among long-term holders.\n\nBased on historical data, a parabolic bull run is not expected just yet. The market will likely witness sideways consolidation in a parallel range leading up to the next halving event.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Tesla appears to be ready to take Bitcoin payments again after briefly doing it a few years ago, but stopping after pressure about going against its mission.\n\nTesla\u2019s history with Bitcoin\n\nEarly in 2021, Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Shortly after, the automaker started accepting the cryptocurrency as payment on new vehicles.\n\nHowever, a few days later, Tesla took a step back with crypto by removing the Bitcoin payment option. The company noted concerns over the energy needs of the Bitcoin network:\n\nTesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nThis is a concern that many Tesla community members shared when Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment, and many were angered by the fact that the company didn\u2019t think about it in the first place.\n\nAt the time, Tesla noted that they were not selling their stake in Bitcoin and that they planned to resume taking Bitcoin payments once the network showed a higher mix of renewable energy.\n\nA year after the initial investment, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin holding increased to $2 billion, but the cryptocurrency lost a lot of its value in 2022 and the automaker\u2019s position suffered greatly.\n\nLast year, we reported that Tesla was likely down by as much as $500 million on its Bitcoin investment.\n\nHowever, it looks like Tesla might have avoided some of those losses.\n\nWith the release of its Q2 2022 financial results, Tesla confirmed that it sold about 75% of its Bitcoin position:\n\nAs of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.\n\nWith roughly $936 million from that 75% and having sold over $250 million as a sort of stress test early in its investment, Tesla is still likely up on its $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\nIs Tesla finally going to take Bitcoin payments again?\n\nIt has been two years, and Tesla hasn\u2019t seemed to be taking steps toward bringing back Bitcoin.\n\nNow internet sleuths have spotted that Tesla has added code on its website to accept Bitcoin payment again:\n\nBREAKING:\n\n\n\nTESLA HAS ADDED BITCOIN BACK INTO THEIR CODE FOR PAYMENTS ON THEIR WEBSITE pic.twitter.com/BhRL4C4BK9 \u2014 LilMoonLambo (@LilMoonLambo) July 20, 2023\n\nThe integration appears to be through Stripe, but it is still not available as an option on Tesla\u2019s website.\n\nBut it is all over the code on Tesla\u2019s ordering page:\n\nThe move could be due to recent reports stating that now more than half of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy.\n\nIt could help Tesla justify bringing back Bitcoin as a mode of payment on its vehicles."

        "content": "Microstrategy\u2019s Stock Poised to Benefit from Bitcoin Halving, Berenberg Predicts\n\nSource: AdobeStock / JorgeEduardo\n\nBerenberg Capital has revealed its bullish case for Michael Saylor\u2018s Microstrategy ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event.\n\nIn a recent research note, the investment firm said the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 26, 2024, serves as the primary driving force behind the firm\u2019s positive outlook.\n\nBerenberg currently holds a price target of $430 for the Virginia-based software company, a notable increase from its current price of $407.71 per share.\n\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and is ingrained in the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nIt refers to the reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are created and awarded to miners for validating transactions. The halving mechanism is designed to control inflation and limit the supply of bitcoins in circulation.\n\nHalving events have significant implications for the supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin, which can ultimately impact its price.\n\nThe reduction in new coin issuance creates a scarcity effect. With fewer BTC tokens entering the market, the available supply decreases.\n\nIf the demand for Bitcoin remains stable or increases, the reduced supply can lead to upward price pressure.\n\nMicrostrategy Expected to Rally Alongside Bitcoin\n\nGiven the strong correlation between Microstrategy\u2019s stock price and the price of Bitcoin at approximately 90%, Berenberg suggests that Microstrategy\u2019s stock is likely to rally alongside Bitcoin.\n\nSince the start of the year, Microstrategy\u2019s stock has soared by over 181%, according to TradingView. This bullish trend continued on Monday, witnessing a 7% increase and ending the day at $407.71.\n\n\u201cIf the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\u201d the firm wrote.\n\n\u201cIf a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time analysts at Berenberg have endorsed Microstrategy due to its massive exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nBack in May, Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at Berenberg Capital Markets, claimed MicroStrategy is a safer bet compared to Coinbase due to the exchange\u2019s regulatory issues.\n\n\u201cGiven the heightened uncertainty that Coinbase faces, we believe investors would be much better served investing in shares of MicroStrategy,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nAs reported, the Litecoin (LTC) blockchain\u2019s halving, which is poised to go through in another 21 days, has already positively impacted the price of LTC.\n\nOver the past month, the price of Litecoin has risen by 22%, while its 12-month performance shows an impressive 81% increase.\n\nThis performance has bolstered the confidence of Bitcoin investors who believe that the upcoming halvening event for Bitcoin will have a similarly positive impact on the price of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin hit a 52-week high last month after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin traders anticipate BTC price to briefly sweep the $27.5K level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a spectacular first half of 2023, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled out, being stuck between $29,000 and $31,500.\n\nThere could be reason to believe that in the near term, the price of Bitcoin will tend to trade sideways or to the downside. This thesis can be based on three factors, with two of them involving technical analysis and the third involving fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin price resistance at $32,000 has been holding strong\n\nCharles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently released a market update in which he notes the significant resistance Bitcoin has failed to break through at the $31,000\u2013$32,000 level:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is trading into the most significant resistance on the chart, $32K. Despite a swath of positive news stories over the last month for the crypto industry; from the Blackrock ETF announcement, the XRP legal victory through to presidential candidate Kennedy stating he would back the US Dollar with Bitcoin today; nothing has helped Bitcoin sustain momentum above $31K.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to state that if positive news of this magnitude doesn\u2019t translate into upward price momentum, this alone could be a bearish signal.\n\nAnalysts question whether Bitcoin's $29,500 support will hold\n\nWhile Bitcoin has not traded far below the $30,000 mark for almost a month, a lack of resistance beneath $29,500 indicates that a breakout to the downside from the current consolidation could lead to further decline.\n\nAs crypto market commentator Colin Talks Crypto has pointed out, the next major support levels for BTC/USD don\u2019t kick in until somewhere around the $27,500 level. Not only does this level act as support based on previous price action, but both the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA have begun to converge just beneath it.\n\n#Bitcoin looks to have a fair chance of dropping to around $27.3k where there is a confluence of both:\n\n\n\n1. a strong support range of previous price action (orange rectangle)\n\n2. where the 200 weekly MA (pink) acts as support.\n\n3. The 200 daily MA (blue) isn't far behind either.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/aDHDMqvW7U \u2014 Colin Talks Crypto (@ColinTCrypto) July 19, 2023\n\nFor the past month, BTC/USD has been holding within a tight consolidation range. Support for this range appears around the $29,500 level. A daily close beneath support could open the path to a further move downward toward $27,500.\n\nHowever, volumes have been declining, suggesting that perhaps the recent spike downward could be less bearish than it seems. If volume picks up amid another pullback, the bears could easily take control of the market.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price falls to $29.5k but on chain data reflects investors\u2019 growing interest\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals have floundered\n\nThe Capriole Investments report cited earlier emphasizes that \u201cprice is only half the picture.\u201d Fundamental factors also come into play. Among those most worth considering might be metrics that pertain to questions such as:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with on-chain flows?\n\nHow are investors allocating capital?\n\nHow does overall market sentiment and the macro environment impact Bitcoin?\n\nIs network security growing?\n\nThe Capriole Bitcoin Macro Index is an aggregate measurement of 40 fundamental Bitcoin variables, including on-chain, macroeconomic and equity market metrics. All factors have been combined into a single machine learning model.\n\nThe report concludes:\n\n\u201cThe Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors. However, the Index just re-entered contraction. On-chain and macro fundamentals have started to trend down following a 7-week period of recovery which started at $26K in early June.\u201d\n\nCapriole Bitcoin Macro Index. Source: Capriole Investments\n\nBitcoin\u2019s long-term bull thesis is still in play\n\nDespite these near-term bearish developments, there\u2019s little reason to be concerned long-term. The next halving event is less than a year away, and positive news keeps flowing in.\n\nPerhaps most importantly of all, the hash rate has risen by 50% in the last six months alone. This suggests that the Bitcoin network is stronger than ever and continuing to grow at a lightning-fast pace.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The second quarter of the year has been a solid one for Bitcoin\u2019s performance as its market dominance gained against altcoins, which \u201cbled\u201d throughout the quarter, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn July 18, the crypto data aggregator released its industry report for Q2 2023 which noted Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) continued to build upon their Q1 gains over Q2.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB), XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) suffered double-digit losses over that time.\n\nCoinGecko said BNB and ADA saw the largest losses as both were labeled securities in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) tokens were hit particularly hard during the quarter with Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK) and Lido (LDO) taking double-digit losses.\n\nThe top five metaverse and play-to-earn tokens by market cap including Axie Infinity (AXS), Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA) also marked losses of up to 40%.\n\nCrypto price returns Q2, 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin dominance increased to a two-year high of just over 52% in late June. However, it dropped back below 50% recently with the altcoin rally driven by Ripple\u2019s partial court victory.\n\nAdditionally, most of the altcoins that made gains following the 80% XRP pump have already lost them, returning markets to the status quo before the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nCoinGecko reported the total market cap remained sideways for the quarter, ending where it started the period at $1.2 trillion. It has remained sideways into the third quarter and is still at $1.2 trillion at the time of writing.\n\nTotal market capitalization Q2, 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe big winner for the period was Bitcoin, which outperformed the rest of the market with its gain of almost 7%, the report noted. However, the average daily trading volume for BTC declined 58.7% from the previous quarter.\n\nRelated: \u2018Altcoin season\u2019 anyone? Bitcoin dominance tumbles after XRP victory\n\n\u201cAfter a stellar Q1, Bitcoin still outperforms most major asset classes in Q2, only lagging behind the NASDAQ and S&P500,\u201d the report stated.\n\nWith most altcoins aside from XRP continuing to retreat at the moment, hopes for an early \"altseason\" are dwindling as Bitcoin remains the king of crypto.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "content": "Illustrative image of two commemorative bitcoins in front of China\u2019s national flag on a computer screen, January 8, 2022. (Photo: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/AFP)On Saturday, January 9, 2021, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto)\n\nIn two May reports, cryptocurrency-tracing firms Elliptic and Chainalysis indicated that chemical producers in China have been accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for ingredients for fentanyl, a lethal drug produced on a large scale in different countries worldwide.\n\nElliptic researchers found more than 90 China-based companies supplying fentanyl precursors. Ninety percent accept payments in Bitcoin and Tether, facilitating the laundering of billions of dollars. Seventeen of the companies even offered to provide fentanyl despite its ban in China since 2019.\n\nSeveral companies openly sold those precursors to customers in Mexico, who also paid with Tether or Bitcoin. Other companies offer a variety of other chemicals including synthetic opioid precursors, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, Elliptic indicated.\n\nThe cryptocurrency wallets of these firms received more than $27 million in thousands of transactions, with a 450 percent increase in transactions from one year to the next; a sum that allowed for the acquisition of precursors to produce fentanyl with an estimated value of $54 billion, Elliptic added.\n\nAccording to the company, chemical suppliers that accept cryptocurrencies circumvent foreign exchanges restrictions in China. This suggests the use of intermediaries, possibly from the Chinese government, to convert payments from local currency to cryptocurrencies, which would imply that the trade of fentanyl precursors with cryptocurrencies relies on services that act as entry and exit points for digital assets.\n\nThese \u201ccriminal organizations take advantage of cyberspace capabilities to coordinate and sell their products, no longer only on the darknet or deep web, but also on the open web,\u201d Yadira G\u00e1lvez, a security expert and academic at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told Di\u00e1logo on July 3.\n\nTaking responsibility\n\nChainalysis identified cryptocurrency addresses linked to Chinese sellers of fentanyl precursors, who received more than $37.8 million in cryptocurrencies since 2018. America, Europe, and Asia, have high exposure to these chemical sellers.\n\nThe blockchain analysis of the addresses of chemical dealers coincide with fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border, confirming regional patterns in cryptocurrency transactions related to fentanyl production identified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Chainalysis noted.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department on April 14 sanctioned and charged individuals and entities that used cryptocurrency addresses to sell fentanyl and other illegal synthetic drugs. Wuhan Shuokang Biological Technology and China-based Suzhou Xiaoli Pharmatech are two of these organizations.\n\nThese chemical companies sold fentanyl precursors to middlemen in Latin America, who in turn marketed them to Mexican drug cartels, such as the Sinaloa cartel, for the production of illicit fentanyl destined for U.S. markets, the Treasury Department said.\n\nG\u00e1lvez pointed out that China does not recognize the seriousness of the problem and stressed that \u201ccountries must assume their responsibility in the fight against illicit substances. Over the years it has been demonstrated that international cooperation is essential to stop the production, trafficking, and distribution of these types of drugs.\u201d\n\nStrong measures\n\nOn June 23, the U.S. government took firm action against four China-based companies, filing formal indictments for manufacturing and distributing fentanyl to the Mexican cartels Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation.\n\nOne of the companies involved, Hubei Amarvel Biotech, openly advertised on its website the shipment of these chemicals to the United States and Mexico. The other three companies are Anhui Rencheng Technology, Anhui Moker New Material Technology, and Hefei GSK Trade, all of which were implicated in similar crimes.\n\nGovernments should involve the private sector, especially pharmaceutical companies and laboratories, to encourage cooperation and the fight against money laundering, Chainalysis indicated. The United States places great emphasis on Chinese companies producing precursor chemicals for fentanyl.\n\nChallenges\n\n\u201cThis poses a challenge for law enforcement and authorities, both in the fentanyl trafficking chain and in demand and consumption management, which are facilitated by the use of cyberspace for transactions by these companies and criminal organizations to get their hands on the precursors,\u201d G\u00e1lvez said.\n\n\u201cIf Latin American governments do not strengthen their capacities in investigation, dismantling of criminal organizations, and physical presence in the territories, together with international cooperation, the insecurity and violence caused by these organizations will continue to be a major problem in the region,\u201d he added.\n\nDark web markets are key to the global distribution of fentanyl and similar substances, providing valuable information on opioid trafficking with cryptocurrencies. International collaboration and regulation are essential to combat this illegal trade and safeguard global health and safety, the Chainalysis study stressed."

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius is battling a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with billions of dollars in claims made by various parties. A new estimate by the Bank of the Future suggests that the troubled crypto lender could likely repay the claims if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) \u2014 two assets held by the firm \u2014 doubled their current market prices.\n\nSimon Dixon, the founder of Bank of the Future \u2014 a crypto-centered investment firm \u2014 tweeted the estimated price BTC and ETH would need to reach for Celsius to repay all its claims and keep all other assets.\n\nBased on the final deal with the Fahrenheit consortium, which won the bid to acquire the assets of Celsius in May, if the BTC price touches $54,879 and the ETH price reaches $3,750, Celsius could repay all claims from the price appreciation of both assets. In June, Celsius appealed in court to convert all its altcoins into Bitcoin and Ether to maximize the value of assets.\n\nEstimated price of BTC and ETH for full recovery. Source: Twitter\n\nDixon noted that these estimates are based on \u201cimperfect knowledge made by the BF [Bank of the Future] internal investment banking team with no access to privileged information.\u201d The new restructuring plan under Fahrenheit includes mining, institutional loans, investments valued at approximately $1.4 billion and $450 million in liquid crypto.\n\nThe firm also shared a comparison between Fahrenheit\u2019s recovery plans and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC) \u2014 a holding company affiliated with the Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust \u2014 wind-down plans. The total recovery under the orderly wind-down comes to $3.519 billion, which exceeds the total assets available at $3.417 billion. This discrepancy is accounted for by the variable cost.\n\nComparison between Fahrenheit plan and BRIC wind down. Source: Twitter\n\nThe return to retail borrowers is approximately $339 million. Bank of the Future estimates suggests the recovery is about 65% for both options, which could increase to about 75%, assuming 10% of claims are unclaimed. 41.4% of recovery under the Fahrenheit plan is in equity, with the remaining 58.6% in liquid crypto. Only 12.4% of recovery under BRIC orderly wind down is in equity, with the remaining 87.6% in liquid crypto.\n\nRelated: Celsius adds over 428K stETH to Lido\u2019s lengthening withdrawal queue\n\nDixon said creditors should fight to get out of the bankruptcy proceedings before the end of 2023, or before the price of BTC and ETH hit the estimated mark. He added that to avoid \u201canother rug pull, we will need to fight hard against it if it comes up.\u201c\n\nIt is very important that we get out of Chapter 11 before #Bitcoin & $ETH approach these numbers to avoid another rug pull that we will need to fight hard against if it comes up.\n\n\n\nEstimation of the price of #BTC and $ETH (50/50 basis) at which claims may be paid in full: $BTC\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PITQV3pIGM \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Learn More About Bitcoin Depot, the company behind many of the Bitcoin ATMs in North America (& how you can invest in their stock)\n\nWho Is Bitcoin Depot?\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen a Bitcoin ATM at your neighborhood gas station or convenience store, there\u2019s a good chance it was a Bitcoin Depot ATM. Since its founding in 2016, Bitcoin Depot has grown to become the largest Bitcoin ATM (or BTM, if you will, short for Bitcoin Teller Machine) network in North America.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares trade publicly on the Nasdaq exchange under the fitting ticker symbol BTM. Bitcoin Depot now has over 6,400 BTM kiosks across the US and Canada, making it (much) easier to buy Bitcoin compared to exchanges.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s how the company came to be. Founder Brandon Mintz learned about Bitcoin in 2013 but found the process of buying Bitcoin, well, difficult. Fast forward to today, and buying BTC still isn\u2019t always easy. Some exchanges make you feel like a circus poodle jumping through hoops.\n\nThere had to be a better \u2014 and more convenient \u2013 way to buy Bitcoin.\n\nNow, you can buy Bitcoin through thousands of BTM kiosks or BDCheckout locations located in popular convenience chains like Pilot, Circle K, and Royal Farms.\n\nWhat Do They Offer?\n\nBitcoin Depot\u2019s primary business is helping people buy Bitcoin through BTMs.\n\nHere\u2019s what a typical transaction looks like:\n\nYou decide to buy Bitcoin. Great idea.\n\nVisit a local store where you\u2019ve seen a BTM kiosk, or use the kiosk locator.\n\nProvide a valid phone number, first and last name, and email address.\n\nEnter the verification code you receive by SMS text message.\n\nDeposit cash into the BTM ($20 minimum).\n\nProvide your Bitcoin wallet address.\n\nTake your receipt or get a receipt by text.\n\nIn minutes, your Bitcoin will be sent to the wallet address you provided. Note: You may need to provide an ID for some larger transactions.\n\nYou can use the Bitcoin Depot mobile app (iOS and Android) as your BTC wallet, or you can use a standalone Bitcoin wallet like Electrum or Mycelium Wallet. Just scan a QR code. The Bitcoin Depot mobile app lets you send or receive Bitcoin, or you can use it for other cryptos as well, including DOGE, BCH, or ETH.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Depot offers other ways to buy Bitcoin.\n\nBuy Bitcoin through the mobile app.\n\nFund your Bitcoin wallet at a BDCheckout location.\n\nBuy BTC online at Bitcoin Depot (powered by Simplex).\n\nBitcoin Depot is all about making it easier to buy (and use) Bitcoin. Some crypto exchanges can take days to clear a deposit or verify your ID before you can trade. With Bitcoin Depot, you can complete your purchase in minutes.\n\nThe BTM kiosk walks you through the simple process, and you\u2019ll usually have your Bitcoin in your wallet in about 10 minutes \u2014 the amount of time it takes the Bitcoin network to mine a new block. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll get a receipt with the details and a customer service phone number.\n\nBDCheckout\n\nIn addition to its standard Bitcoin kiosks, Bitcoin Depot also has about 5,000 BDCheckout locations. Circle K, for example, has over 2,400 locations that support \u201cover-the-counter\u201d Bitcoin purchases.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The service requires the Bitcoin Depot mobile app. You can use the app to find a participating location from about 5,000 available. Tap \u201cload cash\u201d in the app and choose your purchase amount. The app generates a barcode, which the retailer scans so you can complete the purchase. Shortly after, the BTC you purchased is sent to your wallet.\n\nBitcoin ATM Fees\n\nAs with any ATM or kiosk, expect a convenience fee (and markup) to buy Bitcoin through a Bitcoin ATM. Network fees to send Bitcoin to your wallet are included in the purchase with Bitcoin Depot, but \u2014 make no mistakes \u2014 you won\u2019t be buying BTC at market price. To be candid, fees can be much higher with any Bitcoin ATM compared to buying through the advanced trading interface on an exchange. And even the quick-buy boxes you\u2019ll find on exchanges can bring much higher fees.\n\nWhether using a Bitcoin ATM or a crypto exchange, always check to be sure the amount of Bitcoin you\u2019ll receive makes sense for you and your crypto budget.\n\nWhere Can You Find Their Bitcoin ATMs?\n\nBitcoin Depot BTM kiosks are common at popular convenience stores and gas stations like Circle K, Royal Farms, and Pilot, making it easy to find a location near you or when traveling. Use the BTM locator in the app or online to find a location near you.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nBitcoin Depot isn\u2019t the only Bitcoin ATM company out there \u2014 and they\u2019re not all created equal. Some companies only operate a handful of machines and may not have a dedicated customer service team like Bitcoin Depot. Be careful out there. Always do your own research before feeding your hard-earned money into a Bitcoin kiosk."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDemocratic Presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr. has two daring new policies for his eventual administration: Exempt Bitcoin (BTC) holders from capital gains tax and back the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills with a percentage of hard currencies, such as BTC.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is among the hardest currencies and the Kennedy administration is going to encourage its proliferation and propagation,\u201d said Kennedy at a political action committee (PAC) event dubbed Heal-the-Divide.\n\nThe first of Kennedy\u2019s audacious ideas, to exempt capital gains tax when Bitcoin is exchanged for U.S. Dollars, was accompanied by a recognition of its downsides. \u201cThis will give windfall to many Bitcoiners that have a great deal of money,\u201d said the presidential candidate, but added that \u201cthe benefits dwarf the downfalls.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is a bid to counter moves from crypto-friendly countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Germany and Portugal. He thinks the tax exemption policy will spur investment, ensure citizen privacy, and incentivize top talent to stay in the United States.\n\n\u201cMy administration\u2019s mission is to make America the hub of cryptocurrency and particularly of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the 68-year old, it will also make it more difficult for governments to \u201cweaponize currency against free speech.\u201d He touched upon the idea of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and that he intends on creating strong barriers for them to come to fruition.\n\nHe doesn't just have polarizing views on cryptocurrency.\n\nKennedy said during a Twitter Spaces event with Tesla CEO Elon Musk last month that he\u2019s \u201cconvinced\u201d the 2004 presidential election was stolen because of voter fraud and that mass shootings in the U.S. have been linked to prescription drugs. He\u2019s also recently come under fire for alleging that \u201cCOVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA spokesperson for the White House has called the claims \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d In a June survey of voters, Emerson College found that 15% of respondents said they plan to vote for Kennedy in the primary.\n\nKennedy\u2019s second Bitcoin announcement is to back both the U.S. Dollar and US. Treasury Bills with hard assets\u2013namely gold, silver, platinum and Bitcoin. His plan, however, is to \u201cstart small,\u201d backing 1% of t-bills with a combination of these assets, pointing to Bitcoin as what he considers to be \u201cthe world\u2019s hardest asset.\u201d\n\nAside from these two intrepid proposals, Kennedy didn\u2019t hold back on other views on the state of the U.S. economy. In his eyes, the major threat to America is inflation, and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike interest rates, which is \u201cwiping out poor people.\u201d He added that he wishes to see \u201csensible regulation,\u201d and for the authorities to recognize Bitcoin is not a security."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin has been stuck for about a month, but its chart shows it could be near the start of a new cycle, making it a good time for long-term investors to add to their positions, according to Canaccord Genuity. Bitcoin on Wednesday was hovering just below the $30,000 level it retook four weeks ago. Still, it struggled to break above that mark earlier in the year and that continues to be the case now. Both bitcoin and ether are flat for the week, down 1% for the month and up about 7% since the rally on June 21 following BlackRock's bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. Multiple closing prices for both crypto assets show their short- and intermediate-term price trends are higher and support further upside, Canaccord's technical analyst Javed Mirza said in a note Tuesday. He told investors to \"utilize pending near-term weakness to add exposure near important technical support at their 50-day moving averages.\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin has been stuck at $30,000 but Canaccord Genuity sees 28% upside in the medium term Mirza said bitcoin can run another 28.3% higher from current levels, targeting $38,202, if it continues to close above $26,249 over several weeks. Investors should expect the first level of resistance at about $30,493 on the upside and the next at $31,476, he said. Should the bitcoin price turn lower, first support would be at $28,717, about the level of its 50-day moving average. The next level down would be at about $27,441, a level it has not seen in a month. For ether, he sees another 55.6% upside from current levels, targeting $2,952, if it can maintain a multiweek close of $1,935. Looking at the long term, bitcoin and ether also recently reclaimed their four-year moving averages of about $27,022 and $1,592, respectively. \"This confirms the long-term trend is now up, a strong technical positive, and is consistent with a four-year cycle taking hold in cryptocurrencies,\" Mirza wrote. Bitcoin historically has followed a four-year cycle tied to its halving events \u2014 when the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency. Lately, investors have been drawing similarities between the cryptocurrency's recent behavior and its moves in the lead up to the last halving. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "UK Court of Appeal rules Craig Wright's copyright claim over Bitcoin file format can proceed - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Dr. Craig Wright notched another win in the United Kingdom\u2019s Court of Appeal today, as the court granted Dr. Wright\u2019s appeal over his copyright in the Bitcoin file format. As a result, his copyright and database rights case against the BTC partnership\u2014which includes Core developers and entities within the ecosystem such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN)\u2014will proceed on all fronts.\n\nDr. Wright had originally sued the BTC partnership which includes 26 defendants all of whom are involved in the use or promotion of the BTC network, arguing that the two airdrops which effectively carved out the BTC network from the original Bitcoin were breaches of his copyright in the Bitcoin white paper and the Bitcoin file format, and had additionally amounted to breaches of his database rights in the Bitcoin blockchain. Given how much of the industry went on to revolve around this new BTC, a finding that its creation was a breach of Dr. Wright\u2019s rights has the potential to alter the digital asset industry forever.\n\nThe High Court allowed the suit to be served on the defendants with respect to the copyright claim in the white paper and the database rights claim in the Bitcoin blockchain. However, the judge found that there was no serious issue to be tried in respect of the Bitcoin file format claim, finding that the Bitcoin file format was not defined with sufficient precision and objectivity in order to be subject to copyright\u2014a requirement known as \u2018fixation.\u2019\n\nToday, the court of appeal unanimously overruled the lower court. They found that the lower judge had \u2018several flaws\u2019 in his reasoning, beginning with the finding that Dr. Wright had failed to identify any relevant \u2018work\u2019 which defines the structure of the Bitcoin file format:\n\n\u201cThe work Dr. Wright relies upon, the Bitcoin File Format, has been clearly identified. The question of how and when that work was fixed is a different one. Dr. Wright\u2019s case is that the work was fixed when the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain was written on 3 January 2009.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeal went on to say that there was no requirement that there be additional content defining or describing the format in order for \u2018fixation\u2019 to be established. They agreed with Dr. Wright\u2019s argument\u2014which was rejected by the lower court\u2014that third parties have been able to deduce the structure comprising the Bitcoin file format from the blockchain and thus proved that the work was identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity.\n\nDamon Parker of Harcus Parker, which represents Dr. Wright, said:\n\n\u201cWe welcome this significant ruling which enables Dr. Wright to advance his claim for copyright in the Bitcoin File Format which potentially affects all future use, and marketing, of Bitcoin and will prove to be a crucial development in intellectual property law.\u201d\n\nDr. Wright said in a statement:\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the outcome of this appeal. As many developers do not fully document their entire body of work, this appeal shows that, even without documentation, their work is still considered to be capable of copyright protection.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment is a powerful one. Though the Justices were only considering whether Dr. Wright\u2019s claim had a serious prospect of success, the ruling nonetheless amounts to an encouraging rubberstamp from the second-highest court in the country. Now, all three limbs of Dr. Wright\u2019s lawsuit against the BTC partnership will be in play when the case eventually goes to trial. All 26 BTC Core defendants will have to defend against the claim that they breached Dr. Wright\u2019s copyright in the Bitcoin white paper; that they breached his copyright in the Bitcoin file format; and that they breached his rights in the Bitcoin database.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Why isn't smart money's effect on crypto's original promise discussed more? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ignoring the original, utility-driven ideas introduced in the early documents on digital cash became the new normal once adopters stumbled upon a cryptocurrency price ticker. Are new price tickers a sign of innovation?\n\nThere is a critical paradox when thinking about inventions and new things. Culture influences technology, while the technology itself influences culture. This also applies to distributed ledger technology (DLT). However, the case of cryptocurrency is more curious than other innovations because it is not currently used in the way the inventor initially proposed.\n\nSome might argue that the way cryptocurrencies are currently interpreted \u2014 primarily as investments rather than transactional units for the most part \u2014 is more harmful than beneficial. Smart money helps drive these possibly malicious use cases of crypto, and the main question is \u2014 why is that?\n\nSmart money\n\nSmart money refers to financial organizations or individuals with significant resources, expertise and capital. More specifically, the money that flows in and out of central banks, funds, venture firms, or even the wallets of individual investors is smart money.\n\nThis type of capital is essential for discussions of new technologies, regardless of the industry or surrounding markets, and the phenomenon appears in various economic landscapes \u2014 everything from JP Morgan financing Thomas Edison\u2019s inventions to venture firms driving the internet startup equity bubble from 1995 to 2000.\n\nThe growth of the cryptocurrency venture capital market in terms of deal count and capital invested. Source: Galaxy Research\n\nThere are other issues that inventors and builders face when there is a lot of investor involvement, but the main concern comes from smart money utility being a limiting factor and the lack of discourse around this in the DLT space.\n\nCommon economic flaws persist in crypto markets\n\nThe problem of crypto adoption may not be as bad as it seems, as only small, tightly-knit communities are working on more attractive use cases and paths to mainstream crypto adoption.\n\nThis can force the creation of counterproductive markets where retail and institutional investors presume intrinsic value from either scarcity or thin air, and the utilitarian side of novel systems is only seen by underdog pioneers who don\u2019t have much leverage at the time. Although blockchain technology operates in a decentralized manner through peer-to-peer node interactions, even in the early days of crypto, when the whales were just appearing, potential problems such as concentration of wealth and purchasable network control began to emerge.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of cryptocurrency ecosystems, token design, their relation to fiat currency and the lack of regulation made market manipulation easier and more attractive to indulge in for malicious actors. The zero-regulation part was as appealing to institutions as it was to retail traders or criminals.\n\nWall Street Journal reported that groups of online traders who gather on messaging servers to collaborate on pump-and-dump schemes have manipulated nearly $1 billion in 2018 alone, which would be much harder to achieve in a traditional market.\n\nWhy was Bitcoin invented in the first place?\n\nConcerning crypto use cases, the token-as-an-investment feature has become so mainstream that, collectively, we hardly ever think about Bitcoin (BTC) and its alternatives as digital cash or tools for probing decentralized systems to advance our everyday lives.\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 and some other periods in our economic history were mostly caused by influential people in the financial world whose aims did not necessarily relate to those of the average market participant. The idea of decentralization has been considered a potential solution to the problem of market control and influence. However, as discussed, today\u2019s DLT designs still cannot protect the markets around them from manipulation.\n\nThe crucial part, however, is that technology like blockchains doesn\u2019t stagnate because of the ever-increasing involvement of smart money, which continues to push the idea that crypto works best as an investment, usually because of limited supply or just plain virality.\n\nIgnorant growth of mainstream adoption\n\nAlthough smart money brings crypto into the public eye by investing in tokens or startups, bringing more mainstream attention to the space, the downside is that newly minted crypto enthusiasts enter the space with a crypto-as-an-investment mindset.\n\nThey may then introduce crypto to their friends as a \u201cbuying opportunity\u201d while having their financial interests in the matter. This can create a cycle that vaguely resembles a horrid pyramid scheme, MLM or pump-and-dump itself without the participants realizing it.\n\nA pump-and-dump scheme. Source: LivingFromTrading.com\n\nIf early crypto adopters had focused on implementing the ideas explored in the now-famous Bitcoin white paper instead of seeing crypto as a forex market, today\u2019s cryptocurrency use cases could look very different.\n\nAn ironic part of blockchain history is that while criminals \u201cpioneered\u201d real digital cash transactions on the dark web, the rest of the world traded, kept buying or simply forgot about cryptocurrencies until they became big.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIt is hard to say if there is a solution to this cryptocurrency abuse. It would be difficult to effectively encourage institutions to pay attention to startups building DLT systems for real-world, scalable use \u2014 just as it\u2018s difficult to convince traditional organizations or governments to adopt crypto without promising a financial return.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned underdog inventors and builders who, in recent years, have been working on things like decentralized file storage, off- and on-chain data and transaction scaling should be enormously appreciated, acknowledged and introduced to smart money as often as possible. Such a prescription might just help users shake off the idea that crypto can be little more than an investment.\n\nKirthana Devaser is an economist turned financial writer and speaker in the Web3 space.

        "content": "Wed 19 Jul 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nAccording to analysts, the ongoing sell-off in the US dollar has always pulled bitcoin down. But bitcoin\u2019s correlation with DYX won\u2019t last forever, argues Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis.\n\nBitcoin and DYX, a highly complex relationship\n\nFor Robert Kiyosaki, we can expect a \u201cgiant crash\u201d of the US dollar. A situation which, according to the author of P\u00e8re Riche P\u00e8re Pauvre, is favorable to a Bull Run Bitcion.\n\nBut the author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter, Acheson, sees things differently. CoinDesk shared his analysis of bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the dollar index recently.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s worth noting that the negative correlation between BTC and DYX had eroded a few weeks ago. During this period, bitcoin was struggling to consolidate due to a continued strong sell-off in the greenback.\n\nMoreover, the dollar index fell by 2.26% last week. It even fell below 100.00, its lowest level since April 2022. Strangely enough, bitcoin had stabilized between $30,000 and $32,000.\n\nDoes this confirm Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s thesis?\n\nAccording to Acheson:\n\n\u201cThe negative relationship between DYX and BTC is likely to recover, as fluctuations in the dollar index influence global liquidity conditions, which in turn affect valuations of risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it seems hard to foresee the end of this correlation between BTC and DXY any time soon. Its place on the global economic chessboard seems solid despite recent de-dollarization efforts.\n\n\u201cHowever, the BTC-DXY relationship will be difficult to shake for a long time to come. It\u2019s not just because the US dollar is the denominator of the most quoted pair for the crypto-asset (and when the denominator loses value, the ratio rises, and corollary all things similar) \u2013 it\u2019s also because a weaker dollar boosts global liquidity by giving US dollar debt holders around the world more room to breathe,\u201d says Acheson in yesterday\u2019s newsletter.\n\nAn indestructible dollar?\n\nWhether India trades with Saudi Arabia using its own currency, the dollar remains a global reserve currency. It has always maintained its hegemony in international trade, debt and bank borrowing.\n\nSo, when the dollar rises in value, borrowers are confronted with high costs, and as a result, ensure minimal exposure to risky assets. When the dollar rises sharply, the opposite effect occurs.\n\n\u201cThe dollar\u2019s decline looks solid,\u201d continues Acheson, against a backdrop of disinflation in the United States.

The platform reportedly uses AI technology, analysis, and algorithms to send trading signals to partnered brokers to make cryptocurrency trades which simplify the trading process.\n\nUsers deposit fiat currency funds into their broker wallet via one of the accepted payment methods (debit or credit card), and the bot makes trades on their behalf.\n\nThe robot scans the market and finalizes trades for users. However, profits are not guaranteed. Users can set their own trading parameters if they have a trading strategy, or they can make use of fully automated trading.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\ude80 Claimed Win Rate: 88% \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: 2% commission on profits \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Free \u231b Withdrawal Timeframe: 24 - 48 Hours \ud83d\udcb1 Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC \ud83d\udcb2 Supported Fiats: USD, EUR, GBP, CHF \ud83d\udcca Leverage: 1000:1 \ud83d\udcf1 Native Mobile App: No \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Free Demo Account: Yes \ud83c\udfa7 Customer Support: Email, Phone, Online Form \u2705 Verification required: KYC \ud83d\udd01 Automated Trading: Yes \ud83d\udcc8 CFD Available Yes\n\nPros And Cons Of Using Bitcoin Circuit\n\nPros Fast, no-nonsense account registration\n\nIntuitive user interface\n\nDemo trading options\n\nAccount manager support\n\nVarious charts and tools Cons Some fake reviews online\n\nAuto trading bots and leveraged trades are risky\n\nOnly available in some jurisdictions\n\nWho is The Bitcoin Circuit Owner?\n\nBitcoin Circuit was allegedly developed by two brothers with an interest in Math and the market in general. They combined their expertise to ensure all traders have the opportunity to trade in the crypto market without having to do complex equations or predictions. Those with little experience in the cryptocurrency market should be able to use Bitcoin Circuit to automate trading activities and increase their understanding of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Circuit website, the owners say that the bot is constantly updated based on market trends for a better experience. As the website doesn't name the owners, we can't be certain who they are or what experience they have.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Circuit\n\nBelow is a brief overview of how to get started with Bitcoin Circuit. We'll go into more detail later in this review.\n\nGo to Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s official website and register for an account Deposit a minimum of $250 as per the bot\u2019s requirements Customize Bitcoin Circuit and trade. The use of the autotrade function can help you in the beginning if you are looking to better understand the ups and downs of the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Markets, Assets, And Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit provides access to some of the most popular tradable cryptocurrencies. These include:\n\nAdditionally, the robot allows forex trading, thus hosting plenty of fiat currencies, including USD, EUR, CHF, etc. On Bitcoin Circuit you cannot trade other financial instrument classes besides cryptocurrencies and forex.\n\nWhat Leverage Trading Options Are There?\n\nBitcoin Circuit\u2019s partner brokers support margin trades on CFD (Contract for Difference) assets. When users trade CFDs, they bet on the underlying asset\u2019s value without ever owning those coins.\n\nWe could not confirm the margins on Bitcoin Circuit. However, some sources suggest 1:1000 leverage on trades with certain brokers.\n\nWe recommend caution when trading with leverage. The crypto market is volatile, and margin trades can be risky. If the market does not move in your favor, you can lose money quickly. Do enough research and only make trades you can afford to lose. Also, only experienced traders should practice leveraged trading.\n\nIf you want to know more about leveraged trading, take a look at our comprehensive guides:\n\nWhat Are The Spreads?\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find much information on Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s spreads. Different brokers will often feature varying spreads. Expect these percentages to change as the market fluctuates.\n\nFees, Limits, And Payment Options On Bitcoin Circuit\n\nHow Much Does Bitcoin Circuit Cost?\n\nThere are no commissions or spreads with Bitcoin Circuit itself, as well as no subscription, transaction, or inactivity fees. However, note that the crypto robot is connected to reputable crypto brokers with varying fees. To ensure you enjoy your experience, it is best to confirm a broker\u2019s charges and ensure they fit your budget. Most importantly, test the broker via a demo trading account to understand the costs applicable when you trade using real money.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat Are The Payment Methods Accepted By Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit clients can deposit funds into their accounts via a few different methods. These include:\n\nCredit cards\n\nDebit cards\n\nVisa\n\nMastercard\n\nPayPal\n\nWire transfer\n\nBitcoin Circuit will not charge for these deposits, though your bank may add fees for the transaction. Withdrawals can take up to 48 hours until they appear in your bank account.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Circuit Also Charge Fees And Commissions?\n\nBitcoin Circuit takes a small percentage (around 2%) on any profits made using its bot-based trades. However, you will only pay commissions once you make money.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Trade Sizes And Limits\n\nBitcoin Circuit requires a minimum deposit of $250 to make your first trade. However, there is no maximum trade size. Brokers set trade limits. Consult with your broker directly to find out minimum or maximum trade limits.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Platform\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Circuit Work?\n\nBitcoin Circuit works similarly to other automated trading robots. Clients create a trading account and pair with a broker, depositing $250 to make their first trade. Users set trading parameters and determine leverage limits that match their strategy. The platform then makes trades, reportedly based on AI, algorithms, and market analysis.\n\nWhat Devices Can I Use Bitcoin Circuit On?\n\nClients can access Bitcoin Circuit on any device with a web browser. This includes Chrome or Safari. However, some users may have difficulty on mobile devices. Also, Bitcoin Circuit does not have a dedicated mobile app. You can use Bitcoin Circuit on the following devices:\n\nDesktop computers\n\nLaptops\n\niOS devices\n\nAndroid devices\n\nTablets\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Circuit in My Country?\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Circuit available? United Kingdom No Canada No Australia Yes USA No Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nWhat Exchanges And Brokers Does Bitcoin Circuit Partner With?\n\nBitcoin Circuit works alongside numerous brokers who offer CFD trading. That being said, we could not find any information on specific brokers. However, you can search for reviews for your paired broker once you create an account.\n\nSome users have been connected with unregulated brokers, which are less trustworthy than regulated ones.\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Available In My Language?\n\nBitcoin Circuit is available in four languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nDutch\n\nNorwegian\n\nSpanish\n\nChoose your language from a menu at the top of the homepage.\n\nHow Easy Is It to Use Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit features an intuitive interface that is easy to use and allows users to browse assets and CFDs whether they are new or experienced in the market. Clients can adjust parameters to suit their goals and try to establish greater control over Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s automatic trades.\n\nThe site has different charts to help clients make decisions. The bot will use this information independently to make trades as well, so you don\u2019t have to do any analysis if you prefer.\n\nHowever, automated trading robots are one of the riskiest ways to trade, especially when trading with leverage. Users should avoid trading with high leverage and only spend what they can afford, even if the trading platform makes it look easy.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nThe amount you can earn will vary based on the success (or failure) of your positions. So whilst it is possible to make money in cryptocurrency, it is also possible to lose money too.\n\nNote that Bitcoin Circuit has a claimed win rate in various locations of between 85-92%. This win rate can not be verified online. Therefore, you should be aware that it may not be correct.\n\nOverall, have a plan before activating Bitcoin Circuit to automate your crypto trades. Calculate your potential returns considering tax deductions to the IRS. Most importantly, have a trading journal to note down your progress and be open to learning from the errors you make along the way.\n\nKey Features\n\nBitcoin Circuit has several key features that help users navigate the trading platform. The robot has numerous tools and functions to help users trade CFDs from customer support to demo accounts. Some features include:\n\nIntuitive Interface\n\nBitcoin Circuit has a user-friendly interface that benefits both beginner and seasoned traders. View CFD contracts, set trading parameters, and browse essential facts and figures without hassle.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nBitcoin Circuit claims to scrutinize the market and use algorithms to decide on which trades to execute for users, whether they have established their own trading criteria or prefer to go fully automated. The bot uses the most recent data to execute informed trades.\n\nDemo Trader Account\n\nBitcoin Circuit (like many other trading platforms) has a demo trading account so users can practice making trades with leverage before risking their funds. This is a great way to decide if the site is right for you and develop a strategy.\n\nSecurity And Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Legit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit\u2019s legitimacy is dubious. Several reviews online claim the website is a scam, and users may lose their deposit within 24 hours.\n\nIn addition, some claims suggest that Bitcoin Circuit pairs users with unregulated brokers. However, the website states that you will be paired with a certified broker without detailing who certifies them.\n\nTrading CFDs may be risky if you are new to crypto trading. If you want to use a bot (due to lack of experience), set trading criteria to match your strategy and only deposit what you can afford to lose. We suggest reading a wide selection of reviews on any trading platform before adding funds.\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Safe?\n\nWe cannot guarantee the safety of your funds or information when dealing with Bitcoin Circuit. Users have to sign up with their broker through an account verification procedure. However, these brokers may be unregulated.\n\nThey do not mention any security features on the Bitcoin Circuit website. As such, we could not verify whether your information is encrypted or secure.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nBased on information on Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s website, your trading funds are secured on brokers\u2019 platforms regulated by tier-one authorities. Also, this robot is highly encrypted and complies with international AML and KYC policies to safeguard your data and email.\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Regulated?\n\nWe could not find any information on whether Bitcoin Circuit is regulated or not. We recommend only choosing trading platforms regulated by official bodies and adhering to a standard set of practices to protect your funds and information.\n\nDo I Have To Verify My Account With Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nYes. You have to verify your email address before you can use Bitcoin Circuit. You will then be paired with an accounts manager to deposit funds into your broker wallet.\n\nBitcoin Circuit claims that they accept all new client registration forms provided you follow the link in the confirmation email.\n\nYour broker may require extra KYC verification before you can start trading.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Circuit Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Circuit monitors the performance of the crypto markets to identify new trends that could benefit you. It then uses the money deposited on a trading platform to execute trades on your behalf. Note that Bitcoin Circuit will only activate a trade once the preset positions for the trade have been met. Some of the trading strategies and features incorporated in Bitcoin Circuit include;\n\nMulti-device support for crypto trading\n\nDedicated account manager\n\nWide range of tools to assist with trading\n\nPrice Trend Analysis\n\nExtra Information\n\nEducational Resources\n\nThe good news is that you can access plenty of educational materials on crypto trading from the brokers Bitcoin Circuit partners with. These materials include guides, articles, webinars, recorded videos, eBooks, seminars, etc. Some of these brokers also feature social trading platforms you can join to meet your peers and learn from each other. In addition, there are many website blogs, YouTube channels, and podcasts to take advantage of and improve your skill level.\n\nBitcoin Circuit offers numerous tools and charts to help users better understand the market. However, the site also encourages users to go fully automated rather than manually trade CFDs. The bot reportedly uses market analysis and AI protocols to make trades on your behalf.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nBitcoin Circuit Customer Support Details Bitcoin Circuit support email Not available Bitcoin Circuit support contact number Not available Bitcoin Circuit live chat option Yes Bitcoin Circuit other support options\u2026 Online Form\n\nDemo Account\n\nBitcoin Circuit offers a risk-free demo account funded with virtual funds to test the platform and explore the available options before using real money in the live market. We highly recommend free demo accounts for beginners since it is also the best way to gauge your skill level and boost your confidence through practicing how to trade with a robot. The bot\u2019s demo account is user-friendly and a free version of the live account. However, you must register with Bitcoin Circuit and make the necessary minimum deposit to access its demo account.\n\nHow To Get Started With Bitcoin Circuit\n\nIf you still want to create a Bitcoin Circuit account, follow these steps:\n\nCreate An Bitcoin Circuit Account Go to the Bitcoin Circuit homepage and complete the sign-up form at the top of the page. Input your full name, phone number, and email. Then, confirm your email address. Speak To An Account Manager Once you have confirmed your registration, you will be contacted by an account manager who will oversee the next step of the trading process and set you up with a broker. Deposit Funds Once you have passed any KYC procedures, add the $250 deposit into your broker wallet with one of the accepted payment methods. Get Familiar With The Demo Account We recommend using the demo account to practice on Bitcoin Circuit before enabling live trades and risking your money before. This will give you a chance to get familiar with the software. Make Your First Trade Once you understand the trading platform, you can start trading. Choose between automated trading (choose any automated trading software) or manual trading and set your trading criteria to suit your trading strategy.\n\nHow to Delete Bitcoin Circuit Account?\n\nYou can delete your account on the bot\u2019s platform through its settings page or by contacting the Bitcoin Circuit support team.\n\nHow to Withdraw Money From Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit is not responsible for securing your money, which is why it partners with brokers. Generally, to withdraw your earnings with this robot, you must do so through the broker it is connected with. Here is the withdrawal procedure.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s connected broker\u2019s trading platform and sign into your trading/investment account Go to your wallet, where you should click withdraw to start the withdrawal process Enter your preferred payment method supported by the broker Enter an amount to withdraw in your preferred fiat currency Click continue to initiate the withdrawal process, which should take up to 24 hours to complete.\n\nRemember, Bitcoin Circuit partner brokers make withdrawals using fiat currencies and not crypto assets. You must convert your cryptocurrencies into fiat currency to complete the withdrawal process.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Celebrity/Company Endorsements\n\nThere is plenty of online speculation about Bitcoin Circuit's connections to various companies and celebrities.

Below we sample some of the top Bitcoin Circuit reviews.\n\nWhat Are The Top Bitcoin Circuit Reviews on Forums and Reddit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit hasn't yet garnered any reviews on Reddit.

Here, the top reviews state that Bitcoin Circuit is trustworthy and user-friendly. Most users also find it affordable, primarily if you use it on a broker that fits your budget.

If you don't want to use Bitcoin Circuit, check out some of our other reviews:\n\nFinal Thoughts On Bitcoin Circuit\n\nBitcoin Circuit assures users that automated trading is suitable for all traders. However, you are much more likely to lose your money than make a profit using this type of automated trading software.\n\nThe website claims two brothers (unnamed) came up with the idea for the alleged algorithm and that it was a sure-fire bet in the market. However, most clients lose their funds before making any money.\n\nThe market is highly volatile, and traders should be wary of any auto trading platform that promises good results. While manual trading can limit your chance of loss (if you are an experienced trader), you are still likely to leave this site with less money than you started.\n\nIn addition, leveraged trading is riskier still. We could not confirm the leverage margins. However, similar sites offer leverage of up to 1000%, which could land you in a lot of debt if the market does not go your way.\n\nMake sure you do your own research and trade what you can afford. If you are looking to trade with a broker as a beginner, we suggest trying the likes of eToro instead.\n\nThis is not investment advice.\n\nInformation is provided for educational purposes only and is not investment advice. We do not offer financial advice, advisory, brokerage, or investment advice services. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. The value of your investment can go down as well as up, and you may not get back the amount you invested. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions."

        "content": "Standard Chartered has forecast bitcoin will trade as high as $120,000 (\u00a393,000) by the end of 2024, as the bank reassessed a previous prediction as 'too conservative'.\n\nHaving previously predicted a 2024 peak of $100,000, the London-listed bank now thinks bitcoin could reach $50,000 by the end of this year as profits among the cyrptocurrency's miners continue to grow.\n\nBitcoin is up 80.5 per cent this year in dollar terms to $29,965, and 69 per cent against sterling to \u00a323,200.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank predict that Bitcoin could reach $50,000 by the end of the year and high as $120,000 by the end of 2024\n\nBitcoin mining is the process in which transactions are made as new bitcoins enter the circulation in a blockchain.\n\nThe purpose of mining is to validate transactions to prevent fraud, as well as adding new blocks to the blockchain ledger.\n\nBitcoin mining involves using a powerful computer to solve complex hash puzzles and in turn the first user to solve the puzzle is rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nStandard Chartered said: 'Based on their profitability, miners decide how much of the new BTC supply... reaches the market.\n\n'Increased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher.'\n\nThe 12 largest listed miners sold 106 per cent of newly mined bitcoin in the first quarter this year, with the figure pushed above 100 per cent as a result of stockpiles, according to the bank.\n\nStandard Chartered expects this figure to fall 'slightly below' 100 per cent for the second quarter, but a bitcoin price of $50,000 would see this fall to 20 to 30 per cent.\n\nIt said: 'That is a net annual reduction in selling of BTC 250,000 \u2013 a large number relative to bitcoin market turnover.\n\n'We previously predicted that this driver would add $10,000 to the bitcoin price; we now think this estimate is too conservative, and we therefore see upside to our end 2024 target of around $120,000.'\n\nHowever, not all investors are as confident as Standard Chartered on bitcoin's trajectory.\n\nCrypto expert Glen Goodman told This is Money the bank's $120,000 prediction 'feels like a number plucked out of the air'.\n\nGoodman said: 'Standard Chartered laid out a solid bullish case, but there are some major red flags for bitcoin we can't ignore.\n\n'US financial regulators are pummeling crypto relentlessly with court cases and investigations.\n\n'Unless they have a change of heart, it's going to get harder and harder to do crypto business in the world's richest country.\n\n'Also, many economists expect a recession next year, which could seriously depress asset markets including stocks and bitcoin.\n\n'Though if a recession encourages central bankers to reduce interest rates, that could eventually give stocks and bitcoin a boost.\n\n'The bottom line is bitcoin is at the mercy of future events. Some, like 2024's halving, are known, others, like possible recession, are unknown. So $120,000 feels like a number plucked out of the air.'"

        "content": "What is Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit is a cryptocurrency trading robot that reportedly works on a highly customizable AI algorithm. Not much is known about the bot\u2019s history since its official website does not say anything about its creators. However, it seems that entrepreneurs in the FinTech industry created the product. The intelligent computer program is said to be equipped with algorithms to enable it to trade Bitcoin better than human beings.\n\nBitcoin Profit works according to the rules of auto trading robots. The automated trading software decides which buy or sell orders are placed. Calculations and probability assumptions are supposed to make it possible to make profits.\n\nBeginner crypto traders can use the default settings, which execute trades when certain Bitcoin setups. Meanwhile, more experienced traders can customize the parameters to test different strategies on the trading platform.\n\nBitcoin Profit also supports trading on multiple crypto-crypto trading pairs and is said to be 10x better than the best Wall Street trader. Of course, these claims cannot be completely verified. The automated trading platform claims to guarantee users a high win rate and a success record of more than 90%. Again, to us, this seems quite unrealistic. It monitors signals and trends in the cryptocurrency market to determine the most profitable trading approach. Also, when compared to other cryptocurrency robots, Bitcoin Profit claims to be 0.01 seconds faster. Bitcoin Profit has automated and manual modes as well.\n\nBitcoin Profit Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \u2705 Is It a Scam or Legit?

Together with other professional traders and software developers, John allegedly established this trading robot with cutting-edge technology. In addition, the robot was created with new traders in mind who still have zero experience trading the crypto market. The best element about Bitcoin Profit owners is that they promise to keep updating the robot to ensure it is on top of developing trends. They claim to do so by thoroughly analyzing the cryptocurrency markets and ensuring that the AI features in the robot are updated and at their best performance. Most importantly, the robot partners with tier-one regulated brokers for maximum safety.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Profit\n\nAs a newbie with trading robots, you must be wondering how to get started with Bitcoin Profit. Below is a brief overview of the procedure since we will get into the in-depth process later in this guide.\n\nRegister for a Trading Account Deposit Funds Trade\n\nBitcoin Profit Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit doesn't let you trade other assets such as forex, stock, commodities, etc. The bot\u2019s only focus is on the cryptocurrency market, meaning you should consider other options if you want to diversify your trading portfolio with assets from other markets. As mentioned, the robot is beginner-friendly, and all you need to do is ensure it meets your trading needs to get started.\n\nBitcoin Profit currently supports the following cryptocurrencies and more:\n\nWhat leverage trading options are there with Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit collaborates with regulated brokers to offer leveraged trading to its users. Since leverage trading uses derivative products, you do not need to own a Bitcoin wallet to store your funds. As such, fiat currency would suffice.\n\nNote: Trading with leverage is highly risky and if not done with caution, could lead to huge losses within a short time. Do not attempt leveraged trading unless you have done detailed research.\n\nWhat are the spreads on Bitcoin Profit?\n\nSimilar to its leverage options, there is not much information given about the spreads associated with Bitcoin Profit. However, the trading platform boasts of competitive spreads and promising returns compared to the industry average although these claims cannot be verified. If you're interested in spread betting, check out our guide to cryptocurrency spread betting.\n\nFees, limits, and payment options on Bitcoin Profit\n\nHow much does Bitcoin Profit cost?\n\nUnlike other trading robots, Bitcoin Profit does not have any subscription fees or commissions on its use, which means that the system is 100% free to sign up and use the demo account. However, traders need to make a minimum deposit of at least $250 in their trading account to start live trading.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Profit?\n\nTo start trading with the Bitcoin Profit system, you need to make an initial minimum deposit of at least $250 using any of the following payment methods:\n\nCredit card\n\nSkrill\n\nMerchant Pay\n\nVisa\n\nMastercard\n\nSafepay\n\nGiropay\n\nThe Bitcoin Profit website does not charge any transaction or deposit fees from the above methods of payment.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Profit also charge fees and commissions?\n\nBitcoin Profit does not charge any fees or commissions on transactions. However, due to its partnership with brokerages, you might be charged some commission on your profits made from trading.\n\nBitcoin Profit trade sizes and limits\n\nThere are no trade or withdrawal limits on Bitcoin Profit, which means that the trading platform supports budgets from all types of traders. Trades and withdrawals can take place at any time although it might take up to 24 hours for your withdrawn money to reflect in your trading account.\n\nBitcoin Profit\u2019s Trading Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Profit work?\n\nBitcoin Profit works just like other outstanding trading robots that we have successfully tested.
