        "content": "The crypto app Strike on Thursday announced a major expansion of its services, powered by a new partnership with the payment processing platform Checkout.com, that will allow users in more than 65 countries to buy Bitcoin directly with their debit card.\n\nOne of the key challenges facing crypto providers is allowing users to move between fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which require payment rails like wire transfers and ACH transfers.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Strike founder and CEO Jack Mallers said Strike\u2019s long-term goal is to be the \u201cBitcoin company for the Earth,\u201d with global payments serving as a core feature.\n\nRamping up\n\nThe innovation of crypto was creating payment rails that operate 24/7 and without the friction of a banking system separated by international borders. Ideally, anyone could send any amount of money to anyone else at any time.\n\nThe issue, of course, is that people need to own cryptocurrencies in the first place. For most people, that ownership comes from on-ramps like exchanges or wallets, where users purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency.\n\nEven if someone owns Bitcoin, its capacity as an actual currency is limited, with few merchants around the world accepting it as payment. As a result, crypto platforms also require off-ramps to trade tokens back into fiat currency.\n\nFounded in 2019, Strike has been limited by financial restrictions that would enable users to buy and sell Bitcoin. While its app is available to download in more than 65 countries, users are limited to sending Bitcoin and the stablecoin Tether between each other, with only select customers able to trade back and forth into fiat currency.\n\nStrike, which raised an $80 million funding round in September 2022 led by the Bitcoin-focused asset manager Ten31, has over the past year introduced new products to expand on- and off-ramps into fiat, including its Send Globally, where users in the U.S. can send dollars to different markets like Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and the Philippines. Recipients receive the transfer in their own local currency, with Bitcoin serving as an intermediary. Strike\u2019s long-term goal is to facilitate cross-border payments, or remittances, between countries around the world using Bitcoin.\n\nCheckout.com\n\nThe partnership with Checkout.com enables a new payment rail for Strike, allowing more users to buy and sell Bitcoin using the app. Users outside the U.S. will also now be able to originate payments between currencies via the Send Globally feature.\n\nCheckout.com has previously worked with crypto companies, although it cut ties with the exchange Binance in August over money laundering and compliance concerns.\n\nSpeaking with Fortune, Mallers said Checkout.com is providing a card network gateway, meaning it brokers relationships with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Checkout.com itself is not doing the fiat-to-Bitcoin conversions, but instead will serve as an alternative payment rail to wire transfers, ACH, and card processing already available in the U.S, opening up the Bitcoin on-ramp to users globally.\n\nMallers said Bitcoin purchases and withdrawals will not be subject to daily limits outside of its typical fraud prevention system, which monitors new users and large withdrawals, although he emphasized that any prices will be locked in by transactions even if they are delayed.\n\nThe launch still comes during a time of turmoil for the crypto industry. Strike moved custody\u2014or holding its crypto assets\u2014in-house in June after the bankruptcy of Prime Trust, its former custodian.\n\nTrust in the crypto ecosystem has also been rocked by the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted by a federal jury of seven criminal counts in early November related to the collapse of his crypto exchange.\n\nWith young crypto phenoms like Bankman-Fried and Terra\u2019s Do Kwon unveiled as fraudsters, the 29-year-old Mallers said that Strike\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin and regulation is only driving its expansion.\n\n\u201cAs more companies around the world go bankrupt and go to prison, we get more demand because it\u2019s almost like a game of last man standing,\u201d Mallers told Fortune."

It's \"no different than gold\" as the yellow metal's value stems from centuries of people believing it's worth something, he said.\n\n\"Bitcoin is the same thing \u2013 but for a new generation,\" he wrote, noting there's conviction in the digital token's value but unlike gold, it's completely decentralized. \"That's exciting for an investor.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has tumbled from nearly $70,000 at its peak to below $40,000 over the past couple of years. However, it has roughly doubled since the start of this year, boosting its market capitalization to about $730 billion \u2014 not far off the $780 billion market capitalization of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOhanian is a longstanding champion of crypto. He revealed earlier this year that he paid just $15,000 for 50,000 ether in 2014 \u2014 an amount worth over $100 million today if he'd kept it all. He made a combined $50 million from early bets on ether and Coinbase stock, he said.\n\nThe venture capitalist, who's married to tennis star Serena Williams, has predicted the crypto industry will shift from \"speculation + casino vibes\" toward wider adoption, greater utility, and fun. He's also said that bear markets are typically when people create products with real value.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This crypto winter is exactly the time when folks are gonna be building,\" he said in May. \"The next cycle won't be defined by gambling or speculation, it'll be through engaging gameplay.\"\n\nOhanian has also declared the rise of crypto and other alternative assets means the classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds will be \"dead for digital natives.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "Bitcoin: Should You Buy the Next Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -3.59%), which recently broke through the $37,000 price level, has been on a wild ride over the past two years. After collapsing by 65% last year, it is now up 122% this year and has been outperforming all but a handful of top cryptocurrencies. As a result, analysts and traders have been rushing to put out wildly optimistic price targets for Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nBut dig a bit deeper, and there are plenty of reasons it might be headed for a pullback sooner than anyone thinks. It's easy to argue that it is wildly overheating and is now primed for a market correction, especially if the economy shows signs of weakness. But don't worry about the dip too much. Two key factors make the crypto a fantastic long-term investment.\n\nInstitutional investor flows\n\nThe biggest factor supporting a higher price for Bitcoin is the potential for an enormous flow of funds from institutional investors into new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which will likely be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThese new spot ETFs provide institutional investors with a way to get exposure to the digital currency without owning it directly. If institutional investors decide to allocate even 1% of their portfolios to crypto, it could have an enormous impact on the price of Bitcoin for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs a result, some analysts are projecting Bitcoin to smash through its all-time high of $69,000 and continue on an ascent to $100,000 and beyond, driven by this fresh infusion of institutional investor money. Just keep in mind, though, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) recently warned that this impact might be less than originally thought, because institutional investors could simply rotate their money out of other existing Bitcoin investment products and into these new ETFs.\n\nThe halving\n\nThe other key factor supporting a higher price for Bitcoin is the halving, now scheduled for April 2024. This event, which takes place only once every four years, results in the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners being cut by one-half.\n\nThat event creates a \"scarcity effect\" that drives up the price of the crypto over time. It also has a deflationary impact on it, since the rate of new Bitcoin creation is being reduced, and that makes it more attractive as a hedge against inflation. There have been three previous halvings, and all of them have led to Bitcoin hitting new highs.\n\nArguably, the impact of the Bitcoin halving seems to be diminishing over time. And, of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Just because the halving has resulted in three previous bullish market cycles, there's no inherent reason it has to happen a fourth time.\n\nThat being said, it's undeniable that the halving is a cornerstone feature of just about any Bitcoin price forecast for 2024. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, has raised its previous $100,000 price target to $120,000, in part based on new bullishness around the halving.\n\nDo you believe in efficient markets?\n\nThe big question is just how much these two events -- the arrival of the first spot Bitcoin ETF and the halving -- are already priced into the hefty $37,000 price. According to the efficient market hypothesis, which argues that asset prices reflect all available information, they should be.\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset, but it is still an asset. Since we know the date of the halving, and we know the approximate date of the spot ETF approval, then these events should be reflected in the current price.\n\nAs a result, JPMorgan Chase argues that much of the impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF has likely been priced in. Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), too, seems to agree. And there are plenty of investors who think Bitcoin is poised for a recalibration in price, as the market makes sense of all available information.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin bear Peter Schiff is now arguing that the pending approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF product could be a perfect \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" opportunity.\n\nSo that's why you need to be ready for the next big dip in Bitcoin. If you don't prepare now, you could be blindsided if it happens later. I'm long-term bullish on the cryptocurrency, and based on the two catalysts described above, I'm convinced that any dip will provide a unique opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a bargain price before it continues its steep upward ascent."

        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks to Buy Before the 2024 Bitcoin Halving - Nasdaq",
        "content": "According to crypto experts, the ongoing bear market has come to an end after almost two years. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have more than doubled year-to-date, while Ethereum (ETHUSD) has surged close to 70% in 2023. Moreover, two key near-term drivers could drive cryptocurrency prices higher in the next 12 months.\n\nFirst is the Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to take place in April 2024. The total number of Bitcoin that can be mined is limited to 21 million, and the halving process reduces the rewards for mining - which is intended to control the supply of cryptocurrency on the market and limit inflation. The halving typically acts as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin. For instance, between November 2015 and November 2017, BTC prices surged by 2,000%, while they spiked almost 600% between November 2019 and November 2021.\n\nAnother significant event for cryptocurrencies could be the upcoming launch of multiple spot Bitcoin exchanged traded funds (ETFs). Several investment managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ), have applied to introduce their own version of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which seems increasingly likely to be approved by the SEC in the next six months. BlackRock has close to $10 trillion in assets under management, and even if it allocates 1% of funds toward Bitcoin, it could result in inflows worth $100 billion.\n\nIt seems the time is ripe to invest in Bitcoin and related crypto assets right now. While you can purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly from exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), another way to gain exposure to this area of the market is by investing in BTC mining companies. Here are three crypto stocks to consider buying before the 2024 Bitcoin halving event.\n\nTeraWulf Stock\n\nValued at $222 million by market cap, TeraWulf (WULF) develops, owns, and operates Bitcoin mining facility sites in New York and Pennsylvania. In Q3 of 2023, TeraWulf self-mined 611 BTC and realized another 13 BTC via hosting profit share. Its revenue rose to $19 million in Q3, up from $15.5 million in the year-ago period.\n\nThe total value of the self-mined Bitcoin stood at $27.9 million, while the power cost per Bitcoin rose 29% to $9,322 due to a 13% increase in network difficulty. TeraWulf reported adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $9 million, an increase of 19% year over year.\n\nOut of the five analysts tracking WULF, four recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for WULF is $3.65, which is 244% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nHive Digital Technologies Stock\n\nHive Digital Technologies (HIVE) is another Bitcoin mining company, valued at $249 million by market cap. HIVE reported revenue of $22.8 million in Q3 and mined 801 BTC. Its gross operating profit stood at $4.6 million, indicating a margin of 20%.\n\nThe number of BTC mined during the quarter fell by 6.6% year over year. Similar to TeraWulf, HIVE's revenue was impacted by increased mining network difficulty, which means more miners were competing with better equipment for the opportunity to mine the maximum number of Bitcoin. HIVE recently purchased 4,800 Bitmain S19k Pro ASIC miners, allowing it to upgrade a portion of its fleet to improve mining efficiency.\n\nOut of the three analysts tracking HIVE, two recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for HIVE is $6.83, which is 127% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRiot Blockchain Stock\n\nThe final Bitcoin mining stock on my list is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), valued at $2 billion by market cap. Among the largest BTC mining companies in the world, Riot reported revenue of $51.9 million in Q3, as it mined 1,106 Bitcoin during the quarter.\n\nThe company has mined a total of 4,996 BTC in 2023 with an average cost of just $5,537 per Bitcoin, which indicates Riot is a leading low-cost producer of the digital asset. Riot ended Q3 with $290 million in cash and 7,327 BTC worth $500 million, providing it with the liquidity to ride out an uncertain macro environment.\n\nOut of the eight analysts tracking RIOT, six recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price for RIOT is $16.78, which is 65% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Will the current cryptocurrency rally ever end? Investors could be forgiven for thinking that it won't, on Wednesday, as prices of the leading asset in that class, Bitcoin (BTC -3.59%), and a large pack of altcoins continued to trade well in positive territory.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin's 6% advance over the preceding 24 hours, the oft-maligned meme cryptos Dogecoin (DOGE 2.37%) and Shiba Inu (SHIB -0.19%) were up a respective 4.9% and 5.6%. Not to be left behind, Algorand (ALGO -5.06%) was surging more than 11% higher, and Lido DAO (LDO -8.02%) was defying gravity by 5.5%.\n\nThe crypto spot ETF saga continues\n\nThere was no news of great substance affecting the crypto market that day, and when that occurs in the midst of a rally, the rally tends to extend. However, one fresh development to watch, as it ties into a big reason for the market's sunny bullishness these days, is a regulatory announcement on spot crypto ETFs handed down on Hump Day.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was delaying a decision by a company called Hashdex to convert its Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) into a spot ETF.\n\nThe latter instruments are a hot item just now, as they would allow companies to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. At present, they are prevented from doing so and thus can only do their best to mimic crypto price movements using various methods. Spot crypto ETFs would be appealing for a great many investors who don't want the considerable hassle that is often involved with owning cryptos themselves.\n\nAt the moment, there is a clutch of financial-services companies jostling to list spot crypto ETFs on exchanges. Some are conversions, like Hashdex, and others are newly established securities. One example of the latter is Grayscale Investment's proposed Ethereum vehicle, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust. On Wednesday, the SEC said it was also postponing its decision on green-lighting this ETF.\n\nNo trepidation on inflation\n\nA postponement isn't a \"no,\" plus the SEC's moves on Hashdex and Grayscale keep spot crypto ETFs alive as watercooler conversation and topics of discussion on influential crypto forums online. They also serve as a reminder that there are well-capitalized, ambitious companies clamoring for such assets to finally receive approval.\n\nOn top of that, investors continue to be encouraged by the October consumer price index (CPI) data published by the government's Labor Department last Friday. This indicated that inflation was cooling more than economists anticipated, leading pundits and investors to believe that this will discourage the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates (as has been its wont over the past few years).\n\nLevel interst rates -- or perhaps even lower ones if inflation continues to lose heat -- benefit cryptocurrencies and related assets. That's because investors tend to take on more risk when they feel that competing \"safe\" assets (such as the U.S. government's treasury notes) aren't going to pay out more."

        "content": "Famed investor and ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood expects trillions of investor dollars will flow into spot bitcoin ETFs and the digital-asset industry at large in the next decade.\n\nWood predicts about $20 trillion in the bitcoin market and $5 trillion in ethereum potentially by 2030, pointing to an increase in institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as a wider acceptance of use cases for digital assets by traditional financial firms.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re somewhere between one and one-and-a-half trillion [dollars] for the ecosystem,\u201d said Wood while speaking on a panel for a New York press event on Tuesday. \u201cWe see that scaling to $25 trillion in the next five to 10 years.\u201d\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency industry has been plagued by fraud and companies imploding, firms pursuing the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF are banking on broader adoption of bitcoin and ethereum by the traditional financial markets.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all bids for a spot bitcoin ETF, but the agency is currently in talks with firms to work toward a potential approval. The discussions follow the SEC\u2019s loss of a watershed court case to Grayscale Investments in August, when judges ruled the agency had been wrong to block Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nWood Predicts Investor Enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETF\n\nIn an interview with etf.com Tuesday, Wood said she believes institutional investors will turn toward bitcoin when they see its value.\n\n\u201cTypically, institutions will tiptoe in with one percent\u2026then they\u2019ll get more educated and intrigued and build their positions the more they understand,\u201d she explained. Wood expects between 2% and 6.5% of institutional allocation into bitcoin in this time frame.\n\nShe also noted that investors can use bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, pointing to investors looking towards bitcoin in reaction to the regional banking crisis this past spring.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "Ark Invest's Cathie Wood has long been bullish on the cryptocurrency space. She's still optimistic that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could trade somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.\n\nWhat To Know: Bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of the year as optimism surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF continues to rise. Wood believes the rally in Bitcoin is just getting started.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, Wood predicted that Bitcoin would trade up to $650,000 per coin, but that's just her base case. In a bull case scenario, the world's largest cryptocurrency could be worth between $1 million and $1.5 million per coin, she said.\n\n\"Last year, a lot of people thought that the bankruptcy of FTX, Celsius and Three Arrows was going to be the end of Bitcoin. And quite the opposite happened,\" Wood said.\n\nMore and more people are starting to understand that FTX was a centralized organization, lacking transparency. Bitcoin is the exact opposite of that, she said.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized and has a network of developers watching over it, preventing fraud like what we saw with FTX, she explained.\n\n\"When FTX went down, the bitcoin blockchain didn\u2019t skip a beat, the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) network didn\u2019t skip a beat. It was as though it didn\u2019t happen,\" Wood told the Journal.\n\nCheck This Out: EXCLUSIVE: Crypto Industry Insider Predicts Bitcoin Spot ETF In Early 2024 \u2014 Why It's 'Not Entirely Priced In'\n\nThe Ark Invest CEO suggested that a spot Bitcoin ETF could help push prices higher. It would make it easy for the average person to gain exposure to the asset, she said.\n\nAn ETF would be regulated and offer protection. It would also be much less complicated than using Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) to buy Bitcoin, she said.\n\nCoinbase is one of Ark's biggest holdings. At the time of writing, it was actually the top holding in the Ark Innovation ETF (ARCA:ARKK) with a 9.06% weighting.\n\nThe crypto exchange is currently facing an SEC lawsuit claiming the company is an unregistered broker, but Wood isn't worried.\n\nThe SEC has been on the losing side of several similar cases and if Coinbase were to lose, she believes the company would appeal the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, given its importance.\n\n\"We need real legislation if this truly is a new asset class, so that\u2019s really what the question is here,\" Wood told WSJ.\n\n$BTC Price Action: Bitcoin is up approximately 119% year-to-date.

        "content": "As the January 10 deadline for the SEC to decide on a spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approaches, investors are watching closely for any new details on how it will affect the market. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman sat down with ARK Invest Founder, CEO, and CIO Cathie Wood to discuss her stance on bitcoin, the crypto market, and digital assets in general. During the interview, Woods enthusiastically elaborated on her interactions with the SEC: \"We were thrilled to get questions back [from the SEC] because it means they're engaged now. We have met a number of the research people at the SEC... they know what they're talking about and the level of sophistication of their questions suggested okay now they're moving deeply into this.\"\n\nMore questions are arising on what the SEC's decision could mean for markets and investors if regulators convey positive sentiment. Lance McGray, Advisors Asset Management Head of ETF Product, joins Yahoo Finance to give insights on the impacts of the SEC decision and how successful these ETFs could be.\n\nMcGray explains how successful ETFs have already been just in the last year: \"We've seen in the last year or so about 50 conversions come to market and about $75 billion dollars of assets that have come over from other wrappers, specifically the mutual fund wrapper into what is perceived to be a more cash efficient, more flexible, a more transparent wrapper, the ETF wrapper.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, investors in the crypto space are keeping their eyes on the SEC's spot bitcoin decision with the January 10th deadline quickly approaching. Our very own Julie Hyman spoke with ARK investment's Cathie Wood about movement in the space, and the potential for SEC approvals. Take a listen to what she had to say.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: This summer, we got questions back from the SEC. Now normally when you get questions from the SEC, you're just saying, oh my goodness. We were thrilled to get questions back because it means they're engaged now. Now we have met a number of the research people at the SEC on the research side, and they are extremely sophisticated. They know what they're talking about and the level of sophistication of their questions suggested, OK, now they're moving deeply into this.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: As part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ, let's bring in advisors asset management head of ETF product, Lance McGray to discuss more. Thank you for joining us this morning. So first want to start with what we heard from Cathie Wood about the optimism that we're seeing in the momentum towards a potential spot bitcoin ETF approval here.\n\nIn terms of the likelihood, are we liking this momentum and perhaps how soon could we see it?\n\nFirst off, thanks for having me. I think the-- there is plenty of optimism out there. At the end of the day, you're talking about a-- you're talking about a $700 billion market cap universe that has been rather untouched from the ETF industry. So Cathie is extremely optimistic on the conversations that they've been having with the SEC but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.\n\nThese conversations go all the way back to 2017 when the SEC essentially rejected its first bitcoin-- spot bitcoin ETF. So again, while the SEC is coming back with conversations, and that's good news for investors that are looking for a spot bitcoin ETF, let's not forget the mandate of the SEC and that's really to protect the investors with products like this.\n\nSo I anticipate things to be moving smoothly, things to continue moving, but quite honestly, I would-- I would be shocked if something happens in 2023, probably looking at more back half of 24 than anything else.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Now back half of 2024, well, we only have a few months left or one month almost left in 2023. Lance, you know, this has always been seen as a catalyst, that next leg for crypto what's the interest been like among your clients? What are you hearing?\n\nLANCE MCGRAY: There's interest specifically around the spot bitcoin because right now, there are futures-based ETFs. The SEC has got comfortable with futures-based products because these are securities, these are on exchange where there is regulation. Their concern is really around the manipulation and the fraud tied to the underlying spot market.\n\nSo there is appetite. There's been a recent poll that came out last year that says if there's a spot bitcoin product that comes out, there's a 72% appetite for investors to get into that product rather than the current futures product. And we talk about the futures products, yes, it is essentially tracking bitcoin, but it's important to remember that these futures products wouldn't operate the same as A-- as a true spot bitcoin product.\n\nThere's going to be-- there's going to be role costs, there's carry costs, there's contango, there's different costs that come into this and at the end of the day, what the investors are telling us is that they're looking for a spot bitcoin ETF rather than a futures-based ETF which we currently have in the marketplace.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And we are expecting that if this does get approved, there will be a wave of these. But one of these in the mix here is also Grayscale trying to convert its fund to an ETF. Not a lot of known is about this process. I know Cathie Wood was saying she wasn't sure if Grayscale would be able to do that. What do people need to know about that conversion process and what that opens up?\n\nLANCE MCGRAY: Yeah, well, that's a big thing in the ETF industry right now. I know we're talking about bitcoins, but let's just look at mutual fund ETF conversions. This is something that's just recently come to market over the last few years, and we've seen, in the last year or so, about 50 conversions come to market and about $75 billion of assets that have come over from other wrappers specifically the mutual fund rapper into what is perceived to be a more tax efficient, a more flexible, a more transparent wrapper the ETF wrapper.\n\nSo we fully expect that we're going to see these, we're going to see this continue to roll out. We think there's a major trend on the active management side, whether it's crypto or fixed income or equity. There's going to continue to be these mergers or conversions from one wrapper to the next. And when we specifically talk about mutual fund ETF conversions, there's-- from an issuer perspective, let's talk about the benefits.\n\nThe first and foremost is that the track record from the mutual fund. If you have a mutual fund that has a track record of 10, 20, 30 years, that track record can come over to the ETF so that's fantastic news. The other thing in the ETF space is getting scale on day one. If you can bring over assets in from a mutual fund into an ETF.\n\nThe hardest thing for us to do as an ETF issuer is to get that first $100 million, and when we're doing these conversions, you can get that scale on day one. And then finally, you have improved tax consequences of the mutual-- or of the ETF over other vehicles like the mutual fund. So this is something we're going to see a lot of in the coming years, and I think it's one area that's really going to take the world of ETFs to the next step is active management and conversions of other wrappers into ETFs.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: There's certainly a lot to consider in a growing industry to your point. Advisors Asset Management, Head of ETF Product, Lance McGray. Good to talk to you today. Really appreciate the time.\n\nLANCE MCGRAY: Thanks for having me."

        "content": "00:00\n\nHow much institutional or even retail interest is this going to bring into the crypto world? Is it going to be an important milestone? Great to be here, Matt. Thanks very much for having me. And I think you just hit that. That is the key question is is not so much the data, it's not so much when exactly the ETFs will launch, it's what will the impact be. And I think that you you really touched on it right at the top of the show with the correlation chart because that is really the key. That is the key reason for allocation to Bitcoin. I think for most investors it is that mark of vit C and free lunch that bitcoin provides because of its diversification effects, because it has over the long run been uncorrelated to most of the major asset classes. Very low correlation exhibited over the past ten years. There have been periods where that correlation has gone up, as you rightly mentioned, in that pandemic era. But this year, for most of this year, the correlation has indeed been negative if there has been any correlation at all. So that diversification re effects that that it can give in view to portfolios of stocks, bonds, cash and alternatives is what's going to drive the conversation. That's what's going to drive the inflows. The question is what is that allocation? Because because the quantitative evidence, the empirical evidence tells us it shouldn't be zero. It shouldn't be zero. But I've heard often in Conversation Suey about this idea that really at this point, you shouldn't be putting anything into crypto that you're not willing to use, and that would maybe suggest that it shouldn't be super heavily weighted in a portfolio in terms of that asset allocation break up It also, we have to keep in mind it comes against a backdrop of there being a lot of anticipation to your point about a spot ETF being approved eventually. Maybe it's a question of when, not a question of if. And I just wonder how much of that anticipation already is baked into what we're seeing in prices and if ultimately what we see is, okay, maybe a little bit more institutional attraction, a little bit more volume in terms of flows, but pricing doesn't change that much. What do you think? Yeah, that's a that's a that's a really interesting question. And I think it it you know, people have been talking about, oh, it's baked into the price that authorization approval is baked into the price. And indeed the approval may be baked into the price. But as you rightly point out, it's not so much the approval, it's how much in flow are these products, If they are approved, when they are approved, how much inflow will they see? That's you know, what is the market pricing in? Is the market pricing in the $5 billion of inflow or is it pricing in $10 billion of inflow? We don't really know. And so I think that most investors will will look at this cautiously. I don't think any institutional investors are going to be thinking about timing, the market timing of bump. What most institutional investors will be looking at is over the long term and the diversification effects that Bitcoin can have in their portfolios and add more resilience to the returns that they will see from their portfolios."

        "title": "How Will Bitcoin's 2024 Halving Affect Your Crypto Portfolio? Here Are The Predictions - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving is expected in April 2024.\n\nThe event, occurring approximately every four years, affects not only the market value of Bitcoin, but also the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhy It Matters: The Bitcoin halving is a pre-coded event in the Bitcoin protocol that happens every 210,000 blocks \u2014 roughly every four years.\n\nIt reduces the reward miners receive for validating blockchain transactions, thus controlling the issuance of new Bitcoin and maintaining its scarcity\u200b\u200b.\n\nInitially, in 2009, miners were rewarded with 50 BTC for each block.\n\nThe first halving in 2012 reduced this to 25 BTC, and subsequent halving in 2016 and 2020 further decreased it to 12.5 and 6.25 Bitcoin, respectively\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhat Happens After: The halving constrains the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. This affects the balance between supply and demand. When the supply decreases while demand remains constant or increases, the value of Bitcoin is likely to rise\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is also associated with increased market volatility. Investors and speculators closely watch the market dynamics around this event, leading to price fluctuations and heightened trading activity\u200b\u200b.\n\nImplications For Miners: The reduced reward for mining new blocks directly impacts the profitability of Bitcoin mining, influencing the mining landscape.\n\nMiners with higher energy costs and less efficient hardware may face challenges, leading to a shift in the market\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe halving stimulates discussions and innovation within the blockchain community, fostering technological advancements and community development\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe predictable scarcity introduced by the halving mechanism also positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term investment asset\u200b\u200b.\n\nAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE - Hedge Funder Envisions Bitcoin As Settlement Layer For Global Assets \u2014 'We Haven't Even Started'\n\nPredictions\n\nPredictions for Bitcoin's price post-halving are varied. While some experts anticipate a significant price increase, others argue that halving's effects may already be priced into Bitcoin\u2019s value\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitQuant (via Nasdaq and VettaFi): Predicts a post-halving price of up to $250,000, more than nine times its current value\u200b\u200b. Coincodex: Forecasts Bitcoin to reach approximately $49,300 by April 2024, with a potential rally to around $84,100 after the halving\u200b\u200b. Bloomberg: Suggests Bitcoin could surpass $50,000 by 2024, attributing this to the upcoming halving and an expected increase of at least 81% in its value\u200b\u200b. Cryptonews: Anticipates Bitcoin exceeding $100,000, and possibly $300,000 by 2028, with a post-halving range of $60,000 to $90,000\u200b\u200b. Standard Chartered: Predicts Bitcoin's value could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, driven by its characteristics as a decentralized, scarce digital asset\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile predictions vary, the Bitcoin halving event will serve as a catalyst for significant changes and opportunities within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nRead Next: Welcome To 'The Acceleration Phase' - Analyst Predicts An 88% Increase For Bitcoin\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Paolo Ardoino, the expected CEO of Tether, shared the company's intentions to construct mining facilities and invest in other miners. The focus of this expansion will be on establishing mining sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, with the goal of increasing Tether's computing power to represent 1% of the BTC mining network. These new facilities will have a capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts.\n\nThis mining investment is part of Tether's recent $610 million debt financing facility, which was extended to German miner Northern Data Group. Tether has been actively increasing its loans throughout the year and had previously made a strategic investment in Northern Data Group to support initiatives related to artificial intelligence.\n\nArdoino outlined Tether's mining objectives, aiming to achieve 120 megawatts of direct mining operations by the end of this year and an impressive 450 megawatts by the end of 2025. The company is also considering the establishment of a 300-megawatt facility and plans to set up its mining infrastructure inside containers that can be relocated based on fluctuations in electricity prices. Ardoino emphasized that Tether's approach to mining is gradual, stating, \"We are not in a hurry to become the largest miner in the world.\"\n\nIn December, Paolo Ardoino will assume the role of Tether's CEO while maintaining his position as the chief technical officer of parent company Bitfinex, as previously announced in October.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "It's officially been one year since the nation of El Salvador became the first to begin buying Bitcoin every day, joining the millions of savers around the world who dollar cost average into the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs profiled by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo today, it was on this date last year when El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele committed to purchasing one bitcoin every day. One year later, the results are in, Bitcoin is up 120%.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether El Salvador stuck to the plan, if it has, it has amassed a total of 365 bitcoins at a reported cost of $13 million during that time. However, the cost basis for these acquisitions is notably lower at $9.5 million, or a $3 million gain.\n\nThe results showcase the potential benefits of consistent and measured investment in the volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nTime will tell if the results will silence critics, however, who have been critical of the country's strategy. El Salvador has faced scrutiny for its Bitcoin purchasing efforts, with skepticism arising from the lack of transparency regarding the actual purchases. While President Bukele has publicly disclosed the ownership of 2,381 bitcoins acquired at an average price of around $44,300, there remains a challenge in verifying these claims.\n\nAs a result, El Salvador may, at least temporarily, still be down on its overall Bitcoin investment. The country became the first in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, a move that has boosted tourism but drawn the scrutiny of international regulators who fear it is moving away from the U.S. dollar.\n\nAs the nation continues to navigate this uncharted territory, the impact of its pioneering DCA plan, should it have followed through on the promise, will no doubt go a long way toward mitigating concerns given its strong performance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has climbed roughly 117% this year, handily beating the returns in most other asset classes.\n\nOn Wednesday, the token hovered at $36,080. Its supporters have been bullish all year on regulators' potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, the 2024 halving event, easing monetary policy, and falling inflation.\n\nHowever, industry veterans caution that headwinds remain that could mute the enthusiasm and derail the rally.\n\nHere's the bear case for the world's biggest crypto as the market heads into year-end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Overdone' optimism for spot ETFs\n\nJPMorgan strategists said the latest rally in crypto market is \"rather overdone,\" and bitcoin may not gain as much as anticipated on spot ETFs or the upcoming halving.\n\nRather than new institutional products ushering in more investors, JPMorgan maintained they would merely attract flows from existing bitcoin products, like Grayscale's bitcoin trust or mining companies, basically having the effect of shuffling investment around rather than attracting new inflows.\n\n\"We envisage this shift as a relative value trade as several of the above bitcoin products trade at a premium or much reduced discount relative to the past,\" the strategists said.\n\nEven if the SEC approves spot bitcoin ETFs, that doesn't guarantee a lasting change of tune from regulators in favor of crypto, in the bank's view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that point, Alonso de Gortari, chief economist at Mysten Labs, told Business Insider that any regulatory updates that restrict access or opportunities for bitcoin could crimp gains for investors.\n\nWhile Europe and Asia have come out with more accommodative policies in recent months, the US has yet to follow suit, he explained. It would be surprising if Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission deny the approval of all spot ETF applications, but the move could send bitcoin \u2014 as well as ether and other tokens \u2014 tumbling.\n\n\"The reason ETF issuance is so important for the industry is that it would sideline many of the custody and security issues inherent to crypto that many investors would like to avoid,\" de Gortari said. \"An ETF would show that blockchain has matured as an infrastructure layer, being the rails that serve digital assets in the backend, while letting investors access these assets through a mature middleware layer.\"\n\nMacro headwinds\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, told Business Insider that bitcoin's climb could falter if inflation doesn't fall as expected in the new year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Bank of America said Tuesday October's year-over-year CPI reading of 3.2% officially puts an end to the Fed's hiking cycle, any resurgence for inflation would send money from bitcoin into alternatives, and would make it more likely that Fed policy stays tight longer before the central banks shifts to a more accommodative stance.\n\n\"This would push treasury yields higher, making them look more attractive relative to bitcoin,\" he said, noting that he anticipates the US economy to continue heading for a recession in 2024.\n\nDespite some bearish macro developments posing a threat, there is still a strong bull case in 2024's halving event, sources say. Some experts forecast that the halving\u2014which reduces rewards for mining bitcoin by half\u2014could push the token to new record highs above the six-figure mark. The last three halving events have each been followed by record highs within 12 months.\n\nMysten Labs' de Gortari said over the last two years, innovation has ramped up not just for bitcoin but across the digital asset space, and an increasing number of retail investors are recognizing the upside."

        "content": "00:00\n\nYou talked about how pricing was in a very different place back in 2021. Of course, there was a lot in the industry that hadn't happened yet, including the collapse of RTX last year. And that is something when we think about institutions in this space that maybe led to a little bit more trepidation, at least in the immediate aftermath. And I wonder how much that that is fading now, especially given that I'm reading through the notes you sent across to us and you're talking about Pecos Go Network and how that could prevent the next at RTX. How how can you say that confidently? Well, look, we're all excited about the ETF. It's definitely getting closer. We're definitely seeing signals and returns the conversations that the applicants are having with the SEC because working with a bunch of these guys as well. So I'm optimistic, but I think it's quite likely we have another round of ETF rejections before we get the positive, positive news. And it really comes back down to market structure. You know, Gary Gensler has made no secret of this point. You have two separate exchanges from custody, the CFTC market structures already. This way you have to separate exchanges from custody. The equities markets are this way as well. You know, 15 months ago, we had Sam Bankman-fried marching all over Washington, D.C., advocating his seven key points of regulation where he basically said, let me take on all functions. It's going to be great. It's going to be efficient. We'll do that. Obviously, we have a very different thought process in right now, but a lot of these applications are with Coinbase custody, you know, and Coinbase. Well, I'm not trying to say that they're in FTC's by any means. They are taking on also kind of that same playbook, in addition to being an exchange and a custodian, they recently got approval for an FCM. Of course they got a broker dealer. What this means is there's a lot of risks in that entity that are fully understood, and I think that the SEC could quite likely come back and say, No, you got to separate out these things fully before we're going to move forward. Good news, like there's solutions right now of custodians like Becker that focus 100% on that. We don't do trading and exchange work so so we can we can fill that void."

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) barely finished above the flat line. The Dow has now risen four straight days and is at its highest levels since Aug. 14.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies also extended their recent rally. The world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC-USD), rose more than 6% to above $37,000 per coin.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices fell with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) hitting $76.51 per barrel while Brent Crude (BZ=F) fell to just below $81 a barrel.\n\nThe jump in stocks was juiced by the surprise easing in US price pressures, which spurred bets the Federal Reserve will keep rates steady and could start cutting them early next year. Data out Wednesday reiterated this narrative as October wholesale prices saw the largest monthly decline in two and a half years.\n\nMeanwhile, October's retail sales report revealed the first monthly decline in sales since March, though the 0.1% drop still topped Wall Street's estimates.\n\nShares in Target (TGT) surged more than 16% after its third quarter earnings clobbered estimates. The big box retailer pointed to the resilience of the US consumer in the face of higher borrowing costs."

Tether\n\nTether is investing $500 million to enter bitcoin mining, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe $87 billion stablecoin operator has large coffers that could make it a significant competitor in the space.\n\nTether will construct its own bitcoin mining facilities and also take stakes in existing companies.\n\nTether, the issuer of the largest US dollar stablecoin, is aiming to become a bitcoin miner, and it's planning to invest $500 million to establish itself as a major player, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nOver the next six months, the company plans to invest in the space building its own mining facilities as well as taking stakes in existing firms, incoming CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n\"We are committed to being part of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem,\" he said. \"When it comes to the expansions, building new substations and new sites, we are taking them extremely seriously.\"\n\nTether's primary business is running the USDT stablecoin, which maintains a one-to-one match with the dollar. The company generates revenue through managing assets in its multi-billion dollar reserves, and per Bloomberg, it has about $3.2 billion in excess cash as of September.\n\nArdoino said Tether is building bitcoin mines in El Salvador, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Eventually, the company aims to expand its share of the total computing power to run the bitcoin network to 1%, he said. By the end of 2023, Ardoino said Tether will reach up to 120 megawatts across its own operations, and 450 megawatts by the end of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest public bitcoin mining company, Marathon Digital Holdings, contributes about 4%.\n\nBitcoin miners broadly have been cash-strapped and facing liquidity issues, and Tether's deep coffers could enable it to disrupt the industry and emerge as a significant player. Even so, headwinds remain as competition is tight and mining revenue could take a hit in next year's bitcoin halving event.\n\n\"Mining for us is something that we have to learn and grow over time,\" Ardoino told Bloomberg. \"We are not in a rush to become the biggest miner in the world.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTether did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nBitcoin has notched more than 120% gain in 2023. On Thursday, it hovered around $36,570.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

The ETF jumped 5.2% on Tuesday and is now up over 37% this year, clawing back at least some of a dismal 2021 and 2022 where the fund was one of the hiking Fed\u2019s many victims.\n\nMany tech investors and leaders \u2014 including the likes of Elon Musk \u2014 have said rates need to stabilize or decline to unlock further gains. Wood seems to be in the same camp, as she told me in a conversation yesterday.\n\n\u201cI don't think the Fed's going any further,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the market can feel comfortable that that is indeed the case, we don't have to have rates even come down. We think they will. But we think that our strategy has discounted the worst.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the maverick investor isn\u2019t changing her strategy. She\u2019s been remarkably steadfast in her bets and investing philosophy. Even as ARKK plunged 67% last year, she was traveling, speaking to clients and the press as usual. And her message was consistent, even when her returns weren\u2019t: Disruptive innovation is a good investment in the long run.\n\nHas she been proven right? The jury\u2019s still out. Wood says she focuses on a five-year investment horizon. ARKK\u2019s five-year return is -2.5%. Since its inception about nine years ago, it has just about doubled, half the gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Her much smaller Ark Autonomous Tech and Robotics ETF rallied 162% over the same period. (Ark has a suite of eight in-house ETFs).\n\nWood\u2019s steadfast bet on fintech and crypto, however, is very much on the table. She has been making the rounds in support of a suite of new actively managed digital asset ETFs introduced by Ark in partnership with 21Shares, a creator of crypto exchange-traded products sold overseas.\n\nStory continues\n\nWood told me that Ark first bought bitcoin at $250 and her firm\u2019s base case is still $600,000 to $650,000. And she said the odds are improving that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve Ark and others\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF filings by a January deadline. That, she and other bitcoin bulls believe, could unlock more gains.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a bet on a crypto renaissance and a new product for Wood\u2019s firm. It could also provide the juice the ARKK ETF needs to get out of its current trough, 71% down from its 2021 all-time high. The current largest holding in Wood\u2019s flagship ETF? Coinbase.\n\nmorning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Ferrari\u2019s decision to allow U.S. residents to buy its cars in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) has become one of the biggest market wins in 2023, according to the CEO of the Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip.\n\nFerrari has been aware of the growing demand from clients for alternative payment solutions and decided to support dealers in meeting these clients\u2019 requests, the representative said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe source of the cryptocurrencies will be proven, and volatility risks associated with exchange rates will be eliminated. Dealers \u2014 and ultimately Ferrari \u2014 will receive payments in traditional currency and will not be managing cryptocurrencies directly.\u201d\n\nFerrari added the crypto payment support by integrating BitPay, a major crypto payment firm serving global brands like AMC Theaters, the electronics retailer Newegg and others. According to BitPay, Ferrari customers in 10 U.S. locations \u2014 including Washington and Las Vegas \u2014 can now exchange their crypto for a top Ferrari car model like SF90 Stradale, Ferrari Purosangue, Daytona SP3 and others.\n\nSF90 Stradale as one of Ferrari models that can be bought with Bitcoin. Source: BitPay\n\nAccording to CoinFlip CEO Ben Weiss, Ferrari\u2019s move to accept crypto payments is significant for the market. \u201cTheir notable reputation can increase adoption, cryptocurrency value and consumer confidence,\u201d Weiss said, suggesting that their crypto move is also likely to spark interest from lawmakers to develop clear regulatory frameworks.\n\nWeiss believes that Ferrari\u2019s push will eventually push more traditional global firms to accept Bitcoin as payment. He said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of will big-name companies follow Ferrari\u2019s footsteps, but when. Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the decade, proving it\u2019s here to stay and encouraging other big names like PayPal and BlackRock to embrace digital assets.\u201d\n\nFerrari\u2019s decision to adopt cryptocurrency payment has come in line with aspects related to environmental, social and corporate governance, the firm\u2019s representative told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThe analysis of data regarding the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrencies has been a fundamental part of our decision-making process to adopt cryptocurrencies \u2014 in line with our objective to become carbon neutral by 2030,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\nRelated: Crypto payment option for Honda cars only works via third-party platform\n\nAccording to industry analysts, the share of Bitcoin mining energy from renewable sources exceeded 50% as of mid-September 2023. However, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla still hasn\u2019t adopted the BTC payment option after halting such payments in 2021 over carbon concerns.\n\n\u201cTesla still accepts Dogecoin, and Elon continues to be a proponent of crypto,\u201d CoinFlip CEO Weiss noticed, adding that the Tesla founder could also boost crypto adoption by introducing it to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He said:\n\n\u201cElon also has significant experience with payments from his PayPal days and if Elon decides to bring payments to X, as many expect, crypto would be a natural payment rail.\u201d\n\nIn a publicly accessible doc titled \u201cWhat You Need To Know If You Use Bitcoin,\u201d Tesla listed several facts about the cryptocurrency, including that Bitcoin payments are irreversible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way the Bitcoin network works \u2014 no do-overs. So please make sure you enter the correct Bitcoin price in the amount field and the correct Bitcoin address in the recipient field,\u201d the document reads.\n\nMagazine: 5,050 Bitcoin for $5 in 2009: Helsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame"

        "content": "Buckle up.\n\nBitcoin Boomlet\n\nCrypto bros rejoice. Bitcoin has increased in value to nearly $38,000 as of Wednesday, its highest valuation in a year \u2014 though, for those keeping score, nowhere near its halcyon days of November 2021 when it crested over $65,000 \u2014 and one that notches startling gains of more than 38 percent over the past month.\n\nThe recent price increase is likely due to some combination of softening federal interest rates, a general sense that Sam Bankman-Fried's conviction over his misdeeds at FTX serves as a reset for the beleaguered industry, and the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAsset management firm BlackRock had filed for a bitcoin ETF back in June, and then took the first steps towards an ETF for rival cryptocurrency ether earlier this month, which has sparked optimism in the cryptocurrency world after months of low prices.\n\nAn ETF is basically a package of securities that track an index or commodity. In the case of the bitcoin ETF, investors would not own the bitcoin directly but the ETF would be pegged to its value. But most importantly, a bitcoin ETF recognized by the SEC would mark a milestone because it signals institutional approval.\n\nBitcoin Bust\n\nBut facts remain that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile assets, and mining them is still harmful to the environment, despite some efforts to make the process more green.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether bitcoin will ever reach the heights it once had back in 2021, when people were flush with stimulus money, bored from the grinding impact of the pandemic, and bombarded by bitcoin mania in the form of Super Bowl advertisements.\n\nAnd while some are excited about a bitcoin resurgence, the crypto is an utter failure in terms of its intended use as a decentralized form of digital money. It still largely remains a speculative asset among normal investors, transaction fees remain high, and it's a channel for illegal activities. So think twice before entrusting it with your hard-earned retirement assets.\n\nMore on bitcoin: Guy Who Stole Billions in Bitcoin Lived a Sad Life"

        "content": "In a recent interview on the Coin Stories podcast hosted by Natalie Brunell, U.S. Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy discussed his views on Bitcoin, why the government should leave Bitcoin alone, and the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe presidential candidate said Bitcoin \"is an opt out from the broken financial architecture created by by the U.S. Federal Reserve system. And I say this as someone who wants to fight for the dollar to remain the reserve currency of the world.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Ramaswamy asserted that the government perceives Bitcoin as a potential threat to its control over monetary policy. \"Part of it is that they're threatened by the existence of Bitcoin. They don't want people mining for more bitcoin, because that could make bitcoin more popular. Which in turn, creates a threat to the incumbent status of the U.S. Federal Reserve itself,\" he stated.\n\nHe argued that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin challenges the traditional power dynamics of centralized financial systems, causing unease among government institutions. The presidential candidate says he will \"by far be the most Bitcoin or crypto or any other decentralized finance president we've ever had,\" because he thinks \"it is good to decentralize power away from the federal government.\"\n\nHe also addressed the concerns around the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, stating that BlackRock is \"a tentacle of the government.\" He says the money they manage comes from government actors pushing them to adopt agendas, and that it is a \"farce\" to think BlackRock is applying for this ETF in a free market way. Ramaswamy said this is \"the government trying to masquerade as Bitcoin friendly, but in fact it's just a captured system.\"\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race looms closer, Ramaswamy's stance on emerging financial technologies like Bitcoin could become an even bigger focal point of his campaign. Earlier this year, Ramaswamy announced at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami that he had begun accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin over the Lightning Network, making him one of the first U.S. presidential candidates to ever do so.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged above $37,000 between Nov. 10 and 12, only to falter and undergo a correction toward $35,000 on Nov. 13.\n\nThis abrupt movement triggered the liquidation of $121 million worth of long futures contracts, and while Bitcoin\u2019s price stabilized around $35,800 on Nov. 14, investors are left pondering the underlying factors behind this downturn.\n\nBitcoin 12-hour price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nU.S. inflation, gov\u2019t shutdown impact on BTC price\n\nPart of the catalyst behind this movement was the unexpected softening of United States inflation data on Nov. 14. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 3.2% increase in October compared to 2022, leading to a decline in yields on U.S. short-term Treasurys.\n\nThis triggered buying activity in traditional assets, potentially reducing the demand for alternative hedge instruments like Bitcoin. If the Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy to curb inflation successfully without causing a recession pans out, Bitcoin may lose some of its appeal as a hedge.\n\nEven Moody\u2019s rating agency lowering its outlook on the U.S. credit to negative from stable on Nov. 11 did not sway favorably toward Bitcoin and other alternative hedges. Instead, investors sought refuge in short-term 5.25% fixed-income instruments, explaining why gold struggled to surpass $2,000 despite escalating debt levels and global economic challenges.\n\nIn China, October\u2019s retail sales data indicated a 7.6% increase \u2014 the fastest since May. However, this apparent recovery conceals underlying issues, notably a 9.3% decline in property sector investments in the first 10 months of the year. China\u2019s economic stimulus measures, including policy support and liquidity injections, have yielded only modest benefits.\n\nGiven that China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, its economic situation might contribute to investors\u2019 cautious stance on riskier assets like Bitcoin, particularly when viewed within the broader global economic context. Additionally, recent political developments surrounding U.S. government shutdown threats could also influence Bitcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Nov. 14 to keep the government operational through the holiday season, temporarily averting a fiscal crisis. However, this measure sets the stage for potential spending disputes in the coming year, including a provision to cut federal spending by 1% across the board in 2024 if no agreement is reached.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF expectations, regulatory scrutiny\n\nThe cryptocurrency market experienced a negative reaction to a fraudulent BlackRock XRP trust filing on Nov. 13. Although it initially sparked hopes for an XRP (XRP) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., the $9 trillion asset manager swiftly dismissed the claim.\n\nWhile this event is not directly linked to Bitcoin, it has drawn regulatory scrutiny to the crypto sector at a sensitive time when numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications await review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Consequently, irrespective of the parties involved, the outcome represents a net positive for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRelated: Tether credits USDT growth surge to ETF excitement, emerging markets\n\nOn Nov. 13, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart emphasized that approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF should not be expected before January. This statement came amid heightened market anticipation surrounding upcoming SEC decisions scheduled for Nov. 17 and Nov. 21.\n\nHeightened fear of global economic recession\n\nIn essence, the drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price after flirting with the $37,000 level cannot be attributed to a single event. Investors may have reassessed their positions, considering Bitcoin\u2019s substantial $725 billion market capitalization. For comparison, Berkshire Hathaway, a major conglomerate, boasts a $760 billion valuation while posting profits of $76.7 billion in the past year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s stringent monetary policy ensures scarcity and predictability, but major global corporations can repurchase their own stocks using earnings, effectively reducing the available supply. Furthermore, during economic downturns, these trillion-dollar companies can leverage their strong balance sheets during economic downturns to acquire competitors or expand their market dominance.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin\u2019s challenge in maintaining momentum above $37,000 is influenced by factors such as data supporting the Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy for a soft economic landing and concerns over global economic growth. These elements continue to create an unfavorable landscape for Bitcoin\u2019s value, especially if the SEC delays decisions on spot BTC ETFs, aligning with market expectations.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Despite its dominant market share in the crypto sphere, Bitcoin has had limited applications compared to other blockchains which have blossomed to facilitate asset transfers in everything from financial products to video games.\n\nEthereum, for example, has close to 6,000 developers actively building on its network every month as of October 1, according to numbers from Developer Report. Bitcoin, in comparison, has just under 1,000 monthly developers.\n\nA California-based startup called ZetaChain wants to change that by including Bitcoin in the flourishing economy of decentralized finance (DeFi). Off the back of its sizable $27 million Series A raise in August, the company has been busy striking partnerships to scale its blockchain ecosystem.\n\nZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and get access to other blockchains without the need for so-called \u201cbridges\u201d or \u201cwrapped coins\u201d, which are popular solutions that solve one of the biggest hurdles in crypto today \u2014 interoperability across different networks.\n\nOne of the breakthroughs brought by ZetaChain, according to its core contributor Ankur Nandwani, is that developers can deploy smart contracts on the blockchain that can interact with native Bitcoin, essentially adding a smart contract layer to Bitcoin. First proposed by Ethereum, smart contracts are lines of code that execute on predefined rules and have given rise to a proliferation of applications like non-fungible tokens.\n\n\u201cEvery blockchain is like an isolated state and we are connecting them,\u201d said Nandwani in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cMost people use Bitcoin as gold. If you can borrow against gold, you should be able to do what you do with gold for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nToday, ZetaChain announced that it\u2019s adding native Bitcoin support to decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, letting users swap Bitcoin across 30 networks. Behind the scenes, Sushi works by deploying its EVM (Ethereum virtual machine)-compatible smart contract on ZetaChain, meaning that, for the first time, Sushi can support native Bitcoins by making minimal changes.\n\nThese Sushi smart contracts can be accessed from the Bitcoin network itself, so Bitcoin users don\u2019t even need to leave the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the increased liquidity from Bitcoin; it\u2019s about beginning a new chapter in DeFi, where we see more practical use cases of interoperability and enhanced connectivity,\u201d said Sushi\u2019s \u201chead chef\u201d Jared Grey in a statement.\n\nIn October, ZetaChain integrated with centralized exchange OKX\u2019s self-custodial wallet, allowing users to access dApps on various networks and to use their Bitcoins in dApps without the need for wrapping or bridging from the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nStarted in 2021 by serial entrepreneur Nandwani, ZetaChain announced its Series A funding round in August from investors from a range of backgrounds, including quantitative trading firm Jane Street Capital, crypto exchange Blockchain.com and China-focused early-stage VC firm Sky9."

Glad to see you again. So of course, we're seeing Ether jump on the news that uh uh of this Black rock. Uh S one. W what do you make of the way uh uh uh the crypto markets have been responding to uh Ether ETF related uh updates here. Yeah. Well, just start by saying what a, what a difference of two worlds. It's been since, since last time I was on in, in October. Uh kind of looking at the, the confluence of both macro and micro tail ones coming together for the industry and Bitcoin being up 30% plus cents. So, uh you know, not surprising this week that we've seen the delay of the hashtags and expect to see the delay of the Franklin Templeton Bitcoin spot ETF applications. But you know, there continues to be very, very constructive dialogue between the sec and, and issuers. Uh you know, future uh further S one amendments have been filed and uh you know, we expect still very much so that, that this comes in January and uh on the, on the east side, it's just more positive news, I think given the uh argument that these issues have is the reason that the Bitcoin spot is allowed is because there's a Bitcoin features and, uh you know, the same now goes for the east side. Uh So it's only a matter of time before Blackrock and others stepped in and I think what's a little bit of a surprise to the market is how quick that's happened. So I kinda, I kinda wanna get, uh because you, you, you mentioned it, the SEC uh just to kind of clear everything up for everybody. The SEC uh is delaying a decision on the application by hashtags to convert its uh Bitcoin Futures ETF into a spot ETF. Uh And it also punted the, the SEC did also punted the decision on Gray Scale's attempt to do a new uh futures based Ether ETF. So, uh you think these delays, as you said, you're not quite, you're not surprised by this. And, and so what do you think is going on? Yeah, it's, it's really just they want to get all the applications ready for launch on the same day like we saw with the Ethereum Futures ETF uh about last month. And so they're, they're pushing all those to, to that January date. Uh If they, if they delay Blackrock and they're not gonna, they're not gonna let hashtags go unfortunately. So it, it's really just an organizational administration thing and, and I think they probably got clarity that the government shutdown wasn't going to happen. So they have some more time and, you know, maybe we still see it before year end, late December, clear, clear off the slate before the holidays. But, uh, it's just very normal course, uh, going into that January deadline. Now, if all of these are approved on the same day, you would think that most of the funds would flow into the Black Rock ETF, what do you think happens with all of the other applications if they're all approved on the same day? And that first mover advantage is taken away. Yeah, we've, we've seen from the Ethereum Future side II, I believe one or two of those issues actually, uh you know, took down their product after the first week or two just given there, there weren't many flows I think regardless for the industry, it's extremely positive. You know, this is like 10 plus institutional finance and sales teams going around the country and globe selling uh investors as allocators pension funds on what crypto is and why they need to have an allocation in their portfolio. So, uh you know, there'll be a couple uh let's call them martyrs who, who don't get the inflows but have invested extreme amounts of time and, and resources into making these products a huge success and, and spreading the good word. So I, I expect, you know, there's a couple of main players, I think Blackrock's one of them. I think the invest go uh Galaxy is another one of them. Uh And then I would say just given the, the large liquidity head start that G BT C has, you know, already 20 billion in assets in that vehicle. I think those three to me come to mind, you know, maybe are 21 shares but, but uh there's differences in these, these distribution platforms and vehicles across, across each firm. So speaking of which is so talk a little bit more about the uh lending market here, the crypto lending market. Uh One almost thought that that was over uh with the collapse of uh I don't know, uh Celsius and things like that. Uh No offense to Maple, but you know how it is. So uh tell us what's going on here. Yeah. Yeah, Lawrence, uh there's an old adage from Wall Street, something like when the credit market start to thaw and, and open back up is when you really start to see things recover. So we're, we're seeing that full force uh on the maple front. It's, it's definitely the new beginnings of a, of a recovery and, and growth market. Uh lending volumes have, have scaled back tremendously. We, we just in the last month, we crossed $100 million in total uh uh a active loans on the platform. It's a, it's been a large uptick in in demand and inbounds from, from our borrower base uh looking to access capital and, and, and let me just ask you lay a few out and see if this is a bull market. The we crossed 100 million in loans on boarded and issued loans to two of the, the largest institutions to ever borrow from Maple and have the largest monthly inbound onboarding across in the past 12 months. So definitely feeling it. So who, who are the, who are these borrowers? Because are, are, are they, you guys deal mostly with institutions? Uh You know what, what about the retail investor? How, what, what percentage would you say is uh retail versus institutional? Yes. So we don't deal with retail at all. It's, it's only a a institutional platform both on the lending and borrowing side, institution in crypto in many cases, is retail to, to uh traditional finance. So if you had to look at it that way on the high net worth side, yes. Uh As long as everyone's an a credit investor, uh we do have a number of, of institutional credit funds who, who have LP S and, and you could call them high net worth retail on the, on the back end of them uh deploying into Maple. But, but for the most part, we're seeing uh institutional allocators, you know, that have stuck around and, and whether the storm uh you know, continuing to look for yield and, and stable coin supply has increased as well, which has been a, a boon of new capital into the space. So the types of players uh using the Maple platform today consist of high net worth individuals accredited and, uh you know, a number of financial services, largely related businesses in the space. So you can think of funds otc desks, liquidity providers, uh a few Bitcoin miners looking to borrow against their Bitcoin and uh you know, larger, larger kind of institutions that, that play in this space. Yes. All right, Quinn, you've been on the show before. So you know, it's prediction time Bitcoin, as I mentioned at the top of the show almost touched $38,000 yesterday. D by researchers, Marcus Thin is predicting Bitcoin could reach 40,000 if not $45,000 by the end of the year. What do you make of that prediction and give us a little prediction of your own? Yeah. II, I don't hate that. Uh I think we are in a, in a very new regime for crypto markets. We've seen dramatic near term pricing, obviously, which uh the markets kind of finally understanding this and the macro is extremely supportive as well. Equities are are approaching all time highs, interest rates obtained commodities have fall, the dollars fall. And so these are some of the most bullish catalysts you can get for the digital asset industry from a macro perspective. And then uh on top of that, you have the, the Bitcoin ETF S coming in January, you have the having coming uh first thing Q two and, and these are two events that will uh consume, you know, probably 2 to 3 X. The supply of, of, of New Bitcoin coming into the market which is just bullish for, for Bitcoin miners. It's bullish for uh you know, price. So I, I expect, I actually expect in October, I called for 38 K by your end. Maybe that's a little low. II, I think we get a little pull back here in the near term. Just given how quickly things have run. Thanksgiving is usually always a little weird time. Uh But I think going into December, January, it's, it's, you know, I don't think 50 K is off, off. Uh The question."

        "title": "BlackRock's Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing 'Will Get Approved,' Mark Yusko Predicts - CoinDesk",
        "content": "The crypto markets have come back to life this year. Bitcoin doubled, doubled since the beginning of the year, more than doubled. Uh Some of it has to do with the excitement over a potential spot ETF being approved and there's also uh the issue of the Federal Reserve is being a little bit on the Dovish side. I don't know. Um although they kind of say hire for longer anyway, joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Morgan Creep Capital Management. CEO at CIO Mark. Yo, welcome back, Mark. Hey guys, how are you doing? Great to be with you. Good, good to, good to be there. Good, having you on again. Um You know, we talked about staple coins and it just now, uh and some of what we're seeing in the, in the crypto markets, we're seeing an influx of capital into the stable coins, particularly us DT, not so much us DCU S DC seems to be quite on the decline. Uh and, and keep people keep burning it. I, I think again, I think that those are Canadians burning it for, for hot, uh you know, as the winter months come. Yeah, you know, nor of the Quebec could be really, really cold but um otherwise no US CC is being burned. US DT is on the rise. What's going on and how is that affecting the crypto markets? Is that, is that part of what's driving the crypto markets now? Uh I don't know that is driving the crypto markets. I mean, I look stablecoins are, are here to stay. Um, you know, we are going to move to a, a digital world, whether the, the incumbents financial services companies like it or not. Um, you know, name a technology that came along that got critical mass that, that went away. Right. You know, of course, and buggy manufacturers didn't really like the automobile, the train companies don't really like airplanes, but I didn't take a horse and buggy or a train yesterday when I flew to New York, I flew on an airplane. So, uh, this isn't as inevitable as, as the internet phone companies didn't like the internet, they tried to pass laws to make it illegal. Imagine that. And, um, Al Gore killed that bill. So he didn't invent the internet, but he certainly helped it and look stablecoins are, are a great way of transferring value quickly, efficiently and without worrying about market price. And I don't know if you've ever thought about this and, you know, I think about it from time to time, you know, banks are closed more hours than they're open. The markets are closed more hours than they're open and digital assets never sleep. I could transfer you US DC right now if I wanted to, if I could get to my phone, but I'm using my phone since I forgot my computer today. But, uh, so I don't know, I, it's a long winded way of saying, I don't think Stablecoins are the real reason. We're seeing some pretty meaningful pumps in, in a number of coins. I think it's momentum. It's the having cycle. It's the ETF which, you know, croc will get approved, you know, which day I can't tell you exactly. But they're going to get approved whether anyone else does. I, I hope so since I own pieces of two of the companies that are ahead of them in line, but I'm un doubtful that they will get approval. I think Blackrock will get it and I think that's going to bring tens, probably hundreds of billions of dollars into Bitcoin and some of that is going to flow down to other coins as well. I noticed in your answer, you didn't mention CB DCs and as I mentioned before, one would suspect that if you're going to make a large transaction, you're going to be more reluctant to use a Stablecoin than you are a CBD C. Oh, well, look, um, the incumbents would love if the world went to CBD C. There was a big announcement this morning that Apollo and, and a bunch of others are doing this thing to help with the asset management business with JP Morgan and avalanche and OK, great. But that's a private chain. JP Morgan would love you to use a private chain CBD CS. The reason I don't mention CBD CS is I think they're pure evil. I think they're one of the most heinous things you can imagine. They imagine that the guy in charge of the BLS, I'm sure you've seen Augustin. Um, he's a kind of scary guy and you know, he says, of course, we should control how you spend your money when you spend your money if you be allowed to spend your money. Um, you know, programmable money that AAA government can control is a very scary thing. Open and free markets are, are less scary to me. So I, I like Stablecoins. I like digital assets. I love Bitcoin. You might like it, but given that it's so scary, isn't it also inevitable? Well, sure. And I do think that there look fiat isn't going away overnight. Um, now it will eventually go away. I mean, you know, we've had one money for 5000 years. Money is an asset that exists in the absence of a liability. That's gold. Gold has been money for most of human history and it's the only thing that you can take a single ounce from Cleopatra's time to a suit of armor to a zoot suit in the twenties to Sao Road today. And you exchange that ounce and you get a fine person suit. It's been a perfect store of value. There have been 775 paper currencies, all kinds of countries all around the world over the millennia and three quarters of them no longer exist. All the others are down 97 to 99.99999% and all of them will eventually go to zero because governments can't help themselves. They just spend their way into oblivion and their currencies have to be devalued because that's the only way out. So digital assets, the distinct thing about them is take Bitcoin, it's digital gold, it's equally scarce stock to flow ratio is fantastic and it's more divisible and more portable. So I believe it will replace gold as the base layer of money. All money sits on top of gold. Central banks own gold, they issue debt issue currency on top of that. That's the way the world works. I think Bitcoin replaces that. It's not going to go down without a fight. And to your point, they're going to try to digitize it and make it centralized but centralized is the opposite of what we all want, which is decentralized and we will live in a decentralized world in the future. It's just going to take a while. Mark, I want to talk about another token, another Cryptocurrency that is outperforming this morning. I mentioned at the top of the show Solana's soul jumped to nearly 20% in the last 24 hours. What do you make of this new interest, this renewed interest in the Solana Blockchain and its native to Jen. I'm taking full credit 100% credit. I made this happen. So in September early September, I um made a comment on, on a show that Solana had had vaporized transactions during the last, the last cycle. Oh my God, the community went, went ballistic. They were so mad like we did. We never rolled back transactions. I said, I never said you rolled back transactions. I said because of outages in the protocol, the transactions went into the ether and and never got settled and unless you re entered that transaction, it never happened. Now, a couple of people actually were positive and said, hey, let us help you understand this, this guy happy pirate from the Netherlands sat me down on a zoom and walked me through all the changes that they've made and so on. Uh September 22nd literally almost to the day of the bottom at just under 20 bucks. I said, you know what, I've changed my mind. Uh These guys have convinced me that there's, there's something going on here and it's gone to 60 since then. So I'm definitely taking full credit. We're on that one. We're gonna quote you on that one mark. Just kidding around. But no, I, what I think is happening is a couple of things. One, they did fix some of the problems. So that, that's a positive two. We had breakpoint and Breakpoint is always a pump fest. So that, that certainly is part of it. Three. we didn't see the FTX cash get sold. You know, the bankruptcy trustee had threatened to sell all their, their salon and they haven't done that yet that, that will put some pressure on at some point. Uh, And then actually there's some building going on. You know, one of the things that I love about right now is I've been to a bunch of events. I went to permission list, you know, the eh event and I went to Bitcoin event and I went to a file coin event and they're down 80 90% in terms of people, but the people who are left are the builders. So the speculators are gone, the gamblers are gone, the crypto browser and gals are gone and what we have left are people who are building real things. That's super exciting. And if you think about history, the great companies are built in bear markets, they're not built in bull markets because capital flows too freely. You think about breakpoint two years ago at 21 right? Million dollar after parties and you know the price at 260 bucks. That was the peak, right? When you're spending a million dollars on an after party, bad things happen after that. So when you have a nice, you know, I went to a party at Bitcoin Miami this past year and it was at a little taco shop after, you know, renting out a big mansion on, on the water two years ago. So when, when you're down to that level, good things happen, frugality. All right, Mark, we do got to wrap it here, but I spoke over Lawrence and he was asking if you got any Solana bags, you know, II I have to admit we sold most of our, you know, we were very early investors and I, I give Kyle all the credit, you know, we invested in multi coin and, and they bought us a bunch of, of salon. And so we probably one of the best investments I've ever had in my career on a multiple basis. I think we made about 1000 times our money. Um but we did sell most of it, but we still have a decent amount and uh probably hold it for a while. All right, Mark, we're gonna leave it there. Always a pleasure having you on the show. Thanks for joining us. Thanks y'all, talk to you soon. That was Morgan Creek Capital Management, CEO and Cio Mark Yusko."

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through November 14, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price hit $37,000 this past week for the first time since May 2022. BTC is now up ~120% year to date. Some crypto market observers believe this year\u2019s rally is the start of something even greater and that Bitcoin could continue this momentum over the next few years.\n\nFind out more about what\u2019s going on in the Bitcoin Ecosystem.\n\nXRP\u2019s price fell slightly this week and is now up ~90% year to date.\n\nEther posted its highest close in over seven months during the past week, finishing just above $2,100. ETH is now up ~71% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the crypto ETF market?

        "title": "Expect some crypto companies to fail in the wake of Bitcoin's halving - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As we approach Bitcoin's (BTC) halving in April, a phenomenon that historically triggers significant market shifts, companies within the space are at a critical juncture. This event is surrounded by speculation and strategic planning, and for some, a sense of uncertainty. While it's laden with opportunities, it's vital for businesses to adopt a balanced approach, integrating a long-term perspective rather than catering to market euphoria.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin halving events \u2014 which reduce mining rewards by half \u2014 have triggered substantial changes in the crypto landscape. These changes often lead to increased market activity and heightened investor interest. However, basing an entire business strategy on the outcomes of the halving can be a double-edged sword. Focusing solely on short-term gains could lead to missed opportunities or strategic errors that endanger a company's future viability.\n\nThe recent layoffs by layer-2 blockchain Avalanche underscore the volatility and unpredictability inherent to the crypto sector. Such developments highlight the necessity of robust risk management strategies. Companies must be prepared for any eventuality, ensuring their survival beyond the halving event. This calls for a focus on sustainable growth, solid financial planning and a reluctance to overextend in pursuit of fleeting opportunities.\n\nRelated: History tells us we\u2019re in for a strong bull market with a hard landing\n\nIn light of this, crypto companies are increasingly channeling their efforts into product development and halting marketing efforts. The goal is to diversify offerings and cater to an evolving customer base, which is expected to expand post-halving. This strategy is not only about capitalizing on the immediate upsurge in halving-related interest but also about building a foundation that can withstand market fluctuations.\n\nA possible consequence for some companies? Products will be rushed to release \u2014 without adequate cybersecurity preparations. The crypto industry, by its very nature, is a prime target for cyberattacks. History has repeatedly shown what happens to projects that fail to learn from our long list of predecessors who have fallen to hackers.\n\nThe 4th Bitcoin halving will happen in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe 1st halving in 2012 resulted in a 10,000% increase ($11 -> $1,150)\n\n\n\nThe 2nd halving in 2016 resulted in a 3,000% increase ($650 -> $20,000)\n\n\n\nThe 3rd halving in 2020 results in a 630% increase ($8,800 -> $64,000)\n\n\n\nNotice a pattern? pic.twitter.com/zaqkEJUWmC \u2014 legen (@legen_eth) November 13, 2023\n\nMoreover, the current landscape of venture capital in the crypto sector presents a complex picture. The AI hype and the recent crypto winter led to a drying up of funds. However, there's a renewed interest as investors look to capitalize on the halving event. This resurgence of investment must be navigated with caution. Expansion and investment should be backed by a solid financial plan, especially in a market known for its volatility.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the marketing and public perception surrounding the halving. While it's important to generate awareness and excitement, overhyping the event can backfire. Setting realistic expectations is key to maintaining credibility and trust with the user base. The industry has seen its fair share of backlashes due to unmet, overambitious projections.\n\nAnother crucial and often overlooked aspect that crypto companies should consider: the rapidly changing regulatory landscape. Crypto is increasingly coming under the scrutiny of global regulators, particularly in Europe, where discussions about comprehensive crypto regulation are intensifying.\n\nThe shift toward stricter regulatory oversight is indicative of a global trend where governments are seeking to balance innovation in the crypto space with investor protection and financial stability. This change isn't just a matter of compliance. It represents a fundamental shift in how crypto businesses must operate. Companies need to stay abreast of these developments as new regulations could be implemented before the halving in April. Companies that focus on the halving without regard for impending legislative changes may suffer quick consequences.\n\nRelated: WSJ debacle fueled US lawmakers\u2019 ill-informed crusade against crypto\n\nInnovation in compliance can be a competitive advantage. As regulations become more complex and expansive, crypto companies that proactively integrate compliance into their business models and technology infrastructures will likely find themselves ahead of the curve. This involves investing in compliance and regulatory technology, which can provide efficiencies and help navigate the intricacies of varying jurisdictional requirements. For crypto companies, the challenge is to innovate while adhering to these new rules, turning regulatory adherence into a strategic asset rather than a burden.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving and the intensifying regulatory climate herald a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. This dual challenge will inevitably lead to a significant shake-up, where only the most adaptable and forward-thinking companies will survive. Those who take a merely reacting approach risk falling behind or failing altogether.\n\nSuccess in this new era demands being proactive \u2014 integrating innovative strategies that align with regulatory frameworks and harness the halving's potential. The companies that emerge stronger will be those that view these challenges not as obstacles but as opportunities to redefine and solidify their position in a rapidly maturing market. This shift from mere survival to strategic evolution is what will distinguish the leaders in the post-halving, regulated crypto landscape.\n\nDaniele Servadei is the 20-year-old founder and CEO of Sellix, an Italian e-commerce platform that has processed more than $75 million in transactions for more than 2.3 million customers worldwide.

        "title": "Decoding Bitcoin: Essential Insights for Smart Investing - The Cincinnati Enquirer",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nCryptocurrencies have disrupted the digital financial market, and needless to say, Bitcoin is ruling this realm. Despite several phases of market setbacks, the incredible rise of Bitcoin has made it a popular pick among discerning crypto investors. However, the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the wild world of crypto has also impacted the Bitcoin price with erratic twists and turns. If you are someone willing to venture into the world of crypto with Bitcoin, then learning some of the key factors associated with this digital currency is essential. These factors will offer an insight into the intricacies of this digital currency, helping you make informed decisions.\n\nTo begin with, let\u2019s decode the concept behind Bitcoin and what separates it from traditional currencies. Due to the decentralized network structure it operates on, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority and is also not a tangible asset. This network is called blockchain, where transactions are verified through cryptography. To be precise, blockchain technology is like a global digital ledger that records every Bitcoin transaction. This structure has been designed to ensure transparency and security, making Bitcoin a preferred option among investors.\n\nComing to the volatility factor, the Bitcoin price has been through a roller-coaster ride in terms of fluctuations. One day, it skyrockets, and the next day, it drops. This volatility can be either a blessing or a curse for investors. While the record rise in Bitcoin price can offer substantial gains, it can also lead to irreparable losses when it plummets. So, it is a wise idea to not just rely on Bitcoin for profit in the crypto realm. It is crucial to diversify your investments into other prospective currencies.\n\nThe regulatory policies are not talked about much but have a profound influence on the Bitcoin price. There are no standard rules for crypto transactions, so the regulations vary across countries. While some governments are more lenient on the rules, others adopt a cautionary approach to limit crypto transactions. This rapidly changing regulatory landscape leads to unforeseen market conditions, and Bitcoin is no exception. Staying informed about the recent developments in crypto regulations can help minimize potential risks when investing in Bitcoin.\n\nAdopting strong security measures is also important in Bitcoin transactions because the currency doesn't provide immunity to scams or cyber threats. With the rising number of security breaches globally leading to heavy losses for investors, looking for a reliable crypto exchange with robust security practices is imperative. A hardware wallet offers the highest security to safeguard your investment from potential cyber-attacks.\n\nBlockchain technology is constantly evolving with the innovations in the technology landscape. These also influence Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, opening new possibilities and challenges. Keeping track of all these technological advancements can provide valuable insights to assess the pattern of the Bitcoin price movement and the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin might seem attractive, but learning all the underlying factors of this currency is necessary to reduce risk and maximize gain. It is crucial to ensure a careful approach backed by in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of this market. The key to success in the crypto market is knowledge, and gaining it is a consistent process. So, before you take the plunge, earn the wisdom to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk."

        "content": "Hoping to re-infuse the Bitcoin community with \"magic,\" quirky startup Taproots Wizards has raised $7.5 million in seed round financing with crypto-focused venture capitalist Standard Crypto leading the round.\n\n\"We heard about bitcoin 10 years ago. And we're here to fix it,\" Taproot Wizards posted to X on Thursday. \"Our mission is to repopulate Bitcoin\u2019s 10-year-old wizard village.\"\n\nThe organization is a \"Bitcoin-focused Ordinals project,\" according to TechCrunch, which broke the news of the seed round. \"Taproot Wizards has a limited mint of 2,121 wizards, the specific number paying homage to the total supply of bitcoin: 21 million,\" the report said. \"To date, less than 1% \u2014 20 Taproot Wizards\u2019 Ordinals \u2014 have been inscribed so far.\"\n\nOrdinals, which enable the indexing and tracking of every satoshi (Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit) across the network, were introduced in January. The process called \"inscription\" allocates image or other data to individual satoshis. Ordinals can serve as either individual NFTs or fungible BRC-20 tokens.\n\nIn February, The Block reported that crypto developer Udi Wertheimer and Bitcoin mining company Luxor had teamed up in a wizard-themed NFT collection.

        "title": "Which Bitcoin Mining Stock Is a Better Buy: Riot or Marathon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Although the Bitcoin (BTC -3.27%) mining industry continues to grow, two companies currently lead the way: Riot Platforms (RIOT -9.12%) and Marathon Digital (MARA -10.23%). As the most valuable companies by market cap, Riot and Marathon have ascended to the top by means of differing strategies. While both have built a track record of success, which one is worthy of a spot in your portfolio?\n\nTo gain a better understanding of what separates one from the other, we need to take a comprehensive look at recent financial statements, long-term strategy, and competitive advantages unique to each company. In doing so, it will become clear which company is the true leader of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nMarathon continues at a record pace\n\nMarathon is a clear leader in terms of hash rate, a metric that quantifies a company's computational power to mine Bitcoin. Based on third-quarter earnings, Marathon's installed hash rate hit a new all-time high of 23.1 exahashes per second (EH/s), good enough to produce nearly 3,500 Bitcoins. Should equipment installments and expansion plans be fulfilled in the coming months, Marathon expects to hit a hash rate of 26 EH/s by the end of the year and increase its mining capabilities by 30% in 2024.\n\nWith a soaring hash rate placing it at the top of the industry, Marathon had an impressive Q3 as it raked in $97.85 million in revenue. Add in the fact that expenses declined significantly, and Marathon turned a profit to the tune of $64 million. That's a refreshing improvement, considering that last quarter, the company posted a net loss of more than $19 million.\n\nLikely the most beneficial development to occur for Marathon was its restructuring of long-term debt. With debt totaling more than $780 million before Q3, Marathon completed a note exchange in September that reduced long-term debt by 56% and captured a total savings of approximately $101 million in cash. For the first time since 2021, Marathon's cash and Bitcoin holdings exceeded debt at the quarter's end.\n\nRiot's misleading setback\n\nNotching its own all-time high hash rate just shy of 11 EH/s, Riot produced 1,106 Bitcoins over the past three months. Yet, while hash rate increased, Riot's total production took a serious hit. Last quarter, Riot produced 1,775 Bitcoins. But as a result of it mining 600 fewer Bitcoins in Q3, total revenue fell nearly one-third, causing the company to post a net loss of more than $45 million.\n\nThere are likely a handful of reasons why production declined even though hash rate increased. The most plausible is related to Riot's power strategy, where it turns miners off when the cost of electricity exceeds mining profitability, a luxury it can afford thanks to its location in Texas. When this situation occurs, as it often does during peak summer months, Riot sells electricity back to the grid and receives power curtailment credits. In Q3, Riot obtained nearly $50 million in credits, but due to accounting practices, power curtailment credits are not included in revenue.\n\nThe tale of the tape\n\nWhile hash rate and total production are commonly used metrics in comparing Bitcoin mining companies, there is much more to consider. If we were to only use production, Marathon would be a clear winner.\n\nHowever, while Marathon is nearly twice as productive as Riot, its exorbitant debt could hinder profits. While the recent debt restructuring was badly needed and a step in the right direction, there is still a hefty chunk left over. And when compared to Riot, which has virtually zero long-term debt, Marathon's liabilities become magnified.\n\nRiot's absence of debt is what makes it particularly suited to thrive in the volatile Bitcoin mining industry. Not to mention, the company has plans to expand its hash rate to more than 20 EH/s by next year as it builds its Corsicana Facility, a project fully funded independent of external financing.\n\nThe cherry on top is Riot's unique power strategy that has led to some of the lowest costs in the industry. As it currently stands, the average cost it takes for Riot to mine one Bitcoin is just $14,400. For Marathon, this number sits closer to $24,000.\n\nAt first glance, Riot's Q3 was extremely dismal compared to Marathon's. However, only comparing hash rate and revenue doesn't paint the full picture. Even though this quarter was less than ideal for Riot, the company is in a much stronger financial position and will continue to benefit from its expansion plans and unique energy strategy.\n\nWhile Marathon's production is at the top of the industry, Riot is a more well-rounded company that will help it succeed in the long haul. And that is why Riot Platforms may be a better fit for your portfolio than Marathon Digital."

        "content": "On Nov. 15, several altcoins continued to show strength alongside Bitcoin (BTC), which notched an intra-day high at $37,400. Leading into the week, DYDX, Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) and Avalanche\u2019s AVAX (AVAX) currently reflect double-digit gains, with each chasing after new year-to-date highs.\n\nThe sustained bullish price action from altcoins has led some analysts to declare the arrival of an altcoin season, and at the time of writing, the total market capitalization of the altcoin market has hit a 2023 high at $659.5 billion.\n\nAltcoin price rallies typically involve a slew of factors, some being sentiment-based and others based on project fundamentals. Let\u2019s look at a few of this week\u2019s top market performers to see what catalysts underlie their growth.\n\ndYdX fee switch boosts price\n\nThe platform behind the DYDX token is dYdX, a decentralized exchange that offers futures contracts on Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchain tokens like Ether (ETH). On Oct. 27, dYdX launched its layer-1 blockchain with the creation of its genesis block, which operates using native DYDX tokens. The launch allowed for the on-chain distribution of all fees received to validators and stakers. The protocol update has been fantastic for DYDX\u2019s price, sending it up over 110% in the past 30 days.\n\nDYDX price.

Both metrics have witnessed 77.5% increases to $8.67 million in 30 days. Annualized, this could mean $105.5 million in fees for validators and stakers.\n\nDYDX fees and revenue. Source: TokenTerminal\n\nSOL price hits another 2023 high\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has had an impressive 30-day return profile, gaining over 166%. Despite reaching a 2023 high on Nov. 10, Solana\u2019s price is still over 4x below its all-time high of $259.96.\n\nSolana price. Source: TokenTerminal\n\nSolana\u2019s price growth has been powered by an uptick in users, which is led by the top-performing decentralized application on the blockchain, Jito, a liquidity staking platform. Solana\u2019s daily active users also hit a 2023 high on Nov. 10, reaching 200,000. Coinciding with the increase in users, Solana\u2019s revenue has eclipsed $1 million in 30 days, recording a 78.2% increase.\n\nSolana daily active users and revenue. Source: TokenTerminal\n\nAvalanche\u2019s AVAX token picks up steam\n\nAvalanche is a layer-1 blockchain similar to Solana, where validators process transactions and receive tokens. Compared with Solana and dYdX, Avalanche brings in less revenue, but that hasn\u2019t stopped its token from going on a double-digit run this week.\n\ndYdX, Solana and Avalanche fees. Source: TokenTerminal\n\nDespite being relatively smaller, AVAX has been performing well. In the past seven days, AVAX reached above 59% in gains, and it hit an impressive 118% growth in 30 days. AVAX\u2019s price is still more than 7x below its all-time high.\n\nRelated: Is it altseason? Altcoin 30-day performance and total market cap flash bullish\n\nAVAX price.

        "content": "Analysts have indicated that bitcoin, along with other risk assets, could witness significant capital inflows next year, as market indicators suggest the Federal Reserve could pivot to a more dovish monetary policy stance.\n\nAccording to the CME's FedWatch tool, recent futures trading data suggests investors are anticipating a more dovish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe latest indications on FedWatch reveal an almost 100% probability that the Fed will maintain its target rate within the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meeting on December 13.\n\nThe data also shows that futures traders are now pricing in at least four rate cuts by the end of the Fed\u2019s December 2024 policy meeting.\n\nImpact of a Fed pivot on risk assets\n\nIn light of this consensus that the U.S. central bank could reverse its \"higher rates for longer\" monetary policy, YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha explained that this could see bitcoin surge by the end of 2024. \"In the case of a pivot to avoid a recession in the U.S., the risk assets market can get significant capital inflow in the second part of 2024,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Lienkha cautioned that the first reduction of interest rates \"will start no earlier than in the middle of 2024, which means that risk assets will be under pressure at least until then.\"\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill pointed to historic instances when loose monetary policy led to a rise in the value of bitcoin. \"The period of relaxed monetary policy between 2019 and 2021 coincided with a rise in bitcoin prices, while the subsequent tightening of monetary policy led to a decline,\" Butterfill added.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex analysts, \u201cA pivot from the Federal Reserve's current monetary tightening stance to a more accommodative policy could potentially have a positive impact on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, which have a high beta.\" Speaking to The Block, Bitfinex analysts explained that a Fed pivot would signal a decrease in risk aversion among investors. \"This could lead to increased capital inflows into riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies,\" the analysts added.\n\nAdditionally, the Bitfinex analysts said that if the Fed were to signal a rate reversal in 2024, this would suggest that the central bank is anticipating the balance to be restored in the economic metrics, \"which could further contribute to a more bullish sentiment among investors.\"\n\nBitcoin supply scarcity\n\nA Federal Reserve rate reversal could coincide with the fourth bitcoin halving. This event is estimated to occur in April 2024, when the reward for mining new blocks will be halved. The halving has implications for bitcoin supply and valuation.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"Bitcoin BTC -2.75% halvings have historically led to substantial price increases,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block. The analysts explained how the reduced supply of new bitcoins tends to create upward pressure on the price. This is assuming demand remains constant or increases.\n\n\"The event typically attracts more investors, anticipating a price rise, thereby potentially driving the price up due to increased demand,\" Bitfinex analysts added. However, they cautioned that a \u2018sell the event\u2019 phenomenon could cause a valuation drawdown, historically and technically speaking, it has been a bullish event.\n\nBitcoin liquid supply at historic low\n\nThe upcoming bitcoin halving could have an impact on the liquid supply of bitcoin, which is already at historic lows. According to analysts at Glassnode, the long-term holder bitcoin cohort is accumulating the market share of the digital asset, and gradually removing it to cold wallet storage. \"Short-term holder supply is currently at multi-year lows of 2.33 million bitcoin,\" Glassnode analysts added in a note sent to The Block.\n\n\"We will see the full impact on bitcoin supply later when the global economy overcomes current difficulties. If authorities manage to find a path to a soft landing, bitcoin price will significantly surge by the end of 2024,\" Ruslan Lienkha said.\n\nHe pointed to other indicators that show a bullish sentiment among traders. \"USDT is the main quote ticker in the market right now; most BTC purchases are made with stablecoins. Therefore, growing stablecoins capitalization combined with increasing token prices will show market saturation with liquidity and indicate sustained growth,\" Lienkha added.\n\nAdditional indicators indicating bullish sentiment\n\nAnalysts at Bitfinex added to the specific indicators that investors should be aware of when attempting to anticipate future market responses.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex, some indicators to watch are supply metrics, long-term vs short-term holder supply, and spent output age bands, or SOABs. \"Notably, the SOAB indicator recently showcased that the intra-week bitcoin price depreciation to around $34,500 actually increased supply concentration with the bitcoin holder cohort who purchased 6-18 months ago, possibly also in anticipation of the halving,\" Bitfinex analysts added.\n\nThe analysts said that in contrast to this, the supply with short-term holders, who hold for one to three months, has declined significantly. \"This is reflective of the fact that experienced investors who time the market accurately are actually increasing their holdings while new market entrants are panic selling holdings when it moves below their buying price or dips sharply,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization increased by around 0.5% in the past 24 hours to $36,516 at 12:00 p.m. in New York, according to CoinGecko."

The altcoin is now changing hands for $64.83 (\u00a352.28), as of the time of writing.\n\nComing hot on its heels is cardano (ADA-USD), rallying over 9% in the past 24 hours, now priced at $0.40. Both altcoins are the native tokens of layer 1 'smart contract' blockchains that are essentially rivals of the Ethereum network (ETH-USD).\n\nSolana professes to be able to settle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost compared to the Ethereum network. However, analysts argue that the former achieves this by compromising some of its overall security.\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalisation now stands at $1.48tn, up 4.5% change in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is eyeing the $38,000 mark, reaching a height of $37,900 in the past 24 hours. The largest digital asset by market capitalisation is now changing hands for $37,318, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nInvestors anticipate another Fed rate pause\n\nThe latest indications on the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch gauge show a 100% probability that the Fed will maintain its target rate within the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meetings. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to announce the US central bank's next monetary policy decision at a meeting on December 13.\n\nRead more: Crypto bosses pouring millions into anti-ageing tech to live longer\n\nDriven by recent indications that both consumer and wholesale inflation rates have eased considerably from their mid-2022 peaks, data on the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch also points to a full percentage point of rate cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts point to signals the Fed may be softening its overall ambition to reach an annual inflation goal of 2%. \u201cWhat we decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference in September.\n\nMarkets may be projecting the end of Fed rate hikes. Major stock indices have gained this week. US stocks closed slightly higher on Wednesday, as fresh inflation data reinforced anticipation among investors that the Fed could be done raising interest rates.\n\nWatch: The web3 social media app for 'buying and selling shares of your friends' | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "title": "Taproot Wizards raises $7.5M for its Ordinals project to bring the \u2018magic\u2019 back to Bitcoin - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Though Bitcoin is considered to be the grandfather of crypto, it\u2019s not always talked about for its innovation or pushing the envelope. Some want it to stay that way, but not everyone.\n\nTaproot Wizards, a Bitcoin-focused Ordinals project that was inspired by the original Bitcoin wizard Reddit meme from a decade ago, is trying to change the way the blockchain is perceived. The project has raised $7.5 million in a round led by Standard Crypto, Taproot Wizards co-founders Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall shared exclusively with TechCrunch+. They declined to disclose a valuation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in Bitcoin for over a decade. We have these memories of how Bitcoin was. It was very experimental, but it changed,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe want to bring back the culture of building on Bitcoin and make it magical again.\u201d\n\nOther investors include Geometry, Collider Ventures, StarkWare, UTXO Management, Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Masterkey and Newman Capital. The money will be used to rebuild Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cwizard village,\u201d which symbolizes the ecosystem\u2019s desire to compete with other major blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. \u201cWe want to enable or introduce a new way of being a Bitcoiner,\u201d Wall said.\n\nThis investment has similar potential to the one Yuga Labs made in Bored Ape Yacht Club, said Standard Crypto co-founder Alok Vasudev. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot they can do there in building the brand, potentially other collections under the umbrella, but more interestingly we think there\u2019s also interesting infrastructure opportunities for a more dynamic Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d he said. Standard expects to be a part of that movement, rather than just a steward of an NFT collection.\n\n\u201cThe reason we went for a larger round is because we think time is of the essence,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe care a lot about Ordinals and Taproot Wizards, but our mission is bigger than that; we want to bring innovation back to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nTaproot Wizards has a limited mint of 2,121 wizards, the specific number paying homage to the total supply of bitcoin: 21 million. Of that total, 2106, or 99.3%, have been inscribed, but less than 1% \u2014 20 Taproot Wizards\u2019 Ordinals \u2014 have been distributed so far. Wertheimer said they are not sharing the exact pacing of its releases because they didn\u2019t want the hype to fade off quickly. \u201cWe want to find people on a mission, not those focused on JPEGS,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdinals have been given to active community members who participated in its \u201cwizard school\u201d or who are die-hard fans, getting tattoos or sending in videos of them showering in wizard outfits for the opportunity to claim one.\n\nOrdinals, which are comparable to NFTs, launched in December 2022 and gained significant momentum from the Bitcoin community and others in the beginning of 2023. Even though the bigger NFT industry for Ethereum- or Solana-based digital collectibles was declining in value, Ordinals were gaining traction.\n\nBy mid-March 2023, one of the biggest NFT marketplaces, Magic Eden, launched a Bitcoin-focused marketplace for Ordinals, partnering with 13 collections with the \u201cstrongest communities,\u201d including Taproot Wizards, COO and co-founder of Magic Eden Zhuoxun Yin said at the time.\n\nThe total number of inscriptions hit 40.4 million on Wednesday, up 14% from the month-ago date, according to Dune Analytics data. On November 12, the number of daily Ordinals inscribed hit an all-time high of over 505,000.\n\n\u201cIf this was just a hype thing, I wouldn\u2019t have been interested,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in Bitcoin and crypto for 10 years; we see this as an opportunity to push Bitcoin forward. Hype cycles come and go; there\u2019s a fundamental shift here.\u201d\n\nEven though there\u2019s continued growth for Ordinals, the Bitcoin community still remains divided on whether NFTs on its blockchain should happen. \u201cOrdinals started at a time where there weren\u2019t tailwinds behind it,\u201d Vasudev said. \u201c[Taproot Wizards is] growing despite headwinds, and it speaks to the power of what\u2019s here and what a company like this can serve as.\u201d\n\nSome projects, like Taproot Wizards, believe that Ordinals are a positive and fun way to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem. But other \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d criticize these projects for making a \u201cjoke\u201d of the ecosystem, taking block space on the network and raising transaction fees, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe think [Bitcoin\u2019s innovation] has been stagnating because of cultural reasons, not technical ones, and those can be solved,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cOnce that\u2019s broken, we think it\u2019s going to improve.\u201d\n\nSome people in the Bitcoin community have tried to stop the project, Wall said. \u201cThere are influential Bitcoiners who have tried to develop code or encourage miners to censor this type of activity on the block[chain], which is completely against the ethos of Bitcoin; they can\u2019t really stop us from having fun with it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is gaining traction in the NFT world, compared to Ethereum and Solana, the other biggest blockchains for NFTs, it still has room to grow. But in the past 30 days, Bitcoin was the second largest blockchain by NFT sales volume at about $163 million, up 1,074% during the time frame, behind Ethereum, which saw $279.8 million in sales, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cI think the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are definitely going to continue to exist and grow,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cBut Bitcoin and Ordinals will attract people looking for long-term value. It\u2019s a way for people to get started in Bitcoin without having to buy 10 BTC.\u201d\n\nAll in all, there\u2019s thousands (if not millions) of NFT collections out there, and it\u2019s hard for many to stand out. But the co-founders see Taproot Wizards in a different bucket.\n\n\u201cWith what we do, I don\u2019t see it as an NFT collection with a mission,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mission with an NFT collection that wants to make Bitcoin magical again. It\u2019s giving that community a symbol to go out and make it happen, which is the really important part.\u201d\n\nThe article has been updated in the seventh paragraph."

        "content": "Competition is set to heat up for the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust once the Securities and Exchange Commission approves a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The trust, known better by its ticker GBTC , may be the easiest way for institutions to get exposure to crypto today, but that's likely to change in a big way once at ETF is approved, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood told CNBC Pro. \"We had to own a security, so the only way we could [buy into bitcoin] \u2026 was through GBTC and that became the most liquid way to gain exposure,\" she said on the latest PRO Talks on Tuesday. \"We think that's going to change completely. There are going to be lot more liquid ways to gain exposure when we see some of these approvals.\" ARK in partnership with 21 Shares is in a long line at the SEC to get its application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF approved. It would be the first product of its kind in the U.S., though similar products exist already in Canada and Europe. It would also compete with GBTC, of which ARK is a big holder. Grayscale has been fighting with the SEC to convert GBTC into an ETF. Many investors expect an ETF approval in the U.S. to usher a wave of new investors into crypto and help send prices higher. \"I'm sure some investors have taken positions in anticipation saying institutions are just going to push this up,\" Wood said. \"We're at roughly 19.5 million units of bitcoin out there and the top is going to be 21 million. So if there's going to be scarcity value and if institutions start pushing in, the price could go parabolic.\" However, she warned, \"when you get a lot of anticipatory investing like this sometimes you don't get that right away. There could just be profit-taking especially if it settles down a bit.\" The drumbeat for a bitcoin ETF has been growing louder since this summer. More recently, reports of better cooperation by the SEC with the funds attempting to launch an ETF has has helped propel the price of bitcoin higher \u2013 an event benefiting much of the crypto market. \"We were very happy to get questions from the SEC, having filed a number of times and been rejected out of hand,\" Wood said. \"Getting questions was a big step forward. We have gotten to know the research team at the SEC and we're very impressed \u2026 so we look forward to getting questions from them on the spot ETH ETF as well.\" Bitcoin doubled for the year on Oct. 24, giving a lift to crypto-related stocks and other cryptocurrencies. This week, ARK sold $6 million of GBTC shares, which Wood cited as a routine profit-taking event."

        "content": "Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike.

They also typically have a passphrase that lets you access the data stored on the wallet.\n\nYes, you can choose to gain access to your bitcoin via an app on your computer or phone. But these devices do a million other things besides securing crypto. You probably have dozens of apps installed, and as well as access to a variety of websites and services, thereby increasing the chance of something malicious sneaking in.\n\nConversely, crypto hardware wallets only have one app for the following purposes: send, receive, and secure your crypto. That's it. Nothing else goes in or out.\n\nTesting the Trezor Safe 3\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I've used the newly launched Trezor Safe 3 (Bitcoin Edition), a $79 wallet from Trezor. This particular hardware wallet is interesting because it's even more straightforward to understand and use than other devices; it's specifically designed to secure your bitcoin. No fuss, no complications: You guard your bitcoin with Trezor Safe 3, keep it somewhere safe (no pun intended), and never touch it until you need to access it.\n\nThe Trezor Safe has two buttons and a tiny, 0.96-inch, monochromatic OLED display. It's connected to your computer via a USB-C port. It's a simple device with a singular purpose \u2014 and many users will appreciate that.\n\nSetting up Trezor Safe 3\n\nSetting it up is easy. Download and install Trezor's software, crack open the packaging on the device itself, and connect it to your computer via a USB-C cable. The software will recognize the device, updated its firmware, and launch a tutorial on how to use it.\n\nAfter initialising the device, you'll be asked to create a recovery seed. This is basically your crypto key, expressed as a string of English words (typically 12 words). Write these words down on paper (Trezor supplies two handy pieces of paper for that purpose). Don't show them to anyone; store them somewhere very safe.\n\nAn optional step you can do is to create a PIN for your Trezor. You should definitely do that. If you don't, anyone with physical access to the device can breach your crypto. Choose a PIN that you won't forget, and preferably something that only you know.\n\nMoving your bitcoin to the hardware wallet\n\nSay you've purchased bitcoin on a crypto exchange, and now, you want to move them somewhere safer (That's a good idea, by the way. In the world of cryptocurrencies, exchanges have been known to get hacked or go bankrupt.)\n\nOnce you've set up your Trezor Safe 3, connect it to your computer and open the Trezor app. Go to \"Accounts - Receive\" and confirm that the address on the computer screen matches the one on the device itself. Don't neglect this part. If your computer or Trezor software gets compromised, a malicious software may try to scam you into sending the coins to the wrong address.\n\nHit Receive to see your receiving address. Always double check the address in the software and on the device itself before sending or receiving coins. Credit: Trezor\n\nThen, depending on where you're sending the bitcoins from, you can either scan the generated QR code with your phone, or copy and paste the address when the exchange you're sending from asks you to (check that the address is accurate one more time at this point).\n\nAfter you've sent your bitcoin to the hardware wallet, it will typically take a few minutes for them to show up in your Trezor software. Once they're there, you're done. You can disconnect your wallet and keep it somewhere safe.\n\nSending coins is the opposite of this process. Connect your Trezor, run the Trezor software, hit \"Accounts - Send\", pick the amount you want to send, make sure you have the right receiving address, review all the data one more time, and click \"Send.\"\n\nThings you should never do\n\nWhile hardware wallets are among the most secure methods for securing crypto, they only work if you keep certain precautions. Here's a list of things you should never do:\n\n1. Keep your private key in an unsecure manner or share it with anyone.\n\nYour private key, which is a long string of characters, or the recovery seed, typically a gaggle of randomized words, give you full control of your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While setting up your hardware wallet, you'll be prompted to write that list of words down as backup. But it must be stored securely, for example, in a safe. If you just keep it on your desk or store it on a computer file, you've compromised the security you get from a hardware wallet.\n\nYou can write your recovery seed down on a piece of paper, or you can get Trezor's Keep, an analog device made of metal which lets you store your recovery seed without worrying about fire damage. Credit: Trezor\n\n2. Lose your backup\n\nSecurely storing your private key may sound like an unnecessary hassle. Isn't your hardware wallet enough? Well, in theory it is, but it can be misplaced, stolen, or simply malfunction. You need to have a backup. And yes, you need to store it securely; see point number one.\n\n3. Misplace your hardware wallet (especially with no PIN)\n\nLosing your physical device is terrifying, but it's not the end of the world. if you've set up a PIN to protect your coins. If it's PIN-protected, someone that finds the device won't easily access it. And if you've taken precautions and stored your backup safely, you can recover your coins. The recovery process on the Trezor is simple and consists of punching in those 12 words from your recovery seed. It will take a few minutes, given the Trezor has no keyboard, but fortunately, it's probably not something you'll be doing very often.\n\nIs that it?\n\nWell, pretty much. There's nothing too glamorous about securing your crypto with a hardware wallet. It's akin to storing gold and jewellery in a safe. Every now and then, you should connect your wallet to your computer and run the accompanying software to see if the device requires some important updates. But if you don't plan to send, receive, or use your crypto, you should mostly leave your hardware wallet be \u2014 until it's needed."

Both facilities were managed and built by a man surnamed Huang (\u9ec3).\n\nThe police determined that the mining operation was part of a bigger operation and launched a larger investigation in cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nIn May, the prosecutors and the police found that Huang had built three other bitcoin mining farms in Taichung's South, Central and Dali districts, which were also stealing power.\n\nThe police asked the court for permission to detain Huang and their request was approved.\n\nWhile collecting evidence, the police subsequently found three other mining farms in Taichung's North, Central and Xitun districts, indicating that a criminal ring was running a total of eight mining farms.\n\nFrom July to September, the investigation continued and four people were arrested, including an investor in the operation surnamed Cheng (\u912d), Cheng's wife surnamed Su (\u8607), another bitcoin mining farm builder also surnamed Huang, and an individual who rented the locations.\n\nAccording to the police, 700 mining machines were confiscated in raids conducted from March to September. Prosecutors will ask the court to seize the NT$4 million in profit the operation made and make the five suspects pay the cost of the electricity they stole, which was NT$76.83 million, according to Taipower.\n\nAt the same time, prosecutors highlighted that the wiring in two of the farms was dangerously close to being burned through.\n\nIn the event of a fire, public safety would have been severely impacted and so prosecutors have asked the court to hand down heavy sentences to everyone involved."

BlackRock is spreading Tether \u201cFUD\u201d. Mentions unbanked stablecoins can create artificial demand. Discloses Tether fraud has been sanctioned for unbacked tethers.

The prestigious fund manager\u2019s application\u2014and subsequent comments from CEO Larry Fink\u2014has led people to believe that Bitcoin is just a stone\u2019s throw away from massive institutional adoption.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn\u2019t yet approved a Bitcoin ETF, experts say it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nEvery ETF application needs to disclose risks. So, what was the \u201cTether FUD\u201d?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile the trust does not invest in stablecoins, it may nonetheless be exposed to risks that stablecoins pose for the bitcoin market and other digital asset markets,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s filing read. \u201cBecause a large portion of the digital asset market still depends on stablecoins such as Tether and USDC, there is a risk that a disorderly de-pegging or a run on Tether or USDC could lead to dramatic market volatility in digital assets more broadly.\u201d\n\nTether mints USDT\u2014the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a market cap of $87 billion.\n\nUSDT is the most-traded digital asset. As a stablecoin\u2014a cryptocurrency backed by a stable asset\u2014it is used to enter and exit trades quickly and without using a traditional bank or fiat currency.\n\nIt is especially useful when dollars are restricted or unavailable, particularly in the sphere of DeFi, which seeks to disintermediate banks.\n\nBut Tether is controversial: it has been slow to provide documentation to prove that U.S. dollars back USDT, and the entity is not independently audited.\n\nIn 2021, Tether agreed to no longer do business in New York after a two-year New York Attorney General investigation found it had \u201cmade false statements about the backing\u201d of its stablecoin.\n\nAnd BlackRock had to disclose this\u2014concerns around the impact a stablecoin collapse like Tether could have on Bitcoin and the crypto market are not overblown: when algorithmic stablecoin Terra UST imploded last year, Bitcoin took a heavy hit\u2014and the rest of the digital asset market followed.\n\nFierce critics of Tether will continue to doom-monger; they have always said that Tether could harm Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this is just hypothetical\u2014and BlackRock needed to mention whatever could theoretically happen to the crypto market.\n\nTether didn\u2019t answer Decrypt\u2019s emailed questions, but VanEck strategy advisor Gabor Gurbacs said on Twitter that there was \u201cnot much to read into\u201d the comments from BlackRock.\n\nRegulators also flagged potential risks around a number of digital asset market structure matters (including stablecoins) many years ago. As a result, of course ETF issuers will do their best to disclose any potential risk. This is standard process and prudent practice. \u2014 Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) November 14, 2023\n\n\u201cETF issuers do list all risks that they can think of for disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. Dollar itself and banking availability are risks, and so are electric outages and natural disasters.\u201d\n\nHe added that mentioning any risk was \u201cprudent practice.\u201d"

You can gather a lot of useful, actionable information with on-chain analytics. For example, you can look at unique wallet addresses. If this is growing rapidly it could mean that adoption of the project is picking up. You could also look at wallet activity if there are a lot of transactions, addresses sending crypto back and forth, it could indicate that the project has a meaningful user base and it is not solely being traded on centralized exchanges. You can also see what percentage of the supply of a token is held by the largest wallet addresses. This is important because the main ethos of crypto is decentralization and giving autonomy to its users. However if a project\u2019s tokens are more or less held by a few large wallets then this leads to a centralization that allows a few whales to manipulate, price, rewards, governance, etc. These are just a few examples. Analysis of this data is constantly evolving and new, meaningful relationships, ratios, and statistics are being discovered and tracked. And since this is done on public ledgers, anyone with an internet connection can do their own analysis. \u2013 Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM"
