        "title": "$1 Million Bitcoin Price 'No Longer Off the Table': Max Keiser - CCN.com",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price suffered a brutal pullback yesterday, but longtime crypto bull Max Keiser remains confident that the flagship cryptocurrency could still achieve a jaw-dropping $1 million target.\n\nPerhaps even in time to save the eccentric John McAfee from having to \u201ceat [his] d**k\u201d on national television .\n\nRT\u2019s Resident Bitcoin Bull: $100,000 BTC Is \u2018Within Sight\u2019\n\nArguing that Bitcoin crossing the $1 million milestone \u2013 also known as the McAfee d**k price \u2013 is still not \u201coff the table,\u201d Keiser also added other more immediate forecasts.\n\nThe RT host says $28,000 is his short-term price target, while $100,000 \u2013 representing a nearly 800% gain from its present level \u2013 is \u201cwithin sight.\u201d\n\n$28,000 still in play. $100,000 within sight. @officialmcafee \u2019s dick price no longer off the table. #Bitcoin \u2014 Max Keiser, sr. bitcoin advisor to Pres. Bukele (@maxkeiser) June 26, 2019\n\nKeiser has long argued that the Bitcoin price could top $100,000, maintaining that lofty goal even throughout the painful 2018 bear market.\n\nLast month, he predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve launching more quantitative easing would lead to the debasing of the dollar and trigger a massive rush into BTC.\n\nWhile the Fed has shown no indication of launching another round of quantitative easing (yet ), it has signaled that it could lower interest rates. President Donald Trump has, in the past, attacked the institution for \u201clarge scale tightening\u201d and not knowing \u201cwhat it is doing\u201d while pushing for \u201crates cuts & easing.\u201d\n\nDespite a Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t know what it is doing \u2013 raised rates far too fast (very low inflation, other parts of world slowing, lowering & easing) & did large scale tightening, $50 Billion/month, we are on course to have one of the best Months of June in US history\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2019\n\nKeiser also said that Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency would benefit the Bitcoin price, along with the increasing cost of mining BTC as the coin\u2019s inflation rate declines.\n\nCrypto Rally Brings Out the Massive Bitcoin Price Targets\n\nKeiser is not the only crypto bull who contends that Bitcoin has more headroom.\n\nEarlier this month, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, indicated that once the Bitcoin price reached the $10,000 point, it would double in a \u201cfast and furious\u201d manner. BTC currently trades above $11,500.\n\nSpecifically, Lee predicted that Bitcoin would hit $40,000 in five months after passing the $10,000 mark, which he said would ignite a \u201cFOMO\u201d rally.\n\nWith Bitcoin having breached that level this week, it means that if Lee\u2019s prediction comes to pass, by late November the cryptocurrency will have hit another all-time high."

        "title": "Warren Buffett says he doesn't own bitcoin because 'it isn't going to do anything' \u2014 he'd rather own these 2 highly ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Warren Buffett says he doesn\u2019t own bitcoin because \u2018it isn\u2019t going to do anything\u2019 \u2014 he\u2019d rather own these 2 highly coveted and productive assets instead\n\nDespite its recent turbulence, bitcoin has soared by more than 95% over the past five years. But while the world\u2019s largest crypto coin has clearly hit the mainstream, one prominent investor remains critical of the opportunity: Warren Buffett.\n\nDon't miss\n\nAt the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett said that while he doesn\u2019t know whether bitcoin will go up or down going forward, he\u2019s pretty sure that \u201cit doesn't produce anything.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the Oracle of Omaha doesn\u2019t own the asset.\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nTo put that in perspective, bitcoin was trading at around $38,000 a piece when Buffett made those comments. Now, the cryptocurrency has fallen to $21,700.\n\nWhile criticizing bitcoin, Buffett touched on two assets that he would buy if given the opportunity.\n\nFarmland\n\nAgriculture and bitcoin don\u2019t have much in common. Bitcoin was created in 2009 while agricultural communities began to form about 10,000 years ago.\n\nBuffett isn\u2019t known for being an agricultural investor, but he sees value in an asset class that\u2019s critical to the sector \u2014 farmland. His point is if you buy farmland, you hold a tangible asset that produces food.\n\n\u201cIf you said, for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I\u2019ll write you a check this afternoon,\u201d Buffett says.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need to have $25 billion to invest in U.S. farmland. Publicly traded real estate investment trusts \u2014 that specialize in owning farms \u2014 allow you to do it with as little money as you\u2019re willing to spend.\n\nStory continues\n\nGladstone Land (LAND), for instance, owns 169 farms totaling 115,000 acres. It pays monthly distributions of $0.0458 per share, giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 2.8%.\n\nRead more: Grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock market with these 3 easy alternatives\n\nThen there\u2019s Farmland Partners (FPI), a REIT with a farmland portfolio of 190,000 acres and an annual dividend yield of 1.9%.\n\nPlus, online crowdfunding platforms allow you to buy pieces of real estate, including farmland.\n\nWith inflation running hot, the prices of agricultural commodities including corn and soybeans are soaring to new highs.\n\nApartments\n\nApartment buildings are another asset that Buffett wouldn\u2019t mind owning at the right price.\n\n\u201c[If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I\u2019ll write you a check. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d the legendary investor says.\n\nWhether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people.\n\nYou can always buy an apartment building yourself, find tenants and collect the monthly rent checks. Of course, apartment-focused REITs can do that for you.\n\nFor instance, Camden Property Trust (CPT) owns, manages, develops and acquires multifamily apartment communities. It has investments in 171 properties containing 58,433 apartment units across the U.S. and offers an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nEssex Property Trust (ESS) invests in apartments primarily on the West Coast. The REIT currently yields 4.1%, backed by its ownership interest in 253 apartment communities \u2014 in California and Seattle \u2014 totaling approximately 62,000 units.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBuffett prefers farmland and apartment buildings to bitcoin for a very simple reason: They produce something.\n\n\u201cThe apartments are going to produce rent, and the farms are going to produce food.\u201d\n\nBitcoin boasts exciting long-term upside potential. But for risk-averse investors who\u2019d like to sidestep as much volatility as possible, sticking to productive assets is a prudent idea.\n\nA better way to buy property?\n\nOf course, REITs aren't the only way to easily invest in real estate.\n\nAmid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions outside of the stock market.\n\nPrime commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.\n\nWith a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart \u2014 and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Investors Are Plotting a Major Coup - WIRED",
        "content": "A group of activist shareholders in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin investment trust, GBTC, is plotting a coup. The unlikely patchwork of hedge funds, asset managers, and amateur investors is trying to unseat Grayscale Investments, the steward of the trust, whose management they claim has cost them billions of dollars.\n\nSince 2015, GBTC has been marketed as a simple way for regular people to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with an exchange, send crypto between wallets, or figure out how to store it safely. The value of GBTC shares is linked to the price of bitcoin: For every new share created, a fraction of a bitcoin is added to a pot, anchoring its value.\n\nIn a series of adverts targeting the general public, some of which aired on major US TV networks, Grayscale described bitcoin as \u201cthe future\u201d and the ideal investment for retirees and other investors that \u201cdeserve the best.\u201d Now, GBTC shares are owned by hundreds of thousands of amateur investors.\n\nAt the start of 2021, the shares, which had consistently traded at a higher price (sometimes even double) than the underlying bitcoin for years, slumped to 52 percent of the value of bitcoin in mid-December, meaning that for every $1 in bitcoin that shareholders own through the trust, they can only claim back $0.52 by selling their GBTC shares on the market. In aggregate, the discount created a multibillion-dollar hole in investors\u2019 pockets.\n\n\u201cInvestors are in limbo,\u201d says Christian Gal\u00edndez Beltr\u00e1n, a shareholder who claims to hold around $200,000 in bitcoin via the trust. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about not being able to redeem the totality of my money.\u201d\n\nAnother investor, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from the brokerage at which he works, says he purchased roughly $30,000 in bitcoin through GBTC with the goal of hedging against inflation as he prepares for retirement. Although his financial situation has not been too badly damaged, he says the performance of the trust has \u201cill-affected\u201d his marriage; his wife, who \u201cfears the loss is permanent,\u201d has taken to calling him a \u201cbitcoin bozo.\u201d\n\nThousands of GBTC shareholders like these have registered their support for the activist campaign, according to David Bailey, founder of BTC Inc and hedge fund UTXO Management, and leader of one strand of the movement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this a unique situation,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThis product is sold on brokerage platforms in individual retirement accounts. This is your mom and dad thinking they are diversifying their portfolio.\u201d\n\nWIRED spoke to six GBTC shareholders, all of whom told similar stories. One person said they have the entirety of their savings tied up in GBTC, while another has taken on additional work to ensure he is able to sustain himself into retirement.\n\nBailey claims that more than 50 institutions, some of which hold several hundred-million-dollar stakes in GBTC, are also involved in the rebellion to unseat Grayscale, representing a total of at least 20 percent of GBTC shares. He claims to be unable to provide proof, citing investor privacy and legal considerations, but supplied WIRED with web traffic and form submission data that suggests at least 2,000 investors have joined the campaign."

        "title": "Should Crypto Fear Quantum Computing? - Ledger",
        "content": "Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, and Victor Servant, Security Engineer at Ledger, explore the potential implications of quantum computing on the cryptocurrency industry, and how post-quantum solutions may eventually emerge to address the challenge.\n\n\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Quantum computing, a cutting-edge technology, holds immense potential for revolutionizing computation with its unmatched computational power.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Quantum computing, despite being at least several years from a major breakthrough, is perceived as a significant threat to cryptography due to its immense data processing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u2013 The potential impact of quantum computing on cryptography and secure systems such as Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work must be carefully considered. As the world\u2019s most secure gateway to crypto, such fundamental questions merit Ledger\u2019s full attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Computing: The Next Big Tech Leap\n\nThe computers we use daily process information based on \u201cbits\u201d. A bit can only hold one of the following values: 0 or 1, and can be strung together to create a piece of binary code. Today, everything we do with a computer, from sending emails and watching videos to sharing music, is possible due to such strings of binary digits.\n\nThe binary nature of traditional computers imposes limitations on their computing power. These computers only perform operations one step at a time and struggle to accurately simulate real-world problems. In contrast, the physical world operates based on amplitudes rather than binary digits, making it much more complex. This is where quantum computers come into play.\n\nIn 1981, Richard Feynman said that \u201cnature isn\u2019t classical, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you\u2019d better make it quantum mechanical.\u201d Instead of manipulating bits, quantum computing uses \u201cquantum bits\u201d, or qubits, allowing it to process data in a vastly more efficient way. Qubits can be zero, one, and, most importantly, a combination of zero and one.\n\nQuantum computing stands at the crossroads of physics and computer science. To put things into perspective, a 500-qubit quantum computer would require more classical bits than\u2026 the number of atoms in the entire universe.\n\nIs Quantum A Threat To Cryptography?\n\nPublic-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, forms the foundation of cryptocurrency security. It involves a combination of a public key (accessible to all) and a private key. The rapid calculation capabilities of qubits raise the potential for breaking encryption and disrupting the security of the cryptocurrency industry if quantum computing continues to advance.\n\nTwo algorithms need to be closely considered: Shor\u2019s and Grover\u2019s. Both algorithms are theoretical because there currently isn\u2019t any machine to implement them, but as you will see, the potential implementation of these algorithms could be harmful to cryptography.\n\nOn the one hand, Shor\u2019s (1994) quantum algorithm, named after Peter Shor, enables factoring large integers or solving the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time. This algorithm could break public key cryptography with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. Shor\u2019s algorithm would break the vast majority of asymmetric cryptography used today since it is based on RSA (relying on the integer factorization problem) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (depending on the discrete logarithm problem in an elliptic curve group).\n\nOn the other hand, Grover\u2019s (1996) algorithm is a quantum search algorithm devised by Lov Grover in 1996, which can be used to solve unstructured search problems. The Grover algorithm puts a significant dent in symmetric primitives\u2019 security but is not insurmountable. It is generally advised to double the key length to compensate for this break\u2019s square-root complexity. Using AES256 instead of AES128 is considered enough, but it should be noted that this rule of thumb might only sometimes be valid for all ciphers[5]. As for hash functions, which are part of the symmetric primitive\u2019s landscape, it is thought that it has no impact on collision resistance. However, researchers found instances of the problem where this is untrue[6] (multi-target preimage search, for example).\n\nIn essence, both algorithms pose potential dangers to cryptography. Shor\u2019s algorithm simplifies the process of factoring large numbers, making it easier to uncover a private key connected to a public key, and Grover\u2019s algorithm is capable of compromising cryptographic hashing more efficiently than current computers.\n\nWhen Will Encryption-Breaking Quantum Computers Emerge?\n\nLet\u2019s walk through some of the latest experiments and see how fast research is going. The first real quantum computer remains far off, but that doesn\u2019t prevent a global race from reaching \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d For Ayal Itzkovitz, managing partner in a quantum-focused VC fund, \u201cif three years ago we didn\u2019t know if it was altogether possible to build such a computer, now we already know that there will be quantum computers that will be able to do something different from classic computers.\u201d\n\nOne event that everyone has probably heard about was Google\u2019s \u201cquantum supremacy experiment\u201d in 2019 using a device with 54 qubits. In 2021, the University of Science and Technology of China solved a more complex calculation using 56 qubits, reaching 60 qubits later. Its goal was to perform a computation not involving Shor\u2019s algorithm that would equally demonstrate a quantum speedup over classical computing.\n\nBy definition, these experiments do not show progress toward breaking cryptography because they were designed to avoid the size and complexity of performing quantum integer factorization. However, they show that building more qubits into a quantum computer is no longer difficult, with different hardware solutions available, Google\u2019s \u2018Sycamore\u2019 chip qubits being fundamentally different from the USTC\u2019s photons. The next vital step to getting to an encryption-breaking computer is generally considered to be building fault-tolerant computation and error-correcting qubits.\n\nBSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development [1] shows how far from breaking a 160 bits discrete logarithm (lowest blue line in the following image) current quantum computers are. The abscissa shows how reducing the error rate through pure hardware improvements, or fault-tolerant computing helps reach such computing levels without dramatically scaling the number of available qubits (y-axis).\n\nImplementing Shor\u2019s algorithm in a scalable way requires fault-tolerant computation on a few thousand logical qubits: 2124 qubits at a minimum in order to break a 256-bit elliptic curve like bitcoin\u2019s secp256k1, from Improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms[7]. A \u2018logical\u2019 qubit in such a system is composed of several qubits designed to work as an error-corrected version of a single qubit.\n\nA thousand logical qubits roughly translate into several million qubits, covering the size of a soccer field. A practical demonstration of such a fault-tolerant computation was recently made in Fault-tolerant control of an error-corrected qubit[2], where a single logical qubit whose error probability is lower than that of the qubits it is made of. This area\u2019s improvement is expected to follow quickly as it will become the focus.\n\nProgress in this direction will directly translate into a concrete threat to public key cryptography. Lastly, another possibility for rapid progress can come from purely algorithmic improvements or hardware-only discoveries. BSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development[1] explains: \u201cThere can be disruptive discoveries that would dramatically change [the current state of knowledge], the main ones being cryptographic algorithms that can be run on near-term non-error-corrected machines or dramatic breakthroughs in the error rate of some platforms.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not just a problem of being able to build large computers with a lot of qubits (actually building more qubits reliably is not the main focus, fault-tolerant computing is), but also an algorithmic one and possibly a material research one.\n\n\n\nAs we were writing this article, IBM published its results on a 127-qubit chip with a 0.001 error rate, and plans on issuing a 433-qubit chip next year, and 1121-qubit chip in 2023.\n\nAll in all, it remains hard to predict how fast a quantum computer will come to life. Still, we can rely on expert opinion on the matter: A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments[3] and Expert poll on quantum risk[4] show that many experts agree that in 15 to 20 years, we should have a quantum computer available.\n\nQuoting A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments [3] as a summary:\n\n\u201cThe currently deployed public key schemes, such as RSA and ECC, are completely broken by Shor\u2019s algorithm. In contrast, the security parameters of symmetric methods and hash functions are reduced by, at most, a factor of two by the known attacks \u2013 by \u201cbrute force\u201d searches using Grover\u2019s searching algorithm. All those algorithms require large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum machines, which are not yet available. Most of the expert community agree that they will likely become a reality within 10 to 20 years.\u201d\n\nNow that we\u2019ve examined why quantum algorithms could harm cryptography, let\u2019s analyze the substantial risks implied for the crypto and Web3 fields.\n\nQuantum: What Risks for cryptocurrencies?\n\nThe Bitcoin case:\n\nLet\u2019s start with Pieter Wuille\u2019s analysis of the problem for Bitcoin, sometimes considered \u201cquantum-safe\u201d due to addresses being hashes of public keys and thus not exposing them.\n\nNot being able to break a Bitcoin private key based on the assumption that hashes make it impossible also relies on never disclosing one\u2019s public key, whatever the means, which is already wrong for many accounts.\n\nReferring to another thread, Pieter Wuille gives an idea of the impact of having the ~37% of exposed funds (at the time) stolen. Bitcoin would probably tank, and even unexposed, everyone else loses as well.\n\nThe crucial point here is the mention that the progress towards building a quantum computer will be incremental: billions of dollars are publicly invested in this field and any improvement resonates worldwide, as Google\u2019s quantum supremacy experiment showed.\n\nThis means that ending up with funds at risk will take time, and alternative solutions can be laid out correctly. One can imagine setting up a fork of the chain using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for signing and allowing people to transfer their funds to that new chain from the old once news of a reasonably beefy quantum computer seems imminent.\n\nThe Ethereum case:\n\nThe case of Ethereum is interesting as ETH 2.0 includes a backup plan for a catastrophic failure in EIP-2333.\n\nIn case ETH2\u2019s BLS signatures break, which would happen at the same time as ECDSA since they are both equally vulnerable in the face of Shor\u2019s algorithm, a hard fork of the blockchain will be executed before the algorithm is suspected to be compromised. Then, users reveal a preimage of their key that only legitimate owners can possess. This excludes keys retrieved by breaking a BLS signature. With that preimage, they sign a specific transaction allowing them to move to the hard fork and use new post-quantum algorithms.\n\nThis is not a switch to a post-quantum chain yet but it provides an escape hatch. Some more information here.\n\nPost-quantum signatures:\n\nA few things could be improved regarding switching to a post-quantum signature scheme for use in a cryptocurrency. The current NIST finalists have rather large memory requirements. When the signature size is not unreasonably larger than that of an ECDSA, the public key size increases block sizes and the associated fees.\n\nCandidate name Size Rainbow 58.3 kB Dilithium 3.5 kB Falcon 1.5 kB GeMSS 352 kB Picnic 12 kB SPHINCS+ 7 kB\n\nThe Falcon algorithm was designed to minimize the size of the public key and signature. However, its 1563 bytes are still far from the 65 bytes ECDSA currently reaches.\n\nCryptographic techniques can reduce block sizes, like aggregating several signatures together. This [multisignature scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/520) for the GeMSS signature does just that and reduces the cost of storage per signature to something acceptable, despite the vast one-time fee of a GeMSS signature.\n\nThreats to cryptographic hardware:\n\nSignature sizes also impact hardware wallets where memory is highly constrained: a Ledger Nano S has 320 KB of Flash memory available and only 10 Kilobytes of RAM. If suddenly we needed to use Rainbow signatures, generating the public key in a native way would not be feasible.\n\nSince, however, the whole cryptographic community is affected by the problem, including the banking, telecommunication, and identity industry, which make up most of the market for secure chips, we expect hardware to adapt quickly to the need for post-quantum algorithm-friendly hardware and remove that memory (or sometimes performance) all together in time.\n\nThe consequences of those breaks are the downfall of the current banking system, telecommunications, and identity systems such as passports. What to do in the face of such an apocalyptic future? Fear not, or a little, as cryptographers have got it covered.\n\nIs There A Cure, Doctor?\n\nWhile our current computers would need thousands of years to break public key cryptography, fully developed quantum computers would do this in minutes or hours. \u201cQuantum security\u201d standards will inevitably be needed to counter this threat and ensure the security of our future financial transactions and online communications.\n\nWork is already underway regarding what is commonly called \u201cPost-quantum cryptography\u201d that would possibly be \u201ccompatible with today\u2019s computers but which will also be capable of withstanding attackers from quantum computers in the future.\u201d Post-quantum cryptography brings algorithms and mathematical standards to the next level while allowing compatibility with current computers.\n\nThe NIST competition created just for the occasion has already reached its third round and produced a list of potential candidates for standardization. The Post-Quantum security Conference was launched as far back as 2006 to study cryptographic primitives that would resist known quantum attacks.\n\nThe foundations of this research stem from expert warnings that encrypted data is already at risk of being compromised, as the first practical quantum computers are expected to emerge within the next 15 years.\n\nThis kind of attack is known as \u201choard data now, attack later,\u201d where a large organization stores encrypted information from other parties it wishes to break and waits until a powerful enough quantum computer allows it to do so. This is the same worry of this article for example, \u201cThe US is worried that hackers are stealing data today so quantum computers can crack it in a decade\u201c, but it does not say what state-level actors might be doing in the same vein. They have a lot more resources and storage available.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe exact speed at which encrypted communications will become vulnerable to quantum research remains hard to determine.\n\nOne thing is sure: although significant progress is being made in quantum computing, we are still far from possessing the capability to crack cryptography with these machines. The likelihood of a sudden breakthrough resulting in the design of such a computer is minimal, giving us time to prepare for its arrival. If it were to occur overnight, the ramifications would be disastrous, affecting not only cryptocurrencies, but a wide range of sectors.\n\nFortunately, solutions, including post-quantum cryptography, are available to address the threat, but the crypto industry has yet to see the urgency in investing in these measures.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market must closely monitor quantum developments. With regards to hardware, there is little cause for concern as we anticipate the development of new secure elements to meet the demand. It is crucial to stay abreast of the latest advancements in side-channel and fault-resistant versions of these algorithms, in order to provide a reliable implementation for our users.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1]: BSI\u2019s Status of quantum computer development\n\n[2]: Fault-tolerant control of an error-corrected qubit\n\n[3]: A Resource Estimation Framework for Quantum Attacks Against Cryptographic Functions \u2013 Recent Developments\n\n[4]: Expert poll on quantum risk\n\n[5]: Beyond quadratic speedups in quantum attacks on symmetric schemes\n\n[6]: An Efficient Quantum Collision Search Algorithm and Implications on Symmetric Cryptography\n\n[7]: Improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms"

        "content": "00:00\n\nJamie, what do you think of this latest development in in that approach? I think it is what we expected to see it is. It's unfortunate. We had eight where a minor of an area and certainly would have would have liked to see it continue as a group work network. Mike, Mike, what do you think of the S.E.C.? Is deal with crack and the idea that staking as a service they see as a security? Echo that sentiment and the proof of stake allows concentration of larger funds just buying up simply the coin and having an influence on the networks, grassroots work is truly democratized. You have a network of miners globally contributing to networks and securing how the how of the platform performs. I'd love to double down on that with you, Jamie, because you would just kind of mention this idea where you had mined theorem as well. You know, what's the path forward? It was interesting to see a theory and prices really rebound. Even with that looming threat of greater regulatory oversight or crackdown, if you will. So what's the road ahead for assets outside of Bitcoin? I think it's really it's really difficult to say, and certainly clarity is something that the industry desperately needs in order for it to chart a more solid path forward. And you know, Michael, on that note as well to, you know, what does it do now that the book, both of your companies are put together in an industry that was so sorely bruised after last year, you are seeing this kind of price increase this year? What is that price increase in Bitcoin itself mean for the merger of both of your companies? We have a ton of synergies. We always held cuts the highest regard and with Jamie at the helm. Being able to be so disciplined throughout the bull markets, whereas the rest of the public peers were bought into the hysteria and bought very expensive hardware. The companies that come out as true winners are built in the bear markets. It's it's its it's maintaining that balance sheet and knowing how to be agile and navigate the downturns. What's your approach, Mike, to the energy usage debate? I know Jamie has long been a champion of greener mining at Hot 8. How do you approach this problem? Absolutely, it is shown within the sites that we operate out in New York. We're right at Niagara Falls, where over 90 percent hydro in Texas, we have sites that are behind the meter directly on the sites of the energy generation at the solar farms, out of wind farms. We partner with the energy companies, renewable energy companies. So, Jamie, in terms of your business, you've long benefited from the fact that you're not in the United States of America. And we just heard from Michael Shalom saying he's worried that the kind of regulation we're going to get post RTX is going to push businesses out. How do you view that in light of this combination? I think geographic diversity is is really important. We've long been exclusively in Canada really looking for the right entry point into the into the US and we believe we found the perfect partner in U.S. pick to do that. Jamie, do you think that after this merger there are more opportunities for consolidation? You know, a lot of the issues of last year was the unwillingness of capital markets to really open up to the crypto sector. A lot of nervousness around the mining sector. But you did see very interesting deals pop up. You saw interesting rescue financings. What are the capital markets and merger environments look like for you now as a bigger company? Yeah, I think we were expecting to see consolidation in this space. It was a little bit late to come, but we have seen some really interesting deals in mining in the last few months. And I think we're going to continue to see more eminent activity during the balance in 2023. Well, what about for you? I mean, is there anything that you could do to either raise more money or buy more assets as you've seen so many other companies struggle? I think our focus right now is entirely on getting this deal closed and bringing the companies together. But certainly I've been I've been on a growth trajectory and I don't see that as something that will change in a new hot post closing of the."

        "title": "On-Chain-Strain: How Ordinals Inscriptions Are Impacting Bitcoin - nft now",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs, better known as Ordinals, have become nearly inescapable as of late, with more than 89,000 inscriptions in existence. For the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s 14-year history, the blockchain is being used for something other than peer-to-peer transfers, but not everyone is pleased. While a significant portion of Web3 is thrilled with the way this new area of the NFT market is growing, others have raised concerns about the novel tech behind this burgeoning sector.\n\nAlthough opportunity abounds as more users find it possible and desirable to move their collecting and trading efforts over to Bitcoin, the blockchain itself might be suffering as a result. While the barrier to entry into the Ordinals ecosystem continues to be lowered as popularity rises and more creators look to inscribe data on Bitcoin, network congestion has emerged as a potential symptom that Bitcoin NFTs might be creating on-chain strain.\n\nBitcoin blocks are booming\n\nThe new Ordinals protocol, launched by software engineer Casey Rodarmor on January 21, allows users to inscribe data directly on the blockchain, as opposed to NFTs on other chains, like Ethereum, which often point to off-chain data hosted on a decentralized file storage system. That data can include smart contracts, which in turn enable the creation of NFTs. While this on-chain capability has led to much fanfare, with Ordinals being referred to as \u201ctrue NFTs,\u201d it also means that Bitcoin NFTs take up a lot of space.\n\nAnecdotally, Bitcoin block storage capacity hasn\u2019t been something to worry about because the chain has, until now, only been used for peer-to-peer monetary transactions. But as Ordinals continue to gain prominence, and NFT enthusiasts either learn the ins and outs of inscription or find ways to onboard into the Ordinals ecosystem via developer tools, more use has meant more traffic and has ultimately led to network congestion.\n\nTo put it in perspective, although Bitcoin blocks \u2014 the sequential groups of transaction data that are packaged together \u2014 can, theoretically, go as high as 4MB in size, they more often cap out around the 1 \u2013 2MB range. Some have even dictated 2MB as a more realistic maximum size for Bitcoin blocks because a 4MB block size represents the absolute maximum size of a block of data that can be added to the blockchain.\n\nYet, according to Glassnode, since Ordinals launched, the upper range of the mean Bitcoin block size has increased from 1.5-2.0 MB to 3.0-3.5 MB in a matter of weeks. In fact, on February 1, Inscription 652, the first in the Taproot Wizards collection, made history as the largest block and transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history at 4MB.\n\nShort term spikes\n\nSince Ordinals arrived on the scene, the mining of large blocks became both commonplace and necessary, leading to, as reported by Bloomberg, higher transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain. The day before the protocol\u2019s launch, transaction fees peaked at 3.28 percent. While February 13 saw fees peak at 5.68 percent. While this might seem like a concerning pattern, Glassnode reports that these are \u201cshort lived-spikes,\u201d and we have yet to see a significant surge.\n\nPerhaps as the causation to this effect, Glassnode reports that the total number of Bitcoin wallet addresses holding assets (those with a non-zero balance) has pushed to a new all-time high of over 44 million. As the report notes, this demonstrates a short-term uptick in Bitcoin network usage, with the primary source of this activity being due to new users and Ordinals data rather than coin volume.\n\nWhile this spike in numbers has been welcomed by some Bitcoin maximalists who have very publicly embraced the booming Ordinal market, others have voiced concerns about the diminishing accessibility of the blockchain. One Twitter user in particular, who goes by the name Bitcoin is Saving, remarked that those in developing countries might be affected to a much greater degree by higher transaction fees than those in the U.S. An assertion that seems to be reinforced by the fact that counties like Vietnam and the Philippines were found to have most substantial rates of crypto adoption in 2022, while the U.S. and China maintained their statuses as Bitcoin mining powerhouses, accounting for around 30 and 60 percent, respectively, of all Bitcoin mining in 2022.\n\nWhile surely only time will tell if short-term concerns like rising transaction fees become a cause for long-term worry, it seems that \u2014 as was the case with other NFT trends like PFPs and Open Editions \u2014 nothing can slow the spread of Ordinals throughout the NFT ecosystem. Yet, considering the environmental concerns raised in response to the early Ethereum NFT boom, Bitcoin NFTs will be in for a similar period of uncertainty and doubt."

These can comprise JPEG images, PDFS and video and audio files.\n\nAs Rodarmor outlines in the Ordinals documentation, these digital artifacts can be inscribed to an individual satoshi that makes up a whole Bitcoin. Each BTC is made up of 100,000,000 satoshis.\n\n\u201cIndividual satoshis can be inscribed with arbitrary content, creating unique Bitcoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in Bitcoin wallets and transferred using Bitcoin transactions. Inscriptions are as durable, immutable, secure, and decentralized as Bitcoin itself.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been divided over the ability to inscribe digital artifacts to the blockchain, with arguments for and against providing plenty of food for thought. One of the major talking points has been the increased use of block space to inscribe various Ordinals.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average block size has hovered between 0.7MB and 1.5MB from July 2021 to February 2023. From Feb. 5 onward, Bitcoin\u2019s average block size surpassed 2MB for the first time, currently sitting at around 2.2MB at the time of writing.\n\nThe inception of Bitcoin Ordinals has also seen the network hit a record 44 million non-zero addresses, as per data from Glassnode. Glassnode\u2019s latest newsletter notes that Ordinals compete for block space demand but have not yet significantly impacted network fees.\n\nGlassnode describes the advent of Ordinals as a \u201cnew and unique moment in Bitcoin history,\u201d whereby innovation generates network activity without the \u201cclassical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes.\u201c"

        "content": "Ordinals, an NFT-like project on the Bitcoin blockchain, has gained momentum over the past month, signaling a chance that a new frontier may be on the horizon for the biggest cryptocurrency. But in order to be the biggest, experts say its accessibility and security need to be improved.\n\nOver 90,000 Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain to date, according to Dune Analytics data. Ordinals hit an all-time high on February 9 for the number of mints at over 20,000 that day.\n\n\u201cIt seems foolish to say this won\u2019t be a very impactful revelation,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, told TechCrunch. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but given current trends and hockey stick growth, we\u2019re definitely headed to more Bitcoin NFT inscriptions now than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals project isn\u2019t the first to try bringing NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals stands out as a project for directly inscribing onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), without needing another chain or token. \u201cThe unique thing about Ordinals is its putting the image literally in the blockchain,\u201d Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines, said. \u201cOther NFTs usually link to the images on-chain.\u201d\n\nEven though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clunky because it\u2019s day one,\u201d said Alex Adelman, the co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin rewards platform Lolli. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West, but that\u2019s how NFTs felt back in the day, as well with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nEthereum and Solana now have a huge leg up when it comes to infrastructure, communities, and trading platforms and collections. In the past 30 days, Ethereum, the No. 1 blockchain by NFT sales volume, saw volumes increase 35.5% to $860 million across over 178,000 buyers, according to CryptoSlam data. Solana, the second-largest blockchain by NFT sales volume, fell 15.6% to $114.6 million across over 80,000 buyers during the same time period.\n\n\u201cEthereum has proven there\u2019s a market for this already and is essentially stealing market share based on demand,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nSo, inherently Bitcoin NFTs will compete with other major NFT ecosystems, Hansen said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll most likely see a lot of Ethereum NFT projects building bridges to move to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhen people build on Bitcoin, it gets a lot more attention, Ali said. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s more valuable than other chains because it\u2019s unclear if those other chains will be around, but bitcoin will likely be around in 10, 20 or 50 years from now.\u201d\n\nBut this expansion won\u2019t happen overnight, and the current infrastructure for Bitcoin NFTs is extremely clunky and still done manually on many fronts. For example, many people are legitimately completing inscriptions manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBuys are happening through Discords and Google Sheets,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cMarketplaces are very much needed; we can\u2019t be buying and selling on Google Sheets for much longer because there\u2019s going to be hacks, people will get pissed off and it won\u2019t be sustainable.\u201d\n\nLast week Gamma, a marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs, launched its Ordinals feature to help people who have a Bitcoin address inscribe their own NFTs. \u201cWe had over 2,000 people submitting inscriptions in the first two hours,\u201d Jamil Dhanani, founder and CEO of Gamma, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is an indication something is here and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to be the same as Ethereum NFTs, but the value of inscribing data resonates with people.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHow do we get a wallet and see our JPEGs? Right now there\u2019s no way to get around it, all of it is really difficult, and custodying it has been hard. The bar is incredibly high right now.\u201d\n\nAdelman agreed, noting \u201cit\u2019s not accessible at all.\u201d But in 2017, there weren\u2019t very many experiences that were accessible in the Ethereum ecosystem, either, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be services to improve all of this and the access,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs the products and services come to market, it will become more and more prevalent the amount of inscriptions being minted, inscribed and transacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin a year, we\u2019ll have full ecosystems of plug-and-play NFT projects like on Ethereum would be my guess,\u201d he added\n\nAnd more capital and developers will surely enter the space. \u201cMy inbox is overflowing with developers on Ethereum and Solana who don\u2019t know how to build on Bitcoin. The developer community in Bitcoin is getting real demand now, and people are throwing money at it,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting and a healthy thing [ \u2026 ] people realize bitcoin carries a premium, but a ton of work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nOver time, there will be \u201cmuch more use of bitcoin and a much more robust market,\u201d Dhanani said.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Adelman said."

Like all crypto ETFs, part of the allure of BITO is that investors don\u2019t need to deal with cryptocurrency wallets and private keys but can instead invest through a broker they already use.\n\nRead our article on the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Futures ETFs for more information.\n\nBest for Daily Profit Opportunities: ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) Start Investing\n\nPros Ideal for investors who believe Bitcoin's price will fall\n\nAllows for daily profits by short selling Bitcoin\n\nIssued by the first and largest provider of Bitcoin-linked ETFs in the U.S. Cons Investors can lose the entire value of their portfolio in a day\n\nHigher brokerage commissions and expense ratios reduce returns\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $39.79 Expense ratio 0.97% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $99.48 million\n\nThe ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) is a way to invest in Bitcoin when you believe prices will drop, as it allows investors to short sell Bitcoin. Short selling means betting against an asset, in which case you profit when the price of Bitcoin goes down instead of up. However, this also means that there\u2019s no limit to losses an investor can incur, since the price of Bitcoin can hypothetically go up to infinity while it can\u2019t go any lower than zero.\n\nThe BITI ETF follows the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Index, and profitability is computed daily (before fees and expenses) as the inverse (-1x) of the index's daily performance. The fund was launched on June 21, 2022, and already has almost $100 million under management.\n\nCheapest ETF Option: Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) Start Investing\n\nPros Cheapest option among Bitcoin and other crypto/blockchain futures ETFs on this list\n\nRun by a team of experienced asset managers from the Google and Blackstone Cons More of a crypto/blockchain ETF than a Bitcoin ETF\n\nHigher expense ratio than competing ETFs\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $4.97 Expense ratio 0.85% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $50 million\n\nCurrently trading at less than $5, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is the cheapest Bitcoin ETF on our list. It\u2019s an actively managed ETF that invests in companies involved in crypto and blockchain on multiple levels, including digital asset exchanges, mining companies and others providing crypto-related services.\n\nBITQ doesn't just focus on Bitcoin but also invests in companies linked to Ethereum, DeFi and other equity indexes. Some of BITQ\u2019s top holdings include Bitfarms (a Bitcoin mining firm), Galaxy Digital (a financial services provider for blockchain and digital asset companies) and Coinbase (the cryptocurrency exchange).\n\nBest Actively Managed Bitcoin ETF: Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) Start Investing\n\nPros Digital asset investment firm manages all transactions\n\nInvestments are made through a regulated futures market Cons Not very diversified, focusing on just one type of crypto asset\n\nHigher expense ratio due to being an actively managed fund\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $6.61 Expense ratio 0.95% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $18.6 million\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) is an actively managed ETF launched in October 2021. It\u2019s listed on the Nasdaq and, like many Bitcoin-linked ETFs, does not invest directly in Bitcoin.\n\nInstead, BTF aims to deploy as much of its net assets as possible into Bitcoin futures to track the value of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures. Whatever BTF cannot deploy into Bitcoin futures contracts, it puts into U.S. treasury bills.\n\nBest Bitcoin ETF for U.S.-based Companies: Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS GBTC ETF (SPBC) Start Investing\n\nPros Great for investors seeking little exposure to Bitcoin while investing primarily in the S&P 500\n\nExpense ratio is relatively low (0.73%) Cons Trading of equity securities makes it susceptible to stock market fluctuations\n\nInvestors have little control over non-crypto asset allocation\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $20.14 Expense ratio 0.73% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $45.8 million\n\nThe Simplify U.S. Equity PLUS GBTC ETF (SPBC) is not, strictly speaking, a Bitcoin ETF. It's an ETF that invests primarily in U.S. securities (like stocks and other ETFs) but adds exposure to Bitcoin by allocating 10% to 15% of its assets to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nOutside of crypto, SPBC has most of its holdings invested in iShares\u2019 Core S&P 500 ETF. SPBC actively rebalances its Bitcoin holdings to 10% of its portfolio assets to avoid overexposure to the crypto markets.\n\nBest Expense Ratio: VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) Start Investing\n\nPros Exposure to digital asset exchanges, mining companies and crypto firms\n\nLowest expense ratio on this list (0.5%) Cons Volatile, as the technology surrounding digital assets is still in its infancy\n\nDoesn't track Bitcoin-related companies exclusively but those involved with digital assets\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $26.69 Expense ratio 0.50% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $17.6 million\n\nThe VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) tracks, as closely as possible, the price and yield performance of the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index before expenses and fees. The MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index is a set of companies actively involved in the digital assets and blockchain industries, including companies that mine digital assets, run digital asset exchanges (like crypto exchanges) and provide services for the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\nBy investing in DAPP, investors gain exposure to a diverse set of companies pushing the technological envelope in the cryptosphere. Investing in these companies can offer both greater risk and greater reward to investors. While a small number of these firms may discover and develop breakthrough technologies, others may ultimately fail. DAPP has the lowest expense ratio of all Bitcoin ETFs on this list at just 0.50%.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.

Start Investing\n\nOther Bitcoin ETFs we considered\n\nPros Top holdings invested in businesses that may perform well if blockchain fails\n\nCompetitive net expense ratio when compared to similar ETFs\n\nIdeal for long-term investors who seek consistent growth Cons Not ideal for investors solely seeking exposure to Bitcoin\n\nInvestors have little control over where their dollars are deployed\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $15.12 Expense ratio 0.71% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $357.9 million\n\nAmplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) invests at least 80% of its net assets in corporations actively linked to the development and use of blockchain technologies. This means that it invests in Bitcoin-related companies and others with the potential to earn even higher returns under favorable conditions.\n\nBLOK is a reputable general-purpose blockchain ETF but not the best Bitcoin-specific ETF, which is why it didn't make our list.\n\nPros No upfront performance or redemption fees\n\nFlexibility and options as to how investors want to manage their investments Cons High minimum investment requirement ($100,000)\n\nShares bought by clients can only be traded through a direct brokerage account\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $16.84 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount $100,000 Assets under management $21.1 million\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), similar to some other ETFs on our list, gets its exposure to Bitcoin through futures contracts. Unlike those other ETFs, though, XBTF is structured as a C-corporation, a tax-efficient corporate structure that can save investors on tax liabilities over the long run.\n\nAside from investing in Bitcoin futures, XBTF also invests in other assets, including stocks, bonds and cash. It didn't make our list mainly due to its high minimum investment ($100,000) and relatively low amount of assets under management ($21 million) compared to other similar ETFs.\n\nPros Low expense ratio of just 0.65%\n\nTop holdings include tech giants like Alibaba, PayPal and Amazon Cons Significantly less direct exposure to Bitcoin than most other ETFs on this list\n\nExposure to blockchain technology makes it susceptible to market crashes\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $34.25 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $118.9 million\n\nThe First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (LEGR) seeks to track the Inxx Blockchain Index, which invests in companies developing and selling blockchain-based technology solutions. This includes companies building decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure \u2014 think yield farming and NFTs \u2014 and those developing digital assets and other pieces of the crypto economy.\n\nWith its holdings well-diversified across a variety of technology companies, LEGR isn\u2019t nearly as exposed to the swings in the price of Bitcoin as other ETFs. As a result, if you\u2019re looking for an ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin (even loosely), LEGR isn\u2019t the best choice.\n\nPros Functions as a traditional investment vehicle, allowing for easy transfer of assets and rights\n\nShares can be held in some IRA, Roth IRA and investor accounts Cons Provides exposure to Ethereum, not Bitcoin\n\nOne of the highest expense ratios in the crypto ETF market (2.50%)\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $11.72 Expense ratio 2.50% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $3.6 billion\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) boasts more than $3 billion under management with an initial investment requirement of $25,000. However, its value is derived from the price of Ethereum, not Bitcoin, making it an Ethereum ETF.\n\nOn top of not being a true Bitcoin ETF, ETHE\u2019s high expense ratio of 2.50% made it a poor fit for the rest of our list, most of which charge less than 1%.\n\nPros Well diversified funds, with just 20% of assets in its 10 largest holdings\n\nFunds are distributed across the technology, finance and communications sectors Cons Fund has no direct link with Bitcoin\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $20.60 Expense ratio 0.68% Minimum investment amount Not Available Assets under management $87.2 million\n\nThe Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) was designed to achieve long-term growth by tracking the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. We didn't include it among our top picks because it doesn't have a direct link to Bitcoin. Instead, the index provides exposure to companies actively involved with blockchain and other ledger technologies. These include crypto mining, blockchain infrastructure and blockchain software and services.\n\nSeveral of these sectors aren\u2019t widely available through ETFs, making BLCN an option for investors seeking DLT investment vehicles. Current holdings include Coinbase, Hewlett Packard, Microstrategy and American Express.\n\nPros Exposure to blockchain technology stocks and crypto futures in a single trade\n\nInvests in innovative blockchain and digital asset providers Cons Hasn't yet proven its effectiveness\n\nSmall number of assets under management compared to other options, which may suggest lack of investor confidence\n\nHIGHLIGHTS Price $18.95 Expense ratio 0.65% Minimum investment amount $25,000 Assets under management $6.58 million\n\nThe Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS) is an actively managed fund that aims to provide its investors with long-term capital appreciation through Bitcoin-linked ETFs and investments in other blockchain firms. BITS is attractive to many investors due to its focus on long-term gains coupled with its below-average expense ratio.\n\nWhile BITS doesn't invest in Bitcoin directly, it does offer investors exposure to crypto companies working on next-generation technologies, creating the potential for outsized returns. BITS is down 80% since its inception, though, and with less than $10 million under management today, it still needs to prove its worth before institutional investors will take it seriously.\n\nBitcoin ETFs Guide\n\nThe following guide offers basic information about Bitcoin ETFs, from how they work to what to know before choosing one.\n\nHow do Bitcoin ETFs work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF operates similarly to any other ETF: It tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, which in this case is Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange, with the share price fluctuating with the market price of Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors can buy and sell shares in Bitcoin ETFs without having to buy or sell the underlying cryptocurrency directly. Crypto ETFs are managed by investment firms that ensure the fund's holdings match the market value of the tracked cryptocurrency as closely as possible.\n\nHow can I invest in Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nYou can purchase Bitcoin ETFs through many investment brokers like Fidelity and Charles Schwab. Some Bitcoin ETFs, such Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), are also available through platforms like Robinhood and Wealthfront.\n\nAccessibility is one of the primary selling points of Bitcoin ETFs: you don't need to open an account with a crypto exchange or crypto wallet, nor do you need to worry about losing your private keys. All you need is a regular brokerage account, just like the one you use for the rest of your investments.\n\nHow often do Bitcoin ETFs pay out?\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs don't pay dividends on any regular schedule. However, this is changing as the market matures, and some Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2013 have recently started distributing profits in the form of dividends. Still, if you\u2019re seeking regular, predictable dividend payouts, Bitcoin ETFs are probably not the right investment vehicle for you.\n\nMain things to know before choosing a Bitcoin ETF\n\nCryptocurrencies will likely continue to impact the financial markets for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often means using a crypto exchange and/or wallet. This means your money may be kept separate from the rest of your investment portfolio.\n\nIn contrast, crypto ETFs offer an opportunity for investors to invest in crypto without leaving the marketplaces they\u2019re familiar with. Still, there are a few things you should know about Bitcoin ETFs before putting your money into one.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETFs do not make you an actual owner of Bitcoin\n\nIf your ultimate goal in investing in a crypto ETF is to use Bitcoin to make purchases or transfers, investing in an ETF is the wrong path. Bitcoin ETFs do not give their investors direct Bitcoin ownership. Instead, they track the value of Bitcoin and other assets closely related to it. In other words, you become an owner of shares of the fund, not the Bitcoin it\u2019s tracking.\n\n2. You may feel safer investing in Bitcoin ETF instead of Bitcoin\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been a profitable cryptocurrency for some investors, it's still a very volatile asset. On top of that, cryptocurrency exchanges aren't regulated by financial authorities like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the same way that traditional exchanges are, and some international exchanges face almost no regulation at all. This poses a risk for investors, who can get caught up in scams or see the value of their digital assets vanish overnight.\n\nETFs act as a workaround, as they're traded on the traditional financial markets regulated by authorities like the SEC. Some brokerage accounts where you can invest in ETFs are also insured (up to a certain limit), keeping your funds safe even if your broker becomes insolvent. Additionally, some ETFs don't just track Bitcoin alone but also other assets, diversifying your investment and reducing your overall portfolio risk.\n\n3. Bitcoin ETFs are easier to understand for some investors\n\nOne reason crypto ETFs have become so popular is that, for many investors, ETFs are a more familiar investment vehicle than cryptocurrency. Buying an ETF from a broker is often easier than buying crypto from a decentralized exchange, though that may change over time.\n\nAs mobile apps like Coinbase and Venmo make the process of buying crypto smoother, more investors may be inclined to buy cryptocurrency directly from them instead of purchasing crypto ETFs. However, that means your crypto will still be sitting on a centralized platform, and moving it off-platform to a decentralized wallet may require additional know-how.\n\nBitcoin ETFs FAQs Do Bitcoin ETFs pay dividends? chevron-down chevron-up Most Bitcoin ETFs do not yield dividends, mainly because Bitcoin itself is decentralized and not a company that pays dividends to shareholders. However, some Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) \u2014 have recently started paying dividends with yields of around 1%. Some Bitcoin ETFs also invest in shares of publicly traded companies that deal with Bitcoin or keep part of their holdings in Bitcoin. If you invest in these particular ETFs, you might also receive dividends, yet they will likely be lower than if you invested in those companies directly. Some Bitcoin ETFs also invest in shares of publicly traded companies that deal with Bitcoin or keep part of their holdings in Bitcoin. If you invest in these particular ETFs, you might also receive dividends, yet they will likely be lower than if you invested in those companies directly. How safe is investing in Bitcoin ETFs? chevron-down chevron-up All investments come with risks, and this is especially true for crypto-related assets. With that said, investing in a Bitcoin ETF is generally considered safer because most brokers offering ETFs are highly regulated, much more so than crypto exchanges. For more information, read our article on For more information, read our article on whether bitcoin is safe Where can I buy Bitcoin ETFs? chevron-down chevron-up You can buy most Bitcoin ETFs through traditional online brokers, but not all brokers offer them. Depending on the specific ETF you wish to buy, you may need to shop around for the right broker. Some ETFs are also actively traded on NYSE Arca and Nasdaq. Do Bitcoin ETFs invest in Bitcoin directly? chevron-down chevron-up No, Bitcoin ETFs do not invest in Bitcoin directly. There are currently no ETFs that buy or trade BTC. Bitcoin ETFs are an indirect way to gain exposure to the crypto market because the fund invests in companies or assets related to Bitcoin (or Bitcoin futures), but not in Bitcoin itself. What is the difference between Bitcoin and crypto? chevron-down chevron-up Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency \u2014 the most popular crypto of them all \u2014 but not all cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin. Crypto is the broader category of digital currency that Bitcoin and other altcoins fall under. Put another way, Bitcoin is to crypto what the dollar or the euro are to fiat currency.\n\nHow we found the best Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThere are plenty of crypto ETFs available today, and while they can appear quite similar on the surface, not all are worth investing in. We considered the following four factors to narrow down the selection of the best Bitcoin ETFs of the year.\n\nPrice\n\nThe price of an ETF can be misleading, since a higher price doesn\u2019t necessarily mean greater overall performance. However, looking at historical price data can give investors an idea of potential volatility moving ahead.\n\nFor example, if a given ETF has endured large price swings over the past 12 months, there\u2019s a reasonable chance it will endure similarly large swings over the next 12 months. Investors looking for more stable returns should seek out ETFs with a track record of relative stability, especially through the recent market downturn.\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively volatile over the past 12 months, and almost all of them have lost money, largely due to the outflow of funds from the crypto markets.\n\nExpense ratios\n\nExpense ratios are always an important factor to look at when assessing ETFs because they can eat away at investor returns. All things being equal, lower expense ratios are better, though it may be worth paying a higher expense ratio if you can expect higher net returns.\n\nThe lowest expense ratios among Bitcoin ETFs range between 0.5% and 0.75%, with expense ratios on the high side sitting above 1%.\n\nMinimum investment\n\nBitcoin ETFs with low minimum investment thresholds open the door to smaller investors, while those with higher thresholds generally cater to institutional investors. The ETFs on our list have minimum investment thresholds between $10,000 and $100,000.\n\nAssets under management\n\nAssets under management (AUM) is an indicator of the size of a fund. A larger AUM doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a more successful fund; on the contrary, small funds may achieve higher returns because there\u2019s a lower absolute risk if they go bust, allowing them to be more aggressive in their allocations.\n\nThe ETFs on our list range from around $5 million to more than $10 billion worth of assets under management.\n\nSummary of the best Bitcoin ETFs of 2023"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Really Reach a $1 Million Price Tag? Here's Why Cathie Wood Thinks So. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Known for their love of innovation and disruptive technologies, Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest are natural fans of Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%). They believe the world's first cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize financial markets and even the idea of money itself.\n\nTheir confidence in Bitcoin is so strong that analysts at Ark Invest released a report claiming that its price could be worth more than $1 million by 2030.\n\nBut for Bitcoin to get to that level, it would need to increase by more than 4,000% in just seven years. Although Bitcoin is no stranger to massive runs, this prediction seems outlandish at first glance. Fortunately for us, Ark's analyst provided a detailed synopsis of just how Bitcoin could get to the million-dollar mark.\n\nThere's more to Bitcoin than just its price\n\nOne of the primary reasons Ark believes Bitcoin will continue to ascend in price is due to its consistent growth in its network's fundamentals. Similar to earnings reports for companies, data on Bitcoin's blockchain can be evaluated to gauge health and growth.\n\nTo capture this, analysts evaluated blockchain metrics on three different occasions when Bitcoin's price was at $15,800. This price is important because it was the lowest price Bitcoin fell to in the current bear market, reaching that bottom price in November 2022.\n\nThe other two times were on December 2017, which was an all-time high at that point, and then after a bear market that spanned most of 2018 and 2019. That downturn sent Bitcoin prices down as low as $3,100 before climbing back to $15,800 in November 2020.\n\nArk evaluated metrics like hash rate (a statistic that quantifies Bitcoin's computing power), the total supply of Bitcoin that hadn't moved in the past year (a gauge to measure investor behavior), and the number of Bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance (a figure that helps assess network growth).\n\nDespite reaching this $15,800 price on three separate occasions, these metrics were shown to have grown significantly. Here is a breakdown of each of those metrics at these different points in time:\n\nMetric Dec. 2017 Nov. 2020 Nov. 2022 Hash Rate (EH/s) 12.6 127.8 262.4 Supply of BTC Last Moved >1 Year Ago (%) 44.1% 61.8% 66.5% BTC Addresses With Non-Zero Balance (Millions) 24 32.6 43.5\n\nWhen analyzing Bitcoin from this angle, rather than just its price, a few things become clear. First, Bitcoin's network computing power continues to strengthen, a sign that it is becoming more decentralized and secure with time. Second, investors are holding Bitcoin for longer, and this trend is typically viewed as an indication of their confidence that prices will increase in the future. And lastly, the number of addresses has nearly doubled in just five years, which shows that the network has been experiencing exponential growth. Ark believes this combination of the Bitcoin network's resilience and growth, even in the midst of bear markets, will continue into the future and provide the fuel for it to reach new all-time highs.\n\nGood, better, and best-case scenarios\n\nBut how high can Bitcoin actually go? To quantify just how explosive this growth could be, Ark presented three separate scenarios for Bitcoin's journey up to 2030. They divided the three into a bear case (the worst scenario), a base case, and a bull case (the best scenario).\n\nFor the bear case, Ark believes Bitcoin could be worth around $258,500. The base case projects a value of $682,000. And the bull case, a whopping $1.48 million.\n\nJust because Ark thinks a $1.48 million price tag is in the cards doesn't guarantee it will happen. Even though it would be nice to see, the firm doesn't have a crystal ball that predicts the future. But their analysis of Bitcoin's network at three different points provides a compelling case that bear markets and crypto winters are just minor obstacles in Bitcoin's path of price ascension.\n\nOnly time will tell if Ark's analysis proves to be true. With its hash rate, supply last moved more than a year ago, and the number of non-zero balances all sitting at near all-time highs, purchasing Bitcoin today looks as alluring as ever, as the price remains down more than 65% from its peak of $68,000."

        "content": "2023 is off to a great start, with Bitcoin (BTC) rocketing up 40% in January. The good news is not relegated to just Bitcoin, however, as this price increase has sent ripple effects across the cryptoverse. Mining revenue jumped $22.66 million in January, and crypto-related stocks doubled on average. Despite this good news, venture capital investments are down 23% from the previous month.\n\nDownload and purchase this report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nFor a more detailed look into the various sectors of the crypto space, including venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulations and much more, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights report. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.\n\nBitcoin gaining momentum in Q1 of 2023\n\nBitcoin posted its best monthly price performance since October 2021, gaining almost 40% in January. After benefiting from a Consumer Price Index print that showed inflation slowing in December 2022, crypto and stock prices began to cool as retail data missed expectations and earnings diminished. As BTC\u2019s price hit a multi-month high of $23,920 on Jan. 29, all eyes turned to the Feb. 1 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, citing easing but still elevated inflation. BTC saw little volatility around the $23,000 level, suggesting the news was priced in.\n\nAs BTC gained bullish momentum in January, centralized exchange inflows and outflows normalized. The largest monthly outflow of coins in history occurred after the FTX collapse in November 2022, hitting 200,000 BTC/month across all exchanges. The net flows are now closer to neutral, with a reduction in the high outflow trend signaling investors are returning to the crypto market. BTC\u2019s bullish month blitzed through its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages for the first time in over a year, with investor cohorts returning to profitability previously wiped out in 2022.\n\nDeFi TVL up $10 billion despite persistent fears and hacks\n\nSeveral altcoins, including Gala (GALA), Aptos (APT), Threshold (T), Decentraland\u2019s MANA and Solana (SOL), experienced 100%+ monthly growth at the beginning of 2023 as Bitcoin\u2019s price started to rise at the beginning of 2023. This was caused by the extreme dominance of negative sentiment and the over-saturation of short positions by the end of 2022. However, Solana-based protocol Friktion still announced the halting of deposits due to the \u201ctough market for DeFi in the coming months,\u201d suggesting that further recession may occur in the near future.\n\nSimultaneously, several events in a darker world of exploits and hacks continued, following the pathway of 2022. Namely, Avraham Eisenberg\u2019s saga is unfolding as Mango Markets sued the hacker for $47-million compensation following his $117-million attack in October 2022. There have been several incidences of stolen funds moving around in the industry lately.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.

        "content": "There\u2019s little love for bitcoin this Valentine's as sentiment around the cryptocurrency remains \u2018slightly negative\u2019, three months after the fallout from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nGBBC Digital Finance (GDF), an industry body advocating for best practices around digital finance, has partnered with CMI Analytics to create a \u2018Bitcoin Love Index\u2019 \u2013 a daily score that uses a machine algorithm to assess the \u2018sentiment\u2019 behind mentions of bitcoin in the media. Mentions of the word \u2018bitcoin\u2019 are harvested from a wide sample of sources, not just crypto-specific publications.\n\n\n\nThe index shows that, in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse, sentiment around bitcoin fell from being mainly \u2018neutral\u2019 to \u2018very negative\u2019. There was an instant rebound over the following days but it was not until the end of November and beginning of December, GDF figures suggest, that bitcoin sentiment consistently returned to \u2018neutral\u2019 levels.\n\n\n\nBitcoin sentiment is lingering around \u2018slightly negative \u2019 today \u2013 which is also Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 having cooled off slightly since the beginning of the year. The index appears to show that there is not much love for the poster-child of digital assets, even on today of all days.\n\n\n\nLove affair fades as bitcoin trades 60% lower\n\nIn the longer term, GDF notices that there has been no \u2018positive\u2019 sentiment score since the FTX fallout \u2013 the longest streak in the last two years. However, the price of bitcoin, though still volatile, has recovered this month to nearly $20,000 \u2013 similar to the price prior to the FTX collapse.\n\n\n\nOver the entirety of 2022, the price of bitcoin lost more than 60%; it fell from a price of $35,275 at the end of December 2021 to $13,660 at the end of last year. The price of bitcoin had already fallen considerably by the time the FTX story broke, as you might expect \u2013 but that incident alone temporarily wiped 25% off the price of the currency virtually overnight. It wasn\u2019t until the end of January 2023 that the price of bitcoin had recovered to pre-FTX levels.\n\n\n\nThe statistics appear to show that retail investors, whose household budgets are being squeezed anyway, have been spooked by the volatility in the crypto market. But that isn\u2019t really affecting institutional confidence in the market, and there are still those who have full belief in bitcoin.\n\nNigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group, says cryptocurrencies \u201cstill have all the pluses of being digital \u2013 speed, efficiency and convenience \u2013 but they are fundamentally different as they run on an open, immutable blockchain\u201d.\n\nIt has also seemingly not dampened the appetite for celebrity ambassadors at crypto companies; earlier today, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt joined Gamdom, a cryptocurrency casino, as its new brand ambassador."

        "content": "Bitcoin is known for its robustness, security and predictability. Every 10 minutes \u2014 on average \u2014 the blockchain produces a new block, and the successful miner earns a block reward of 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC), around $130,000.\n\nHowever, every once in a while, the Bitcoin blockchain surprises observers and participants.\n\nAt block height 776,339, nodes across the network verified a completely empty block. The block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain with zero included transactions, leading to some confusion among the crypto community. So, what exactly is an empty block, and how does it happen?\n\nBlock expectation vs. reality. Source: Mempool.space\n\nFirst, while an empty block might seem strange at first, it\u2019s actually a normal occurrence on the network. The last time it occurred was a little over two weeks ago, in block 774,486.\n\nMiners are incentivized to mine blocks as quickly as possible, and sometimes, they mine a block before they have received any transactions to include. When this happens, the block remains empty.\n\nThe Bitcoin mempool, the go-to space for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain, offers the following explanation: \u201cWhen a new block is found, mining pools send miners a block template with no transactions so they can start searching for the next block as soon as possible. They send a block template full of transactions right afterward, but a full block template is a bigger data transfer and takes slightly longer to reach miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this intervening time, which is usually no more than 1\u20132 seconds, miners sometimes get lucky and find a new block using the empty block template.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the miners \u201cgot lucky\u201d by mining a template. In this instance, the Bitcoin block at height 776,389 was added mere seconds after its predecessor, 776,488. \u200eHowever, block 776,388 earned an extra 0.086 BTC or $1,854 in fees, which was added to the block reward of \u200e6.25 BTC or $135,247.\n\nEven though an empty block doesn\u2019t contain any transactions, the miner still receives the block reward of the newly minted Bitcoin. As such, block 776,389 was awarded 6.25 BTC \u2014 no transaction fees. Binance Pool was the winning miner, which contributes as much as 12% to the total hash rate.\n\nBitcoin mining pool ranking. Source: Mempool.space\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that empty blocks are not a problem for the network. By mining empty blocks, miners still produce the coin generation transaction, also known as the coinbase transaction, which keeps Bitcoin steady on its path to reaching 21 million BTC issued.\n\nRelated: Public miners increased Bitcoin production, hash rate in January\n\nAccording to data from BitInfoCharts, the percentage of empty blocks on the network is usually around 1%\u20132%. The stat is more surprising today, given the rise of \u201cordinals\u201d on Bitcoin, or the ability to permanently etch pictures, data and stamps onto the blockchain.\n\nThe rise in ordinals has provoked some questions and even concern among the Bitcoin community, and the first instances of pornography were recently recorded. The mempool has been increasingly busy, and block space has been contested for as some JPEG enthusiasts scramble to contribute their art to the Bitcoin blockchain."

He predicts more investors will begin to \u201cstack\u201d BTC into cold storage wallets:\n\n\u201cgiven volatility, i think #bitcoin can overshoot wildly and tap one of these $100-300 trillion market caps, correct and then regain a steadier adoption over time. i suspect people with average entry points, relative to then current price won't have much incentive to sell in size.\u201d\n\nThe CEO explained that part of that next wave of adoption may come from what he describes as \u201chyperbitcoinization spurts\u201d \u2014 where people in hyperinflationary environments will \u201crush\u201d to bitcoin:\n\nAdam Back believes the inflation of fiat currencies may force people to buy and hold bitcoin.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners have earned nearly $600,000 in two months from a new controversial nonfungible token (NFT) protocol called Ordinals that has triggered a surge in user activity.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nOrdinals allow users to inscribe data in images and other media types in newly mined blocks on the blockchain that is otherwise largely used for peer-to-peer (P2P) monetary transactions.\n\nFee spent on inscribing Ordinal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nSince the launch of Ordinals in mid-December 2022, users have inscribed nearly 74,000 NFTs into the Bitcoin blockchain, earning miners a cumulative $574,000 in BTC transaction fees to date, data from Dune Analytics shows.\n\nThese NFTs include \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d stemming from clones of projects like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.\n\nThe NFT community is moving to BTC, where Ordinals have brought true scarcity to collectibles.\n\n\n\nI forever inscribed \u201cThe Blonde Don\u201d BAYC #1626 on the world's scarcest and most secure chain burning him off ETH forever using TeleBurn.\n\n\n\nIt's done. Over. Not coming back to ETH. pic.twitter.com/jmKpSSPybm \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 12, 2023\n\nRising demand for Bitcoin block space\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was made possible by Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Taproot, Bitcoin\u2019s network soft fork upgrades from 2017 and 2021, respectively.\n\nRelated: Ordinals protocol sparks debate over the place for NFTs in the Bitcoin ecosystem\n\nFor instance, the SegWit update effectively increased Bitcoin\u2019s block capacity to four megabytes (4 MB).\n\nSimilarly, the Taproot update helps batch and verify multiple transactions together as long as their size does not exceed 4 MB. This feature allows the inscription of data, such as images and videos, in Bitcoin blocks.\n\nBitcoin Taproot adoption in recent weeks. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nThe advent of Ordinals has coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s mean block size jumping from its typical average of 1.5\u20132 MB to between three and 3.5 MB in early February.\n\nBitcoin mean block size. Source: Glassnode\n\nSimultaneously, the number of pending SegWit and non-SegWit blocks in the Bitcoin mempool has also increased significantly \u2014 the highest since the FTX collapse, as shown below.\n\nThe number of pending blocks in the Bitcoin Mempool. Source: Glassnode\n\nOn some occasions, Ordinals\u2019 data has been comprising over 50% of Bitcoin block space, according to BitMEX Research.\n\n\u201cThis describes a growth in the user base and an upwards pressure on the fee market from usage beyond the typical investment and monetary transfer use cases,\u201d noted Glassnode in its weekly report, adding:\n\n\u201cOrdinals are a new frontier [...] to observe how it affects and manifests in both on-chain network and investor behavior.\u201c\n\nOrdinals: BTC miners\u2019 new revenue stream?\n\nBitcoin miners generate most of their revenue from the network\u2019s block subsidies, i.e., finding or \u201cmining\u201d new blocks. By comparison, the share of miners\u2019 earnings from transaction fees is only about 3%.\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin network rewards miners with 6.25 BTC per block. But this subsidy will drop by 50% to 3.125 BTC in spring 2024 in a halving event, which happens every four years. As a result, the share of miners\u2019 revenue from transaction fees is expected to rise over time as block rewards decrease.\n\nTo some, Ordinals introduce what\u2019s called miner extractable value, or MEV, which has been previously associated with mining on Ethereum.\n\nSimply put, MEV is the maximum value that miners can obtain from producing new blocks beyond the block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nIf Bitcoin Ordinals will take off (and I think it will) it\u2019s really good news for Bitcoin mining companies\u2019 revenue, something that\u2019s not reflected in their valuations yet. \u2014 Marc van der Chijs (@marcvanderchijs) February 6, 2023\n\nCritics, however, argue that Ordinals is an \u201cattack\u201d that will price out the real financial activity and thus damage Bitcoin\u2019s image as a reliable P2P payments network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is designed to be censor resistant,\u201d said Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, adding:\n\n\u201c[It] doesn\u2019t stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding. At least do something efficient. Otherwise, it\u2019s another proof of consumption of block-space thingy.\u201c\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Is This Billionaire's Favorite Cryptocurrency - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ray Dalio, the billionaire co-manager of the world's largest hedge fund, is well-versed in microeconomic trends, and his long experience in tracking global economic trends has also helped him recognize growing shifts in the macroeconomic environment before they become mainstream.\n\nOne shift he predicts is coming involves the growing competition between different forms of money. And he believes Bitcoin (BTC 1.58%) will become a viable competitor among those forms -- so much so that he has allocated 2% of his own portfolio to the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut why would a billionaire take on such a large position in such a risky asset? Fortunately for those of us who are curious, he recently elaborated on his reasoning.\n\nThe billionaire's cryptocurrency of choice\n\nDuring his appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Dalio was asked a handful of questions on finance and economics, but eventually, the topic of Bitcoin arose. At this point, the discussion transitioned into a monologue as Dalio explained his expectations for Bitcoin's growing role in an increasingly digital future, how it stacks up against gold, and even delved into the concept of money itself.\n\nDalio offered several justifications to support his decision to invest in Bitcoin. At the top of that list was how far Bitcoin has come from its humble beginnings and how it has \"obtained the status of having imputed value.\"\n\nWhen the crypto launched in 2009, there were virtually no users of its network. Fast-forward to today, and the Bitcoin blockchain has become a vast decentralized network based on true organic growth. Not only has it grown exponentially, but Bitcoin's code has proven to be virtually unhackable -- a fact that doesn't get recognized enough, in Dalio's opinion.\n\nThe demise of the dollar\n\nAfter Dalio celebrated Bitcoin's monumental rise, he then dove into his reasoning as to why it has a legitimate future as a form of currency. As he put it, the coming years and decades will likely be \"an era where there will be competition of monies.\"\n\nDue to the ever-inflating supplies of government-backed fiat currencies, citizens today are getting the proverbial short end of the stick. They are seeing their paychecks dwindle in purchasing power as the circulating supply of money continues to increase. As a result, Dalio believes the idea of money itself is \"increasingly being considered\" by the citizens of these governments.\n\nAs he put it, \"money has two purposes.\" It should serve as a medium of exchange and a storehouse of wealth -- a combination of characteristics that Bitcoin possesses and that, in his view, currencies like the U.S. dollar are beginning to lack. In this future of alternative monies, Dalio sees Bitcoin becoming a formidable rival to fiat currencies.\n\nGold or digital gold\n\nDue to its use-case similarities to gold, a common approach by investors is to create a \"one or the other\" dichotomy between Bitcoin and gold. But Dalio doesn't see it this way. When asked if he prefers Bitcoin or gold, Dalio explained that he sees the two as having similar characteristics, but serving different purposes.\n\nHe noted that Bitcoin possesses a role in our digital future where the ability to send value over the internet is important, but contended that there could also be a need for people to exchange value \"offline.\" While Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, they are technically traceable.\n\nDespite gold still providing value in today's economy, Dalio believes Bitcoin is the \"younger generation's alternative to gold.\" As this generation begins to become more integrated into the economy, Bitcoin will likely benefit.\n\nAdvice for non-billionaires\n\nAs previously mentioned, Dalio is said to have allocated around 2% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. But Dalio has a net worth of more than $19 billion. His appetite for risk has likely receded as he looks to preserve his wealth rather than grow it.\n\nDepending on your investing time horizon and tolerance for risk, you might feel comfortable allocating a larger share of your portfolio to a volatile asset like Bitcoin. If you are in a wealth preservation mode like Dalio, then a 2% allocation could be a healthy level for you. But those who are closer to the start of their investing journeys are more than likely to be in the market long enough to see how Dalio's predictions about competing monies play out over the long term."

Source: Rekt Capital/ Twitter\n\n\u201cMost important\u201d CPI print arrives\n\nThe macro landscape is set to be dominated by one data point this week with the Feb. 14 release of the CPI for January.\n\nBets are on for inflation continuing to decline in a move that could still buoy risk assets despite a comedown in early February.\n\nThe picture is complicated by a reshuffling of how CPI is calculated, but analysts dispute its significance versus the overall trend of inflation receding.\n\nHowever, this month\u2019s print is being closely eyed far beyond crypto circles.\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s CPI report is the most important report to date. After a strong January jobs report and December CPI \u2018revised\u2019 higher, uncertainty is everywhere,\u201d capital markets newsletter, The Kobeissi Letter, told Twitter followers at the weekend.\n\n\u201cBoth bulls and bears need the report to go their way. Whichever side is right will drive the market for the next month.\u201d\n\nPopular trader and analyst Myles G underscored the consequences for crypto should CPI come in higher than expected, warning that this would \u201cdump the market big.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost every CPI reveal last 6 months has been an instant dump, then an immediate recovery after traders digested the data,\u201d fellow trader Satoshi Flipper noted about the relationship between CPI and market volatility.\n\n\u201cWill this time be different?\u201d\n\nU.S. CPI chart.

This time around, the depression could be harder and more drawn out than before.\n\n\u201cWhile many Bitcoin investors have noted that BTC typically bottoms roughly ~400 days after the bull market peak, this chart suggests that this time is different,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cConsidering that we\u2019ve never seen this signal until now, the implication is that the 1-year trend might stay below the 3-year trend even longer!\u201d\n\nHe said that the two-year EMA might also end up crossing below the three-year EMA, which would likewise constitute a first-of-its-kind event.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that occurs within the next 6 months as a result of further sideways action or downward consolidation,\u201d the analysis forecast.\n\nBTC/USD 1-week candle chart (Bitstamp) with 52-, 104-, and 156-day moving averages.

        "title": "Bitcoin halving 2024: a blessing or a curse - crypto.news",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) halving significantly impacts the cryptocurrency world. The next event, scheduled for 2024, will likely impact bitcoin price again: let\u2019s find out how.\n\nBitcoin halving is an event wherein the reward given to miners for verifying transactions on the BTC blockchain is cut in half every four years. This event occurs as a mechanism to control inflation and reduce the rate of new bitcoins entering the market.\n\nHalving has substantial implications for miners, as their profitability is also cut in half. The halving also causes a surge in the price of BTC \u2014 as the limited supply pushes the demand higher.\n\nAs we approach the forthcoming halving event next year, the market is buzzing with anticipation. This halving could push bitcoin past its all-time high, exceeding the 2021 peak of $68,789.\n\nThis article will cover all you need about bitcoin halving, how it impacts the markets and stakeholders, and everything else. But first, let\u2019s understand what bitcoin halving is.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving\n\nThink of bitcoin halving as the network\u2019s version of a cost-of-living adjustment. Bitcoin halving is a predetermined event built into the Bitcoin network. It occurs every four years or after 210,000 blocks have been mined and reduce the block reward by 50%.\n\nSo where miners used to get 12.5 bitcoin for verifying a block before the 2020 halving, they now get just 6.25.\n\nThe 2020 halving was the third since bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2009. The first took place in November 2012 and reduced the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoin per block. The second took place in July 2016 and reduced the reward from 25 to 12.5 bitcoin.\n\nBTC mining rewards\n\nThe idea behind halving is that bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, established the total supply of bitcoin at 21 million coins. These halvings help ensure the scarcity of BTC by slowly reducing the amount of new bitcoin created until the supply is exhausted, which will be done by 2140.\n\nMoreover, the event also helps maintain bitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature, which limits its circulating supply and increases the cost of mining BTC.\n\nAs a result, the Bitcoin network is thought to be more secure as the incentive to attack it with more powerful computers (known as a \u201c51% attack\u201d) becomes less enticing.\n\nEffects of bitcoin halving on different stakeholders\n\nThe much-awaited bitcoin halving has been a source of great intrigue for all stakeholders, including miners, investors, and crypto exchanges. So let\u2019s look at how each of these stakeholders benefits from it:\n\nMiners\n\nWith halving, bitcoin miners earn only half the coins they were earning previously. Simply put, they must work twice as hard to get the same rewards. So, it\u2019s no surprise that the anticipation around the halving is exceptionally high for miners.\n\nHowever, halving is not necessarily a bad thing for the miners. Since a limited number of bitcoins can be mined, the halving helps miners maintain their profit margins. This means the miners can enjoy the same rewards without having to mine more.\n\nInvestors\n\nThe halving is an excellent opportunity for investors since it usually tends to lead to a surge in bitcoin\u2019s price. This momentum often causes a ripple effect across other cryptocurrencies and can be profitable for investors.\n\nThe surge in the price also allows investors to take advantage of low-cost entry points and potentially increase their profits.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges\n\nFor exchanges, the halving is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is an exciting event that attracts many traders and thus leads to increased volumes in trading.\n\nOn the other hand, it can also be a cause of concern as the sudden surge in activity can cause technical glitches and congest the networks.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s clear that bitcoin halving affects all stakeholders differently but can eventually lead to a positive outcome.\n\nHow each stakeholder benefits depends on their goals and strategies, so it\u2019s essential to carefully consider the implications of the halving before making any decisions.\n\nEffects of previous halvings on the market\n\nThe market impact of previous bitcoin halvings is often referred to as the \u201chalving effect.\u201d In other words, halvings can be viewed as catalysts for significant market events.\n\nBTC historical price chart. Source: CoinStats\n\nStatistics from the past three halvings show that bitcoin\u2019s price increased substantially in the long term following each.\n\nThe first halving in November 2012 saw the BTC price grow from around $11 to a high of $948 by December 2013.\n\nThe second halving, which occurred In July 2016, saw the BTC value increase from around $650 to a high of $13,650 by December 2017.\n\nLastly, the third halving in May 2020 saw the price surge from around $8,200 to a peak of $68,789 in November 2021.\n\nWhen halving hits, miners are rewarded fewer coins for their work, leading to a supply shock and causing the price to climb as demand driven by scarcity weighs heavier on the availability of the currency.\n\nThis effect has become so predictable that the market is actively anticipating them, leading to an influx of buyers before each event.\n\nIt is important to note that the halving effect can vary from cycle to cycle, so although it may have had a bullish impact in the past, it isn\u2019t guaranteed to happen each time.\n\nThat being said, if the past is any indication, the halving effect will likely continue to affect the market in the future.\n\nThe road ahead: what to expect from the next halving?\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHalving events have been a significant catalyst for bitcoin price appreciation. As seen in the chart above, bitcoin\u2019s price began to increase steadily in the 500 days before the most recent halving. After the halving, bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed, just as in the past two.\n\nHence, bitcoin is likely to experience a similarly promising price rise in the days leading up to the fourth halving, slated for May 2024, by which the block reward will drop to 3.125 BTC.\n\nFollowing the halving, bitcoin is expected to make a decisive up move, potentially even reaching new, higher levels.\n\nAt the time of writing, the current price of BTC is around $22,715, with a market cap of $438 billion.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The city of Da Nang, Vietnam, which some have dubbed \u201cBitcoin Beach Vietnam,\u201d will play host to Asia\u2019s first Bitcoin and Lightning Network conference in the region. Neutronpay, BitcoinVN and Nunchuk \u2014 all Vietnam-based Bitcoin companies \u2014 are excited to share what is happening in Asia as it relates to Bitcoin projects, Bitcoin communities and Lightning adoption across the region. The conference will take place on March 22 through 24, 2023 at the beautiful beachside Furama Resort.\n\nMalcolm Weed, chief operating officer of Neutronpay, who is the event\u2019s main organizer, said, \u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited to be putting on the world\u2019s first Bitcoin and Lightning event in Asia. Bitcoin adoption is very strong across the region, with countries like Vietnam, Philippines, India, Pakistan, Thailand and China all being in the top-10 global rankings for Bitcoin adoption, making it the world\u2019s Bitcoin epicenter. With over 4 billion people in Asia \u2014 70% of which are unbanked \u2014 it is no wonder Bitcoin adoption is so strong.\u201d\n\nMalcolm continued, \u201cWhen I looked around, I noticed that other parts of the world were being represented with events, but Asia and more specifically emerging markets in Asia had none, and were being completely overlooked considering the global rankings. We\u2019re proud to say that since we announced the event, it has been highly talked about and is now on many people\u2019s yearly must-hit conference calendars. We\u2019ve so far built a great speaker list, composed of many recognizable Bitcoiners, with an emphasis on making sure we have representation from countries across South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.\u201d\n\nThe event will kick off with a beach meet and greet on the evening of March 22, followed by two days of speakers sharing the latest developments across the Bitcoin ecosystem, touching on both technological and economic aspects. There will also be a strong representation of companies that are building on the Lightning Network and will share the current state of affairs and what exciting things are currently being worked on.\n\nThere will only be 500 attendees, so tickets are limited. General admission two-day passes are currently priced at $375, with ticket prices going up again on March 1. The nonprofit event can be accessed by local Vietnamese attendees at a preferential price of $35 dollars.\n\nThere are a few spots left for this Bitcoin-only event for speakers, moderators, volunteers, sponsors and media, so those interested in taking part should reach out via email.\n\nAbout Lightningcon Vietnam\n\nLightningcon Vietnam is Asia\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin and Lightning conference. It will bring together stakeholders from all sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem, with local representation from projects and communities across the region and a focus on networking, collaboration and learning over a two-day conference.\n\nAbout Neutronpay\n\nNeutronpay is a Silicon Valley VC-funded startup that provides Lightning Network infrastructure to businesses that wish to launch Lightning products such as remittances, payments, spending, payouts and banking capabilities. It is led by veterans in the payments, compliance, banking and Bitcoin industries and was founded in 2018, being part of the first cohort of companies building on the Lightning Network.\n\nAbout BitcoinVN\n\nBitcoinVN was founded in late 2013 by a Vietnamese-German team with the mission to provide locals and expats with access to the digital asset economy and its wider applications. The team comprises stalwarts of the Bitcoin scene in Ho Chi Minh City, and have grown to be the go-to Bitcoin provider in the region for online and over-the-counter trades."

Tate, who boasted about scamming men via his webcam business and had a huge internet following, frequently talked about the size of his cryptocurrency stash.\n\nMateea Petrescu, a spokesperson for Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan (who was also arrested ), told Decrypt that Romanian police also confiscated hardware wallets containing digital assets.\n\nPetrescu said Andrew Tate\u2019s wallet contained five Bitcoin\u2014today worth around $111,339. Tristan\u2019s wallet held around 16 Bitcoin.\n\nIn total, that\u2019s $467,625 worth of the asset.\n\nAndrew Tate\u2019s Bitcoin was held in his girlfriend\u2019s hardware wallet, the spokesperson said\u2014adding that it couldn\u2019t be confirmed whether the social media star owned more crypto than has already been seized.\n\nRomanian Police told Decrypt they couldn\u2019t comment.\n\nAndrew Tate has talked about Bitcoin a lot. \u201cYou can actually control and own your money,\u201d he said last year on Anthony Pompliano\u2019s popular Bitcoin podcast. \u201cHow difficult is it to move serious cash?

They claim the two brothers wanted to \u201ctransform\u201d women who worked for them \u201cinto slaves\u201d, according to a Reuters report which cites court documents."

        "content": "It's hardly the most famous logo around, and certainly wasn't the work of a hugely well paid design agency. The Bitcoin logo was created by a community forum member back in 2010 \u2013 so perhaps we can forgive a few design imperfections.\n\nNearly 13 years later, a Twitter user has shared how a slightly infuriating defect has endured on the vector files \u2013 the kind that, while tiny, would be utterly unacceptable on a big brand design. And it turns out it isn't the only issue with the Bitcoin logo. (Looking for inspiration? Check out the best logos of all time.)\n\n(Image credit: Bitboy via Bitcoin Forum)\n\nUser @_Bosch_ points out that when zooming in on the vector, one can just about spot a few pixels from the orange background protruding into the white of the 'B'. Ironic, seeing as one famous Bitcoin slogan is \"when in doubt, zoom out\" (something about seeing the bigger picture, etc.) And another user added that one of the curves of the letter isn't perfectly smooth either.\n\nA small design detail that has stayed with many iterations of the original #bitcoin logo since its inception in 2010 pic.twitter.com/nYElwD2S6vFebruary 9, 2023 See more\n\n(Image credit: @skyler_fs on Twitter)\n\nStill, we can't be too hard on a logo designed by a community member over a decade ago. According to Decrypt, Bitcoin Forum member Bitboy shared the design as an improvement on the original (below) by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010, and shared it free to the public domain. If anything, the fact that is has endured for so long shows that, while not quite perfect, it's a pretty clean logo.\n\n(Image credit: Satoshi Nakamoto)\n\nAnd of course, not even the world's biggest logos are safe from the dreaded design flaw. Just yesterday, we reported that people are spotting an imperfection in the Google logo.

Secure your seat today\n\nCanadian crypto hardware manufacturer Coinkite has designed a bitcoin hardware wallet reminiscent of an old-school BlackBerry phone straight out of the 2000s.\n\nBut the company says its new design reflects forward thinking on the tightest possible security measures and user-friendly features gleaned from customer feedback.\n\nThe soon-to-be-released device, dubbed Coldcard Q1, became available for pre-ordering on Feb. 9 and comes with a full keyboard, an LCD screen and an LED-illuminated QR code scanner.\n\nThe waffle-phone-style QWERTY keyboard gives off strong 2002 BlackBerry vibes and is supposed to cut down on so-called fat-finger errors when entering sensitive passwords, PINs and passphrases.\n\nRead more: Wasabi Wallet Will Pay You to 'Crack' a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nCoinkite added a battery compartment on the Q1\u2019s rear side that fits three AAA batteries, so there\u2019s no need for a tethered power supply, although a USB-C port is available for customers who prefer using a power cord.\n\nIt\u2019s the company\u2019s fifth iteration of a bitcoin hardware wallet, following the introduction of the MK line starting in 2018. The most-recent model, the Coldcard MK4, was released in February 2022.\n\nThe company aims to crack into the market-leadership ranks of hardware wallet makers, currently dominated by big names including Trezor and Ledger. But the overall market may be growing as more crypto investors seek out hardware wallets as an alternative to simply leaving coins on exchanges.\n\nOutsiders may scoff at the Q1\u2019s bulky, throwback user interface or UX, but Coinkite says it intentionally came up with that anachronistic design after consultations with users of its smaller, slimmer MK4.\n\nWay more ppl than I expected like the bulky-QWERTY-non-pocketable mountain-man-devices like we do. \ud83d\ude06 \u2014 NVK \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1e @nvk@nvk.org (@nvk) February 11, 2023\n\nThe exact size, weight and price of the Q1 will be confirmed in the near future, but eager users can already reserve the device with a $199 deposit. The retail price is not expected to be much higher than the deposit amount.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe Q1 was built mainly to help less advanced users,\u201d Celia Cherif, a Coinkite business development representative, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cWe gathered their feedback from the MK4 and made everything more UX friendly for them in the Q1.\u201d\n\nGrowing market for hardware wallets\n\nCoinkite\u2019s roots in the Bitcoin space go all the way back to 2011, when co-founders Rodolfo\n\nNovak and Peter Gray stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper and later built a rudimentary bitcoin hardware wallet. The pair eventually incorporated as Coinkite, and the firm now produces and sells a suite of hardware and software Bitcoin products, including the MK4, which Cherif says is Coinkite\u2019s best-selling product.\n\n\u201cColdcard sales have been higher than expected,\u201d Novak wrote in a tweet. Coinkite declined to provide CoinDesk with official sales data.\n\nLast year\u2019s implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange triggered an exodus of customers from centralized exchanges to self-custody devices.\n\nOne crypto publication reported that two of the largest players in the hardware wallet space \u2013 Trezor and Ledger \u2013 captured a significant share of those spooked customers in November. According to the publication, Trezor reported a 300% increase in week-over-week sales while Ledger saw a six-fold increase in account creations for Ledger Live, the firm\u2019s wallet management software.\n\nCoinkite also saw an uptick in sales, although it\u2019s not clear by how much. \u201cBitcoiners are so resolute on bitcoin and so many are getting off exchanges,\u201d Novak tweeted. \u201cIn all my years, I've never seen so much activity.\u201d\n\nConvenience and 'air-gapping'\n\nThe Q1\u2019s design revolves around convenience and security, especially \u201cair-gapping,\u201d which means isolating the device from potentially unsecured networks like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\n\nCherif says that some less-tech-savvy customers reported difficulties using the MK4. Many customers were fumbling to enter sensitive passphrases, struggling to scan bitcoin address QR codes, dealing with the hassle of connecting power cords and switching back and forth between microSD cards.\n\nWith that backdrop, Coinkite designed the Q1 to include two microSD slots for saving wallet seed phrases \u2013 a series of 12 to 24 random words used to \u201crecover\u201d or regain private keys in the case of accidental loss. The double microSD slots offer more secure data transfer than traditional USB-A connections (more commonly referred to as simply \u201cUSB\u201d), which Cherif says are vulnerable to all sorts of sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of vulnerabilities with USB data connectivity,\u201d Cherif explained. \u201cThere's a website created just to monitor all the known vulnerabilities. The list is never-ending. These are vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by malicious actors.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s engineers included both AAA batteries and the USB-C port as power sources for the Q1. Cherif also emphasized that the Q1\u2019s USB-C port is strictly reserved for power transmission and not data transfer.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to plug the USB-C cable into an Internet-connected device, it remains a much safer option than a USB cable because it doesn't have any data lines connected, only power,\u201d Cherif said.\n\nCoinkite added a flashlight to the Q1 so users can easily scan Bitcoin QR codes (encoded Bitcoin addresses) in dim lighting.\n\nThe wallet has an LED QR code scanner instead of a video camera-based version. Coinkite says the choice was deliberate because cameras, being more technologically complex, are more prone to malicious hacks.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, the camera is an attack vector,\u201d Cherif explained.\n\nA few Twitter users perusing details of the new device wondered out loud if the Q1\u2019s large color LCD screen is able to display Ordinals, a new type of on-chain Bitcoin non-fungible token (NFT).\n\nOrdinals will look great on that big screen. \u2014 Mike In Space! (@mikeinspace) February 9, 2023\n\nFor now, the answer is \u201cno,\u201d although Coinkite is collaborating with Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on a project that uses a different Coinkite product \u2013 the Satschip \u2013 for Ordinals provenance (using a Bitcoin private key to prove ownership of an Ordinals NFT).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals"

        "content": "Bitcoin was the only top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrency to gain in Tuesday morning trading in Asia in a market unsettled by regulators in the U.S. targeting digital asset companies. Paxos Trust Co. was ordered on Monday to stop issuing its U.S. dollar-pegged Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin by New York authorities and it reportedly faces an SEC investigation. BNB, the native currency of Binance the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, had the biggest drop on the list.\n\nSee related article: Paxos ordered to stop issuing Binance USD stablecoin: report\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 0.1% in the past 24 hours to US$21,800 at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is down 4.2% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Ether dropped 0.56 to US$1,506, posting a 6.8% weekly loss.\n\nBNB fell 5.9% to US$294.40, bringing weekly losses to 9.3%.\n\nThe New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos to stop issuing the BUSD stablecoin and the company received notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it may face an investigation as the regulator regards BUSD as an unregistered security, according to a Monday press release.\n\n\u201cPaxos categorically disagrees with the SEC staff because BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws,\u201d the firm said in the release.\n\nA stablecoin is a crypto token pegged to the value of an asset, in this case the U.S. dollar, and collateralized by the underlying asset. BUSD was co-developed by Paxos and the Binance exchange. The Ethereum-based stablecoin is issued and managed by Paxos.\n\nPaxos said the BUSD it issues is fully backed with U.S. dollar-denominated reserves and is fully segregated. Paxos reported about $16 billion in collateral backing BUSD as of Jan. 31.\n\nThe moves on Paxos by regulators follow the SEC slapping a US$30 million fine on the Kraken U.S.-based crypto exchange last week for what it called the illegal operation of a crypto staking program.\n\nThe actions by regulators unnerved some investors, with Polygon dropping 4.3% to trade at US$1.19, a loss of 0.3% for the past week. Solana fell 3.3% to US$20.78, a weekly loss of 8.4%.\n\nU.S. equities rose on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index both gained 1.1% while the Nasdaq Composite Index closed the day 1.4% higher.\n\nThe gains come ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January, a key measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve uses to set interest rates. Economists expect an 0.4% increase in the CPI for January from December, however, the year-on-year pace is slowing.\n\nThe CPI in December showed prices rose 6.5% year-on-year from the 7.1% recorded in November, which in turn declined from October\u2019s 7.7% and 8.2% in September.\n\nThe Fed, which has said it wants inflation back in the 2% range, has raised interest rates multiple times since last March to reverse the inflation surge. Analysts at the CME Group predict a more than 90% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a further 25 basis points at its meeting next month. U.S. interest rates are currently at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years, and Fed officials have repeatedly indicated they could raise rates to as high as 5%.\n\nSee related article: UAE central bank to issue CBDC, promote digital asset growth"

        "content": "In brief Bakkt is a custody service that stores Bitcoin in cold storage.\n\nThe platform provides a way for traditional investors to get involved in Bitcoin with US federal regulatory oversight.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe owner of the New York Stock Exchange wants to make Bitcoin mainstream. What counts as mainstream? Traditional and financial institutions. If you can get the old money to feel comfortable trading new money, you can bring a huge new wave of investors to the cryptocurrency game\u2014and maybe even stabilize it. That\u2019s the promise of Bakkt, which hopes to become the on-ramp of the institutional investor.\n\nWe learn more about it below.\n\nWhat is Bakkt?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt its core, Bakkt is a custody service that stores Bitcoin in a secure form, known as cold storage. It looks after large amounts of Bitcoin on behalf of institutional investors. Originally, the company serviced retail customers as well; they ceased this offering in February 2023. They said they will instead focus on direct interaction with businesses, providing them \u201cwith crypto and loyalty experiences for their customers through SaaS and API solutions.\u201d\n\nBakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). ICE then offers a Bakkt-branded Bitcoin futures product. This is where traders are able to bet on the rising or falling price of Bitcoin. All the Bitcoin used to back the trades is stored in Bakkt's secure custody.\n\nBakkt is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange. Image: Shutterstock.\n\nSo, Bakkt looks after the Bitcoin on behalf of ICE, which enables institutional investors to speculate on it in the form of futures trading. The combination provides institutions with the chance to buy and sell digital assets in a US federally regulated environment. That means they can experience the ease, volume, and security for Bitcoin that they already enjoy on traditional exchanges.\n\nWhat's relatively unique to Bakkt is that it allows for trades to be physically settled in Bitcoin, as opposed to cash. That means when a trade is finished, traders receive Bitcoin to their account. All of this Bitcoin is stored by Bakkt\u2014and it uses a separate ledger to record who owns what, rather than having to move the Bitcoin around all the time.\n\nWhen did Bakkt launch?\n\nBakkt was announced in August 2018, but didn't launch until September 23 2019. ICE, which created it, is run by Wall Street giant Jeffrey Sprecher, who also serves as the chairman of NYSE. Sprecher noticed that many traditional investors were itching to get involved in cryptocurrency, but they needed it to be packaged and regulated in the right way. So ICE created Bakkt to meet investor demand.\n\nHe originally appointed Kelly Loeffler as CEO of Bakkt, formerly the CMO of ICE, who left to become a US Senator in late 2019. She was succeeded by former PayPal vice president of engineering Mike Blandina, then ICE's associate general counsel David Clifton (as interim CEO), and finally former head of technology at Citi Gavin Michael.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBakkt's launch got off to a slow start. On its first day, the Bakkt Bitcoin futures offering saw just 71 Bitcoin traded, worth around $700,000 at the time. Trading has built up over time; during the last week of 2020\u2014a golden period for crypto in general\u2014Bakkt's Bitcoin futures reached a trading volume of $286 million.\n\nA brief history of Bakkt\n\nAugust 2018 \u2013 The Bakkt platform is announced by parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\n\n\u2013 The Bakkt platform is announced by parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) December 2018 - Bakkt raises $182.5 million in funding round\n\n- Bakkt raises $182.5 million in funding round September 2019 - Bakkt Bitcoin futures go live, trading is now open on ICE.\n\n- Bakkt Bitcoin futures go live, trading is now open on ICE. December 2019 - Bakkt launches Bitcoin monthly options and cash-settled Bitcoin futures.\n\n- Bakkt launches Bitcoin monthly options and cash-settled Bitcoin futures. January 2021 - Bakkt announces that it will go public.\n\n- Bakkt announces that it will go public. March 2021 - Bakkt receives a BitLicense in New York.\n\n- Bakkt receives a BitLicense in New York. February 2023 - Bakkt ceases its retail business.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?\n\nBakkt is still the new kid on the block, but it\u2019s already labeled as the way to make Bitcoin mainstream. Even titans Microsoft and Starbucks have thrown their weight behind it.\n\nThe platform provides a way for traditional investors to get involved in Bitcoin with the oversight of US federal regulation. The company is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for approval \u2013 which will bring requirements like compliance, anti-money laundering rules, and strict reporting standards.\n\nThat could be the assurance that big-time institutional investors need to finally dive in to crypto. The company has said its goal is to turn Bitcoin into the world\u2019s first worldwide currency.\n\nHow does Bakkt work?\n\nBakkt is a platform for institutional investors to buy, sell, and store digital assets on a global network. The idea is that Bakkt gives investors the chance to trade assets and futures based in Bitcoin the same way they would traditional currencies and commodities.\n\nBakkt also offers warehouse storage for the safekeeping of Bitcoin. Storing a customer\u2019s private keys \u201coffline\u201d adds layers of security and thwart hackers \u2013 bringing more peace of mind to traditional investors.\n\nThe platform has also come up with a way to tackle blockchain\u2019s biggest drawback: slow speed. Since a lot of the transactions will happen between customers with assets already stored in the warehouse, it isn\u2019t necessary to put every single movement on a blockchain. Anything that happens within the warehouse is recorded on Bakkt\u2019s own separate ledger. Only assets coming in or leaving the warehouse need to be on the blockchain.\n\nIn that sense, parent company CEO Sprecher says it operates \u201con a layer above the blockchain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat can you do with Bakkt?\n\nBakkt is a way for institutional investors to embrace Bitcoin in a way they\u2019ve never been able to before.\n\nBakkt claims to solve two fundamental problems that prevent Bitcoin from widespread acceptance.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Infrastructure - Bakkt\u2019s platform provides regulated infrastructure for buying and selling Bitcoin.\n\n- Bakkt\u2019s platform provides regulated infrastructure for buying and selling Bitcoin. \ud83d\udd0d Price discovery - Bakkt wants to create trusted, regulated price discovery\u2014finding a clear price across multiple exchanges\u2014so investors can have full confidence in buying and selling. If they do manage to crack it, Bakkt stands a high chance of luring the traditional investors they seek.\n\nThe future\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the New York Department of Financial Service (DFS) granted a BitLicense to Bakkt. This enables it to start operating in New York, opening up its custody services to a wider audience.\n\nBakkt is also planning to become a publicly-traded company. On January 11, it announced plans for a merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings in a deal that will result in a combined company called Bakkt Holdings, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This deal will value the newly created company at $2.1 billion."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite pushback from Bitcoin purists, Ordinals\u2014the NFT-like project on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014shows no signs of slowing, as over 76,400 inscriptions have been created to date. The number of Ordinals spiked on February 9, 2023, exceeding 20,800 inscriptions for the day, according to data from Dune.\n\nLaunched last month, Ordinals is the latest project aiming to bring NFTs into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Counterparty, launched in 2014, was the first project that introduced non-fungible tokens to Bitcoin with the Rare Pepes collection, followed by the 2017 launch of Stacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat distinguishes Ordinals from earlier projects is that the digital assets are inscribed directly onto satoshis, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin, without needing a sidechain or token.\n\nDevelopers have inscribed JPEGs, audio files, videos, and even video games to test the limits of what can go on the Bitcoin blockchain. While the total number of Bitcoin NFTs is unknown, the Ordinals website and Gamma, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Stacks, appear to point to several thousand minted on the network.\n\nBitcoin NFTs may be having a moment, but the technology is still in its infancy, especially when compared to Ethereum and Solana, which have had several years to perfect the minting, trading, and viewing of digital collectibles.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have been live for a few months now, but it\u2019s only really a week old in terms of mass adoption,\u201d Satoshibles developer Brian Laughlan told Decrypt on Discord. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while before we see general wallet support.\u201d Launched in 2021, Satoshibles is the first NFT Collection to bridge Ethereum NFTs with Bitcoin using Stacks.\n\nMany Bitcoiners, no matter what they say, are scrambling to mint a pre 100k inscription. Hilarious how people have 2 faces. Y\u2019all would all be served better to just maintain 1 face and be honest. It\u2019s a better life. \u2014 ck (going to Bitcoin 2023) (@ck_SNARKs) February 13, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Bitcoin Twitter continues to argue the merits of filling blocks with pictures and videos, Bitcoin miners are raking in a tidal wave in fees that topped $92,220 on February 12, 2023, for Ordinal transactions alone.\n\nUnsurprisingly, clones of popular NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have made their way to the Bitcoin Blockchain. On February 8, a single Ordinal Punk sold for 9.5 BTC, or nearly $215,000."

        "content": "On-chain analysis revealed that BTC has the potential to rally to $42,000 before the year runs out.\n\nIn the meantime, coin distribution exceeds accumulation.\n\nCurrently trading at its September 2022 level, CryptoQuant analyst Oinonen_t has opined that Bitcoin [BTC] \u201chas a significant chance to reach its fair price of $42K this year.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oinonen_t, an assessment of two on-chain indicators, namely BTC\u2019s exchange stablecoins ratio (ESR) and exchange reserves, confirmed the potential for a further price increase.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe analyst noted that BTC\u2019s ESR has surpassed a technical inflection point and is diverging from the spot price, which is a positive sign.\n\nAdditionally, BTC\u2019s exchange reserves have been in a long-term downtrend, reflecting entities holding their assets off-exchange, which the analyst referred to as a \u201chealthy development\u201d for the market.\n\nThese factors, along with the approaching 2024 halving event, indicate that BTC is moving toward a new pre-halving accumulation cycle, Oinonen_t concluded.\n\nAlso sharing a similar belief in a continued rally in BTC\u2019s price, another CryptoQuant analyst operating under the pseudonym Yonsei_dent assessed BTC\u2019s Supply in Profit metric and found that the current market has passed the Bottom Discovery phase and entered the Transition phase, which often precedes a potential for a bull market.\n\nHe found further that BTC\u2019s Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) on a 400-day moving average has reached the previous cycle\u2019s low, suggesting that further declines are unlikely.\n\n\u201cCompared to the time of entry into the 2019 bull market, it seems a bull transition is in the process of passing through the bottom. However, in the case of the 2015-2016 Bottom, Supply in Profit (%) went down after entering the Transition phase, and the Bottom period became longer. Since aSOPR 400MA reached the previous cycle\u2019s low, further declines are unlikely. However, there is a concern that the current situation will be prolonged unless it changes to a positive (+) slope,\u201d Yonsei_dent noted, adding a caveat.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nStay at alert\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC\u2019s price decreased by almost 5% in the last week. At press time, the king coin exchanged hands at $21,885.\n\nA daily chart assessment of price movements revealed a significant decline in BTC accumulation in the last week. At 1.74 million at the time of writing, the coin\u2019s On-balance Volume (OBV) had declined by 1% since February began.\n\nA steady fall in an asset\u2019s OBV indicates that there is decreased buying pressure and increased selling pressure, suggesting that market participants are becoming more bearish on the asset. This can signify potential downward price movement, as there is less demand for the asset.\n\nThe position of BTC\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) confirmed where market sentiment rested. At negative -0.07 at press time, more investors took to distributing their BTC holdings rather than holding on to them. A continued downtrend in BTC\u2019s CMF might be followed by a price drawback. Hence, caution is advised."

        "content": "Australia-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Iris Energy has revealed it will nearly triple its mining capacity with the addition of thousands of mining rigs.\n\nOn Feb. 13 the firm said it purchased an additional 4.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) worth of Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro ASIC miners, bringing its self-mining capacity to 5.5 EH/s from 2.0 EH/s.\n\nBased on the S19j Pro\u2019s maximum hash rate of 100 terahashes per second (TH/s), the purchase adds an estimated 44,000 miners to its fleet, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s calculations.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Iris\u2019 co-founder and co-CEO, said the purchase \u201cis a significant milestone\u201d for the company, adding it has been a \u201cchallenging period for both the industry and markets more generally.\u201d\n\nIris said the new miners will be installed in the company\u2019s centers but did not mention in which locations. The firm operates three facilities in various locations in British Columbia, Canada and one in Texas in the United States.\n\nIris\u2019 flagship site in Mackenzie, British Columbia. Source: Iris Energy\n\nThe company used $67 million of remaining prepayments to ASIC miner manufacturer Bitmain to fund the purchase of the rigs \u201cwithout any additional cash outlay.\u201d\n\nIris had a 10 EH/s contract with Bitmain which it says \u201chave been fully resolved, with no remaining commitments.\u201d It stated it remains debt free.\n\nThe firm said it\u2019s also considering options to sell surplus miners above its 5.5 EH/s of mining capacity to re-invest the funds.\n\nRelated: Core Scientific to hand over 27K rigs to pay $38M debt\n\nLast November the company was forced to unplug miners used as collateral on a $107.8 million loan, as the units were producing \u201cinsufficient cash flow to service their respective debt financing obligations.\u201d\n\nOver the past few months, cryptocurrency miners have been squeezed from multiple directions, having to confront low Bitcoin prices amid high hash rates, high mining difficulty and high energy prices.\n\nThe pressure caused publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies to sell off almost all of the BTC mined throughout 2022 with data from blockchain research firm Messari showing Iris sold around 100% of the nearly 2,500 BTC it mined that year.\n\nA February analysis from Hashrate Index shows that publicly listed miners increased their production in January with better weather and stable electricity prices helping the production surge. Iris\u2019 January production resulted in 172 BTC, compared to 123 BTC in December."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies That Are Down 33% to 71% and Ready to Pop - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market is back to its volatile old ways again. The relentless downtrend of 2022 gave way to some strong gains in January, but the market's general trend is headed sideways these days. The leading crypto names are up one week and down the next.\n\nThat being said, I am convinced that digital currencies will disrupt many industries over the next few years, from banking and financial services to online games and insurance. Therefore, I see this dip as a great time to separate the wheat from the chaff and pick up high-quality cryptocurrencies on the cheap.\n\nSo let's push through the throng of lesser lights and wannabes to find some top cryptocurrencies on fire sale in February 2023. The crypto names below are down by at least 33% over the last year. Still, they have some seriously valuable real-world use cases, and with a bit of patience, they're sure to regain their worth in the long run.\n\nBitcoin: The massive granddaddy\n\nLet's start with the digital elephant in the room. Bitcoin (BTC 1.56%) set the standard for what a cryptocurrency can be, and it remains the largest and most respected crypto name 14 years later.\n\nBitcoin's price is down 50% in the last 52 weeks but also up 38% from last year's rock bottom in November. Many experts agree that the long-term price target is far above today's modest price.\n\nFor example, noted growth investor Cathie Wood and her ARK Invest firm recently reminded investors that Bitcoin should be worth nearly $1.5 million per coin in the year 2030. The reason for that parabolic price gain is that Wood expects demand for Bitcoin to skyrocket while the lifetime supply is capped at 21 million Bitcoins. Nearly 92% of that limited supply has already been minted by Bitcoin miners, so there is not much room for inflation.\n\nAnd if you look to MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) chairman Michael Saylor, you'll get not a firm price target but a pretty solid analysis of what's next for the largest cryptocurrency. Over the next four to eight years, Saylor expects the regulatory framework around crypto to be straightened out, allowing large-scale institutional investors to get involved.\n\nBased on this projection, Saylor's MicroStrategy is going all-in on Bitcoin. The data analytics company has converted essentially all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin, taking out loans and selling stock in order to grab more digital tokens. The company even took out a $205 million loan from Silvergate Capital (SI), collateralized by some of MicroStrategy's existing Bitcoin holdings, for the sole purpose of purchasing another bunch of Bitcoins.\n\nWhether you call it \"skin in the game\" or \"bias,\" Saylor's company is voting with its wallet.\n\nThe company now holds approximately 132,500 Bitcoin tokens, worth roughly $2.88 billion at today's price. That's 55% of MicroStrategy's enterprise value and almost more than the company's current market cap. If Bitcoin goes bust in the future, so will MicroStrategy. But if it reaches Cathie Wood's 2030 target price, MicroStrategy's current tokens would be worth $196 billion (and I'm sure the company will buy more Bitcoin along the way).\n\nSo two smart people agree that Bitcoin has a bright future. They can still be wrong, and some other cryptocurrency might steal Bitcoin's thunder over the next few years, but it's not easy to disrupt a first mover with this much of a head start. The \"digital gold\" looks ready to live up to its nickname in the next few years, and this dip seems like a good time to pick up tokens at a low price.\n\nLitecoin: A more practical take on Bitcoin\n\nWhere Bitcoin goes, Litecoin (LTC -1.52%) will follow. Litecoin started out in 2011 as a tweaked clone of Bitcoin. Some of the key differences are:\n\nLitecoin generates new data blocks more often than Bitcoin does.\n\nAs a result, new transactions on the blockchain ledger are validated faster and with lower transaction fees.\n\nIts mining algorithm was explicitly chosen for its high processing rate using consumer-grade graphics cards instead of specially designed cryptomining chips.\n\nLitecoin's quick and cheap transactions make it more useful for everyday retail use than Bitcoin. It's like whipping out a quick-and-easy debit card instead of Bitcoin's proverbial gold nuggets. As a result, the smaller Litecoin community has drummed up payment support from more than 5,000 e-commerce stores and services. That's fewer than Bitcoin's 12,000 merchants but far ahead of most other altcoins.\n\nThe coin crashed hard last year, partly due to a controversial privacy upgrade known as Mimblewimble. The code change led to regulators banning Litecoin in markets like Thailand and South Korea. However, most of the crypto world is still comfortable with allowing Litecoin trades, and the coin is widely available on popular exchanges such as Coinbase Global and Robinhood Markets.\n\nThe South Korean panic did not trigger a wave of Litecoin bans in other markets, and investors are starting to relax those tightly bunched nerves. All told, the Litecoin token is down 33% over the last year and should see stellar returns from this low point.\n\nPolkadot: Knitting a Web3 fabric from other cryptos\n\nI can't end this list in good conscience without including Polkadot (DOT 3.88%). It's the cryptocurrency at the heart of the Web3 sea change, destined to soar as the next-generation version of the internet takes over from the mishmash of ad-supported social networks you see in the current Web 2.0 model.\n\nWith smart contracts, bankless peer-to-peer value-exchange transactions, and transparent content-publishing systems, Web3 is ready to turn the online publishing and e-commerce worlds upside down. As the official blockchain network of the Web3 Foundation, giving developers easy ways to tie the strengths of many different cryptocurrencies and blockchains into a cohesive application, Polkadot will surely gain boatloads of value as the revolution plays out.\n\nYet the Polkadot token's price is down by 70% in 52 weeks. It is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of $7.06 billion, just ahead of Litecoin at $6.56 billion but far behind Bitcoin's dominant $419 billion footprint. Thanks to Polkadot's special and uniquely useful place in the Web3 ecosystem, I expect the token to start rubbing shoulders with Bitcoin and friends over the next couple of years. The opportunity for outsized growth is too obvious to ignore, and I take every chance I get to help you see it.\n\nSo if I could suggest only one cryptocurrency in today's market, my choice would depend on what you want your investment to achieve.\n\nBitcoin is the safe-as-houses (in a digital sense) bet on long-term value storage.\n\nLitecoin is more of a digital dollar, to be used in everyday shopping transactions -- more liquid but perhaps more volatile in the long run.\n\nAnd Polkadot plays a completely different game, serving up a brand-new vision of what the internet can be.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've been holding on to my Litecoin and Bitcoin lately while buying several batches of additional Polkadot. I can't wait for Web3 systems to go mainstream in a big way, so I'm doing what I can to take advantage of that upcoming metamorphosis."

        "title": "Bitcoin ordinals pump and dump using stolen images and copyright - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions using ordinals are becoming increasingly popular. As the hype cycle begins for the \u201cNFTs on Bitcoin\u201d movement, profiteering ordinals pump groups have quickly sprung into action.\n\nAlthough NFTs have existed on Bitcoin for years via OP_RETURN data and Counterparty, Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor\u2019s new ordinals project makes it possible to inscribe an unprecedented 3.9 megabytes of data into each Bitcoin block. The resulting inscription often takes the form of an NFT-like picture, audio file, video, or even computer game. Similar to an NFT, this inscription can be traded and passed along to other Bitcoin wallets.\n\nInscriptions endow normally fungible satoshis \u2014 the smallest denomination of bitcoin; one bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis \u2014 with numismatic value. In other words, inscriptions give certain satoshis extra value* (see footnote).\n\nOne inscription recently sold for a stunning 9.5 bitcoin, or over $200,000 in extra, numismatic value.\n\nSome inscriptions are harmless jokes, others are artwork, a few take the form of censorship-resistant speech, but most are hyped NFT collections. Many inscribe stolen images \u2014 including copyrighted media.\n\nRead more: NFT wash trade accounts for 6.5% of daily sales volume on OpenSea\n\nLet the ordinals pump and dump begin\n\nWith so much profit sloshing around just weeks into Rodarmor\u2019s unveiling of Ordinals.com, promoters smell money. OpenSea NFT promoters from the 2021 hype cycle are now hawking Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\nOf course, pump-and-dump groups are nothing new in digital asset history. Thousands exist on Telegram and Discord. If you see a small altcoin suddenly rallying and then crashing within a few minutes, you\u2019re probably watching a pump and dump.\n\nShielded behind usernames, VPNs, and ephemeral messages, ordinals pump organizers on Telegram or Discord often use pseudonyms, buy followers and engagement to appear credible, or even mask their web traffic with Tor.\n\nExamples of ordinals inscription projects\n\nAlthough Telegram and Twitter are gaining activity, ordinals pump groups are most active on Discord. One group with thousands of members claimed that they could \u201cfront-run whales\u201d and make sure paying members profit \u201cno matter what.\u201d\n\nJust days into the Ordinals project, there are already tens of thousands of inscriptions. Many of them are created by administrators of NFT projects, including:\n\nOrdinal Punks\n\nOrdinal Loops\n\nOrdinal Cubes\n\nOrdinal Shards\n\nOrdinal Diamonds\n\nOrdinal Tulips\n\nOrdinal Eggs\n\nOrdinal Penguins\n\nOrdinauts\n\nBitcoin Rocks\n\nBitcoin Punks\n\nBitcoin Toadz\n\nBitcoin Boos\n\nBitcoin Punks\n\nBitcoinShrooms\n\nInscribed Peps\n\nSeveral of these projects have simply stolen images from Ethereum-based NFTs. Marquee projects like CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, EtherRocks, and others have already been inscribed from Ethereum onto Bitcoin numerous times \u2014 without their owners\u2019 permission.\n\nOther projects are inscribing trademarked and copyrighted content. For example, BitcoinShrooms seems to be pushing its luck with promotional material including a recognizable Linux mascot, a copyrighted Wall-E character, and a copyrighted Pac-Man ghost. Its Twitter account indicated that its sale was not open yet.\n\nAcross all of the projects, the focus of administrators is rarely about art and almost always about profitably selling and re-selling NFTs. Many administrators make overt claims about price predictions, profit potential, BitClout-like bonding curves, and their entrepreneurial efforts to add additional \u201cvalue\u201d to their NFT-based enterprise.\n\nOf course, some people were less than thrilled with the idea of paying an inflated price for essentially a dressed-up satoshi. Some of them equated inscriptions with the NFT fad of 2021 whose volumes quickly declined -99%.\n\nWhich ordinals offerings are securities offerings?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the US Justice Department considers pump-and-dump schemes a form of fraud. The department regularly files charges against the organizers of these rings. Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warns against pump-and-dump schemes because their organizers typically misrepresent why an asset is surging in price in order to dump their holdings at an inflated price.\n\nSecurities laws exist to force issuers to disclose risks. Obviously, it is easier to withhold information to make an offering more appealing. However, regulators like the SEC enforce disclosure so that investors have enough information to make an informed decision.\n\nOf course, promoters of NFTs and inscriptions often claim that they not securities. Therefore, in their opinion, information disclosure regulations must not apply.\n\nNevertheless, almost anything \u2014 including orange grove parcels \u2014 can be sold as a security in what is known as an investment contract.\n\nAn investment contract exists when a promoter sells anything \u2014 even a non-security \u2014 when purchasers invest money into a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others. When sold in this way, the investment contract is, itself, a security. In other words, the offering of a non-security can be a securities offering.\n\nRead more: Ripple says SEC lawsuit could end in weeks \u2014 don\u2019t hold your breath\n\nIn the same way, many promoters are selling inscriptions in a way that makes their offering a securities offering. For example, one administrator claimed, \u201cIt will be our job to make sure we give you more than what you pay for. So, no matter what, everyone will end up in profit, because of what we are working on giving our holders.\u201d That promise seems dangerously close to the SEC\u2019s Howey Test. If an offering passes that test, it is a security.\n\nMain takeaway\n\nInscriptions bring back an old argument about adding data that has nothing to do with payments to the Bitcoin blockchain. Because they don\u2019t have a formal marketplace like OpenSea yet, they\u2019re more vulnerable to potential fraud, including pump-and-dump schemes that can dump satoshis with extra data on unsuspecting buyers.\n\n* (On a mathematical note, it becomes parabolically difficult to trace individual satoshis within UTXO sets as they process through multi-output transactions. In other words, it\u2019s computationally prohibitive to actually trace most satoshis in existence. Although satoshis are neatly ordered within newly mined blocks, as satoshis pass through multi-output transactions, their position within each UTXO set mixes. In launching his Ordinals project, what Rodarmor has actually contrived is an off-blockchain convention wherein participants, in his words, \u201cpretend\u201d to track satoshis. He makes several assumptions of convenience about where satoshis are located within UTXO sets post-transaction and assigns ordinals to his hypothetical ordering, despite the impossibility of knowing where satoshis are actually located after several multi-output transactions. Notwithstanding this arbitrary ordering system, Rodarmor has indeed combined a novel schematic using SegWit\u2019s witness data discount, Taproot signatures, and Ordinal theory to introduce NFT-like inscriptions into the Bitcoin network.)\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThis pattern, which suggests the formation of a long-term bottom, is characterized by the crossing or overlapping of the 200-day moving average and the realized price, moving from the top to the bottom. This pattern was observed in 2019, 2015, and 2012, after which BTC experienced a long-term upward trend.\n\nAccording to Grizzly, in these highly inflationary times, the predicted long-term upward trend might follow if BTC detaches from assets such as equities and acts as a store of value.\n\nAnother analyst Baro Virtual considered BTC\u2019s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss ratio (NUPL). The analyst found that the current market situation was similar to the NUPL index movement in the spring of 2019 when it broke its 365-day moving average and BTC experienced strong bullish momentum.\n\nHowever, after encountering rejection at the medium-term resistance range of 0.15-0.25, BTC\u2019s NUPL index tested its 365-day moving average, which served as support.\n\nAccording to Baro Virtual, a successful hold of the 365-day MA and overcoming the resistance range could lead to solid bullish momentum.\n\nFor the upward break to happen, BTC\u2019s price has to \u201cdecouple\u201d from the broader financial markets, Baro Virtual opined. He further stated,\n\n\u201cAlso very important is the question of whether there will be a final decoupling of Bitcoin and the US stock market in the current cycle or whether Bitcoin will become a hostage to traditional macroeconomic indicators.\u201d\n\nBTC market refuses to cut ties with traditional markets\n\nOn 1 February, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the smallest interest rate adjustment since March. On this news, BTC\u2019s and ETH\u2019s prices fell slightly by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIt is no longer news that BTC\u2019s price exhibits high sensitivity to announcements such as inflation data or changes in Federal Reserve interest rates.\n\nIn fact, in the last year, BTC\u2019s price reacted each time interest rates were hiked.\n\nDuring the recent Federal Reserve meeting, the Fed Chair, Jerome H. Powell, indicated that \u201ca couple more\u201d interest rate increases were being considered to ensure that inflationary pressures are effectively contained.\n\nIf history is anything to go by, one can expect BTC\u2019s price to react to any further interest rate hikes as the year progresses."

Because Ordinals lack smart contract support and programmability, many in the Stacks community see its rise as an overall benefit to Bitcoin sidechain developers.\n\n\"There's a lot of limit to how much data you can put in an Ordinal store, and that's really where we see Stacks is going to come in and really expand,\" Miller said, adding that Ordinals has proven that there's massive demand to be able to use NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals is also still in its early stages, and lacks several key features for long-term growth. These include a seamless way to inscribe Ordinals without the need to sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain, marketplaces to buy and sell digital artifacts, and wallets that allow collectors to see their Ordinals\u2014something Hiro and other developers are working furiously to launch.\n\nWe\u2019ve begun rolling out support to Hiro Wallet for Bitcoin, NFTs and Ordinals for a truly cross-protocol Bitcoin Web3 experience. https://t.co/OAVriTraFq \ud83e\uddf5 A thread with details\u2026 #bitcoin #web3 #stx #nfts #ordinals pic.twitter.com/SiWrIluFhk \u2014 Mark Hendrickson | mark.btc | Hiro Wallet (@markymark) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cThe Stacks community have been saying for so long that things should be getting built on Bitcoin,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cBecause it is the most trusted thing that\u2019s been around the longest, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nDespite the excitement around Ordinals, Miller did acknowledge that the Bitcoin blockchain was not meant to be used this way, noting the lack of programmability of the blockchain, as opposed to Ethereum, which has programmability built in.\n\nEthereum NFTs are still early in their lifecycle as well, Miller notes, and says he does not see Ordinals as a challenge to Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the NFT space. However, he does say that the on-chain data storage will make the Bitcoin blockchain a popular place to inscribe important information like deeds, real estate transactions, or government documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that [Ordinals] are going to be a one-for-one replacement for Ethereum NFTs,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t think the fact that they\u2019re different is going to be an imposition for it\u2014I think it\u2019s going to be an asset.\u201d"

The biggest producer of BTC was Core Scientific, who mined 1,527 coins in January, followed closely by Riot, who produced 740 Bitcoins in the same period.\n\nMarathon and Cipher have experienced substantial growth in their production of Bitcoin, with 687 and 343 Bitcoins produced, respectively, compared to their previous month's production of 475 and 225 Bitcoins in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Jaran Mellerud, a Bitcoin mining analyst, the favourable weather conditions in January, and stable electricity prices played a role in the increase of production by miners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud explained that a winter storm in December affected North America and led to high electricity prices, which forced many mining companies to reduce their operations. However, with the improved weather in January, the electricity prices stabilised, allowing the miners to maintain higher levels of operation and produce more Bitcoins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hash rate of most public miners increased in January, but the pace of increase was slower than anticipated. The only exception was Cipher, a Texas-based company, which significantly increased its hash rate by over 50 percent to 4.3 EH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud noted that Cipher has been working hard during the current bear market, and he predicts that the company will reach its target of 6 EH/s of self-mining capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanSpark also increased its hash rate to 6.6 EH/s, up from 6.2 EH/s in December, due to a number of acquisitions made in late 2022. Hive also showed growth in January, with its hash rate rising nearly 30 percent from 2.1 to 2.7 EH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMellerud explained that Hive is continuously replacing its GPU fleet with ASICs, particularly with its in-house designed Buzzminers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Scientific also saw an increase in its hash rate, reaching 17 EH/s in January from 15.7 in December. However, the company's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings are expected to have an effect on these figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proceedings include an agreement with the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) to pay off a debt of $38.6 million by transferring over 27,000 mining machines used as collateral, which represents 18 percent of Core Scientific's rigs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "Sometimes no bad news is seen as good news, too. While the year gone by witnessed a series of setbacks for cryptocurrencies including 30 percent capital gains tax , the New Year is ushering in positivity and hope for crypto investors.\n\nIncidentally, there was no negative commentary around digital currencies in the Budget 2023 , and their prices have also witnessed a significant jump in the past couple of months.\n\nA report by Reuters , while relying on the options trading data, asserts that bitcoin and ether have recovered noticeably in the recent past.\n\nThe report states that the total volume of bitcoin and ethereum options jumped significantly on Deribit in January against the previous month.\n\nIn the past three months, bitcoin prices have recovered by over 25 percent to hit $23,193 on Wednesday at 8.50 GMT. At the same time, the overall market capitalisation of crypto tokens crossed $1 trillion again, shows the CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEven the second most popular cryptocurrency Ethereum recovered by 52 percent from $1,100 on Nov 9 to hover around $1,671 on Wednesday, the CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nEther has reported a rise of 52 percent in the past three months, shows the CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe Binance Coin also witnessed a jump of 23.7 percent in its price in the past three months from $266.85 on Nov 9 to $330 on Wednesday.\n\nOther crypto tokens have also been trading higher than their previous close.\n\nRipple trades at $0.399 at 9 am GMT, nearly one percent higher than its previous close, Aptos rose 3.14 percent to trade at $15.77, Cardano rose 2.59 percent to trade at $0.397 and dogecoin trades 0.38% higher on Wednesday to trade at $0.09.\n\nPolygon rose 4.45 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at $1.28 and Solana rose 1.4 percent to trade around $23.64 on Wednesday.\n\nBack to business\n\nWazirX, which had earlier stopped accepting fresh cash deposits on its platform, has resumed accepting them, as confirmed by an email sent to its customers on Jan 27.\n\nHowever, the deposits can be made by investors only via RTGS, NEFT or IMPS and not via UPI.\n\nDuring the time when fresh cash deposits were barred, the crypto platform gave the option of peer-to-peer trading to investors wherein they could directly transfer money to the potential seller.\n\nOnce investors deposit money into their accounts, the option of P2P trading will automatically get disabled, reads the email referred to above.\n\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder and CEO, CoinSwitch, says the massive jump in crypto prices has led to 3 times increase in weekly investing activity since January.\n\n\"The crypto market has rebounded significantly since the turn of the year, with Bitcoin rising nearly 40% and other coins even more. Now, retail investment behavior, both in traditional and crypto markets, is momentum-based\u2014investing more when prices are rising, and fewer when they are falling. As such, we have been witnessing a rise in weekly investing activity since January\u2014over 3X, and this trend has continued through the Budget week. It is, therefore, not right to attribute this activity to the Budget alone,\" said Mr Singhal.\n\nHowever, Gaurav Mehta, Founder of Catax \u2013 Simple Crypto Taxes, believes that the overall outlook for cryptocurrencies is still gloomy, and there is no favourable climate for retail investors.\n\n\u201cThe absence of negative news in the budget should not be interpreted as a signal to purchase despite the current bull run, particularly for retail investors, given the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies and the absence of coverage in the budget. Industry has spoken out against 1% TDS, 30% tax, and the inability to deduct losses, but government has continued with implemented policy,\u201d said Mr Mehta.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder & CEO, CREBACO, believes the environment for crypto currencies is still quite gloomy in India with most exchanges on the verge of shutting their businesses.\n\n\u201cVolumes have dropped by 97%. One of the largest exchanges in India is struggling with international exchange. No new money is coming in and the liquidity in the INR order booking is running dry. The government must regulate or the industry in India will see its end soon\u201d said Mr Sogani."

        "content": "Bitcoin is creating a new economy with the \u201cInternet of Value\u201d concept: monetizing data itself and returning power to users. As terabytes of new information flow onto the network every hour, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how data on the BSV blockchain could be filtered and searched. JungleBus, by GorillaPool, has created the concept of the indexing subscription service. In a video workshop, Kurt Wuckert Jr. and Luke Rohenaz explain why the world needs indexing so badly and how JungleBus can solve the problem.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s looked in dismay at their ever-expanding digital photo folder can understand the need for a reliable indexer. Decades of images, recorded by the time taken but with nothing else to identify them other than the image itself\u2014 looking for something specific can be a nightmare. Now imagine all the world\u2019s data recorded and stored by timestamp alone\u2014it\u2019s orderly, but unusable without some kind of indexing and the ability to search using different parameters.\n\nTo explain JungleBus, you must first explain (the real) Bitcoin\n\nJungleBus is an indexing engine that filters raw data from the blockchain and serves it back out in a useful format so that applications can use Bitcoin data in their apps or go so far as to build an entire overlay network to replace the internet itself.\n\nDid you get all that? It might sound like a bit much at first. The workshop is aimed not only at existing Bitcoin users but also newcomers, so Wuckert spends the first segment explaining what Bitcoin is really about, the problems it could solve, and some fundamentals about how it works.\n\n\u201cMore than just a payments network or an investment opportunity, Bitcoin is the Internet of Value,\u201d he states.\n\nWith Bitcoin, it\u2019s possible to create a worldwide peer-to-peer network able to secure and transact unique data items without the risk of \u201cdouble-spends\u201d or duplicates. Peer-to-peer is a more efficient way to scale the network than simply broadcasting all transactions to everyone, and proof-of-work (PoW) is the superior economic incentive model to keep all this secure and trustable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a brilliance to the power of communication, and Bitcoin is just economic communication. Bitcoin allows you to add value to every bit or byte of data that crosses the network,\u201d Wuckert remarks.\n\nData becomes more valuable as it becomes more ubiquitous, and over a trillion megabytes of data are created globally daily. Right now, the ones profiting from that data proliferation are Silicon Valley megacorps and online service providers, who use the information users upload to increase their own wealth, power, and influence (at users\u2019 expense).\n\nAs for networks like BTC, their participants have become too absorbed in downstream issues like libertarianism and speculative investment, which in turn has influenced those networks\u2019 development approach. Bitcoin (BSV), on the other hand, is more interested in creating new economies by monetizing data itself. It also hands ownership of that data back to those who create and/or own it: the users.\n\nBlockchain doesn\u2019t magically solve all these problems by itself, though, and there are some shortcomings.\n\n\u201cThe blockchain is just a giant bucket of unsorted data,\u201d Wuckert says, or \u201ca monolithic database.\u201d And here\u2019s where JungleBus comes in. How do you index, categorize, and identify the terabytes (or more) of new data Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processors record onto the network every day? How can you ever know what data is important and what can be ignored? How do we filter it, find out (for example) what data are payments, what are jpegs or audio files, what are tokens or scripts, or personal and business records?\n\nAs a mining pool, GorillaPool is running some of the most powerful nodes in the history of Bitcoin. They operate in large data centers, with 10GB connections, with the ability to process some of Bitcoin\u2019s largest-size blocks with minimum-possible latency.\n\nIt\u2019s quite challenging to set up and operate your own full node. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary for an application developer to take on the role of infrastructure manager just to keep it working. After all, it isn\u2019t necessary to run your own ISP to build an application on today\u2019s internet.\n\n\u201cJungleBus is essentially a piece of middleware that allows you to bootstrap an overlay network of just your (own) data,\u201d Wuckert shares. It\u2019s an interface to identify and filter only the data relevant to you and your project. Instead of verifying the entire world\u2019s random data stream, you can verify only your own and verify its provenance just as securely as if you were checking everything. JungleBus indexes data directly from Bitcoin miners (transaction processors), which Wuckert calls \u201cdirectly to the metal\u201d and is more reliable and scalable than existing index databases that communicate through their providers\u2019 servers.\n\nJungleBus allows developers to set up their own companies and services for a handful of dollars, rather than the six-figure or more sums associated with trying to verify transactions on your own full node operation.\n\nHow does JungleBus work?\n\nLuke Rohenaz then takes over leading the workshop to explain JungleBus\u2019 inner workings and use cases in more specific detail.\n\n\u201cWhere JungleBus really shines is with cross-platform interoperability,\u201d he says. He explains that it works as a back-end to the API that powers your applications and is not something you connect directly to the app itself. A single JungleBus subscription powers one app\u2014users don\u2019t have to use APIs to check data.\n\nJungleBus does the \u201cdeep inspection\u201d on transaction outputs to identify and flag data/protocol types. From that analysis, it can create a feed that can categorize data of interest across multiple different services. Rohenaz demonstrates the currently-supported data reference or media types, which include BAP (Bitcoin Attestation Protocol), RUN, MAP, BITCOIN, and B, among others. Subscribing users can configure their own dashboards with a selection of fields to follow and verify only relevant transaction data.\n\nJungleBus works in real-time and can even check data in mempool transactions (meaning even txs that haven\u2019t yet been processed), and it also allows for blockchain \u201cre-orgs\u201d and other errors. For developers, Rohenaz shows how to configure and code a subscription based on raw transaction data, using data across services like BitChat and BlockPost as examples.\n\nRohenaz describes all this as \u201ca big blue open sea of opportunity for anyone who wants to build interoperable apps\u201d and hints at an upcoming hackathon next month to explore new ideas. To kick this off, he suggests some possibilities. Watch Wuckert and Rohenaz\u2019s workshop in the video above, and start thinking of exciting ways you\u2019d like to organize the world\u2019s data.\n\nWatch: Build on Blockchain \u2013 Common Challenges & Tools to Make it Easier\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Top 10 Ways to Make Money with Cryptocurrency in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The top ways to make money with Cryptocurrency in 2023 are mainly from investing, trading, and staking\n\nIntro: Cryptocurrency has been around for more than a decade and is rapidly becoming a popular way to make money online. The cryptocurrency market is extremely lucrative. There are numerous ways to make money in cryptocurrency, ranging from investing to active trading to staking.\n\nCryptocurrency is a decentralized payment method that can be used to conduct online transactions. The market, on the other hand, is flooded with the top cryptocurrencies to invest in, ranging from the well-known Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. With the recent increase in the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, an increasing number of people are seeking ways to profit from this new digital asset. The blockchain is the digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions. Transactions are processed on a blockchain network comprised of thousands of machines, and owners can earn cryptocurrencies in exchange for the efforts of these machines.\n\nHere are top 10 Ways to make money with Cryptocurrency in 2023:\n\n1. Investing\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is an excellent way to profit from it. You can buy individual coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or you can buy a cryptocurrency index fund. This is an excellent method for diversifying your portfolio and spreading your risk. When investing in cryptocurrency, make it a point to thoroughly research and comprehend the risks involved.\n\n2. Lending\n\nAnother way to monetize cryptocurrency is through lending. It entails lending your cryptocurrency to another person in exchange for interest. The interest rate you receive will be determined by the type of cryptocurrency you lend and the amount you lend. There are different types of lending platforms such as Decentralised lending platforms (DLP), Centralized, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending.\n\n3. Trading\n\nInvesting is a long-term endeavour based on a buy-and-hold strategy, whereas trading takes advantage of short-term opportunities. The cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. In a nutshell, asset prices can rise or fall dramatically in a short period of time. To be a successful trader, you must have strong technical and analytical skills.\n\nAnother way to make money is by trading cryptocurrency pairs such as BTC USDT based on market trends and technical analysis. This involves studying charts and using indicators to predict future price movements.\n\n4. Mining\n\nMining is the most common way to make money with cryptocurrency. Mining validates blockchain transactions and adds new data blocks to the chain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency as a result of their efforts. Mining can be done with either specialised hardware or cloud mining services. Cloud mining does not require the purchase or maintenance of hardware, but the rewards are typically lower than with hardware mining.\n\n5. Staking\n\nCrypto staking is a method of investing in cryptocurrency that entails keeping a set number of coins in your wallet for a set period of time. As a result, your crypto investments can generate passive income. The amount of interest you can earn is determined by the cryptocurrency and the number of coins you stake.\n\n6. Traditional Buy and Hold\n\nGetting crypto assets of choice from a crypto exchange and purchasing more when prices drop traditionally are called \u201cBuying the dip\u201d. The asset may be sold months or years later at a significant overall profit compared to the purchase price. Coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin rise and fall on a daily basis. Because of the hype, new coins like Chia are more likely to debut at a higher price. It later loses value and takes a long time to recover.\n\n7. Earning Interest\n\nCryptocurrency can help you earn interest on your investments. It is accomplished through a \u201cyield farming process,\u201d in which you lend your cryptocurrency to a platform in exchange for interest. While potentially risky, yield farming can be a great source of passive income. The amount of interest you earn is solely determined by the platform and the type of cryptocurrency you lend.\n\n8. Affiliate Programs\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges have affiliate programmes that allow to earn commissions on customers you refer. This is an excellent way to profit from cryptocurrency without having to engage in any trading or investing. Affiliate programmes can be extremely competitive.\n\n9. Dividends\n\nDividends are another way to make money with your crypto assets. If you\u2019re familiar with investing in stocks or bonds, you\u2019re probably aware of the concept of dividends. Dividends are small cash payments made to shareholders, to put it simply. If a company makes profits for a quarter, those profits are split and returned to the company\u2019s ownership (shareholders).\n\n10. Airdrops\n\nAirdrops are an excellent way for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to obtain free tokens without investing any money. Airdrops, unlike traditional sales and token launches, do not require users to make a deposit or spend any money upfront. Sharing project information on social media, joining an online community, or completing simple tasks like watching an educational video are examples of these steps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Uncertain regulations in the region have made it rather challenging for these assets to survive. Despite being one of the most powerful countries in the world, cryptocurrencies are crumbling in the U.S. It looks like the industry could be enduring a few more hardships in the region.\n\nEarlier today, President Joe Biden named Lael Brainard as his top economic advisor.

Through this transition, Brainard would reportedly advise Biden\u2019s administration on multibillion-dollar economic agenda. This includes the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act which are pertinent in the country.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community wasn\u2019t very happy about this change. This was mostly because \u201cBrainard hates Bitcoin.\u201d Right after this news broke out, several in the industry pointed out how this could be detrimental to the digital asset sector.\n\nBrainard hates Bitcoin\n\n\n\nI watched her spread misinformation about Bitcoin in front of a large student audience at Stanford in February 2020\n\n\n\nWill be interesting to see what happens next\u2026 https://t.co/yNUMBJ8HVV February 14, 2023\n\nLast year, Brainard listed out the possible perils of the crypto-verse. Along with this, she implied that the market should be regulated before it looms as a threat to the financial system. She previously stated,\n\n\u201cDespite significant investor losses, the crypto financial system does not yet appear to be so large or so interconnected with the traditional financial system as to pose a systemic risk. This is the right time to establish which crypto activities are permissible for regulated entities and under what constraints so that spillovers to the core financial system remain well contained.\u201d\n\nShe repeated the same thing during a speech in London last July.\n\nWill the Digital Dollar sideline Bitcoin?\n\nDespite her distaste towards Bitcoin, Brainard has been a proponent of the Digital Dollar or the U.S. CBDC. Time and again, she has put forth the benefits of rolling out CBDC. She noted how the launch of the Digital Dollar could bring about \u201ca safe central bank liability in the digital financial ecosystem, much like cash currently coexists with commercial bank money.\u201d\n\nBrainard also highlighted the possibility of CBDC co-existing with stablecoins. Through her new position, she might push the government in developing the Digital Dollar."

        "content": "The global crypto market cap stands on the verge of losing the $1 trillion mark, as prices of top coins saw more losses than gains early Monday morning. Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest crypto, failed to rise above the $22,000 mark over the weekend. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of reds and greens across the board. The Render Token (RNDR) became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 13 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.49 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $21,828.45, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.09 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 18.75 lakhs.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price today\n\nETH price stood at $1,518.99, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.88 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.32 lakhs.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) price today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour loss of 0.17 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.08179. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 7.29.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour dip of 0.16 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $93.07. LTC price in India stood at Rs 7,900.\n\nRipple (XRP) price today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.373, seeing a 24-hour loss of 2.27 percent. As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 32.40.\n\nSolana (SOL) price today\n\nSolana price stood at $20.93, marking a 24-hour gain of 1.16 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,956.40.\n\nTop crypto gainers today (February 13)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nRender Token (RNDR)\n\nPrice: $1.62\n\n24-hour gain: 13.87 percent\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nPrice: $0.3141\n\n24-hour gain: 9.21 percent\n\nZiliqa (ZIL)\n\nPrice: $0.03058\n\n24-hour gain: 9.18 percent\n\nInternet Computer (ICP)\n\nPrice: $5.64\n\n24-hour gain: 8.16 percent\n\nOasis Network (ROSE)\n\nPrice: $0.07401\n\n24-hour gain: 5.27 percent\n\nTop crypto losers today (February 13)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nPrice: $0.08466\n\n24-hour loss: 8.63 percent\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nPrice: $1.00\n\n24-hour loss: 8.55 percent\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nPrice: $2.28\n\n24-hour loss: 7.53 percent\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nPrice: $0.4354\n\n24-hour loss: 7.50 percent\n\nThe Graph (GRT)\n\nPrice: $0.1538\n\n24-hour loss: 6.93 percent\n\nWhat crypto exchanges are saying about the current market scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cMost cryptocurrencies experienced a decline over the weekend. Bitcoin's value dipped below $22,000 following the US-based Kraken crypto exchange's decision to halt its staking service and pay a $30 million fine to the SEC for not registering the service. The current trading price of Bitcoin, near its support level of $21,770, is bearish, and if the trend continues, it could fall to $21,500 by the end of the week. Currently, Bitcoin does not show any signs of a midterm price recovery.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cThe Crypto market is feeling the impact of global regulations. Liquid staking token prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement which clarified that staking as a technical service will continue in the US but with more transparency around tokens going into the staking pool, to prevent fund misuse. Bitcoin\u2019s price fell due to the SEC verdict that Kraken will cease its US operations. Ethereum\u2019s price went down by almost 1.6 percent.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin price drops below $21,750, downtrend could continue with potential to reach $21,200. If the price breaks below this level, further declines may occur with the next support level at $20,600. Despite the current decline, with support from the 200-day EMA, there may be an opportunity for another top if the market holds above $20,300.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cOver the weekend, there was significant growth observed in certain subsectors of the cryptocurrency market. However, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating and charging Paxos for their involvement with the BUSD stablecoin, which highlights the increased regulatory scrutiny that the industry may face in the coming year. Despite the challenging global regulatory environment, there seems to be a shift in the commentary surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in India. Previously, there had been some suggestions to ban cryptocurrencies, but recent comments from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicate a more accommodating stance. It is expected that the regulation of cryptocurrencies will eventually be a coordinated effort by governments worldwide. However, India's initial stance during the G20 summit was to ban cryptocurrencies, as opposed to exploring the possibility of a coordinated regulatory framework.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market had a busy weekend as BTC is looking for a new support level. The macroeconomic factors are swinging the prices across the crypto market which include regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected December consumer prices. BTC is trading close to the $22,000 level while ETH is exchanging hands at the $1,516 level. The next FOMC meeting is the next big event for the digital asset market for which investors are eagerly waiting.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Basically the ERC-721 standard on Bitcoin Network allows you to \u201cInscribe\u201d individual Satoshi\u2019s with data known as the Ordinals [Bitcoin NFTs]. Anyone still bullish on what this can do for BTC Adoption, will this new discovery taint the original digital P2P cash that Bitcoin started as, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s pretty wild what\u2019s going with the Ordinals trends in the Crypto and NFT space and its great to see builders building amazing blockchain infrastructures.\n\nSince this new meta launched weeks ago, Ordinals NFT transactions has been limited to spreadsheet OTC trading\u2014 due to a non availability of marketplace to process trades. Interestingly, Mark Hendrickson of the Hiro Wallet Project, announced on microblogging platform Twitter that; \u201cHiro Wallet has begun rolling out support for Bitcoin, and Ordinals for a truly cross-protocol Bitcoin Web3 experience.\u201d\n\nWith the new bridge, Extension users can send Bitcoin from their Hiro Wallet using the same Secret Key or Ledger device for managing their STX and other assets (such as BNS names and NFTs) across accounts. Send to all Bitcoin address types, with additional support for sending to BNS names coming soon.\n\nUsers can view their BTC holdings as stored on the account\u2019s Native SegWit address under \u201cBalances\u201d. They can also copy this address under \u201cReceive\u201d and soon reveal Taproot addresses for the deposit of Ordinal inscriptions (more on that below!). All inbound and outbound Bitcoin transactions appear within the \u201cActivity\u201d tab, alongside other Stacks activity such as contract executions and deployments. You can access this Bitcoin functionality now for testing by switching your network to \u201cTestnet\u201d with the latest version (v3.34.0) of the Hiro Wallet extension. Mainnet activation is expected soon later this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the fun is only getting started as we roll out expansive support for both Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions. By connecting Hiro Wallet to apps like Gamma, you\u2019ll be able to pay for new inscriptions and deposit them directly into your account as \u201cCollectibles\u201d Mark stated.\n\nThe simplest way to describe Ordinal Theory according to ChainLeft, an early advocate of Ordinal Theory \u2014 Is to track the provenance of fungible sats on Bitcoin and assign a \u201cnon-fungible\u201d value to them. It\u2019s up to the collectors to subscribe to accept this method and find value in it. Different methods to track provenance aren\u2019t new in Blockchain\u2019s.\n\nCounterparty (XCP) tracks provenance through linked UTXOs in transactions.\n\nNamecoin (NMC) tracks provenance through name identifiers.\n\nEthereum (ETH) tracks provenance through smart contracts\n\nOrdinals are actually \u201csats\u201d, not the images you see shared around. With ordinals, you could philosophically assign a \u201cnon-fungible\u201d value to technically fungible satoshis (1/100 millionth of a $BTC). Here\u2019s alpha: I think in the future these early sats will have a lot of value.\n\nIn a different twist, a closely followed crypto strategist is predicting a huge upside for one under-the-radar Ethereum (ETH) altcoin. Pseudonymous analyst Cantering Clark tells his 159,800 Twitter followers that he has his eye on Hashflow Token (HFT).\n\nThe last tickerless chart I shared did a 3x this week. I have been building a spot position in this one patiently because the setup is looking like it has quite a move ahead of it. 3 things in its favor. -New coin and new chart effect. -Not microcap but not overweight\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WODQXqA1Xl \u2014 HORSE (@TheFlowHorse) February 12, 2023\n\nThe last tickerless chart I shared did a 3x this week. I have been building a spot position in this one patiently because the setup is looking like it has quite a move ahead of it. Three things in its favor.\n\nNew coin and new chart effect.\n\nNot microcap but not overweight already.\n\nLow unit bias.\n\nAlthough, Cantering Clark initially shared a tickerless chart, he eventually unveiled the name of the low-cap altcoin on his radar. \u201cThis is not a microcap but smaller never the less so be mindful, but HFT looks like it is going to push much higher before what is probably a long corrective re-accumulation period. I am long.\u201d\n\nHashflow is the 262nd-ranked crypto asset with a market cap of $110.87 million. At time of writing, HFT is trading for $0.62, up more than 20% in the last 24 hours. Looking at the analyst\u2019s chart, he believes HFT could rally to as high as $1.02. The blockchain project recently announced a roadmap for 2023, which includes plans to launch the Hashverse, Hashflow\u2019s gamified, storyverse-driven decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows users to stake tokens, complete quests and earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHashflow is built on the Ethereum network for interoperability, zero slippage and miner extractable value (MEV)-protected trades. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) traditionally rely on automated market markers (AMMs) to enable on-demand trading of assets, but Hashflow uses a request-for-quote (RFQ) model that allows for professional market makers to manage liquidity pools. Next, Cantering Clark says a key price range for Bitcoin ($BTC) is around $22,200, where he notes that the king crypto could either find resistance or break through it with momentum.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the famous book \u201cRich Father Poor Father,\u201d shared in a tweet his prediction that they see Bitcoin at $500,000 by 2025, due to a giant collapse coming that will put the Fed in trouble.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki\u2019s Bitcoin prediction: $500,000 by 2025 because of the Fed\n\nBusinessman Robert Kiyosaki launched his financial prediction on the social network of crypto-lovers, indicating that Bitcoin will come to be worth $500,000 because of the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nGiant crash coming. Depression possible. Fed forced to print billions in fake money. By 2025 gold at $5,000 silver at $500 and Bitcoin at $500,000. Why? Because faith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed. Gold & Silver Gods money. Bitcoin people\u2019s $. Take care. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 13, 2023\n\nIn essence, Kiyosaki predicts that the Fed will be forced to print trillions of fake dollars to deal with a gigantic coming crash and that this will destroy faith in the US dollar.\n\nTo survive over time will be those who take refuge in gold, silver and Bitcoin. That is why by 2025, Kiyosaki predicts BTC at $500,000, gold at $5,000 and silver at $500.\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s predictions that have come true\n\nKiyosaki has also become famous on the globe thanks to his \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d manual that has become a best seller in finance for more than six consecutive years.\n\nIn this regard, from the moment he decided to enter the crypto world, he has been studying the market with his analysis, sharing his predictions before.\n\nThe last one was shared in May 2022, when BTC had just touched $29,000. Even at that time, Kiyosaki predicted that the crypto queen would begin its descent, reaching a low around $11,000 to $9,000.\n\nAgain, the entrepreneurial economist had cited the behavior of the Fed, which failed to understand the rise in inflation that was already occurring at that time.\n\nIn any case, Kiyosaki\u2019s prediction was not entirely wrong. On the contrary, Bitcoin has been falling in price since that May 2022, hitting its low of $15,000 in November, just after the collapse of the FTX crypto-exchange.\n\nHence, it was neither $11,000 nor $9,000, but yes the predicted drastic drop in BTC\u2019s price from $29,000 to $15,000 did occur.\n\nThe latest news on BTC\n\nRecently, Bitcoin has been mentioned in several countries and projects. Among many, there is the case of Russia rumored to be ready for the legal use of BTC and mining.\n\nEven Dubai, already pro-bitcoin, appears to have seen the introduction of a new school that will be able to accept BTC and ETH for payment of its fees.\n\nNot only that, famous Bitcoin influencer Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has launched an online summer internship on open source development on the Bitcoin protocol at his Saylor Academy.\n\nThe project is called Saylor Academy\u2019s Summer of Bitcoin, and is an initiative of the Constitution Foundation, founded by Michael Saylor in 2008, even before Bitcoin was born"

        "title": "Bitcoin experienced its first \"Death Cross\" - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Bitcoin today made headlines for something that has never happened before: it experienced its first \u201cDeath Cross\u201d on the weekly chart.\n\nWhat is the Death Cross and what does it mean for Bitcoin?\n\nIn technical analysis, a Death Cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average, signaling a potential change in trend.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the 50-week moving average crossed the 200-week moving average downward, triggering the Death Cross.\n\nThe Death Cross is considered by many traders and analysts to be a bearish signal, indicating a potential decline in the price of the asset. This is because the crossing of the moving averages suggests that the recent price decline is not just a short-term fluctuation, but rather a long-term trend reversal.\n\nIt is important to note that the Death Cross is not an infallible indicator and that other factors can influence the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Death Cross is not unique to Bitcoin and has been observed in other financial markets, including stocks, commodities, and forex.\n\nIndeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the stock market experienced a Death Cross in March 2020, during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, the Death Cross on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart is significant because of the growing interest in cryptocurrency and its impact on the broader financial landscape.\n\nBitcoin has had a turbulent history, with its value fluctuating wildly over the years.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created in 2009 as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies and gained popularity among early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\n\nAttention of the general public\n\nHowever, it was not until Bitcoin\u2019s 2017 bull run that it came to the attention of the general public, reaching an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December of that year.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has experienced several booms and busts, with notable increases and decreases in value.\n\nIn 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s value plummeted along with the rest of the financial markets during the pandemic-induced recession, but rebounded stronger than ever in 2021, reaching an all-time high of more than $64,000 in April.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin\u2019s value has trended downward, with the cryptocurrency losing more than half its value in just a few months.\n\nThe so-called \u201cdeath cross\u201d on the weekly chart is seen as a sign that this downward trend may continue, and many analysts predict further declines in the coming weeks and months.\n\nBitcoin still on a downward trend?\n\nThere are several factors that could be contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline. A major driver of Bitcoin\u2019s value is investor sentiment, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent volatility and regulatory restrictions have caused some investors to lose confidence in the asset.\n\nIn addition, concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining have led to increased scrutiny and criticism of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline may not be all bad. The cryptocurrency has always been known for its volatility, and its recent decline could be seen as a correction after a period of excessive growth.\n\nIn addition, many long-term investors and supporters of Bitcoin see the recent decline as an opportunity to buy the asset at a lower price.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline is not necessarily indicative of the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term potential. Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade, and its value has continued to rise over the years despite the many challenges it has faced.\n\nBitcoin death cross\n\nThe Death Cross on the weekly chart is just one data point in a complex and dynamic ecosystem, and it is important to consider other factors when assessing Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nWe can therefore infer that the recent Death Cross on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart represented a significant development for the cryptocurrency. Highlighting the potential change in its long-term trend.\n\nEven though this bearish signal has caused concern among some investors and analysts, it is important to remember that the Death Cross is just one of many data points in a complex and evolving ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin has faced numerous challenges throughout its history, but has continued to grow and evolve as a viable alternative to traditional currencies.\n\nWhile its recent decline has prompted criticism and skepticism. It is important to recognize that volatility and corrections are natural components of any financial market and can provide opportunities for long-term investors.\n\nAs the world continues to face challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. The role of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may become even more significant in the years ahead.\n\nAlthough the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, it is clear that it will continue to be a topic of discussion and debate among investors, analysts, and enthusiasts for years to come."

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 has made some bleak predictions about the economic outlook, as he praised gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) as alternatives to the United States dollar.\n\nIndeed, with the gloomy warnings of a \u201cgiant crash coming\u201d and \u201cdepression possible,\u201d Kiyosaki explained that the Federal Reserve was \u201cforced to print billions in fake money,\u201d which is how he referred to the U.S. dollar in his tweet on February 13.\n\nOn the other hand, he projected that by 2025, gold would reach the price of $5,000 per ounce, \u201csilver at $500, and Bitcoin at $500,000,\u201d because \u201cfaith in [the] US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed.\u201d Finally, he addressed gold and silver as \u201cGod\u2019s money,\u201d and Bitcoin as \u201cpeople\u2019s dollar.\u201d\n\nGiant crash coming. Depression possible. Fed forced to print billions in fake money. By 2025 gold at $5,000 silver at $500 and Bitcoin at $500,000. Why? Because faith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed. Gold & Silver Gods money. Bitcoin people\u2019s $. Take care. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 13, 2023\n\nKiyosaki warns of a recession ahead\n\nNotably, the best-selling author and entrepreneur, who is a known critic of the fiat currency system in the U.S. and the world, had previously warned that the world was already in a recession, voicing the expectations of a rough landing.\n\nHe had earlier also reiterated that investors should avoid paper money and instead focus on accumulating precious metals like gold, which he expected to rally in the coming months due to the accumulation by central banks, predicting that the stock market would likely crash further.\n\nAs for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Kiyosaki labeled it one of the three \u201chottest subjects on earth\u201d alongside silver and gold, referring to Bitcoin as \u201cpeople\u2019s money,\u201d and attributing its bullish rally in January to the increasing demand for alternative investment products.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency, which Kiyosaki predicts to trade at $500,000 by 2025, was at press time changing hands at the price of $21,756, down 0.8% on the day, as well as declining 5.19% across the previous week but still recording an increase of 9.1% on its monthly chart, as per data retrieved on February 13.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "content": "Wirex, a leading crypto payments platform, has announced a long-term strategic partnership with payment giant Visa (NYSE: V) to expand its footprint in the United Kingdom and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.\n\nUnder the partnership, Wirex will directly issue crypto-enabled debit, and prepaid cards for assets like Bitcoin (BTC) to more than 40 countries, the crypto payment firm said in a press release on February 13.\n\nThe partnership will support further collaboration in significant markets such as Europe, the USA, and APAC between two countries.\n\nExpanding crypto payment services\n\nThe development is another milestone for Wirex, which has over five million customers globally, with the UK as its largest customer base and rapid growth in APAC. The partnership is expected to empower more people to access the benefits of crypto.\n\n\u201cVisa wants to bring more payment options to consumers by connecting digital currencies with our network of banks and merchants. We\u2019re excited that Wirex is expanding their focus on Asia Pacific, making it easy and seamless for people to spend their crypto balance at the millions of merchants that accept Visa in the region,\u201d said Matt Wood, Head of Digital Partnerships, Asia Pacific at Visa.\n\nElsewhere, Svyatoslav Garal, Regional Managing Director of Wirex APAC, pointed out that Visa\u2019s safety, security, and innovation will help the company to continue developing a next-generation app and card.\n\nIt is worth noting that, although Wirex\u2019s primary customer base is in the UK, it withdrew from the region\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) temporary registration regime before the full registration deadline. This means it now serves UK-based customers through a subsidiary licensed in Croatia.\n\nIndeed, Wirex has long made it clear about its global expansion plans, an aspect backed by significant capital inflow from various backers.\n\nVisa crypto expansion\n\nAt the same time, Visa has been making inroads into the crypto space, intending to launch several products after the firm filed trademarks for crypto wallets and the metaverse.\n\nBack in 2022, the company also launched a no-limit Bitcoin card in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) alongside partnering with the now-collapsed FTX crypto exchange to offer crypto-backed debit cards in 40 countries"

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe Bitcoin price prediction sees a 0.46% decline over the past few hours as the cryptocurrency fails at $21,899 and could head lower.\n\nBitcoin Prediction Statistics Data:\n\nBitcoin price now \u2013 $21,692\n\nBitcoin market cap \u2013 $417.6 billion\n\nBitcoin circulating supply \u2013 19.2 million\n\nBitcoin total supply \u2013 19.2 million\n\nBitcoin Coinmarketcap ranking \u2013 #1\n\nBTC/USD Long-term Trend: Ranging (Daily Chart)\n\nKey levels:\n\nResistance Levels: $25,000, $27,000, $29,000\n\nSupport Levels: $19,000, $17,000, $15,000\n\nBTC/USD loses its momentum after touching key resistance above $21,899. As of writing, the king coin is down 0.46% on the day at $21,692 hovering below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price may struggle to close above $21,700, and if it does, it should be free to rise well above $22,000 if it moves toward the upper boundary of the channel.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: Can Bitcoin Price Trade Above $22,000?\n\nAfter a slightly positive move above $21,800, the Bitcoin price could remain below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. Over the past few days, the king coin has been struggling for the bullish movement. In today\u2019s session, the Bitcoin price attempted to push higher, but the sellers stepped into the market to bring the market price lower to touch the daily low of $21,431.\n\nMoreover, if the coin moves lower, the $21,000 may serve as the nearest support level, which may likely make room for the coin to fall further to hit the supports at $19,000, $17,000, and $15,000. The Relative Strength Index (14) remains below the 50- level, which could follow the downward movement. On the contrary, BTC/USD may likely face the upper boundary of the channel to hit the resistance levels of $25,000, $27,000, and $29,000.\n\nBTC/USD Medium-term Trend: Bearish (4H Chart)\n\nOn the 4-Hour chart, the BTC price hovers around $21,647 and may likely cross above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. However, if the bulls gather enough strength, the upward movement may be near the resistance level of $22,500 and above.\n\nOn the downside, immediate support could be located around the $21,300 level while critical support is at $21,000 and below. Therefore, the Bitcoin price may likely fall below the lower boundary of the channel if the bears put more pressure on the market, Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (14) keeps moving below the 40-level, suggesting a sideways movement.\n\nBitcoin Alternatives\n\nThe Bitcoin price is at the moment moving sideways, if the king coin moves above the resistance level of $22k, it is likely to resume upward movement but if not, there could be more negative movements in the market. However, the Meta Masters Guild has become one of the most popular crypto presales of the year, raising almost $4.5 million as it continues its presale to end the fundraising round in less than five days."
