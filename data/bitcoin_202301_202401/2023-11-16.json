        "content": "Charity donations: How much cryptocurrency have we raised so far?\n\nHelp us reach our donation goal this holiday season and join our donation leaderboard for Save the Children's HODL Hope Campaign.\n\nSave the Children\u2019s crypto philanthropy journey\n\nSave the Children was the first iNGO (international Non-Governmental Organization) to accept a bitcoin donation in 2013 in response to Typhoon Haiyan which struck Southeast Asia and devastated the Philippines.\n\nAround the world children are being robbed of their futures by a global economy built on inequality and greed. With your continued support, Save the Children believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can be a force for good and a force for financial inclusion.\n\n\n\nWhich cryptocurrencies do Save the Children accept?\n\nSave the Children\u2019s crypto fundraising is powered by The Giving Block and our crypto wallet custodian, Gemini*. We can accept any cryptocurrency currently available on the Gemini Exchange.\n\nWe accept multiple cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and USDC. For the latest list of cryptocurrencies, we accept*, please visit our crypto donation page.\n\n*Gemini regularly adds new cryptocurrencies to their platform for trading.\n\nYour crypto donation could be matched!\n\nThere are various automatic crypto matches running for donations to Save the Children. Please visit The Giving Block for the latest information. Please note that Save the Children receives matches only for donations made directly to us.\n\nDonating a cryptocurrency that is not available on our wallet?\n\nYou can also donate Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Cosmos (ATOMA), Polkadot (DOT), Flow (FLOW), Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), and or Stella (XLM) to Save the Children.\n\nDonating NFTs?\n\nWe accept the proceeds from an NFT sale once converted to a cryptocurrency such as ETH.\n\nFor an NFT or other smart contract, you can dynamically generate a unique, static, reusable wallet address for Save the Children with these simple steps:\n\nStep 1: Input a comment in the \u201cDonation notes\u201d field (optional)\n\nStep 2: Select the crypto type\n\nStep 3: Click the CONTINUE button\n\nStep 4: Add your email and/or contact information (optional if you would like an email confirmation)\n\nStep 5: Click the CONTINUE button\n\nStep 6: Copy and paste the dynamic address or QR code that is generated.\n\nWhat is #CryptoGivingTuesday?\n\n#CryptoGivingTuesday is the unofficial start of #BagSeason, the holiday giving season for the crypto community. It takes place annually on the Tuesday after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nWhat is #NFTuesday?\n\n#NFTuesday brings together NFT marketplaces, artists, galleries and projects to bring visibility and raise funds for important causes.\n\nIs my cryptocurrency charitable donation tax deductible?\n\nYes, your cryptocurrency donation is tax deductible*. Save the Children offers supporters who want to donate cryptocurrency to charity the ability to donate in a tax-efficient way. The IRS classifies cryptocurrency donations as property, meaning they are not subject to capital gains tax and are tax-deductible. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nFor example, for donors in the United States, the IRS has classified bitcoin as property for tax purposes. This means that when someone donates bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit such as Save the Children, donors do not have to pay capital gains tax and it is tax-deductible if you provide your email address.\n\n*Subject to change. Please consult your tax advisor.\n\nCan I donate anonymously?\n\nYes, you can donate anonymously. However, you will not receive a tax receipt unless you provide your email address."

        "content": "The crypto app Strike on Thursday announced a major expansion of its services, powered by a new partnership with the payment processing platform Checkout.com, that will allow users in more than 65 countries to buy Bitcoin directly with their debit card.\n\nOne of the key challenges facing crypto providers is allowing users to move between fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which require payment rails like wire transfers and ACH transfers.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Strike founder and CEO Jack Mallers said Strike\u2019s long-term goal is to be the \u201cBitcoin company for the Earth,\u201d with global payments serving as a core feature.\n\nRamping up\n\nThe innovation of crypto was creating payment rails that operate 24/7 and without the friction of a banking system separated by international borders. Ideally, anyone could send any amount of money to anyone else at any time.\n\nThe issue, of course, is that people need to own cryptocurrencies in the first place. For most people, that ownership comes from on-ramps like exchanges or wallets, where users purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency.\n\nEven if someone owns Bitcoin, its capacity as an actual currency is limited, with few merchants around the world accepting it as payment. As a result, crypto platforms also require off-ramps to trade tokens back into fiat currency.\n\nFounded in 2019, Strike has been limited by financial restrictions that would enable users to buy and sell Bitcoin. While its app is available to download in more than 65 countries, users are limited to sending Bitcoin and the stablecoin Tether between each other, with only select customers able to trade back and forth into fiat currency.\n\nStrike, which raised an $80 million funding round in September 2022 led by the Bitcoin-focused asset manager Ten31, has over the past year introduced new products to expand on- and off-ramps into fiat, including its Send Globally, where users in the U.S. can send dollars to different markets like Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and the Philippines. Recipients receive the transfer in their own local currency, with Bitcoin serving as an intermediary. Strike\u2019s long-term goal is to facilitate cross-border payments, or remittances, between countries around the world using Bitcoin.\n\nCheckout.com\n\nThe partnership with Checkout.com enables a new payment rail for Strike, allowing more users to buy and sell Bitcoin using the app. Users outside the U.S. will also now be able to originate payments between currencies via the Send Globally feature.\n\nCheckout.com has previously worked with crypto companies, although it cut ties with the exchange Binance in August over money laundering and compliance concerns.\n\nSpeaking with Fortune, Mallers said Checkout.com is providing a card network gateway, meaning it brokers relationships with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Checkout.com itself is not doing the fiat-to-Bitcoin conversions, but instead will serve as an alternative payment rail to wire transfers, ACH, and card processing already available in the U.S, opening up the Bitcoin on-ramp to users globally.\n\nMallers said Bitcoin purchases and withdrawals will not be subject to daily limits outside of its typical fraud prevention system, which monitors new users and large withdrawals, although he emphasized that any prices will be locked in by transactions even if they are delayed.\n\nThe launch still comes during a time of turmoil for the crypto industry. Strike moved custody\u2014or holding its crypto assets\u2014in-house in June after the bankruptcy of Prime Trust, its former custodian.\n\nTrust in the crypto ecosystem has also been rocked by the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted by a federal jury of seven criminal counts in early November related to the collapse of his crypto exchange.\n\nWith young crypto phenoms like Bankman-Fried and Terra\u2019s Do Kwon unveiled as fraudsters, the 29-year-old Mallers said that Strike\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin and regulation is only driving its expansion.\n\n\u201cAs more companies around the world go bankrupt and go to prison, we get more demand because it\u2019s almost like a game of last man standing,\u201d Mallers told Fortune."

        "title": "Bitcoin derivatives market evokes memories of 2021 surge - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "A burst of activity in Bitcoin derivatives has evoked memories of the period in late 2021 when the token surged to an all-time high.\n\nVariables such as the cost of perpetual futures trades and options open interest point to a revival in speculative gusto for Bitcoin, which has more than doubled in price this year in a partial rebound from a 2022 rout.\n\nThe increased attention stems partly from expectations that the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds may soon get regulatory assent, opening up the asset to more investors. The likely level of ETF inflows is an open question but the possibility of greater demand is enough to spur chancy trades.\n\nA spokesperson for Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, said the notional value of Bitcoin options open interest on the platform reached a record of roughly $14.9 billion earlier this week. That topped the $14.4 billion achieved in October 2021 just before Bitcoin hit its high of almost $69,000. Open interest refers to outstanding contracts that have yet to be settled.\n\n\u201cCrypto call options were in strong demand for the past few weeks,\u201d said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider Orbit Markets. While some traders placed leveraged bets on a \u201clarge breakout\u201d to $100,000 or beyond, the more immediate test is the $38,000 level, she said.\n\nBitcoin neared $38,000 on Thursday before falling back and was trading at $36,264 as of 3:33 p.m. in Singapore on Friday. Three charts below highlight key trends from the futures and options market for the largest digital token.\n\nFOREVER FUTURES\n\nPerpetual futures are among the most popular Bitcoin derivatives as they have no set expiry date. Exchanges use the so-called funding rate to align the contracts to the underlying spot price. In bullish periods the rate tends to be positive, indicating traders betting on gains are prepared to pay funds to speculators who are short, as a cost of maintaining their positions.\n\nThe rolling, seven-day average funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures through Nov. 15 was around levels last seen in the final quarter of 2021, a period when Bitcoin was rallying toward its zenith, according to CryptoQuant data spanning a range of digital-asset exchanges.\n\nCURVE SHIFT\n\nTraders analyze Bitcoin futures curves for clues about the price outlook. The entire curve based on CME Group Inc. contracts has shifted upward compared with the pattern seen a month ago. Whereas the curve back than sloped up to almost $32,000 for the farthest contract, it now rises to nearly $40,000.\n\nThe notional value of Bitcoin futures open interest on the CME, the world\u2019s leading derivatives exchange, recently surpassed the equivalent figure for Binance. Binance is the largest crypto exchange but faces a web of regulatory probes in key jurisdictions, including the US.\n\nCME open interest for Bitcoin futures reached $4 billion on Friday versus $3.8 billion on Binance, Coinglass figures show.\n\nThe growth in CME open interest relative to Binance \u201csuggests a more substantial institutional participation in using futures to obtain long exposure to Bitcoin,\u201d said Le Shi, head of trading at market making and algorithmic trading firm Auros.\n\nOPTIONS INSIGHT\n\nFigures from Deribit show a preponderance of bullish options bets on Bitcoin hitting $40,000 and even $45,000 by the end of December. Given that the traders selling the call options are willing to take the other side of the wager, that suggests $40,000 could become a key test area for Bitcoin\u2019s rally."

Pedro Fi\u00faza/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAlexis Ohanian says the crypto winter will shake out \"tourists and grifters\" from the sector.\n\nThe Reddit cofounder views bitcoin as a haven asset like gold, but for a new generation.\n\nOhanian paid just $15,000 for ether that would be worth over $100 million today if he'd kept it all.\n\nAlexis Ohanian predicts a brighter, cleaner future for cryptocurrencies, and sees bitcoin as a modern-day version of gold.\n\n\"I've invested through every 'crypto winter,' and they still don't faze me,\" the Reddit cofounder posted on X this week. \"Winter clears out the tourists and grifters, it happens in every industry.\"\n\nOhanian, the founder and general partner of venture firm 776, touted crypto as safe despite its volatility. It's \"no different than gold\" as the yellow metal's value stems from centuries of people believing it's worth something, he said.\n\n\"Bitcoin is the same thing \u2013 but for a new generation,\" he wrote, noting there's conviction in the digital token's value but unlike gold, it's completely decentralized. \"That's exciting for an investor.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has tumbled from nearly $70,000 at its peak to below $40,000 over the past couple of years. However, it has roughly doubled since the start of this year, boosting its market capitalization to about $730 billion \u2014 not far off the $780 billion market capitalization of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOhanian is a longstanding champion of crypto. He revealed earlier this year that he paid just $15,000 for 50,000 ether in 2014 \u2014 an amount worth over $100 million today if he'd kept it all. He made a combined $50 million from early bets on ether and Coinbase stock, he said.\n\nThe venture capitalist, who's married to tennis star Serena Williams, has predicted the crypto industry will shift from \"speculation + casino vibes\" toward wider adoption, greater utility, and fun. He's also said that bear markets are typically when people create products with real value.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This crypto winter is exactly the time when folks are gonna be building,\" he said in May. \"The next cycle won't be defined by gambling or speculation, it'll be through engaging gameplay.\"\n\nOhanian has also declared the rise of crypto and other alternative assets means the classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds will be \"dead for digital natives.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Below $40,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC -3.22%) history is characterized by a boom-and-bust cycle. Investor enthusiasm and risk-seeking behavior create the necessary conditions for a raging bull market. But then, as pessimism takes hold of the market, this cryptocurrency seems to go into free fall. It seems like this situation always repeats itself.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is 47% below its peak price, which was set about two years ago. However, it's had a wonderful run so far this year. Some investors might be considering adding this asset to their portfolios in the hopes of riding the bullish momentum.\n\nShould investors buy Bitcoin while it's still below $40,000? Here's why that looks like a smart decision.\n\nA safe-haven asset?\n\nCryptocurrencies in general are viewed as an extremely risky asset class. And it makes sense. Not only is the volatility something that most investors simply can't handle, but the opaqueness, complexity, and major failures of some high-profile industry names add to the worries. It's no wonder many choose to avoid this asset class altogether.\n\nBut this year, the price action of different assets has been very interesting and tells us an insightful story. The S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Index, which measures the performance of the Treasury bond market, is up 0.70% this year (as of Nov. 15). Treasuries are viewed as the ultimate safe haven asset, especially in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, both factors that seem to be at elevated levels right now.\n\nGold, another asset that market participants turn to for safety, is up just 7% this year. When inflation is still above average, coupled with everything else going on in the world like war and political turmoil, you'd expect more capital to flock to the precious metal.\n\nBitcoin's price, on the other hand, has skyrocketed 114% in 2023. Is this top cryptocurrency now becoming a safe asset in the minds of the investment community? While it's hard to point to exact reasons why an asset goes up or down, Bitcoin's price movement in recent times is certainly telling. Perhaps it's not so risky after all.\n\nUpcoming catalysts\n\nWhile Bitcoin's big-picture aspects are certainly compelling enough reasons to own it, some catalysts in the near term could continue propelling the price higher. The most important news related to Bitcoin in recent months is the potential approval of spot exchange-traded funds. Major asset managers, like BlackRock and Fidelity, among many others, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A hard deadline for a decision comes in January. An approval could introduce large pools of capital to Bitcoin, which could drive the price up.\n\nThen there's the upcoming halving, set to take place in April 2024. This event, which cuts the rate of Bitcoin's new supply in half, happens roughly every four years. Historically, Bitcoin's price has experienced a bullish trend in the several months leading up to a halving, as well as in the months following. Now might be one of the best times to buy this digital asset.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore the overall macroeconomic backdrop. The latest inflation data, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, showed a step in the right direction. And this could mean that the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and maybe even starts to reduce rates sometime next year. This could be a boon for risky assets like Bitcoin.\n\nBuying Bitcoin below $40,000 might look like one of the smartest investing decisions in hindsight."

        "title": "Flaw in early Bitcoin wallets shows how much crypto depends on secure code - Fortune",
        "content": "One of the best articles I read this week was a Washington Post report that revealed how some Bitcoin wallets from the pre-2016 era have a major vulnerability that could let hackers guess their private key, which is the password that controls the wallet.\n\nAs the Post explains, the problem \u201cstems from wallet programs that created cryptographic keys that weren\u2019t random enough. Instead of crafting electronic keys that were one in a trillion and therefore very hard for an outsider to forge, they made keys that were one in some number of thousands\u2014a randomness factor easily hacked.\u201d\n\nIn other words, hackers could use trial and error to guess the private key of these wallets and steal the contents. For now, the details of the vulnerability are only known by the security firm that discovered it, and they are not disclosing them for obvious reasons\u2014but the firm made clear it\u2019s a matter of time till bad guys find it too.\n\nWhile this sounds like a potential catastrophe, the fallout is likely to be relatively minor since the wallet flaw affects only certain pre-2016 wallets created by the firm Blockchain and a few others. Blockchain has been warning its customers so those affected have time to patch their wallet or move their Bitcoin somewhere else.\n\nThe most interesting question for me is what will become of the vulnerable wallets whose owners have long ago forgotten about them. There are likely more of these than we might imagine. I recall, for instance, a friend who briefly dated a guy who sent her a small amount of Bitcoin to try and get her interested in crypto\u2014but who, understandably, promptly forgot about it soon after. No doubt there are many others in her situation since there are reportedly at least 4 million Bitcoins lost forever.\n\nThe irony is that the price of Bitcoin in 2015 was as low as $300 and is up 100-fold since then, which means even small amounts from that era are worth a healthy sum. The upshot is that news of the vulnerability will set off a race to recover all that forgotten Bitcoin\u2014a race not unlike those expeditions that seek to find and recover sunken vessels that contain gold bars.\n\nUnfortunately, those likely to win that race are nasty characters like the North Korean military hackers, who already spend their time trying to steal crypto. The Post reports there have been proposals for white hat hackers to steal the Bitcoin first and figure out a way to safeguard and distribute it. Alas, for now, the plan is not going forward due to fear of legal liability.\n\nAll of this a fine reminder of just how much the integrity of crypto depends on secure code.

        "content": "00:00\n\nHow much institutional or even retail interest is this going to bring into the crypto world? Is it going to be an important milestone? Great to be here, Matt. Thanks very much for having me. And I think you just hit that. That is the key question is is not so much the data, it's not so much when exactly the ETFs will launch, it's what will the impact be. And I think that you you really touched on it right at the top of the show with the correlation chart because that is really the key. That is the key reason for allocation to Bitcoin. I think for most investors it is that mark of vit C and free lunch that bitcoin provides because of its diversification effects, because it has over the long run been uncorrelated to most of the major asset classes. Very low correlation exhibited over the past ten years. There have been periods where that correlation has gone up, as you rightly mentioned, in that pandemic era. But this year, for most of this year, the correlation has indeed been negative if there has been any correlation at all. So that diversification re effects that that it can give in view to portfolios of stocks, bonds, cash and alternatives is what's going to drive the conversation. That's what's going to drive the inflows. The question is what is that allocation? Because because the quantitative evidence, the empirical evidence tells us it shouldn't be zero. It shouldn't be zero. But I've heard often in Conversation Suey about this idea that really at this point, you shouldn't be putting anything into crypto that you're not willing to use, and that would maybe suggest that it shouldn't be super heavily weighted in a portfolio in terms of that asset allocation break up It also, we have to keep in mind it comes against a backdrop of there being a lot of anticipation to your point about a spot ETF being approved eventually. Maybe it's a question of when, not a question of if. And I just wonder how much of that anticipation already is baked into what we're seeing in prices and if ultimately what we see is, okay, maybe a little bit more institutional attraction, a little bit more volume in terms of flows, but pricing doesn't change that much. What do you think? Yeah, that's a that's a that's a really interesting question. And I think it it you know, people have been talking about, oh, it's baked into the price that authorization approval is baked into the price. And indeed the approval may be baked into the price. But as you rightly point out, it's not so much the approval, it's how much in flow are these products, If they are approved, when they are approved, how much inflow will they see? That's you know, what is the market pricing in? Is the market pricing in the $5 billion of inflow or is it pricing in $10 billion of inflow? We don't really know. And so I think that most investors will will look at this cautiously. I don't think any institutional investors are going to be thinking about timing, the market timing of bump. What most institutional investors will be looking at is over the long term and the diversification effects that Bitcoin can have in their portfolios and add more resilience to the returns that they will see from their portfolios."

        "content": "In a Manhattan courtroom this month, the cryptocurrency industry faced a reckoning as its onetime star, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of fraud in a trial that put the industry\u2019s excesses on vivid display.\n\nBut the ever-volatile crypto markets were already moving on.\n\nShortly before Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s verdict landed on Nov. 2, the price of Bitcoin surpassed $35,000, its highest level since an industry meltdown in 2022. Last week, Ether, the second-most-popular digital currency, surged 10 percent to around $2,100, its best performance in months. Some investors rushed to declare the end of the so-called crypto winter of falling prices and financial scandals that have plagued the industry for the last 18 months.\n\nDriving the renewed euphoria? A potential new fund.\n\nCrypto investors are growing optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve an exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., that tracks the price of Bitcoin, analysts said. The fund would trade on traditional stock exchanges and offer an easy way for people to invest in cryptocurrencies, potentially bringing a wave of money into the industry.\n\nSome proponents have hailed the possibility of this new investment vehicle, known as a spot Bitcoin E.T.F., as crypto\u2019s \u201csalvation.\u201d In August, Grayscale Investments, a crypto asset manager, scored a legal victory over the S.E.C. that seemed to pave the way for it to offer the Bitcoin product. And last week, BlackRock, a giant money manager, filed paperwork to establish a similar E.T.F. to track the price of Ether."

        "content": "Continued near-term sell-off risk was averted in the crypto market after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a stopgap spending bill to avoid a potential government shutdown yesterday, according to investment firm Matrixport's Head of Crypto Research and Strategy Markus Thielen.\n\nIf a shutdown had gone ahead, non-essential government work would have halted, including the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s progress on potential bitcoin spot ETF approvals, even by January 2024, resulting in more profit-taking and bitcoin potentially dropping 10%, Thielen argued.\n\nA narrow window to approve all current bitcoin spot ETF applications at the same time ends today, Nov. 17. Once the window passes, all current filings can no longer be accepted simultaneously this year \u2014 as it's unlikely a filing would be accepted during its comment window \u2014 shifting emphasis to the next deadline on Jan. 10, K33 Research analysts said earlier this week.\n\nWith the bill approved, momentum for a potential bitcoin spot ETF approval is maintained, keeping alive Matrixport\u2019s year-end price target of $45,000, Thielen added. This was initially set in February when bitcoin was trading at $22,500.\n\nWith the latest inflation data on Nov. 14 revealing a fall in the U.S. CPI from 3.7% to 3.2%, lower than expected, Matrixport forecasts a further decline to 1.6% in 2024. Such a drop could lead to significant interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve (150-200 basis points), fueling a continued rally in risk-on assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, Thielen said.\n\nThielen also reiterated expectations that this \u201cfifth bitcoin bull market\u201d would last until December 2024, roughly six months after Bitcoin BTC -2.60% \u2019s next expected halving event in April \u2014 when the block reward gets cut in half \u2014 with a price target of $125,000.\n\nEther, altcoins and bitcoin mining stocks could be set to outperform\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nMatrixport projects Ethereum's revenues to reach $171 million this month \u2014 the highest since May \u2014 hinting at a period of potential outperformance relative to bitcoin. The boost is a positive sign not just for ether but for the broader altcoin market, with fees and revenue on the rise across various chains and bitcoin\u2019s market dominance peaking, Thielen wrote.\n\nU.S. trading hours continue to be the most important, especially following BlackRock's Ethereum Trust registration in Delaware last week, Nasdaq\u2019s subsequent 19b-4 filing for BlackRock's proposed iShares Ethereum Trust ETF and BlackRock\u2019s S-1 filing for an ether spot ETF with the SEC yesterday, Thielen added.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks, including Hive Blockchain, Marathon Digital and Iris Energy, could also be set for a period of outperformance against bitcoin, according to Matrixport."

In an interview with Bloomberg, Paolo Ardoino, the expected CEO of Tether, shared the company's intentions to construct mining facilities and invest in other miners. The focus of this expansion will be on establishing mining sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, with the goal of increasing Tether's computing power to represent 1% of the BTC mining network. These new facilities will have a capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts.\n\nThis mining investment is part of Tether's recent $610 million debt financing facility, which was extended to German miner Northern Data Group. Tether has been actively increasing its loans throughout the year and had previously made a strategic investment in Northern Data Group to support initiatives related to artificial intelligence.\n\nArdoino outlined Tether's mining objectives, aiming to achieve 120 megawatts of direct mining operations by the end of this year and an impressive 450 megawatts by the end of 2025. The company is also considering the establishment of a 300-megawatt facility and plans to set up its mining infrastructure inside containers that can be relocated based on fluctuations in electricity prices. Ardoino emphasized that Tether's approach to mining is gradual, stating, \"We are not in a hurry to become the largest miner in the world.\"\n\nIn December, Paolo Ardoino will assume the role of Tether's CEO while maintaining his position as the chief technical officer of parent company Bitfinex, as previously announced in October.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "How Will Bitcoin's 2024 Halving Affect Your Crypto Portfolio? Here Are The Predictions - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving is expected in April 2024.\n\nThe event, occurring approximately every four years, affects not only the market value of Bitcoin, but also the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhy It Matters: The Bitcoin halving is a pre-coded event in the Bitcoin protocol that happens every 210,000 blocks \u2014 roughly every four years.\n\nIt reduces the reward miners receive for validating blockchain transactions, thus controlling the issuance of new Bitcoin and maintaining its scarcity\u200b\u200b.\n\nInitially, in 2009, miners were rewarded with 50 BTC for each block.\n\nThe first halving in 2012 reduced this to 25 BTC, and subsequent halving in 2016 and 2020 further decreased it to 12.5 and 6.25 Bitcoin, respectively\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhat Happens After: The halving constrains the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. This affects the balance between supply and demand. When the supply decreases while demand remains constant or increases, the value of Bitcoin is likely to rise\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is also associated with increased market volatility. Investors and speculators closely watch the market dynamics around this event, leading to price fluctuations and heightened trading activity\u200b\u200b.\n\nImplications For Miners: The reduced reward for mining new blocks directly impacts the profitability of Bitcoin mining, influencing the mining landscape.\n\nMiners with higher energy costs and less efficient hardware may face challenges, leading to a shift in the market\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe halving stimulates discussions and innovation within the blockchain community, fostering technological advancements and community development\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe predictable scarcity introduced by the halving mechanism also positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term investment asset\u200b\u200b.\n\nAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE - Hedge Funder Envisions Bitcoin As Settlement Layer For Global Assets \u2014 'We Haven't Even Started'\n\nPredictions\n\nPredictions for Bitcoin's price post-halving are varied. While some experts anticipate a significant price increase, others argue that halving's effects may already be priced into Bitcoin\u2019s value\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitQuant (via Nasdaq and VettaFi): Predicts a post-halving price of up to $250,000, more than nine times its current value\u200b\u200b. Coincodex: Forecasts Bitcoin to reach approximately $49,300 by April 2024, with a potential rally to around $84,100 after the halving\u200b\u200b. Bloomberg: Suggests Bitcoin could surpass $50,000 by 2024, attributing this to the upcoming halving and an expected increase of at least 81% in its value\u200b\u200b. Cryptonews: Anticipates Bitcoin exceeding $100,000, and possibly $300,000 by 2028, with a post-halving range of $60,000 to $90,000\u200b\u200b. Standard Chartered: Predicts Bitcoin's value could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, driven by its characteristics as a decentralized, scarce digital asset\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile predictions vary, the Bitcoin halving event will serve as a catalyst for significant changes and opportunities within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nRead Next: Welcome To 'The Acceleration Phase' - Analyst Predicts An 88% Increase For Bitcoin\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

And I wonder how much that that is fading now, especially given that I'm reading through the notes you sent across to us and you're talking about Pecos Go Network and how that could prevent the next at RTX. How how can you say that confidently? Well, look, we're all excited about the ETF. It's definitely getting closer. We're definitely seeing signals and returns the conversations that the applicants are having with the SEC because working with a bunch of these guys as well. So I'm optimistic, but I think it's quite likely we have another round of ETF rejections before we get the positive, positive news. And it really comes back down to market structure. You know, Gary Gensler has made no secret of this point. You have two separate exchanges from custody, the CFTC market structures already. This way you have to separate exchanges from custody. The equities markets are this way as well. You know, 15 months ago, we had Sam Bankman-fried marching all over Washington, D.C., advocating his seven key points of regulation where he basically said, let me take on all functions. It's going to be great. It's going to be efficient. We'll do that. Obviously, we have a very different thought process in right now, but a lot of these applications are with Coinbase custody, you know, and Coinbase. Well, I'm not trying to say that they're in FTC's by any means. They are taking on also kind of that same playbook, in addition to being an exchange and a custodian, they recently got approval for an FCM. Of course they got a broker dealer. What this means is there's a lot of risks in that entity that are fully understood, and I think that the SEC could quite likely come back and say, No, you got to separate out these things fully before we're going to move forward. Good news, like there's solutions right now of custodians like Becker that focus 100% on that. We don't do trading and exchange work so so we can we can fill that void."

        "content": "It's officially been one year since the nation of El Salvador became the first to begin buying Bitcoin every day, joining the millions of savers around the world who dollar cost average into the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs profiled by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo today, it was on this date last year when El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele committed to purchasing one bitcoin every day. One year later, the results are in, Bitcoin is up 120%.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether El Salvador stuck to the plan, if it has, it has amassed a total of 365 bitcoins at a reported cost of $13 million during that time. However, the cost basis for these acquisitions is notably lower at $9.5 million, or a $3 million gain.\n\nThe results showcase the potential benefits of consistent and measured investment in the volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nTime will tell if the results will silence critics, however, who have been critical of the country's strategy. El Salvador has faced scrutiny for its Bitcoin purchasing efforts, with skepticism arising from the lack of transparency regarding the actual purchases. While President Bukele has publicly disclosed the ownership of 2,381 bitcoins acquired at an average price of around $44,300, there remains a challenge in verifying these claims.\n\nAs a result, El Salvador may, at least temporarily, still be down on its overall Bitcoin investment. The country became the first in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, a move that has boosted tourism but drawn the scrutiny of international regulators who fear it is moving away from the U.S. dollar.\n\nAs the nation continues to navigate this uncharted territory, the impact of its pioneering DCA plan, should it have followed through on the promise, will no doubt go a long way toward mitigating concerns given its strong performance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The prospect of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved soon in the United States has increased demand for the major cryptocurrency, leading to a surge in transaction fees.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain reached $11.6 million in fees paid on Nov. 16, according to statistics from CryptoFees. At the time of writing, YCharts data shows that the average transaction fee is $18.69, up 113% from the previous day and 746% from a year ago.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees between January 2023 and November 2023. Source: CryptoFees\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis, Bitcoin remains near 18-month highs and beyond its bear market trading range. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $36,407, a 0.58% gain over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been rising since Wall Street investment manager BlackRock filed for a spot BTC ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June. After BlackRock's application, several other major asset managers in the United States submitted similar proposals, including Fidelity, ARK Invest, and WisdomTree, among others.\n\n#Bitcoin has officially flippened ETH in daily fees for the first time in 3 years. pic.twitter.com/2G3t6j64TP \u2014 \u20bf Isaiah\u26a1\ufe0f (@BitcoinIsaiah) November 17, 2023\n\nWhile the SEC appears to be engaging with the firms on proposal adjustments, it has yet to make a decision, moving final deadlines to January 2024. On Nov. 16, WisdomTree amended its Form S-1 with the regulator, followed by similar amendments from ARK and 21Shares, Valkyrie, Bitwise and VanEck.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the amended versions may be a response to concerns the SEC has raised. \u201cIt means ARK got the SEC\u2019s comments and has dealt with them all, and now put [the] ball back in [the] SEC\u2019s court,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201c[In my opinion] good sign, solid progress.\u201d\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment fund that mirrors the price of Bitcoin. The \u201cspot\u201d aspect means the fund directs the purchase of Bitcoin as the underlying asset. It enables investors to participate in Bitcoin\u2019s market through their regular brokerage accounts. It\u2019s a way to get exposure to BTC price fluctuations without the need to purchase it on a crypto exchange, for example.\n\nAs a result, a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to draw institutional investors\u2019 capital, which may potentially result in the price of Bitcoin reaching new highs in the coming months. According to Bloomberg analysts, there is a 90% likelihood of approval of all proposals in the same batch in January.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

The company generates revenue through managing assets in its multi-billion dollar reserves, and per Bloomberg, it has about $3.2 billion in excess cash as of September.\n\nArdoino said Tether is building bitcoin mines in El Salvador, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Eventually, the company aims to expand its share of the total computing power to run the bitcoin network to 1%, he said.

Even so, headwinds remain as competition is tight and mining revenue could take a hit in next year's bitcoin halving event.\n\n\"Mining for us is something that we have to learn and grow over time,\" Ardoino told Bloomberg. \"We are not in a rush to become the biggest miner in the world.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTether did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nBitcoin has notched more than 120% gain in 2023.

This shift signifies the market's maturation and growing sophistication,\" noted Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers.\n\nHe added that on Deribit, which holds an 85% market share in bitcoin options, \"there is currently a record-breaking $15 billion in notional open interest in BTC options.\"\n\nThe data from Deribit corresponds with that from The Block's data dashboard. The total bitcoin options open interest across cryptocurrency exchanges has reached an all-time high of $16.49 billion, it shows.\n\n\n\nIncrease in crypto derivatives trading\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nStrijers added that the increase in open interest to a new all-time high is evidence of the cryptocurrency market's evolving complexity. \"This development underscores the increasing preference for options as a strategic tool among traders, whether for positioning, hedging, or leveraging the recent surge in implied volatility. It's clear evidence of the market's evolving complexity,\" he said.\n\nAn increase in open interest signals a highly liquid market with many participants. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding options contracts that have not been exercised. When there is an increase in open interest, it suggests an increase in sophisticated trader activity, with new contracts being created and added to the existing ones.\n\nWhile higher open interest can suggest greater interest in a specific asset and increased market activity, it doesn't provide information about the direction of the market or whether the prevailing sentiment is bullish or bearish."

        "content": "It's been a wild week for Bitcoin. The world's largest Cryptocurrency by Market cap was close to 38,000 on Wednesday, guess where it is now, it's like 36,000. So those balloons popped. Uh Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is head of tasty crypto. Ryan Grace. Welcome Ryan. Welcome back. Actually, thank you, Lawrence. Janice. Nice to see you both. Happy Friday. See you. So, um next six months, do you think that uh we're gonna continue to see some sort of uh bullishness? Can you explain why? Yeah, I think so. I think when you look out over the next six months, I mean, we're clearly in a bullish trend. We were training sideways really since March and now we've broken above some of those key levels. And I think you look for that trend to continue though. I would caution maybe in the, the very short term. Um I would caution around, you know, the idea that, hey, look, we're gonna see the fed on pause here. We're gonna see interest rate cuts and I would caution that being a good thing. You know, I do think that you see this trend continue. But if we start to see the economy slow down, which would cause the fed to ultimately pause and, and ultimately start to cut into next year. You know, I think it's because bad things are happening. But beyond that, when you look out at kind of this confluence of, of factors, it could all come into play really around the same time, you have the ETF approvals, which I know we've seen that kind of kicked down the road here by the SEC. But I don't think that that's unexpected. You have the having you have possibly um that accommodative monitor policy, we see a little bit more stimulus and you also have when you look on chain really ill liquid supply right now, we're about 75% or so of of long term supply is just kind of frozen. So I think the conditions are right for this bullish trend to continue. But again, I would caution in the short term, you know, you could still see a lot of volatility, but take advantage of that volatility would be my view. Speaking of the spot, Bitcoin ETF earlier this week, the SEC delayed a decision about hashtags spot Bitcoin ETF, I believe another application is, is coming up uh today. What do you think of these delays? Is it slowing momentum? What do you make of this? You know, I think you're gonna see a little bit of selling pressure when those, those headlines hit. Um but I don't think it changes anything. I think there's still a very high probability that we see these ETF S approved. Um I'm not surprised that the, the SEC is again kicking the can and delaying some of this. Uh I think that was to be expected, but as we get into um early next year into the 1st and 2nd quarter, I think that we will see these approved and, you know, I, I think generally that's gonna again continue to support this bullish narrative. Iiii I noticed you use the, the phrase uh e expect and probability and things like that. It's not guaranteed. And, and this is kind of a discussion I had with people the other day, uh that this is not something that's in the bag and that's across the board. Correct. There are ways for the sec to say, look, we're not approving this at all until we get control over the spot crypto markets or whatever it is. Um Do you think that that's a probability of happening as well if you had to assign, you said there's a probability if you had to assign a probability on ETF S spot, ETF s getting approved uh in the next six months, let's say, what would you assign that probability to be? Yeah, I think it's, it's above 50%. Right. I, I agree with you, Lawrence. I mean, there's certainly a chance that, um, we don't see this happen and that would definitely be a disappointment. And I think you would see, you know, certainly see some selling pressure as a result. But I think, uh just given how long this has taken where you've come from. Um I do think that there's a lot of momentum behind the industry right now. I mean, you have some of the biggest players in the space, obviously with Blackrock. Um people can speak to, to Larry Fink's connections. I think there's, you know, a greater than 50. I got to interrupt here because this is something that we do hear a lot that Blackrock is so sophisticated. Their attorneys are smarter than the S CCS attorneys. Every, but at the same time, Blackrock has to come up against not just the S ECs attorneys, they also have to come up against a guy who taught the class about crypto at MIT who now runs the SEC and it, it's just the SEC and the thing about regulators are that they don't have to worry about market pressures sometimes in regulating because if they say, look, we don't like something, we're not gonna approve it no matter what. Like, we don't care that trillion dollar asset managers want it. We don't like it and they can do that because they're the sec at the end of the day, they have an army and a bunch of guns backing them. So why would they care about how and whether or not Blackrock wants something and, and this, you know, they're not, they're, they don't care about market pressure sometimes. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, I, I don't disagree with that. I think in that case then, you know, maybe we just have to wait this out. Uh, I do think there is a higher probability that we see this approved but if not, you know, maybe this ultimately does become an election issue when we think about crypto and maybe you do see some single issue voters come out in response to that. I mean, really, uh, a lot of time until then but, um, you know, I guess that's what you'd have to bet on then next is that you have to wait this out and you see some kind of shift in terms of the SCC, how many, how many single issue voters do we see? And still states. I, I don't know. Well, I, I don't, I don't mind inflation but this is, this is what matters to me. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that, that there's, you know, a, a slim number but I guess that would just be the next step. Um, but for now I'm, I'm hopeful, I suppose one convention you put them all together, Lawrence. I spoke over you. We didn't hear you. Is it, you could put all the people who are crypto single issue voters in 11 conventional in Miami, in the entire country from the entire country. Ok, Lauren, we're gonna leave that there. I want to turn it down. So alt coins, are there any alt coins you're watching? We kind of monopolize this segment talking about Bitcoin and, and the spot Bitcoin ETF. But the alt have been doing some interesting stuff lately, especially Solana, which tumbled a bit this morning. What are you watching? Yeah, when I look across the space at all coins, you know, I think there might be a short term trading opportunity here where you see some of these uh play catch up certainly to Solana's performance. Um You know, when you look at the Solana BT C ratio, the spread there, um that's really just ripped higher versus something like E priced in Bitcoin, which is trading, you know, closer to those one year, those one year lows. So there might be an opportunity there where you see uh just in the short term, you know, a little bit of catch up when we look at E versus BT C, certainly E versus Solana. Um I also am looking at layer twos. So we've seen, you know, generally as, as they're all correlated just having various volatilities. We've seen everything perform relatively well here over the last couple of weeks. But if you're looking for a trading opportunity, there's possibly a chance for some catch up in some of the L two s against Ethereum. So when you look at arbitra, you look at optimism, um even polygon, you know, maybe there's an opportunity for a trade there as uh arbitra specifically has really underperformed on a relative basis versus what we've seen across the board. And what, what do you think ultimately led to today's sell off? You know, I just think it's a little bit of profit taking. I mean, I think in the short term, we've seen uh a pretty strong correlation between risk assets, uh generally speaking and crypto. So we saw a huge rip in crypto. We saw, you know, a massive move um in the S and P as well. And we're kind of seeing that run out of a little bit of steam. So I think that this is just kind of the, the natural course of trading, you're gonna get a little bit of chop. I still would look for opportunities to take advantage of those dips. Uh I think again, we're in a bullish trend, you know, your new range is maybe in terms of just where our volatility is, let's say it's, it's 35 to 40. Um I would look to, to buy those dips and I think we're just seeing a little bit of selling pressure after what's been, I mean, a massive rally over the last month when you look at a lot of these tokens. All right, Ryan, it's, it's that time of the segment for predictions. Where do you see Bitcoin headed towards the end of the year? I think into the end of the year, you know, if we continue to see, uh, again, risk assets trade. Well, here which a lot of people are betting on that kind of Santa Claus rally. Uh, we do know that from a seasonal perspective, November tends to be a great month for Bitcoin. Um, see if that continues into December, but let's say we're north of 40,000 going into the end of the year. I'm looking for this rally to continue."

        "content": "Despite its dominant market share in the crypto sphere, Bitcoin has had limited applications compared to other blockchains which have blossomed to facilitate asset transfers in everything from financial products to video games.\n\nEthereum, for example, has close to 6,000 developers actively building on its network every month as of October 1, according to numbers from Developer Report. Bitcoin, in comparison, has just under 1,000 monthly developers.\n\nA California-based startup called ZetaChain wants to change that by including Bitcoin in the flourishing economy of decentralized finance (DeFi). Off the back of its sizable $27 million Series A raise in August, the company has been busy striking partnerships to scale its blockchain ecosystem.\n\nZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and get access to other blockchains without the need for so-called \u201cbridges\u201d or \u201cwrapped coins\u201d, which are popular solutions that solve one of the biggest hurdles in crypto today \u2014 interoperability across different networks.\n\nOne of the breakthroughs brought by ZetaChain, according to its core contributor Ankur Nandwani, is that developers can deploy smart contracts on the blockchain that can interact with native Bitcoin, essentially adding a smart contract layer to Bitcoin. First proposed by Ethereum, smart contracts are lines of code that execute on predefined rules and have given rise to a proliferation of applications like non-fungible tokens.\n\n\u201cEvery blockchain is like an isolated state and we are connecting them,\u201d said Nandwani in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cMost people use Bitcoin as gold. If you can borrow against gold, you should be able to do what you do with gold for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nToday, ZetaChain announced that it\u2019s adding native Bitcoin support to decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, letting users swap Bitcoin across 30 networks. Behind the scenes, Sushi works by deploying its EVM (Ethereum virtual machine)-compatible smart contract on ZetaChain, meaning that, for the first time, Sushi can support native Bitcoins by making minimal changes.\n\nThese Sushi smart contracts can be accessed from the Bitcoin network itself, so Bitcoin users don\u2019t even need to leave the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the increased liquidity from Bitcoin; it\u2019s about beginning a new chapter in DeFi, where we see more practical use cases of interoperability and enhanced connectivity,\u201d said Sushi\u2019s \u201chead chef\u201d Jared Grey in a statement.\n\nIn October, ZetaChain integrated with centralized exchange OKX\u2019s self-custodial wallet, allowing users to access dApps on various networks and to use their Bitcoins in dApps without the need for wrapping or bridging from the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nStarted in 2021 by serial entrepreneur Nandwani, ZetaChain announced its Series A funding round in August from investors from a range of backgrounds, including quantitative trading firm Jane Street Capital, crypto exchange Blockchain.com and China-focused early-stage VC firm Sky9."

        "content": "Ferrari\u2019s decision to allow U.S. residents to buy its cars in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) has become one of the biggest market wins in 2023, according to the CEO of the Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip.\n\nFerrari has been aware of the growing demand from clients for alternative payment solutions and decided to support dealers in meeting these clients\u2019 requests, the representative said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe source of the cryptocurrencies will be proven, and volatility risks associated with exchange rates will be eliminated. Dealers \u2014 and ultimately Ferrari \u2014 will receive payments in traditional currency and will not be managing cryptocurrencies directly.\u201d\n\nFerrari added the crypto payment support by integrating BitPay, a major crypto payment firm serving global brands like AMC Theaters, the electronics retailer Newegg and others. According to BitPay, Ferrari customers in 10 U.S. locations \u2014 including Washington and Las Vegas \u2014 can now exchange their crypto for a top Ferrari car model like SF90 Stradale, Ferrari Purosangue, Daytona SP3 and others.\n\nSF90 Stradale as one of Ferrari models that can be bought with Bitcoin. Source: BitPay\n\nAccording to CoinFlip CEO Ben Weiss, Ferrari\u2019s move to accept crypto payments is significant for the market. \u201cTheir notable reputation can increase adoption, cryptocurrency value and consumer confidence,\u201d Weiss said, suggesting that their crypto move is also likely to spark interest from lawmakers to develop clear regulatory frameworks.\n\nWeiss believes that Ferrari\u2019s push will eventually push more traditional global firms to accept Bitcoin as payment. He said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of will big-name companies follow Ferrari\u2019s footsteps, but when. Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the decade, proving it\u2019s here to stay and encouraging other big names like PayPal and BlackRock to embrace digital assets.\u201d\n\nFerrari\u2019s decision to adopt cryptocurrency payment has come in line with aspects related to environmental, social and corporate governance, the firm\u2019s representative told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThe analysis of data regarding the environmental impact associated with cryptocurrencies has been a fundamental part of our decision-making process to adopt cryptocurrencies \u2014 in line with our objective to become carbon neutral by 2030,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\nRelated: Crypto payment option for Honda cars only works via third-party platform\n\nAccording to industry analysts, the share of Bitcoin mining energy from renewable sources exceeded 50% as of mid-September 2023. However, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla still hasn\u2019t adopted the BTC payment option after halting such payments in 2021 over carbon concerns.\n\n\u201cTesla still accepts Dogecoin, and Elon continues to be a proponent of crypto,\u201d CoinFlip CEO Weiss noticed, adding that the Tesla founder could also boost crypto adoption by introducing it to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He said:\n\n\u201cElon also has significant experience with payments from his PayPal days and if Elon decides to bring payments to X, as many expect, crypto would be a natural payment rail.\u201d\n\nIn a publicly accessible doc titled \u201cWhat You Need To Know If You Use Bitcoin,\u201d Tesla listed several facts about the cryptocurrency, including that Bitcoin payments are irreversible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way the Bitcoin network works \u2014 no do-overs. So please make sure you enter the correct Bitcoin price in the amount field and the correct Bitcoin address in the recipient field,\u201d the document reads.\n\nMagazine: 5,050 Bitcoin for $5 in 2009: Helsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame"

        "content": "Analysts have indicated that bitcoin, along with other risk assets, could witness significant capital inflows next year, as market indicators suggest the Federal Reserve could pivot to a more dovish monetary policy stance.\n\nAccording to the CME's FedWatch tool, recent futures trading data suggests investors are anticipating a more dovish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe latest indications on FedWatch reveal an almost 100% probability that the Fed will maintain its target rate within the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meeting on December 13.\n\nThe data also shows that futures traders are now pricing in at least four rate cuts by the end of the Fed\u2019s December 2024 policy meeting.\n\nImpact of a Fed pivot on risk assets\n\nIn light of this consensus that the U.S. central bank could reverse its \"higher rates for longer\" monetary policy, YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha explained that this could see bitcoin surge by the end of 2024. \"In the case of a pivot to avoid a recession in the U.S., the risk assets market can get significant capital inflow in the second part of 2024,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Lienkha cautioned that the first reduction of interest rates \"will start no earlier than in the middle of 2024, which means that risk assets will be under pressure at least until then.\"\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill pointed to historic instances when loose monetary policy led to a rise in the value of bitcoin. \"The period of relaxed monetary policy between 2019 and 2021 coincided with a rise in bitcoin prices, while the subsequent tightening of monetary policy led to a decline,\" Butterfill added.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex analysts, \u201cA pivot from the Federal Reserve's current monetary tightening stance to a more accommodative policy could potentially have a positive impact on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, which have a high beta.\" Speaking to The Block, Bitfinex analysts explained that a Fed pivot would signal a decrease in risk aversion among investors. \"This could lead to increased capital inflows into riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies,\" the analysts added.\n\nAdditionally, the Bitfinex analysts said that if the Fed were to signal a rate reversal in 2024, this would suggest that the central bank is anticipating the balance to be restored in the economic metrics, \"which could further contribute to a more bullish sentiment among investors.\"\n\nBitcoin supply scarcity\n\nA Federal Reserve rate reversal could coincide with the fourth bitcoin halving. This event is estimated to occur in April 2024, when the reward for mining new blocks will be halved. The halving has implications for bitcoin supply and valuation.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"Bitcoin BTC -2.60% halvings have historically led to substantial price increases,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block. The analysts explained how the reduced supply of new bitcoins tends to create upward pressure on the price. This is assuming demand remains constant or increases.\n\n\"The event typically attracts more investors, anticipating a price rise, thereby potentially driving the price up due to increased demand,\" Bitfinex analysts added. However, they cautioned that a \u2018sell the event\u2019 phenomenon could cause a valuation drawdown, historically and technically speaking, it has been a bullish event.\n\nBitcoin liquid supply at historic low\n\nThe upcoming bitcoin halving could have an impact on the liquid supply of bitcoin, which is already at historic lows. According to analysts at Glassnode, the long-term holder bitcoin cohort is accumulating the market share of the digital asset, and gradually removing it to cold wallet storage. \"Short-term holder supply is currently at multi-year lows of 2.33 million bitcoin,\" Glassnode analysts added in a note sent to The Block.\n\n\"We will see the full impact on bitcoin supply later when the global economy overcomes current difficulties. If authorities manage to find a path to a soft landing, bitcoin price will significantly surge by the end of 2024,\" Ruslan Lienkha said.\n\nHe pointed to other indicators that show a bullish sentiment among traders. \"USDT is the main quote ticker in the market right now; most BTC purchases are made with stablecoins. Therefore, growing stablecoins capitalization combined with increasing token prices will show market saturation with liquidity and indicate sustained growth,\" Lienkha added.\n\nAdditional indicators indicating bullish sentiment\n\nAnalysts at Bitfinex added to the specific indicators that investors should be aware of when attempting to anticipate future market responses.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex, some indicators to watch are supply metrics, long-term vs short-term holder supply, and spent output age bands, or SOABs. \"Notably, the SOAB indicator recently showcased that the intra-week bitcoin price depreciation to around $34,500 actually increased supply concentration with the bitcoin holder cohort who purchased 6-18 months ago, possibly also in anticipation of the halving,\" Bitfinex analysts added.\n\nThe analysts said that in contrast to this, the supply with short-term holders, who hold for one to three months, has declined significantly. \"This is reflective of the fact that experienced investors who time the market accurately are actually increasing their holdings while new market entrants are panic selling holdings when it moves below their buying price or dips sharply,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization increased by around 0.5% in the past 24 hours to $36,516 at 12:00 p.m. in New York, according to CoinGecko."

        "title": "Decoding Bitcoin: Essential Insights for Smart Investing - The Cincinnati Enquirer",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nCryptocurrencies have disrupted the digital financial market, and needless to say, Bitcoin is ruling this realm. Despite several phases of market setbacks, the incredible rise of Bitcoin has made it a popular pick among discerning crypto investors. However, the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the wild world of crypto has also impacted the Bitcoin price with erratic twists and turns. If you are someone willing to venture into the world of crypto with Bitcoin, then learning some of the key factors associated with this digital currency is essential. These factors will offer an insight into the intricacies of this digital currency, helping you make informed decisions.\n\nTo begin with, let\u2019s decode the concept behind Bitcoin and what separates it from traditional currencies. Due to the decentralized network structure it operates on, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority and is also not a tangible asset. This network is called blockchain, where transactions are verified through cryptography. To be precise, blockchain technology is like a global digital ledger that records every Bitcoin transaction. This structure has been designed to ensure transparency and security, making Bitcoin a preferred option among investors.\n\nComing to the volatility factor, the Bitcoin price has been through a roller-coaster ride in terms of fluctuations. One day, it skyrockets, and the next day, it drops. This volatility can be either a blessing or a curse for investors. While the record rise in Bitcoin price can offer substantial gains, it can also lead to irreparable losses when it plummets. So, it is a wise idea to not just rely on Bitcoin for profit in the crypto realm. It is crucial to diversify your investments into other prospective currencies.\n\nThe regulatory policies are not talked about much but have a profound influence on the Bitcoin price. There are no standard rules for crypto transactions, so the regulations vary across countries. While some governments are more lenient on the rules, others adopt a cautionary approach to limit crypto transactions. This rapidly changing regulatory landscape leads to unforeseen market conditions, and Bitcoin is no exception. Staying informed about the recent developments in crypto regulations can help minimize potential risks when investing in Bitcoin.\n\nAdopting strong security measures is also important in Bitcoin transactions because the currency doesn't provide immunity to scams or cyber threats. With the rising number of security breaches globally leading to heavy losses for investors, looking for a reliable crypto exchange with robust security practices is imperative. A hardware wallet offers the highest security to safeguard your investment from potential cyber-attacks.\n\nBlockchain technology is constantly evolving with the innovations in the technology landscape. These also influence Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, opening new possibilities and challenges. Keeping track of all these technological advancements can provide valuable insights to assess the pattern of the Bitcoin price movement and the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin might seem attractive, but learning all the underlying factors of this currency is necessary to reduce risk and maximize gain. It is crucial to ensure a careful approach backed by in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of this market. The key to success in the crypto market is knowledge, and gaining it is a consistent process. So, before you take the plunge, earn the wisdom to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk."

Here are the basics on how Bitcoin mining works and some key risks to be aware of.\n\nBitcoin mining statistics\n\nDollar Coin\n\nA miner currently earns 6.25 Bitcoin (about $227,500 as of November 2023) for successfully validating a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCreating Bitcoin consumes 147 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, more than is used by the Netherlands or the Philippines, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nIt would take nine years of household-equivalent electricity to mine a single bitcoin as of August 2021.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been extremely volatile over time. In 2020, it traded as low as $4,107 and reached an all-time high of $68,790 in November 2021. As of November 2023, it traded for about $36,400.\n\nWhile it depends on your computing power and that of other miners, the odds of a modestly powered solo miner solving a Bitcoin hash were about 1 in 26.9 million in January 2023.\n\nThe United States (37.4 percent), Mainland China (18.1 percent) and Kazakhstan (14.0 percent) were the largest bitcoin miners as of January 2022, according to the Cambridge Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is one of the most popular types of cryptocurrencies, which are digital mediums of exchange that exist solely online. Bitcoin runs on a decentralized computer network or distributed ledger that tracks transactions in the cryptocurrency. When computers on the network verify and process transactions, new bitcoins are created, or mined. These networked computers, or miners, process the transaction in exchange for a payment in Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin is powered by blockchain, which is the technology that powers many cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all the transactions across a network. Groups of approved transactions together form a block and are joined to create a chain. Think of it as a long public record that functions almost like a long running receipt. Bitcoin mining is the process of adding a block to the chain.\n\nHow Bitcoin mining works\n\nIn order to successfully add a block, Bitcoin miners compete to solve extremely complex math problems that require the use of expensive computers and enormous amounts of electricity. To complete the mining process, miners must be first to arrive at the correct or closest answer to the question. The process of guessing the correct number (hash) is known as proof of work. Miners guess the target hash by randomly making as many guesses as quickly as they can, which requires major computing power. The difficulty only increases as more miners join the network.\n\nThe computer hardware required is known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and can cost up to $10,000. ASICs consume huge amounts of electricity, which has drawn criticism from environmental groups and limits the profitability of miners.\n\nIf a miner is able to successfully add a block to the blockchain, they will receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward. The reward amount is cut in half roughly every four years, or every 210,000 blocks. As of November 2023, Bitcoin traded at around $36,400, making 6.25 bitcoins worth $227,500.\n\nIs Bitcoin mining profitable?\n\nIt depends. Even if Bitcoin miners are successful, it\u2019s not clear that their efforts will end up being profitable due to the high upfront costs of equipment and the ongoing electricity costs. The electricity for one ASIC can use the same amount of electricity as half a million PlayStation 3 devices, according to a 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nAs the difficulty and complexity of Bitcoin mining has increased, the computing power required has also gone up. Bitcoin mining consumes about 147 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, more than most countries, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. You\u2019d need 9 years\u2019 worth of the typical U.S. household\u2019s electricity to mine just one bitcoin as of August 2021.\n\nSource: Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\n\nOne way to share some of the high costs of mining is by joining a mining pool. Pools allow miners to share resources and add more capability, but shared resources mean shared rewards, so the potential payout is less when working through a pool. The volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s price also makes it difficult to know exactly how much you\u2019re working for.\n\nHow do you start Bitcoin mining?\n\nHere are the basics you\u2019ll need to start mining Bitcoin:\n\nWallet. This is where any Bitcoin you earn as a result of your mining efforts will be stored. A wallet is an encrypted online account that allows you to store, transfer and accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Companies such as Coinbase, Trezor and Exodus all offer wallet options for cryptocurrency.\n\nMining software. There are a number of different providers of mining software, many of which are free to download and can run on Windows and Mac computers. Once the software is connected to the necessary hardware, you\u2019ll be able to mine Bitcoin.\n\nComputer equipment. The most cost-prohibitive aspect of Bitcoin mining involves the hardware. You\u2019ll need a powerful computer that uses an enormous amount of electricity in order to successfully mine Bitcoin. It\u2019s not uncommon for the hardware costs to run around $10,000 or more.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin mining\n\nPrice volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s price has varied widely since it was introduced in 2009. Since just November 2021, Bitcoin has traded for less than $20,000 and nearly as high as $69,000. This kind of volatility makes it difficult for miners to know if their reward will outweigh the high costs of mining.\n\nRegulation. Very few governments have embraced cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and many are more likely to view them skeptically because the currencies operate outside government control. There is always the risk that governments could outlaw the mining of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies altogether as China did in 2021, citing financial risks and increased speculative trading.\n\nTaxes on Bitcoin mining\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember the impact that taxes can have on Bitcoin mining. The IRS has been looking to crack down on owners and traders of cryptocurrencies as the asset prices have ballooned in recent years. Here are the key tax considerations to keep in mind for Bitcoin mining.\n\nAre you a business? If Bitcoin mining is your business, you may be able to deduct expenses you incur for tax purposes. Revenue would be the value of the bitcoins you earn. But if mining is a hobby for you, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll be able to deduct expenses.\n\nMined bitcoin is income. If you\u2019re successfully able to mine Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, the fair market value of the currencies at the time of receipt will be taxed at ordinary income rates.\n\nCapital gains. If you sell bitcoins at a price above where you received them, that qualifies as a capital gain, which would be taxed the same way it would for traditional assets such as stocks or bonds.\n\nCheck out Bankrate\u2019s cryptocurrency tax guide to learn about basic tax rules for Bitcoin, Ethereum and more.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining sounds appealing, the reality is that it\u2019s difficult and expensive to actually do profitably. The extreme volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s price adds more uncertainty to the equation.\n\nKeep in mind that Bitcoin itself is a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, which means it won\u2019t produce anything for its owner and isn\u2019t pegged to something like gold. Your return is based on selling it to someone else for a higher price, and that price may not be high enough for you to turn a profit."

The altcoin is now changing hands for $64.83 (\u00a352.28), as of the time of writing.\n\nComing hot on its heels is cardano (ADA-USD), rallying over 9% in the past 24 hours, now priced at $0.40. Both altcoins are the native tokens of layer 1 'smart contract' blockchains that are essentially rivals of the Ethereum network (ETH-USD).\n\nSolana professes to be able to settle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost compared to the Ethereum network. However, analysts argue that the former achieves this by compromising some of its overall security.\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalisation now stands at $1.48tn, up 4.5% change in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Though Bitcoin is considered to be the grandfather of crypto, it\u2019s not always talked about for its innovation or pushing the envelope. Some want it to stay that way, but not everyone.\n\nTaproot Wizards, a Bitcoin-focused Ordinals project that was inspired by the original Bitcoin wizard Reddit meme from a decade ago, is trying to change the way the blockchain is perceived. The project has raised $7.5 million in a round led by Standard Crypto, Taproot Wizards co-founders Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall shared exclusively with TechCrunch+. They declined to disclose a valuation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in Bitcoin for over a decade. We have these memories of how Bitcoin was. It was very experimental, but it changed,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe want to bring back the culture of building on Bitcoin and make it magical again.\u201d\n\nOther investors include Geometry, Collider Ventures, StarkWare, UTXO Management, Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Masterkey and Newman Capital. The money will be used to rebuild Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cwizard village,\u201d which symbolizes the ecosystem\u2019s desire to compete with other major blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. \u201cWe want to enable or introduce a new way of being a Bitcoiner,\u201d Wall said.\n\nThis investment has similar potential to the one Yuga Labs made in Bored Ape Yacht Club, said Standard Crypto co-founder Alok Vasudev. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot they can do there in building the brand, potentially other collections under the umbrella, but more interestingly we think there\u2019s also interesting infrastructure opportunities for a more dynamic Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d he said. Standard expects to be a part of that movement, rather than just a steward of an NFT collection.\n\n\u201cThe reason we went for a larger round is because we think time is of the essence,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe care a lot about Ordinals and Taproot Wizards, but our mission is bigger than that; we want to bring innovation back to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nTaproot Wizards has a limited mint of 2,121 wizards, the specific number paying homage to the total supply of bitcoin: 21 million. Of that total, 2106, or 99.3%, have been inscribed, but less than 1% \u2014 20 Taproot Wizards\u2019 Ordinals \u2014 have been distributed so far. Wertheimer said they are not sharing the exact pacing of its releases because they didn\u2019t want the hype to fade off quickly. \u201cWe want to find people on a mission, not those focused on JPEGS,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdinals have been given to active community members who participated in its \u201cwizard school\u201d or who are die-hard fans, getting tattoos or sending in videos of them showering in wizard outfits for the opportunity to claim one.\n\nOrdinals, which are comparable to NFTs, launched in December 2022 and gained significant momentum from the Bitcoin community and others in the beginning of 2023. Even though the bigger NFT industry for Ethereum- or Solana-based digital collectibles was declining in value, Ordinals were gaining traction.\n\nBy mid-March 2023, one of the biggest NFT marketplaces, Magic Eden, launched a Bitcoin-focused marketplace for Ordinals, partnering with 13 collections with the \u201cstrongest communities,\u201d including Taproot Wizards, COO and co-founder of Magic Eden Zhuoxun Yin said at the time.\n\nThe total number of inscriptions hit 40.4 million on Wednesday, up 14% from the month-ago date, according to Dune Analytics data. On November 12, the number of daily Ordinals inscribed hit an all-time high of over 505,000.\n\n\u201cIf this was just a hype thing, I wouldn\u2019t have been interested,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in Bitcoin and crypto for 10 years; we see this as an opportunity to push Bitcoin forward. Hype cycles come and go; there\u2019s a fundamental shift here.\u201d\n\nEven though there\u2019s continued growth for Ordinals, the Bitcoin community still remains divided on whether NFTs on its blockchain should happen. \u201cOrdinals started at a time where there weren\u2019t tailwinds behind it,\u201d Vasudev said. \u201c[Taproot Wizards is] growing despite headwinds, and it speaks to the power of what\u2019s here and what a company like this can serve as.\u201d\n\nSome projects, like Taproot Wizards, believe that Ordinals are a positive and fun way to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem. But other \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d criticize these projects for making a \u201cjoke\u201d of the ecosystem, taking block space on the network and raising transaction fees, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe think [Bitcoin\u2019s innovation] has been stagnating because of cultural reasons, not technical ones, and those can be solved,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cOnce that\u2019s broken, we think it\u2019s going to improve.\u201d\n\nSome people in the Bitcoin community have tried to stop the project, Wall said. \u201cThere are influential Bitcoiners who have tried to develop code or encourage miners to censor this type of activity on the block[chain], which is completely against the ethos of Bitcoin; they can\u2019t really stop us from having fun with it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is gaining traction in the NFT world, compared to Ethereum and Solana, the other biggest blockchains for NFTs, it still has room to grow. But in the past 30 days, Bitcoin was the second largest blockchain by NFT sales volume at about $163 million, up 1,074% during the time frame, behind Ethereum, which saw $279.8 million in sales, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cI think the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are definitely going to continue to exist and grow,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cBut Bitcoin and Ordinals will attract people looking for long-term value. It\u2019s a way for people to get started in Bitcoin without having to buy 10 BTC.\u201d\n\nAll in all, there\u2019s thousands (if not millions) of NFT collections out there, and it\u2019s hard for many to stand out. But the co-founders see Taproot Wizards in a different bucket.\n\n\u201cWith what we do, I don\u2019t see it as an NFT collection with a mission,\u201d Wertheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mission with an NFT collection that wants to make Bitcoin magical again. It\u2019s giving that community a symbol to go out and make it happen, which is the really important part.\u201d\n\nThe article has been updated in the seventh paragraph."

        "title": "Sushi taps into ZetaChain to begin testing native Bitcoin DeFi swaps - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "DeFi platform Sushi has partnered with interoperability platform ZetaChain to explore the possibility of native Bitcoin (BTC) swaps for its users across 30 different blockchain networks.\n\nSushi\u2019s deployment of its decentralized exchange (DEX) on ZetaChain is touted to enable trading of BTC without wrapping across several blockchains in what the team describes as a \u201cnative, decentralized and permissionless manner.\u201d\n\nThe integration is set to include Sushi\u2019s v2 and v3 automated market makers and Sushi\u2019s cross-chain swap, SushiXSwap.\n\nZetaChain core contributor Ankur Nandwani told Cointelegraph that the partnership can bring Bitcoin\u2019s vast user base to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector in a native manner. He also countered arguments suggesting that bridging BTC without wrapping the assets on another chain is not possible.\n\n\u201cThere have already been early examples like THORChain who are trading Bitcoin natively with other chain assets. Other approaches, like Bitcoin side chains, also offer a flavor,\u201d Nandwani said.\n\nHe added that ZetaChain\u2019s approach effectively allows anyone to build Bitcoin-interoperable decentralized applications (DApps) that can settle contracts and transactions natively.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are trust assumptions, namely trusting the decentralization of the network that is doing this cross-chain transaction.\u201d\n\nZetaChain has reportedly proven the technology at a testnet level and will look to prove the utility when it launches its mainnet through partnerships with SushiSwap and other DeFi protocols.\n\nSushi head chef Jared Grey hailed the integration as a significant advancement for DeFi and described the capability to swap Bitcoin natively as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for the industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the increased liquidity from Bitcoin; it\u2019s about beginning a new chapter in DeFi, where we see more practical use cases of interoperability and enhanced connectivity.\u201d\n\nSushi\u2019s integration with ZetaChain is set to take place in two phases. The first will see Sushi introduce a DEX on ZetaChain\u2019s testnet to support basic asset swaps and liquidity provision. This phase is also set to include beta testing and incentives for application testing.\n\nSushi will become one of ZetaChain\u2019s launch partners when it deploys its mainnet. The launch is expected to be followed by full functionality for Bitcoin interoperability. Nandwani outlined the technical details behind the functionality that allows for native BTC cross-chain swaps.\n\nA cross-chain swap contract is deployed on ZetaChain\u2019s Ethereum Virtual Machine. The contract is omnichain, which means that while it\u2019s deployed on ZetaChain, it can be called, and the value can be passed to it from any connected chain, including Bitcoin.\n\nCalling a cross-chain swap contract involves a user sending a regular native token transfer transaction on Bitcoin with a special memo to a TSS address. The memo contains the omnichain contract address on ZetaChain and a value that is passed to the contract. For a cross-chain swap, the value would be the destination token, for example, Ether (ETH) or USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum, as well as the recipient address on the destination chain.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin could become the foundation of DeFi with more single-sided liquidity pools\n\nThe TSS address is owned by ZetaChain signer validators. BTC transferred to the TSS address is locked, and validators observe this transfer and cast a vote about this event on ZetaChain. If enough votes are cast, the event is considered observed, and an inbound cross-chain transaction (CCTX, from Bitcoin to ZetaChain) is created.\n\nOnce a CCTX is processed, a ZetaChain omnichain contract is called, and the amount of BTC transferred to the TSS address is minted as ZRC-20 BTC. During the cross-chain swap contract execution, a ZRC-20 BTC is swapped for the ZRC-20 of another token, for example, ZRC-20 ETH.\n\nZRC-20 ETH is then finally withdrawn to the destination chain. During the withdrawal process, ZRC-20 ETH is burned, and an outbound CCTX is created from ZetaChain to Ethereum. Observer validators vote on this CCTX on ZetaChain. Once the outbound CCTX is processed, native ETH is transferred from the TSS address on Ethereum to the recipient on Ethereum.\n\nNandwani provided this example to outline how native BTC is swapped for native ETH in a decentralized manner, facilitated by ZetaChain\u2019s network validators across connected chains.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

I want to get ahead of it because there's a pretty good chance we'll see delay orders from the SEC. Delays WOULD NOT change anything about our views & 90% odds for 19b-4 approval by Jan 10, 2024 pic.twitter.com/LE7sOlHAHM \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 14, 2023\n\nFranklin Templeton was awaiting its first spot Bitcoin ETF deadline on Nov. 17, but the SEC delayed it to Jan. 1, 2024. Hashdex, whose deadline was previously also set for Nov. 17, saw its deadline moved by the SEC to Jan. 1, 2024, on Nov. 15 as well.\n\nGlobal X, another firm that hasn\u2019t amended its S-1 filing yet, is also awaiting its second spot Bitcoin ETF deadline on Nov. 21.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts like Seyffart expect the SEC to do another round of delays on decisions regarding the upcoming deadlines in the near future. However, Seyffart still believes the delays would not alter his perspective of the 90% likelihood of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF before the end of January 2024.\n\nDisclaimer: The article has been updated to reflect that the SEC delayed decisions regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs by both Franklin Templeton and Hashdex on Nov. 15.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "After a more than 80% jump in bitcoin's price in the first half of 2023, crypto market watchers gave CNBC their expectations for how the cryptocurrency will perform in the latter half of the year. STR | NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAs investors weigh year-end tax moves, there may be a lesser-known savings opportunity for certain cryptocurrency investors, experts say. After the crypto industry lost nearly $1.4 trillion in 2022, many investors leveraged tax loss harvesting, which uses losses to offset profits. But after a rally in 2023, you may consider strategically selling profitable crypto held in brokerage accounts, known as \"tax gain harvesting.\" The strategy works for investors in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket who have owned digital assets for more than one year, according to certified public accountant Tom Wheelwright, CEO of WealthAbility.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nAs of November 17, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the beginning of 2023, and some investors now have \"built-in gains,\" Wheelwright said. Those in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket can \"sell it, recognize the gain and buy it back immediately\" because there's no so-called wash sale rule for gains, he said. You calculate gains by subtracting the asset's sales price from the \"basis\" or original cost. But when you repurchase the currency, the basis adjusts to the new purchase price, known as a \"step-up in basis.\" If prices continue to climb and you sell the asset again later, the higher basis means future profits will be smaller. Investors \"really ought to be paying attention\" to tax-free opportunities to harvest crypto gains, according to Wheelwright. Of course, the decision to repurchase crypto depends on your risk tolerance and goals.\n\nWhy it's a 'wiser strategy' to harvest gains\n\nIf you fall into the 0% bracket, crypto tax-gain harvesting is a \"wiser strategy\" than harvesting losses, especially when immediately buying back the asset, explained Andrew Gordon, tax attorney, CPA and president of Gordon Law Group. Tax-loss harvesting has been popular among crypto investors because of a wash sale loophole. The IRS disallows a loss for other assets if investors buy a \"substantially identical\" asset within the 30-day window before or after the sale. The wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto losses or gains for any asset. Still, the tax gain strategy allows you to sell at a gain and pay no tax, whereas \"tax loss harvesting defers future tax,\" Gordon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nHow to know your capital gains bracket\n\nFor 2023, you may fall into the 0% long-term capital gains rate with taxable income of $44,625 or less for single filers and $89,250 or less for married couples filing jointly. That's based on \"taxable income,\" which is significantly lower than gross earnings. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income."

        "content": "In a dynamic intersection of technology, finance, and innovation, Sora Summit 2023 is set to unfold on December 16 at the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park in Taipei. This eagerly anticipated event, organized by Sora Ventures, a digital asset venture capital firm, promises to be the pinnacle of Taipei Blockchain Week.\n\nA Legacy of Collaboration and Excellence\n\nSora Summit made its debut in 2018 in Macau, attracting over 1,000 participants and featuring more than 100 speakers from globally recognized entities such as Pantera Capital and Binance Labs. The summit has since evolved into a benchmark for quality information, distinguished speakers, and high-profile attendees, setting the stage for collaborative efforts within the Bitcoin community.\n\n\u201cThe development of bitcoin utility will be far more relevant tobitcoin pricethan anyone can imagine. Historically, utility has been the core factor to price increase on any blockchain,\u201d said Jason Fang, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at Sora Ventures. \u201cSora\u2019s investment team feels very strongly about this trend and we are eager to share our knowledge and resources through Sora Summit.\u201d\n\nFour Pillars of Focus\n\nThis year, Sora Summit returns with a renewed commitment to fostering collaboration and exploring the latest trends in the Bitcoin space. The event will revolve around four key sectors, each crucial to the evolution of Bitcoin and digital assets:\n\nBitcoin Ecosystem: Delving into the recent surge in Bitcoin's utility and value, the summit aims to unravel the intricacies of the Bitcoin ecosystem with insights from industry leaders.\n\nDecentralized Science: As the future of open-sourced scientific research takes center stage, the summit will facilitate discussions on the transformative potential of decentralized science.\n\nCryptography & Encryption: Tackling the pressing challenges of data privacy, experts will converge to propose innovative solutions within the realm of cryptography and encryption.\n\nOrdinals: Exploring the next phase for greater adoption, Sora Summit will shed light on the evolving landscape of Ordinals, Inscriptions and their expanding utilities and use cases.\n\nDistinguished Speakers Shaping the Dialogue\n\nThis year's summit boasts an impressive lineup of speakers representing prominent organizations within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Notable figures include Casey Rodarmor, the Creator of the Ordinals Protocol, Danny Yang, CEO at Metagood and OnChainMonkey, David Bailey, CEO at Bitcoin Magazine, and Domo, the Creator of BRC-20 standard and the token ORDI. These speakers bring a wealth of experience and expertise, ensuring diverse perspectives on the critical issues facing the Bitcoin industry today.\n\nTaipei: A Pivotal Hub for Blockchain Innovation\n\nFang highlighted the significance of choosing Taipei as the host city. He emphasized Taipei's unique position in bridging the East and West in the Bitcoin landscape, citing the city's immense potential to contribute to the industry ecosystem. \u201cA lot of people in our industry have heard about Ordinals and decentralized science, but not many people actually understand what the technology does,\u201d explained Fang. \u201cThis is why we\u2019re hosting Sora Summit, so we can fill the knowledge gap for those who are keen to hear about the future narratives in Bitcoin.\u201d By partnering with Taipei Blockchain Week, Sora Summit aims to underscore Taipei's importance within the global blockchain community, providing an unparalleled platform for participants to learn, network, and collaborate.\n\nA Confluence of Minds and Technologies\n\nAs Sora Summit 2023 prepares to unfold in Taipei, the anticipation is palpable. With a focus on the Bitcoin ecosystem and a diverse array of sectors critical to the future of digital commerce, the summit promises to be a melting pot of ideas, collaboration, and innovation. The distinguished speakers will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the discourse and steering the Bitcoin industry toward new horizons. As the world eagerly awaits the insights and collaborations that will emerge, Sora Summit 2023 stands as a testament to the continued evolution and maturation of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFor more information and to register for Sora Summit 2023, click here.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application was again the talk of the crypto town this week\u2014but this time triggered by its \u201cTether FUD.\u201d\n\nAlthough the filing is from June, industry watchers recently pointed out that the world\u2019s biggest fund manager had included warnings about how Tether\u2014and the stablecoin market in general\u2014could negatively impact the Wall Street titan\u2019s Bitcoin ambitions.\n\nCrypto critic and pseudonymous Twitter user @Bitfinexed pointed out that \u201cBlackRock is spreading Tether \u2018FUD\u2019,\u201d labeling a section in BlackRock\u2019s filing that asserted that the price of Bitcoin could be affected by stablecoins as seeding \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat could BlackRock's endgame be here?\n\nNeato. BlackRock is spreading Tether \u201cFUD\u201d. Mentions unbanked stablecoins can create artificial demand. Discloses Tether fraud has been sanctioned for unbacked tethers. Discloses Tether laundering money. I guess the FUD is super effective. pic.twitter.com/av6JMp8IGX \u2014 Bitfinex'ed \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc27 \u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1 \ud83c\udffa (@Bitfinexed) November 13, 2023\n\nFirst things first: BlackRock, which has over $9 trillion in assets under management, sent shockwaves through the crypto world when it filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June. The prestigious fund manager\u2019s application\u2014and subsequent comments from CEO Larry Fink\u2014has led people to believe that Bitcoin is just a stone\u2019s throw away from massive institutional adoption.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn\u2019t yet approved a Bitcoin ETF, experts say it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nEvery ETF application needs to disclose risks. So, what was the \u201cTether FUD\u201d?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile the trust does not invest in stablecoins, it may nonetheless be exposed to risks that stablecoins pose for the bitcoin market and other digital asset markets,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s filing read. \u201cBecause a large portion of the digital asset market still depends on stablecoins such as Tether and USDC, there is a risk that a disorderly de-pegging or a run on Tether or USDC could lead to dramatic market volatility in digital assets more broadly.\u201d\n\nTether mints USDT\u2014the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a market cap of $87 billion.\n\nUSDT is the most-traded digital asset. As a stablecoin\u2014a cryptocurrency backed by a stable asset\u2014it is used to enter and exit trades quickly and without using a traditional bank or fiat currency.\n\nIt is especially useful when dollars are restricted or unavailable, particularly in the sphere of DeFi, which seeks to disintermediate banks.\n\nBut Tether is controversial: it has been slow to provide documentation to prove that U.S. dollars back USDT, and the entity is not independently audited.\n\nIn 2021, Tether agreed to no longer do business in New York after a two-year New York Attorney General investigation found it had \u201cmade false statements about the backing\u201d of its stablecoin.\n\nAnd BlackRock had to disclose this\u2014concerns around the impact a stablecoin collapse like Tether could have on Bitcoin and the crypto market are not overblown: when algorithmic stablecoin Terra UST imploded last year, Bitcoin took a heavy hit\u2014and the rest of the digital asset market followed.\n\nFierce critics of Tether will continue to doom-monger; they have always said that Tether could harm Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this is just hypothetical\u2014and BlackRock needed to mention whatever could theoretically happen to the crypto market.\n\nTether didn\u2019t answer Decrypt\u2019s emailed questions, but VanEck strategy advisor Gabor Gurbacs said on Twitter that there was \u201cnot much to read into\u201d the comments from BlackRock.\n\nRegulators also flagged potential risks around a number of digital asset market structure matters (including stablecoins) many years ago. As a result, of course ETF issuers will do their best to disclose any potential risk. This is standard process and prudent practice. \u2014 Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) November 14, 2023\n\n\u201cETF issuers do list all risks that they can think of for disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. Dollar itself and banking availability are risks, and so are electric outages and natural disasters.\u201d\n\nHe added that mentioning any risk was \u201cprudent practice.\u201d"

Both facilities were managed and built by a man surnamed Huang (\u9ec3).\n\nThe police determined that the mining operation was part of a bigger operation and launched a larger investigation in cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nIn May, the prosecutors and the police found that Huang had built three other bitcoin mining farms in Taichung's South, Central and Dali districts, which were also stealing power.\n\nThe police asked the court for permission to detain Huang and their request was approved.\n\nWhile collecting evidence, the police subsequently found three other mining farms in Taichung's North, Central and Xitun districts, indicating that a criminal ring was running a total of eight mining farms.\n\nFrom July to September, the investigation continued and four people were arrested, including an investor in the operation surnamed Cheng (\u912d), Cheng's wife surnamed Su (\u8607), another bitcoin mining farm builder also surnamed Huang, and an individual who rented the locations.\n\nAccording to the police, 700 mining machines were confiscated in raids conducted from March to September. Prosecutors will ask the court to seize the NT$4 million in profit the operation made and make the five suspects pay the cost of the electricity they stole, which was NT$76.83 million, according to Taipower.\n\nAt the same time, prosecutors highlighted that the wiring in two of the farms was dangerously close to being burned through.\n\nIn the event of a fire, public safety would have been severely impacted and so prosecutors have asked the court to hand down heavy sentences to everyone involved."

        "content": "As managers investing on behalf of clients, we are constantly monitoring on-chain analytics to ensure we are making informed decisions. You can gather a lot of useful, actionable information with on-chain analytics. For example, you can look at unique wallet addresses. If this is growing rapidly it could mean that adoption of the project is picking up. You could also look at wallet activity if there are a lot of transactions, addresses sending crypto back and forth, it could indicate that the project has a meaningful user base and it is not solely being traded on centralized exchanges. You can also see what percentage of the supply of a token is held by the largest wallet addresses. This is important because the main ethos of crypto is decentralization and giving autonomy to its users. However if a project\u2019s tokens are more or less held by a few large wallets then this leads to a centralization that allows a few whales to manipulate, price, rewards, governance, etc. These are just a few examples. Analysis of this data is constantly evolving and new, meaningful relationships, ratios, and statistics are being discovered and tracked. And since this is done on public ledgers, anyone with an internet connection can do their own analysis. \u2013 Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM"
