        "content": "Crypto exchange Coinbase currently holds over $25 billion in bitcoin, establishing itself as the world\u2019s largest bitcoin custody entity, with nearly 5% of all bitcoin in circulation.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s holdings are roughly equivalent to the stash held by Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic individual or group credited with creating bitcoin and authoring the original white paper in 2008, according to Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe identified sum was spread across 36 million deposit and holding addresses used by Coinbasein, Arkham reported in a Saturday post on X. The largest cold wallet identified held about 10,000 bitcoin.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBut the blockchain analytics company suggested that the exchange probably holds thousands more bitcoins that have not been categorized yet, based on latest financial data from Coinbase. Ongoing analysis will aim to uncover these additional addresses.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s custody of ether (ETH) is significantly smaller when compared to its bitcoin holdings. As per Arkham\u2019s data, the exchange held about $2.6 billion in ether.\n\nThe fact that Coinbase may hold as much bitcoin (BTC) as Nakamoto is notable because it is widely believed that the mysterious bitcoin creator mined an impressive amount of bitcoin, with estimates ranging from 600,000 BTC (equivalent to $13 billion) to as much as 1.1 million BTC ($23.8 billion) during the cryptoasset\u2019s early years.\n\nTracking the whereabouts of all these bitcoins is considered somewhat challenging due to their dispersion across numerous addresses.\n\nShould the upper estimate prove accurate, Nakamoto would find themselves among the top 50 billionaires globally, closely trailing Chanel chairman Alain Wertheimer.\n\nThe identity of the Bitcoin creator has remained unverified, although one public profile which claimed association with Nakamoto indicated a location in Japan.\n\nIn Nakamoto\u2019s writings, they variously used both American and British English spellings, as well as idiomatic expressions. This has led some to question whether the inventor\u2019s claimed Japanese identity is accurate.\n\nThere have also been observations regarding the timestamps on Nakamoto\u2019s comments, which have led some to speculate that they might not have been located in Japan while working on Bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell Monday morning in Asia to trade below US$26,300. Ether also dipped and remained below the US$1,600 mark. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were down. Toncoin led the losers with a slide of over 4% over the past 24 hours. The retreat in cryptos follows the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish policy stance at its September meeting. Although it paused interest hikes, the Fed signalled another raise to come by the end of the year, with rates to remain higher for longer than anticipated. U.S. stock futures were up during early morning trading in Asia. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower on Friday for a week of losses.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,300 with more declines expected\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.22% in the last 24 hours to US$26,252.57 as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency posted a weekly loss of 0.91%. It was hovering above US$26,500 over the weekend but lost the support line early Monday morning.\n\n\u201cOverall, the trend is down and stays bearish,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote in a report Monday.\n\nAs Bitcoin failed to break its 50-day moving average of US$26,876, more downward movement is expected.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin trades below US$26,000 then the market might attempt another break lower,\u201d Thielen said. He added that \u201cOctober tends to be seasonal bullish for Bitcoin, but we would stay cautious without a break above its 50d MA.\u201d\n\nEther dipped 0.86% to US$1,579.12, trading 2.52% lower for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe mostly worry about Ethereum as weak fundamentals plus a lack of hype around the EIP-4844 upgrade (which should come sometime in Q4 2023) could make the blockchain slowly obsolete,\u201d said Thielen.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s failure to rally above US$1,650 is of the utmost concern as a break lower could have major implications for the altcoin sentiment,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nStory continues\n\nEIP-4844, also known as the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade, is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that aims to improve the speed and cost-effectiveness of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe average fee on the Ethereum blockchain dropped to around US$1.15 per transaction on Saturday, the lowest level since December 2022, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Ethereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction. Historically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels. https://t.co/MpOLfMYKUp pic.twitter.com/JI8ZLhmb4p \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 23, 2023\n\n\u201cHistorically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels,\u201d wrote Santiment in a Saturday Twitter post.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses for the past 24 hours. Toncoin led the losers, falling 4.22% to US$2.20 for a weekly loss of 3.98%. But the native token of the Open Network (TON) still posted a monthly rise of more than 50%\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.0% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume edged up 8.42% to US$17.64 billion.\n\nU.S. equities traders were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019 ahead of Fed meeting\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading the losers with a 0.31% drop.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed the week lower. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped 2.93% and 3.62% respectively, both registering their largest weekly declines since March.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Thursday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all dropped. The Hang Seng led the losses with a 0.99% decline while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was up 0.61%.\n\nInvestors are digesting the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish monetary policy outlook. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, but revised its economic projection to indicate one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. It also projects slower-than-expected rate cuts throughout 2024.\n\nZachary Hill, head of portfolio management at the U.S.-based investment manager Horizon Investments, told Reuters on Saturday that the past week has seen \u201csome Fed messaging colliding with overly optimistic equity investors.\u201d\n\nThose investors have \u201cwanted to trade peak interest rates for almost a year now.\u201d But the Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech and the Fed\u2019s projection showed that the central bank \u201cdoesn\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet,\u201d said Hill.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s remarks, U.S. 10-year treasury yields closed at 4.44% on Friday, after briefly rising above 4.5% on Thursday for the first time since 2007.\n\nExplaining the central bank\u2019s hawkish stance, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday the latest consumer price index (CPI) indicated a rise in inflation. That coincides with rising oil prices. Bowman said that the continued risk of rising energy prices could \u201creverse some of the progress\u201d she said has been made on inflation in recent months.\n\n\u201cI expect it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to return inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way,\u201d Bowman added.\n\nThe global oil price benchmark Brent futures traded at around US$92 as of 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. That is an increase of over 11% in the past 30 days. Morgan Stanley on Thursday raised its fourth-quarter Brent forecast from US$82.5 per barrel to US$95. But the U.S. investment giant said a price above US$100 would seem \u201cstretched\u201d, according to a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 74.6% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 73.8% on Friday. It also gives a 59.3% chance of another pause in December, up from 54.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, S&P on Monday lowered its projection for China\u2019s 2023 economic growth from 5.2% to 4.8%. It cited the country\u2019s limited fiscal and monetary easing policies as reasons for the decline.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Crypto traders shift focus to 4 altcoins as Bitcoin price flatlines - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range for the past three days, even with the S&P 500 falling for the last four days of the week. This is a positive sign, as it shows that cryptocurrency traders are not panicking and rushing to the exit.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply seems to be gradually shifting to stronger hands. Citing Glassnode data, analyst CryptoCon said that Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STHs) \u2014 investors who have held their coins for 155 days or less \u2014 are holding the least amount of Bitcoin supply in more than a decade.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIn the short term, the uncertainty regarding Bitcoin\u2019s next directional move may be keeping traders at bay and could be one of the reasons for the subdued price action in several large altcoins. However, it\u2019s not all negative across the board, with several altcoins showing signs of recovery in the near term.\n\nCould Bitcoin shake out from its slumber and start a bullish move in the near term? Would that act as a catalyst for an altcoin rally? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may lead the charge higher.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nThe bulls have managed to sustain Bitcoin\u2019s price above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $26,523, but they have failed to start a strong rebound. This indicates a lack of demand at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint show a status of equilibrium between the buyers and sellers. A break below the 20-day EMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The BTC/USDT pair could then descend to the formidable support at $24,800.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rises from the current level and climbs above the 50-day simple moving average of $26,948, it will signal that buyers are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $28,143.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile BTC has been trading below the moving averages on the 4-hour chart, the bears have failed to start a downward move. This suggests that selling is drying up at lower levels. Meanwhile, the bulls will try to propel Bitcoin\u2019s price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $27,400 and subsequently to $28,143.\n\nIf the bears want to seize control, they will have to sink and sustain BTC\u2019s price below $26,200. That could first yank it down to $25,750 and then to the $24,800 support level.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) surged above the downtrend line on Sept. 22, indicating a potential trend change in the near term.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the buyers have the upper hand. On any correction, the bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA of $6.55. A strong rebound off this level will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls will then try to extend the up-move to $8 and eventually to $8.50. If the bears want to prevent that up-move, they will have to sink and sustain the LINK/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA.\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive zone. The bulls have been buying the dips to the 20-EMA, indicating a positive sentiment. If LINK\u2019s price rebounds off the 20-EMA, $7.60 will then be the upside target to watch.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if Chainlink\u2019s price continues lower and skids below the 20-EMA, it will signal profit-booking by the bulls. LINK may then retest the breakout level from the downtrend line. The bears will have to sink it below $6.60 to be back in control.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) turned down from the overhead resistance at $1,370 on Sept. 21, indicating that the bears are trying to defend the level.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA of $1,226 is the support to watch for the downside. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that lower levels are continuing to attract buyers. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive MKR\u2019s price above the overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the MKR/USDT pair could accelerate toward $1,759.\n\nConversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. That could keep the pair range-bound between $980 and $1,370 for a few days.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers shove the price above $1,306, the MKR price could sprint toward $1,370.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below $1,264, it will suggest that the selling pressure is increasing. That could clear the path for a further decline to $1,225. A slide below this support may tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is in a downtrend. The bears are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA of $0.85, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground. This suggests that the bulls are trying to hold on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RSI has risen above 40, indicating that the momentum is gradually turning positive. If buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The ARB/USDT pair could first rally to the 50-day SMA of $0.95 and thereafter to $1.04.\n\nThe support on the downside is $0.80 and then $0.78. Sellers will have to drag ARB\u2019s price below this zone to make room for a retest of the support near $0.74. A break below this level will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling the rallies to the downtrend line. The bears pulled the price below the moving averages but could not sink ARB below the immediate support at $0.81. This suggests that the bulls are trying to form a higher low.\n\nBuyers will again try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, Arbitrum\u2019s price is likely to start a strong recovery toward the psychological level of $1. Contrarily, a break below $0.81 can tug the ARB price to $0.78 and subsequently to $0.74.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nTheta Network (THETA) soared above the 20-day EMA of $0.61 on Sept. 23, indicating that the bulls have absorbed the supply and are attempting a comeback.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears have pulled the price back below the 50-day SMA of $0.64, but the bulls are expected to defend the 20-day EMA. If THETA price turns up from the current level and climbs above the 50-day SMA, it will enhance the prospects of a retest of $0.70.\n\nThis is an important level to keep an eye on because if it is scaled, the THETA/USDT pair may reach $0.76. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA. That opens the door for a potential retest of $0.57.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are protecting the overhead resistance at $0.65. If buyers want to sustain the bullish momentum, they will have to drive THETA above $0.65. If they do that, the pair is likely to start a new up-move toward $0.70.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is the important support to watch for on the downside. If bears sink the price below this support, it will indicate that the bulls are closing their positions. The pair may then descend toward the $0.58 support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With this most recent acquisition, MicroStrategy has solidified its place as one of the leading institutional investors in Bitcoin.\n\nThose who have been monitoring MicroStrategy\u2019s progress in the cryptocurrency space are not surprised by the decision.\n\nWhen it made its maiden acquisition in August 2020, the corporation launched its first foray into Bitcoin investments. Since then, it has kept acquiring Bitcoin, even financing some of its purchases with loans.\n\nAs this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo demonstrates, Saylor has maintained that Bitcoin is \u201cunderestimated\u201d in comparison to other crypto industry potential. Saylor has frequently said that altcoins should be sold because they are overpriced.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain if more institutions will emulate MicroStrategy as Bitcoin gains recognition as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic volatility.\n\nApproved BTC ETF Hopes Dash as SEC Continues to Defer Decision\n\nThe allure of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had Bitcoin enthusiasts riding high on a wave of excitement this past summer, but it appears the tide has abruptly flipped.\n\nDespite earlier indications to the contrary, achieving approval for a US Bitcoin ETF still appears to be a distant goal.\n\nAs the drama plays out, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to put off the approval of large asset management companies like Fidelity and Invesco\u2019s applications for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen BlackRock Inc., a major fund company, got on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon in June, many people thought they might be holding the magic wand.\n\nBTC Price Rose\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price increased due to the speculative nature of the cryptosphere, under the assumption that BlackRock had an advantage over its rivals. But as it is, BlackRock\u2019s participation has merely increased tension and brought about eventual disappointment.\n\nAfter BlackRock\u2019s announcement, Bitcoin prices did indicate a hopeful 20% increase, but by August, the steady rise abruptly came to an end. The reason? Due to rising interest rates, there has been a long waiting period and a decline in the general enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is well aware of the unpredictable relationship between Bitcoin and ETFs. By the conclusion of the week, Bitcoin had entered its third straight dip after a roller-coaster of price changes, hovering around the $25,700 level.\n\nEven worse, the SEC\u2019s postponements of the ETF ruling served as further proof of the market\u2019s inherent fragility.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that October will serve as the final month. The SEC is now on a 45-day countdown to provide their next answer because of the recent deferments that are still in effect. This implies that the cryptosphere will undoubtedly awaken by mid-October.\n\nIn addition, the SEC will need to decide how to respond to the Grayscale ruling. The introduction of ether-futures ETFs, which, rumors have it, the SEC might just approve, is a third change to look forward to in the upcoming month."

Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.\n\nAll the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is \"underestimated\" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.\n\nWith the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and major Bitcoin (BTC) investor, is sending a bullish signal to the market by announcing the acquisition of another big stash of cryptocurrency.\n\nMichael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, took to X (formerly Twitter) on Sept. 25 to announce a 5,445 BTC purchase by the firm. The coins were bought for $147.3 million in cash at an average price of $27,053 per BTC.\n\nAccording to a Form 8-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries acquired the amount between Aug. 1 and Sept. 24.\n\nAs of Sept. 24, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held an aggregate of approximately 158,245 BTC, which was acquired at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per coin, inclusive of fees and expenses, the filing notes. The aggregate purchase price for MicroStrategy\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings amounts to $4.68 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC for ~$147.3 million at an average price of $27,053 per #bitcoin. As of 9/24/23 @MicroStrategy hodls 158,245 $BTC acquired for ~$4.68 billion at an average price of $29,582 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/GbJtUoQfXv \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) September 25, 2023\n\nThe new purchase comes as Bitcoin has traded sideways at around $26,000 over the past few weeks. After briefly touching $28,000 on Aug. 29, Bitcoin slipped to as low as $25,000 on Sept. 11. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,081, down 1.9% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency is also down around 4% over the past seven days.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bought by corporate giants should not be feared \u2014 Michael Saylor\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s latest purchase further reaffirms the company\u2019s bullish stance on Bitcoin. The firm previously bought 12,333 BTC for $347 million in June 2023 at an average purchase price of $29,668 per coin.\n\nIn Q1 2023, MicroStrategy reported its first profitable quarter since 2020 due to a one-time income tax benefit. The company managed to retain profitability in the next quarter, reporting $22.2 million in net income in early August.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: PEX staff flee event as scandal hits, Mt.

        "content": "Bitcoin continued to fall in Monday afternoon trade in Asia, along with Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, except Tron. Toncoin was the biggest loser. Global cryptocurrency markets weakened after the U.S. Federal Reserve at its September meeting indicated another interest rate hike by the end of the year, signaling that rates will remain higher for longer than anticipated.\n\nSee related article: South Korean entertainment firm NHN to build blockchain games on Sui despite local ban\n\nTron only gainer among top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin lost 1.44% to US$26,182 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency was hovering above US$26,500 over the weekend but lost the support level early Monday morning.\n\nEthereum also posted losses, dropping 0.69% to US$1,580 in the past 24 hours and 3.27% on the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since Thursday.\n\nEIP-4844, also known as the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade, is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that aims to improve the speed and cost-effectiveness of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe average fee on the Ethereum blockchain dropped to around US$1.15 per transaction on Saturday, the lowest level since December 2022, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment.\n\n\u201cEthereum generated US$17.9 million in fees last week, the lowest since Dec. 26. Fees have peaked out in May this year and are gradually declining, this continues to be a crucial development for Ether prices. With less than one week left in September, fees are (so far) 50% less than in August,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe mostly worry about Ethereum as weak fundamentals plus a lack of hype around the EIP-4844 upgrade (which should come sometime in Q4 2023) could make the blockchain slowly obsolete. Holders do not have unlimited patience and these upgrades are not fast enough and are marginal,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos fell except Tron, which rose 0.41% to US$0.08434 in the past 24 hours, and gained 0.53% on the week.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dropped 1.05% to US$1.04 trillion, while market volume gained 51.52% to US$22.17 billion.\n\nNFT market trade mixed\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.62% to US$1,953.35 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.82%.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum and Polygon indexes also dropped while Solana index rose.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume gained 6.83% to US$9,746,899, while the number of NFT buyers increased 5.93% to US$48,312, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nAmong blockchains, the Ethereum network topped rankings, gaining 33.47% to US$4.7 million. Polygon and Mythos blockchains ranked second and third respectively.\n\nPolygon-based DraftKings topped rankings among collections, but dropped 30.06% to US$1.04 million.\n\nMost global equities drop\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nMajor Asian equity markets dropped on Monday. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, the Shenzhen Component Index, South Korea\u2019s Kospi, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng declined, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened at the end of trading hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures were down as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures as well as the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the red.\n\nThe U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, but revised its economic projection to indicate one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. It also projects slower-than-expected rate cuts throughout 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com said Monday it will invest as much as US$4 billion in an attempt to become a major player in generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s investment into a ChatGPT rival reinforces why almost all investors should have some AI exposure in their investment mix,\u201d Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis tech has the potential to disrupt existing industries or create entirely new ones. Early investors are likely to benefit from the exponential growth that often accompanies the adoption of such technologies. As these innovations gain traction, their valuations could skyrocket, resulting in significant returns on investment,\u201d Green added.\n\nEuropean bourses weakened on Monday morning in Europe with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 lower. Traders continue to assess central bank activities from last week. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, France\u2019s central bank governor, told CNBC that it is \u201cpremature\u201d to bet on an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank.\n\n\u201cWe should remain at this level for a sufficiently long period of time. Betting now on the next cut is probably premature,\u201d de Galhau said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat below US$26,300 Tuesday morning in Asia. Ether also edged up but remained below the US$1,600 mark. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while recording marginal gains in the past 24 hours, logged losses for the week. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners. Cryptos, along with global equities, face pressure from interest rate hike concerns and rising treasury yields. U.S. stock futures were flat during early morning trading in Asia after Wall Street closed higher on Monday. That rise broke a four-day losing streak triggered by hawkishness from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nLosses for short-term Bitcoin holders\n\nBitcoin was little changed as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, trading at US$26,276.60 for a weekly loss of 1.78%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency dropped to US$26,011.47 on Monday evening, the lowest price since Sept. 13.\n\nEther also remained flat. It edged up 0.35% to US$1,586.87 but is down 3.06% for the past seven days. The token touched a high of US$1,595.84 on early Tuesday morning, but failed to move above the US$1,600 resistance level.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency market sentiment remains weak, amid declines in global stock markets, a strong dollar and rising yields putting pressure on risk assets,\u201d Hani Abuagla, senior market analyst at online trading broker XTB MENA, said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe economic policies enacted by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, have redirected capital towards less risky investments such as government bonds,\u201d said Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cThese bonds currently offer an attractive risk/reward ratio, offering a passive income while mitigating portfolio risk,\u201d Greco added.\n\nCiting data from blockchain tracker Glassnode, XTB MENA\u2019s Abuagla noted that over 97.5% of addresses owned by short-term Bitcoin holders are posting losses \u2014 an 11 month high. Short-term holders (STH) are those traders that have bought Bitcoin over the last 155 days.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis may mean that the pressure to sell BTC at a loss in the STH pool may be growing, as evidenced by the previous pattern of on-chain behavior (when the price fell below the average STH purchase price of BTC),\u201d said Abuagla.\n\nMeanwhile, Abuagla said that a drop in Bitcoin prices could be a \u201ccontrary signal\u201d indicating an oversold market. That may present a potential accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, he added.\n\nMicroStrategy, the U.S.-based analytics firm founded by Michael Saylor, revealed on Monday it purchased nearly US$150 million worth of Bitcoin from Aug.1 to Sept. 24 at an average price of about US$27,053 per coin.\n\nAs of Sept. 24, MicroStrategy held around 158,245 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly US$4.68 billion.\n\n\u201cWhile this is bullish and shows continued faith and strong buying pressure, crypto markets didn\u2019t really react. Ironically, MicroStrategy\u2019s buying announcements have historically been followed by mild pull-backs instead of rises, and the crypto space might be cautious about buying,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing happens in an environment where investors are still digesting the Fed\u2019s speech hinting at higher rates for longer, and therefore presumed lower valuations for most risk assets,\u201d added d\u2019Anethan.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains for the past 24 hours. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners. The token rose 1.10% to US$0.2453 but lost 2.49% for the week.\n\nToncoin was the only top-10 non-stablecoin token to record a 24-hour loss. It dropped 1.83% to US$2.16 for a weekly loss of 10.28%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.28% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 40.50% to US$24.94 billion.\n\nU.S. equities drop, China\u2019s property woes continue\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Nasdaq led the losses with a 0.40% drop. Wall Street closed higher Monday following a sharp decline Friday.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Tuesday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all dipped. The Kospi led the declines with a 1.14% drop. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.14%.\n\nBoth the S&P and Nasdaq indexes last Friday logged their biggest weekly losses since March. That followed U.S. Federal Reserve comments last week indicating it will keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nChuck Carlson, chief executive officer at the U.S.-based investment advisor Horizon Investment Services, told Reuters Tuesday that he sees a \u201ctug of war\u201d dynamic playing among investors. There are now two groups, he said. Those concerned by Fed hawkishness and \u201cbulls wondering maybe we have seen the correction and we can start to build from these levels higher.\u201d\n\nKey economic data releases this week include the U.S. second-quarter gross domestic output (GDP) and personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE). Both are expected Thursday. Analysts project an acceleration in U.S. GDP growth and a slowdown in core PCE, according to Investing.com.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year treasury yield rose on Monday to close at 4.542%. That was the highest closing price since October 2007.\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 81.5% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 74.6% on Monday. It also gives a 60.9% chance of another pause in December, up from 59.3% on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis at China\u2019s real estate giant Evergrande Group worsened Monday. The firm\u2019s mainland China unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co., defaulted on principal and interest payments totaling about US$547 million due Sept. 25. The firm\u2019s shares dropped 21.8% on Monday to their lowest closing level since Sept. 5.\n\nEvergrande filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in August 2023 after its default on a dollar bond in December 2021 triggered widespread turmoil in the Chinese real estate industry.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, announced its latest acquisition of the market\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nPer an SEC filing submitted on Monday, between August 1 and September 24, the firm and its subsidiaries purchased approximately 5,445 Bitcoin for about $147.3 million in cash. The average price per coin, inclusive of fees and expenses, was approximately $27,053.\n\nWith this recent purchase, MicroStrategy has swelled its coffers to an aggregate of about 158,245 Bitcoin purchased at an average purchase price of approximately $29,582.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe aggregate purchase price for MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings has amounted to $4.68 billion, per the filing.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC for ~$147.3 million at an average price of $27,053 per #bitcoin. As of 9/24/23 @MicroStrategy hodls 158,245 $BTC acquired for ~$4.68 billion at an average price of $29,582 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/GbJtUoQfXv \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) September 25, 2023\n\nWhile MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin once again underscores the company's confidence in the asset as a store of value and a long-term investment, the continued bear market also means that it is significantly in the red on its historical investments in the first cryptocurrency.\n\nWith Bitcoin down 1.7% on the day and trading just above $26,100 at the time of writing, the fiat value of Bitcoin held on MicroStrategy's balance sheet is currently standing at roughly $4.1 billion.\n\nThe firm previously bought 12,333 BTC for $347 million in June 2023, at an average purchase price of $29,668 per BTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMicroStrategy began acquiring cryptocurrency back in August 2020, with co-founder Michael Saylor stating at that time that the primary motivation was to use it as a hedge against inflation.\n\nEarlier this year, Saylor said the company\u2019s strategy \u201cis to buy and hold Bitcoin, and the key for us is to be consistent, transparent and responsible in the pursuit of that strategy.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy saw its first profitable quarter since 2020 in Q1 2023, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit, sustaining profitability in the second quarter with $22.2 million in net income\u2014despite a $24.1 million impairment charge on its Bitcoin holdings."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin in Dubai - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Dubai is a magnificent city to live and work in. But how can someone buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is Dubai crypto-friendly?\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide with the answers. The great news is that, yes, buying Bitcoin (BTC) in the United Arab Emirates is permitted, and the country is actually one of the most welcoming to cryptocurrency exchanges and investors.\n\nIs Dubai crypto-friendly?\n\nThe thriving metropolis of Dubai in the UAE has long been deemed a crypto-friendly city. Some describe the UAE as the most crypto-friendly country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is zero tax to pay on cryptocurrency trading in the UAE, as well as zero income or capital gains tax. This combination has made the Middle Eastern country massively attractive to cryptocurrency and blockchain companies and the users of these technologies. There are many UAE crypto traders and plenty of crypto investment options in the UAE.\n\nBut is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Dubai and the UAE have some regulations on cryptocurrencies, including policies to protect investors. Cryptocurrencies are not licensed or recognized as legal tender; however, there are no laws against buying Bitcoin in the UAE or owning or trading Bitcoin or other crypto.\n\nHow to buy cryptocurrency in Dubai\n\nBuying Bitcoin in Dubai and anywhere in the UAE is quite straightforward; it starts with choosing a crypto exchange, registering and creating an account, and then adding the funds needed to buy the cryptocurrency of choice.\n\nBitcoin is available on any exchange, and other leading cryptocurrencies are available on most major exchanges. Investors who plan to hold on to Bitcoin usually want to move their Bitcoin away from an exchange into a Bitcoin wallet or to more secure Bitcoin storage like a hardware wallet. Let\u2019s look at the steps to buying Bitcoin in the United Arab Emirates:\n\n1. Choose an exchange\n\nThe first priority when choosing an exchange is security; crypto buyers should always research the exchange and check online reviews, then review the coins, the exchange lists and the fees.\n\n2. Register\n\nRegistering with an exchange starts with an email, a password and any other security authentication available. Cryptocurrency exchange users should always make full use of any additional security options. New exchange users will usually need to provide the exchange with an image of a piece of photo ID to complete its Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.\n\n3. Fund and buy\n\nOnce an account has been created, funds can be added from fiat accounts. After that, it\u2019s possible to buy BTC with UAE dirhams easily this way or to select another trading pair.\n\nWhich crypto exchanges operate in Dubai and the UAE?\n\nThe intriguing thing is that there are many leading exchanges that operate in the UAE; investors can pick from the most well-known, the best-reviewed, those thought of as the safest, and those with the highest availability of leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nSome of the crypto exchanges and Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai and the UAE are eToro, OKX, HTX (formerly Huobi) and Binance. Bitcoin brokers in the UAE, such as Rain, OKX, Uphold, Bybit and Binance, are regulated by the UAE Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) or the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n\nHow to choose Bitcoin wallets in Dubai\n\nJust like Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai, there are lots of options for Bitcoin wallets in Dubai to store crypto safely. The first step is to choose a Bitcoin wallet suitable for investor plans or behavior.\n\nOnline wallets or wallet applications aren\u2019t as safe as hardware wallets, but they can be more suitable for investors planning to move their cryptocurrency holdings or use them on a regular basis. Hot wallets to choose from include Trust Wallet or Electrum.\n\nMore valuable Bitcoin holdings or funds left idle for some time are best stored in safer hardware wallets, such as Trezor or Ledger Nano.\n\nCan you buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash?\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash straight from an account or by using a credit card. After an account has been set up with an exchange, the next step is to add fiat money funds to the account and then go on to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nDoes Dubai have Bitcoin ATMs?\n\nThe UAE is so welcoming to crypto that it is one of the countries to have Bitcoin ATMs, and Dubai\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was installed at the five-star Rixos Premium Dubai Hotel in 2019. At the kiosk, visitors can insert cash and buy Bitcoin instantly.\n\nIs buying Bitcoin via P2P in Dubai common?\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to trade Bitcoin directly with one another, unlike centralized or decentralized exchanges. On a P2P exchange, it\u2019s possible to look at a seller\u2019s list of assets for sale and choose accordingly. Buyers and sellers agree on the price of the cryptocurrency for sale before the sale is made.\n\nP2P exchanges can be more common in countries with greater restrictions on cryptocurrency exchanges; in Dubai, that\u2019s not the case. The major exchanges operating in Dubai often have P2P functionality as well as standard trading options, which provides the best of both worlds. The exchanges offering P2P trading in Dubai include Binance, Paxful, OKX, HTX, Bybit and KuCoin.\n\nAre there crypto-friendly banks in the UAE?\n\nIt is interesting to know how banks in Dubai and the UAE view cryptocurrencies and crypto users. The UAE doesn\u2019t fail the crypto entrepreneur, and there are a number of crypto-friendly banks in the UAE that will allow crypto businesses to open and use fiat accounts.\n\nFirst Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has no policies restricting its customers from buying and selling crypto. Although it doesn\u2019t offer crypto trading, it\u2019s possible to link an FAB account with a crypto exchange to fund Bitcoin purchases. FAB also has future plans to leverage Web3 and digital assets for its users.\n\nExercise caution while dealing with cryptocurrencies\n\nIt is fortunate for Dubai residents to have access to a vibrant financial environment that enables them to engage with the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that the value of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile and subject to significant price swings in either direction. Therefore, before entering the cryptocurrency market, careful research and knowledge of the risks involved are crucial."

        "title": "Cathie Wood on AI, Nvidia and Bitcoin - Morningstar.ca",
        "content": "Valerio Baselli: Hello, welcome to Morningstar. The big news within the ETFs space is that the American asset management firm ARK Invest, which specializes in disruptive innovation, has acquired Rize ETF, a London-based provider of thematic and sustainable trackers. To talk about the future of ARK Invest in Europe, among other things, today I'm joined by the well-known founder and CEO of ARK Invest, Cathie Wood.\n\nWhy Did Cathie Wood and ARK Invest Expand Into Europe?\n\nSo, Cathie, first of all, welcome and thanks for being here. Let's start with the basics. Why this takeover in Europe and why now?\n\nCathie Wood: Well, it's been very interesting at ARK practically since the beginning when we monitor who the subscribers are to our research, which we give away free. We have found that 25% of them are from Europe, but we didn't have anything, any strategies, to offer in Europe. And so, we have been looking for quite some time and we found this gem hidden inside of AssetCo, and the DNA was just right. They're thematic, they're futures-oriented, mega-trend oriented, and it seemed like a great fit.\n\nWill Thematic Investing Work in European Markets?\n\nBaselli: So, as you know, thematic investment has enjoyed a booming rise in recent years in Europe, even though the pace of flows, for example, has slowed down compared to the explosion post COVID-19. What are your thoughts in investing thematically, especially here in Europe, where the average investor is probably different from the American one?\n\nWood: Well, judging from the responses to our research, I think the appetite is there. And I also do appreciate, certainly we're learning a lot from our new ARK Invest Europe team, that Europe is different. Different countries have different kinds of appetites for different strategies. I know, for example, Valerio, in your Italy, there's a huge appetite for thematic, perhaps in other areas not. So, we are going to leave it to them to direct us to the right places.\n\nWhy Thematic Investing is the Future, According to ARK Invest\n\nBaselli: That's interesting. What advice would you have for investors shopping for a thematic fund? And are there any themes in your view that don't really have investment merit, at least today?\n\nWood: Well, our focus at ARK Invest has been on actively managed ETFs and other wrappers, focused exclusively on disruptive innovation. And ARK Invest Europe is similarly minded. We don't think there are enough strategies out there that are focused on the future in the ways that we are, grounded in original research. We see a lot of strategies that are somehow flavours of broader-based benchmarks. And we think that the world of technology especially is moving so quickly that it will be very difficult for the benchmarks to keep up. And I'll just give one example. It took the S&P 500 in our country until Tesla [TSLA] reached $500 billion for the S&P to allow it into its index. $500 billion. There are not many companies bigger than that. And yet, in the case of Tesla, we think it has miles to go.\n\nWhy Did ARK Invest Exit Nvidia?\n\nBaselli: And let's talk of your flagship strategy, the ARK Innovation [ARKK] fund. After having performed extremely well between 2017 and 2020, the fund suffered for a couple of years. Now, in 2023, the year-to-date performance is very positive. But some might say that the strategy missed out on a big part of the artificial intelligence rally. The easiest example is of course Nvidia [NVDA], a name that you owned since inception, I believe, which is no more in the portfolio and is up roughly 190% for the year-to-date. So, why did you decide to close out your stake in Nvidia? And do you regret this decision?\n\nWood: Well, if you read our research going back to 2014, we've been very focused on the revolution called artificial intelligence. And we gained exposure to Nvidia when it was $5. Now, it's closer to $450. And we were pounding the table. So, we did very, very well with it. In fact, in the flagship strategy since inception, it is the fourth largest contributor to performance after Tesla, GBTC [GBTC], Invitae [NVTA], which is a genomics name, and then Nvidia.\n\nWhat we've been doing with our research is trying to figure out who else is going to win in a very big way. This is called real original research as opposed to checking a box, artificial intelligence, Nvidia. And we have found that the characteristics of companies that will win in this new age \u2013 and this is going to impact every industry, every company \u2013 are companies with domain expertise, and when it comes to innovation, that's really important, especially in areas like multiomics sequencing in life sciences. So, they have domain expertise, they have AI expertise, so we look at their talent, and perhaps most importantly, they have proprietary pools of data so that they can evolve specialized AI models and integrate them into the open source models out there to develop very powerful solutions. Almost every name in our flagship strategy is an exposure to artificial intelligence. Nvidia is much more expensive than most of the names in our portfolio, except for perhaps the multiomics names.\n\nNvidia Won't Outperform Our Other Stocks: ARK Invest\n\nBaselli: Yeah, exactly, and I wanted to ask you: What do you think of the current Nvidia valuation? Do you think market's expectations of its growth or margins are overly optimistic?\n\nWood: We think that it's going to be a good stock over time, but we don't think it is going to outperform the other stocks in our portfolio over time as more and more people, analysts, investors, do research, real research, on what this AI revolution means. And so, we think our current positions are misunderstood exposures to artificial intelligence. We do not regret selling Nvidia in the flagship, which has to incorporate all of our innovation platforms, so robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing. The other portfolios, which are more specialized, do own Nvidia. We've just taken the position down quite significantly.\n\nWhich AI Themes Are a Buy Today?\n\nBaselli: All right. Speaking of artificial intelligence, of course, you've been investing in it for years. Do you have a preferred way of gaining exposure to the theme? For instance, what do you prefer among solution providers, hardware providers, or maybe companies who will leverage AI into their own businesses, such as biotech firms?\n\nWood: Sure. As I mentioned, practically every stock in our portfolios we view through an AI lens in the way I described, especially focused on proprietary data. But for every dollar of hardware invested in the AI space \u2013 and Nvidia is primarily hardware, evolving more software solutions, but primarily hardware- for every dollar of hardware, we expect 8 to 20 times the amount of software. And so, we have a lot of software-oriented names in our portfolios.\n\nTo give you an example, UiPath [PATH] is a robotics process automation company. It is helping companies automate the most mundane administrative tasks in their companies. And it has proprietary data associated with many companies around the world and the solutions they are evolving to automate these mundane processes, including AI. So, it has all of that proprietary data. Other names that are not familiar, and that's what we offer is diversification in the disruptive innovation space. Other names include Twilio [TWLO], Exact Sciences [EXAS], even Zoom [ZTNO]. I think many people are surprised to see Zoom in our portfolios. But I think many people will be surprised to see how many AI applications Zoom is evolving here. So, on October 4th, stay tuned to Zoomtopia and you'll learn more about it.\n\nARK Invest on Interest Rates\n\nBaselli: Very interesting. Your investment process follows a clear philosophy. It concentrates the portfolio on high-conviction, high-growth names. So, an economic environment with rising interest rates is far from being ideal for this kind of strategy. How do you manage this? And what's your outlook on rates and economic growth?\n\nWood: Yes. During, it was 2021 and '22 that this was a real problem. First, the fear of rising interest rates hurt our strategy, and then the actuality, or the reality of rising rates last year really hurt our strategy. This year we've started outperforming, and I think it is because investors are looking over the top of these interest rate increases and anticipating the end of them, and then ultimately the decline. If we're right, disruptive innovation is going to cause a lot of deflation. That's a good thing. Deflation caused by disruptive innovation will cause an explosion in the growth rates of units in the disruptive innovation space. So, we think we've been through the worst of it, but I will also point to another period where interest rates were rising in 2017, for example. Our response back then is, wait a minute, the Fed is now sure that we're over the '08-'09 crisis, and it is going to allow the markets to work. Our portfolios, the flagship, was up 87% that year, even though interest rates were going up. Now, if interest rates have plateaued or are going down, that will be an extra good environment for our strategies, especially given what happened in '21 and '22. This will be the flip side of that.\n\nWe Are Very Optimistic on Bitcoin: Cathie Wood\n\nBaselli: And of course, if you think of disruptive innovation, you think of digital assets and cryptocurrencies. You have been one of the early adopters of Bitcoin. Now markets await the Securities and Exchange Commission decision on the first Bitcoin spot ETF. But from this point of view, we might say that Europe is probably a bit ahead of the game. There are dozens of crypto ETPs listed in Europe, as you know very well-- you have a partnership with 21Shares, the biggest crypto ETPs provider in Europe. So, what is your outlook for Bitcoin at this stage?\n\nWood: We are very optimistic on Bitcoin. One of the markers or milestones this year that I think surprised everyone was in the United States, we had a regional bank crisis in March. As regional bank stocks were plummeting, and some went bankrupt, Bitcoin increased from 19,000 to 30,000. What was that? That was a flight to safety. One of the reasons regional banks and most banks get into trouble is counterparty risk and depositors fleeing them. If you think about crypto assets and Bitcoin especially, it is completely decentralized. There's no counterparty risk. And it is completely transparent. You can see the movements by IP address and see where there might be trouble brewing. It's a giant neighborhood watch with a lot of people involved. This involves their livelihood. So, we think it's very robust. When institutions get the green light, and I think they're waiting for the SEC, I think that we're going to see significant participation in this new asset class by institutions.\n\nBaselli: Finally, going back to the start of the acquisition of Rize ETF, what will be your role for the European market and overall within the firm? Will you still manage the active ETFs?\n\nWood: Yes, the active equity ETFs ARK Invest in the U.S. will continue to manage. And ARK Invest Europe will manage the ARK indexed thematic strategies, and they also will distribute for us. So, we think it's a win-win.\n\nBaselli: Thank you so much, Cathie, for your time and your insights. I appreciate that. For Morningstar, I'm Valerio Baselli. Thanks for watching.\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk To view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.
