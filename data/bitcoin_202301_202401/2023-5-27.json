        "content": "Bitcoin has jumped over 60% year-to-date, paring losses from a brutal 2022.\n\nInsider spoke to four crypto experts on what's next for bitcoin in 2023.\n\nOne blockchain exec said bitcoin can't hit a record high until US inflation is under control.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

The crypto traded at a record of $67,566 in November of 2021, per Messari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"However, a possible headwind is the potential recession forecast to hit the US, Europe, and other major economies due to a stubbornly inverted yield curve,\" Ho told Insider. \"Couple this with a bunch of other unsavory macro factors \u2014 such as inflation \u2014 many investors would rather remain on the sidelines.\"\n\n\"This is contributing to the mostly sideways price action we've been experiencing,\" Ho added.\n\nA key technical event for Bitcoin's network, the halving, could push the token's price up significantly though. Although the halving is estimated to occur in April of 2024, Ho says bitcoin may go on a tear leading up to the event.\n\n\"Bitcoin halvings are significant because they slash the production of new bitcoins on the network by half,\" Ho said. \"This curtails the supply of freshly minted coins, thus leading to a price increase if the demand persists.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Litecoin, which is due for its halving this year, is up around 90% since its lows in Q3, 2022,\" Ho said. \"Therefore, if we take that as a guide, it is possible that we could see a similar 90% move from Bitcoin's Q3, 2023 price, which would give a rough target of about $60,000.\"\n\nJagdeep Sidhu, president of Syscoin Foundation, expressed similar optimism around the halving.\n\n\"While we've weathered some storms recently, the resilience of the crypto ecosystem remains evident. From the ashes of FTX, the market has rebounded, demonstrating its inherent capacity to absorb shocks and evolve,\" Sidhu told Insider.\n\n\"As we approach the next Bitcoin halving and crypto dominance looks set to peak, we're on the cusp of exciting developments in the crypto world.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf inflation cools in the US and there's regulatory clarity around digital assets, another crypto exec told Insider that bitcoin could hit $38,000 by year-end, a 41% increase from its current trading level.\n\n\"My base case is bitcoin will trade in a range to a range between $25,000 and $32,000 for the remainder of 2023,\" Tim Shan, COO at decentralized crypto exchange Dexalot, said. \"But if we see inflation remain high, I think bitcoin could trade back down to lows of the year.\"\n\n\"The short to medium term driver is still inflation, and specifically US inflation. I think core inflation has been pretty sticky but will continue to decline in the US, leading the Fed to pause for the rest of the year,\" Shan added.\n\nDavid Uhryniak, who works on ecosystem development at blockchain infrastructure provider TRON, is confident that bitcoin will finish the year \"significantly higher\" and could close out 2023 at over $35,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Right now, smart traders are waiting for greater validation as to which way bitcoin and the rest of the market will move next before committing serious money,\" Uhryniak told Insider. \"By Q4, much of the uncertainty that's clouded the market all year should have abated. Things like concerns over the Mt. Gox coins being liquidated or the US government selling its stockpile of BTC confiscated from black markets.\""

        "title": "Marc Andreessen on A.I., Bitcoin, and Billionaires - Reason",
        "content": "Marc Andreessen has helped a lot of people get rich\u2014including Marc Andreessen. He's made millions of people's lives more fun, more efficient, or just a little weirder while making himself into a billionaire.\n\nHe is the co-creator of the first widely used web browser and co-founder of the venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. Though he hates the term unicorn\u2014industry lingo for a private tech firm valued at more than a billion dollars\u2014he's a famously successful unicorn wrangler: He was an early investor in Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Lyft, and more.\n\nAndreessen is also aggressively quotable, whether it's his classic 2011 pronouncement that \"software is eating the world\" or his more recent \"There are no bad ideas, only early ones.\" And in 2014 he said, \"In 20 years, we'll be talking about bitcoin the way we talk about the internet today.\" A born bull, Andreessen is an optimist who places his hope for the future squarely in the hands of \"the 19-year-olds and the startups that no one's heard of.\"\n\nAs splashy artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT and DALL-E begin to permeate our daily lives and the predictable panic revs up, Reason Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward sat down with Andreessen in February for a video and podcast interview about what the future will look like, whether it still will emerge from Silicon Valley, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the role of government in fostering or destroying innovation.\n\nReason: I tend to be skeptical of people who claim that this time it's different, with any tech or cultural trend. But with artificial intelligence (A.I.), is this time different?\n\nAndreessen: A.I. has been the fundamental dream of computer science going all the way back to the 1940s. There were five or six A.I. booms where people were really convinced that this time is the time it's going to happen. Then there were A.I. winters in which it turns out, oops, not yet. For sure, we're in another one of those A.I. booms.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are different about what's happening right now. There are these very well-defined tests, ways of measuring intelligence-like capabilities. Computers have started to do actually better than people on these tests. These are tests that involve interactions with fuzzy reality. So these aren't tests like, \"Can you do math faster?\" These are tests like, \"Can you process reality in a superior way?\"\n\nThe first of those test breakthroughs was in 2012, when computers became better than human beings at recognizing objects in images. That's the breakthrough that has made the self-driving car a real possibility. Because what's a self-driving car? It's basically just processing large amounts of images and trying to understand, \"Is that a kid running across the street or is that a plastic bag, and should I hit the brakes or should I just keep going?\" Tesla's self-driving isn't perfect yet, but it's starting to work quite well. Waymo, one of our companies: They're up and running now.\n\nWe started to see these breakthroughs in what's called natural language processing about five years ago, where computers started getting really good at understanding written English. They started getting really good at speech synthesis, which is actually quite a challenging problem. And then most recently, there's this huge breakthrough in ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT is an instance of a broader phenomenon in the field called large language models, or LLMs. A lot of people outside the tech industry are shocked by what that thing can do. And I'll just tell you, a lot of people inside the tech industry are shocked by what that thing can do.\n\nChatGPT does feel, to those of us who don't fundamentally understand what's going on, like a little bit of a magic trick. Like Arthur C. Clarke's third law: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" And sometimes it really is a trick. But you're saying this is something real?\n\nWell, it's also a trick. It's both. There's a profound underlying question: What does it mean to be smart? What does it mean to be conscious? What does it mean to be human? Ultimately, all the big questions are not, \"What does the machine do?\" Ultimately, all the big questions are, \"What do we do?\"\n\nLLMs are basically very fancy autocompletes. An autocomplete is a standard computer function. If you have an iPhone, you start typing a word and it will offer you an autocompletion of the rest of that word so you don't have to type that whole word. Gmail has autocomplete now for sentences, where you start typing a sentence\u2014\"I'm sorry I can't make it to your event\"\u2014and it will suggest the rest of the sentence. What LLMs are is basically autocomplete across a paragraph. Or maybe an autocomplete across 20 pages or, in the future, maybe an autocomplete across an entire book.\n\nYou'll sit down to write your next book. You'll type the first sentence, and it will suggest the rest of the book. Are you going to want what it suggested? Probably not. But it's going to give you a suggestion, and it's going to give you suggested chapters, it's going to give you suggested topics, it's going to be suggested examples, it's going to give you suggested ways to word things. You can already do this with ChatGPT. You can type in, \"Here's my draft. Here's five paragraphs I just wrote. How could this be worded better? How could this be worded more simply? How could this be worded in a way that people who are younger can understand it?\" And so it's going to be able to autocomplete in all of these very interesting ways. And then it's up to the human being who's steering it to decide what to do with that.\n\nIs that a trick or a breakthrough? It's both. Yann LeCun, who's a legend in the field of A.I., who's at Meta, argues this is more trick than breakthrough. He argues it's like a puppy: It autocompletes the text it thinks you want to see, but it doesn't actually understand any of the things it's saying. It doesn't actually know who people are. It doesn't know how physics works. It has this thing that's called hallucination, where if it doesn't have an autocomplete that's factually correct, it's like a puppy, it still wants to make you happy, and so it will autocomplete a hallucination. It will start making up names and dates and historical events that never happened.\n\nI know the term is hallucination, but the other concept that comes to mind for me is imposter syndrome. I don't know whether the humans have the imposter syndrome or the A.I.s do, but sometimes we're all just saying the thing that we think someone wants to hear, right?\n\nThis goes to the underlying question: What do people do? And then\u2014this is where things get incredibly uncomfortable for a lot of people\u2014what is human consciousness? How do we form ideas? I don't know about you, but what I've found in my life is that a lot of people on a day-to-day basis are just telling you what they think you want to hear.\n\nLife is full of these autocompletes as it is. How many people are making arguments that they actually have conceived of, that they actually believe, versus how many people are making arguments that are basically the arguments that they think people are expecting them to make? We see this thing in politics\u2014that you guys are an exception to\u2014where most people have the exact same sets of views as everybody else on their side on every conceivable issue. We know that those people have not sat down and talked through all of those issues from first principles. We know that what's happened, of course, is the social reinforcement mechanism. Is that actually any better than the machine essentially trying to do the same thing? I think it's kind of the same. I think we're going to learn that we're a lot more like ChatGPT than we thought.\n\nAlan Turing created this thing called the Turing test. Basically he said, \"Let's suppose we develop what we think is an A.I. Let's suppose we develop a program and we think it's smart in the same way that a person is smart. How will we know that it's actually smart?\" So you have a human subject, and they're in a chatroom with a human being and with a computer. And both the human being and the computer are trying to convince them that they're actually the real person and the other one is the computer. If the computer can convince you that it's a human being, then it effectively is A.I.\n\nThe obvious problem with the Turing test is that people are super easy to con. Is a computer that's good at conning you A.I. or is that just revealing an underlying weakness in what we think of as profoundly human?\n\nThere's no single vector of smart versus not smart. There are certain sets of things humans can do better or worse, there are certain sets of things computers can do better or worse. The things computers can do better are getting really good.\n\nIf you try Midjourney or DALL-E, they're able to produce art that is more beautiful than all but maybe a handful of human artists. Two years ago, did we expect a computer to be making beautiful art? No, we didn't. Can it do it now routinely? Yes. What does that mean in terms of what human artists do? If there's only a few human artists that can produce art that beautiful, maybe we're not that good at making art.\n\nYou've been using the language of humanity: \"Humans are like this.\" But some of this is cultural. Should we care if A.I.s are coming out of Silicon Valley versus coming from another place?\n\nI think we should. Among the things we're talking about here is the future of warfare. You can see it in the self-driving car. If you have a self-driving car, that means you can have a self-flying plane, that means you can have a self-guided submarine, that means you can have smart drones. You have this concept now we see in Ukraine with these so-called loitering munitions, basically a suicide drone\u2014it kills itself. But it just stays in the sky until it sees the target, and it just zeros in and drops a grenade or itself is the bomb.\n\nI just watched the new Top Gun movie, and they allude to this a little bit in the movie: To train an F-16 or F-18 fighter pilot is like, I don't know, $7, 8, 10, 15 million, plus it's a very valuable human being. And we put these people in these tin cans and then we fly them through the air at whatever Mach whatever. The plane is capable of maneuvering in ways that will actually kill the pilot. So what the plane can do is actually constrained by what the human body can actually put up with. And then, by the way, the plane that is capable of sustaining human life is very big and expensive and has all these systems to be able to accommodate the human pilot.\n\nA supersonic A.I. drone is not going to have any of those restraints. It's going to cost a fraction of the price. It doesn't need to have even the shape that we associate with it today. It can have any shape that's aerodynamic. It doesn't need to take into account a human pilot. It can fly faster, it can maneuver faster, it can do all kinds of turns, all kinds of things that the human pilot's body can't tolerate. It can make decisions much more quickly. It can generate much more information per second than any human being can. You're not just going to have one of those at a time, you're going to have 10 or 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 of those things flying at the same time. The nation-states with the best A.I. capabilities are going to have the best defense capabilities.\n\nWill our A.I.s have American values? Is there a cultural component to the type of A.I. we're going to get?\n\nLook at the fight that's happened over social media. There's been a massive fight over what values are encoded in social media and what censorship controls and what ideologies are allowed to perpetuate.\n\nThere's a constant running fight on that in China, which is the \"Great Firewall,\" and they've got restrictions on what they'll allow you to show if you're a Chinese citizen. And then there's these cross-cultural questions. TikTok as a Chinese platform running in the U.S. with American users, especially American children, using it. A lot of people have theories that the TikTok algorithm is very deliberately steering U.S. kids towards destructive behaviors, and is that some sort of foreign hostile operation?\n\nSo anyway, to the extent that these are all big issues in this previous era of social media, I think all of these issues magnify out by a million times in this A.I. area. All of those issues become far more dramatic and important. People only generate so many kinds of content, whereas A.I. is going to be applied to everything.\n\nWhat you just described, is that a case for early and cautious regulation? Or is that a case for the impossibility of regulation?\n\nWhat would Reason magazine say about well-intentioned government\u2014\n\nHa! Well, there are people who are deeply skeptical of governments, who still say, \"Maybe this is the moment for guardrails.\" Maybe they want to limit how states can use A.I., for instance.\n\nI'll make your own argument back to you: The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It's like, \"Boy, wouldn't it be great this time if we could have very carefully calibrated, well-thought-through, rational, reasonable, effective regulation?\"\n\n\"Maybe this time we can make rent control work, if we're a little bit smarter about it.\" Your own argument obviously, is like, well, that's not actually what happens, for all the reasons you guys talk about all the time.\n\nSo yeah, there's a theoretical argument for such a thing. We don't get the abstract theoretical regulation, we get the practical, real-world regulation. And what do we get? Regulatory capture. Corruption. Early incumbent lock-in. Political capture. Skewed incentives.\n\nYou've talked a lot about the rapid process through which innovative tech startups become enmeshed incumbents, both just with the state and more generally in their business practices. That topic has come up a lot recently with the Twitter Files and revelations of the ways that companies collaborated willingly, but maybe with a looming threat as well, with government agencies.\n\nIt seems to me like we're going to be in for more of that. This blurring of the lines between public and private is our fate. Is that what it looks like to you? Does that threaten innovation, or are there ways in which it could potentially speed things along?\n\nThe textbook view of the American economy is that it's free market competition. Companies are fighting it out. Different toothpaste companies are trying to sell you different toothpaste and it's a largely competitive market. Every once in a while there's an externality that requires government intervention and then you get these weird things like the \"too big to fail\" banks, but those are exceptions.\n\nI can tell you my experience, having been now in startups for 30 years, is that the opposite is true. James Burnham was right. We passed from the original model of capitalism, which he called bourgeois capitalism, into a different model, which he called managerial capitalism, some decades back. And the actual correct model of how the U.S. economy works is basically big companies forming oligopolies, cartels, and monopolies and doing all the things that you expect oligopolies, cartels, and monopolies to do. And then they jointly corrupt and capture the regulatory and government process. They end up controlling their regulators.\n\nSo most sectors of the economy are a conspiracy between the big incumbents and their punitive regulators. The purpose of the conspiracy is to perpetuate the long-term existence of those monopolies and cartels and to block new competition. To me, that completely explains the education system, both K-12 and the university system. It completely explains the health care system. It completely explains the housing crisis. It completely explains the financial crisis and the bailouts. It completely explains the Twitter Files.\n\nAre there sectors that are less subject to that dynamic you just described?\n\nThe question is always the same: Is there actual competition? The idea of capitalism is basically an economic form of the idea of evolution\u2014natural selection and survival of the fittest and the idea that a superior product ought to win in the market and that markets ought to be open to competition and a new company can come along with a better widget and take out the incumbents because its widget is superior and customers like it better.\n\nIs there actual competition happening or not? Do consumers actually have the ability to fully select among the existing alternatives? Can you actually bring a new widget to market or do you get blocked out? Because the regulatory wall that's been established makes that prohibitive.\n\nThe great example of this is banking, where the big thing in 2008 was, \"We need to bail out these banks because they're 'too big to fail.'\" And so then there were screams of the need to reform the \"too big to fail\" banks. That led to Dodd-Frank. The result of Dodd-Frank\u2014I call it the Big Bank Protection Act\u2014is that the \"too big to fail\" banks are now much larger than before and the number of new banks being created in the U.S. has dropped to zero.\n\nThe cynical answer is that doesn't happen in the spaces that don't matter. Anybody can bring a new toy to market. Anybody can open a restaurant. These are fine and good consumer categories that people really enjoy and so forth, but as contrasted to the health care system or the education system or the housing system or the legal system\u2014\n\nIf you want freedom, your business had better be frivolous.\n\nThat would be the cynical way of looking at it. If it doesn't matter in terms of determining the power structure of society, then do whatever you want. But if it actually matters to major issues of policy where the government is intertwined with them, then of course it doesn't happen there.\n\nI think it's so self-evident. Why are all these universities identical? Why do they all have identical ideologies? Why isn't there a marketplace of ideas at the university level? Well, that becomes a question of why aren't there more universities? There aren't more universities because you have to get accredited. The accreditation bureau is run by the existing universities.\n\nWhy do health care prices do what they do? A major reason for that is because basically they're paid for by insurance. There's private insurance and public insurance. The private insurance prices just key off the public prices, because Medicare is the big buyer.\n\nSo how are Medicare prices set? A unit inside [the Department of Health and Human Services] runs literal Soviet-style price-fixing boards for medical goods and services. And so once a year, there are doctors who get together in a conference room at, like, a Hyatt Chicago somewhere, and they sit down and they do the exact same thing. The Soviets had a central price-fixing bureau. It didn't work. We don't have that for the entire economy, but we have that for the entire health care system. And it doesn't work for the same reason that the Soviet system didn't work. We've exactly replicated the Soviet system, [but] we're expecting better results.\n\nYou said about 10 years ago that bitcoin is as important as the internet was. We've had a little time for that to play out. How is that prediction looking to you?\n\nI wrote a New York Times column back when The New York Times would run things that I write\u2014which, by the way, in case you're wondering, is no longer true.\n\nEverything in there, I still agree with. The one modification I would make is at the time it looked like bitcoin was going to evolve in a way where it was going to be used for many other things. We thought it was a general technology platform that was going to evolve to be able to make a lot of other applications possible in the same way the internet did. That didn't happen. Bitcoin itself just basically stalled out. It basically stopped evolving, but a bunch of other projects emerged that took that place. The big one right now is ethereum. So if I wrote that thing today, either I would say ethereum instead of bitcoin or I would just say crypto.\n\nBut otherwise, all the same ideas apply. The argument I made in that piece is basically crypto, Web3, blockchain\u2014they're what I call the other half of the internet. It's all the functions of the internet that we knew we wanted to have when we originally built the internet as people know it today. But it's all of the aspects of basically being able to do business and be able to do transactions and have trust. We did not know how to use the internet to do that in the '90s. With this technological breakthrough of the blockchain, we now know how to do that.\n\nWe have the technological foundation to be able to do that: have a network of trust that is overlaid on top of the internet. The internet is an untrusted network. Anybody can pretend to be anybody they want on the internet. Web3 creates layers of trust on top of that. Within those layers of trust, you can represent money, but you can also represent many other things. You can represent claims of ownership. You can represent house titles, car titles, insurance contracts, loans, claims to digital assets, unique digital art. You can have a general concept of an internet contract. You can strike contracts with people online that they're actually held to. You can have internet escrow services. So for e-commerce, you can have a service. You have two people buying from each other. You can have actually a trusted intermediary now that is internet-native that has an escrow service.\n\nYou can build on top of the untrusted internet all of the capabilities that you would need to have a full, global, internet-native economy. And that's a giant idea. The potential there is extraordinarily high. We're midway through that process. A lot of those things have worked. Some of those things haven't worked yet, but I think that they're going to.\n\nAre there sectors where you think there's currently the right amount of investment? Insufficient investment? Too much investment because there's hype?\n\nSo there's the term, research and development, but really those are two different things. Research is basically funding smart people pursuing deep questions around technology and science such that they may not have any idea yet of what kind of product could get built on it or even whether something can work.\n\nAnd then there's the other side, which is what we do: the development side. By the time we fund a company to build a product, the basic research has to be finished already. There can't be open basic research questions, because otherwise you have a startup that you don't even know whether you'll even be able to build a thing. Also, it needs to be close enough to commercialization that within five years or something, you can actually commercialize it into a product.\n\nThat formula worked really well in the computer industry. There were 50 years of basically government research into information science, computer science, during and after World War II. That translated to the computer industry, software industry, internet. And that worked. By the way, that also worked in biotech.\n\nThose are the two main areas [where] I think actual productive research is happening. Should there be more funding into basic research? Almost certainly. Having said that, the basic research world has a very profound crisis underway right now, which they call the replication crisis. It turns out that a lot of what people thought was basic research has actually basically been fake\u2014and arguably fraud. So among the many problems that our modern universities have, there is a very big problem where most of the research that they're doing does seem to be fake. So would you recommend more money be put into a system that's just generating fake results? No. Would you argue that you do need basic research to continue to get new products out the other end? Yes.\n\nOn the development side, I'm probably more optimistic. I think generally we don't lack for money. I think basically all the good entrepreneurs get funded.\n\nThe main question on that side of things is not so much the money. [It's] about competition and how markets work. In what fields of economic activity can there actually be startups? For example, can you actually have education startups? Can you actually have health care startups? Can you actually have housing startups? Can you actually have financial services startups? Can you do a new online bank that works in a different way? And for those fields where you would want to see a lot of progress, the bottleneck is not whether we can fund them; the bottleneck is literally whether the companies will be allowed to exist.\n\nAnd yet I think there are sometimes places where you might have said it's settled wisdom that you can't have a startup in this area, and then it turns out you can. I'm thinking of space. I'm thinking of, to some extent, some subsets of education. I would also put crypto in this category. How can you compete with money? And then here we are, in a quite robust competitive market that is trying to compete with money.\n\nSpaceX is probably your best-case scenario. Talk about a market that's dominated by the government and has regulations literally to the moon. I don't even know the last time anybody tried to do a new launch platform. And then the idea that you're going to put all these satellites up there, there's massive regulatory issues around that. And then the complexity on top of that. Elon [Musk] wanted the rockets to be reusable, so he wanted them to land on their rear ends, which is something that people thought was impossible. All previous rockets\u2014basically they're one shot and they're done. Whereas his rockets get reused over and over again, because they're able to land themselves. SpaceX climbed a wall of skepticism its entire way, and [Musk] basically just brute-forced his way through it. He and the team there made it work. The big thing we talk about in our business is just, look, that is a much, much harder entrepreneurial journey. That's just what the entrepreneur has to sign up for to do that and the risks that are involved are just much harder than starting a new software company. It's just a much higher bar of competence that's required. It's much higher risk.\n\nYou're going to lose more of those companies because they're just going to not be able to make it. They're going to get blocked in some way. And then you need a certain kind of founder who's willing to take that on. That founder looks a lot like an Elon Musk or a Travis Kalanick [of Uber] or an Adam Neumann [of WeWork]. In the past, it looked like Henry Ford. This requires Attila the Hun, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan. To make that kind of company work requires somebody who is so smart and so determined and so aggressive and so fearless and so resistant to injury of many different kinds, and willing to take on just absolutely cosmic levels of vitriol and hate and abuse and security threats. We need more of those people. I wish we could find a way to grow them in tanks.\n\nWhy do you think it is that there is this special category of obsessive anger that's directed at the entrepreneurial billionaire? I mean, U.S. senators tweeting that billionaires should not exist\u2026\n\nI think it's all in Nietzsche\u2014what he called ressentiment, the toxic blend of resentment and bitterness. It's the cornerstone of modern culture, of Marxism, of progressivism. We resent people who are better than us.\n\nChristianity too, right?\n\nYeah, Christianity. The last will be first and the first will be last. A rich man will sooner pass through the eye of a needle than enter the kingdom of God. Christianity is sometimes described as the final religion, the last religion that can ever exist on planet Earth, because it's the one that appeals to victims. The nature of life is there are always more victims than there are winners, so victims are always in the majority. Therefore, one religion is going to capture all the victims or all the people who think of themselves as victims. And that, by definition, is the majority among lower-class societies. In social science, they'll sometimes refer to a phenomenon called crabs in a bucket, where if one person starts to do better, the other people will drag them back down.\n\nThis is a big problem in education\u2014one kid starts to do good and the other kids start to bully him until he's no better than the rest. In Scandinavian culture, there's a term, tall poppy syndrome. The tall poppy gets whacked. Resentment's like a drug. Resentment is a very satisfying feeling, because it's the feeling that lets us off the hook. \"If they're more successful than I am, it just proves that they're worse than I am. Because obviously, they must be immoral. They must have committed crimes. They must be making the world worse.\" It's very deeply wired in.\n\nI guess I'll say this: The best entrepreneurs we deal with have no trace of it at all. [They] think the entire concept is just absolutely ridiculous. Why would I spend any minute thinking about whatever anybody else has done or whatever anybody else thinks of me?\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for style and clarity."

        "content": "Bitcoin moved back above US$28,000 in Monday morning trading in Asia, leading a rally among all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Ethereum broke through the resistance ceiling of US$1,900. The gains followed an in-principle agreement between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy to raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling, which boosted investors\u2019 appetite for risk assets.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 3.98% over the last 24 hours to US$28,195 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. It recorded a weekly gain of 5.73%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency moved above US$28,000 for the first time since May 10.\n\nEther jumped 3.48% in the past 24 hours to US$1,916, moving up 6.53% over the past seven days. It was trading above the US$1,900 mark for the first time in three weeks.\n\nCryptocurrency prices received a boost after U.S. President Biden on Saturday said he had reached an in-principle agreement with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling, which averts the threat of a default in the world\u2019s biggest economy. If ratified, the agreement would run through Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nBoth parties are now urging U.S. Congress to pass the deal by June 5 \u2013 the deadline set by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The talks had rattled investors for weeks as a debt default in the U.S. could have caused panic in global markets.\n\nThe sense of relief among investors that a deal is on the verge of completion has led to \u201cfresh buying of risk assets,\u201d said Markus Thielen, Head of Crypto Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in a note shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cSo many investors were scared about the debt ceiling and the potential default by the U.S. government \u2013 which is just so unlikely. Now, they need to find something else to be bearish about while the market likely rallies,\u201d said Thielen.\n\nWith Bitcoin taking the lead, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours. The total market cap for cryptocurrencies rose 3.00% in that period to US$1.17 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume also jumped 57.01% to US$31.73 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeo, the token that supports China-affiliated Neo blockchain, saw the largest weekly gain in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. It rose 23.83% to US$11.37. Neo is backed by Onchain, a Chinese blockchain company and member of the country\u2019s internet finance industry lobby.\n\nNeo outperformed most other larger-cap cryptocurrencies in the past week with investors now \u201cpositioning themselves for the Hong Kong opening event,\u201d said Thielen of Matrixport.\n\nHong Kong will unlock trading for retail investors from June 1, as the city seeks to become a hub for the crypto industry.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.57% to 3,373.39 in the 24 hours to 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is still down 0.82% for the past seven days.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum dipped 8.07% in the past 24 hours to US$13.10 million, according to CryptoSlam data. In contrast, NFT sales on the Bitcoin network surged 95.50% to US$8.29 million.\n\n$OXBT BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin NFT collection launched last Thursday, saw its sales exceed US$3 million in the past 24 hours, or more than 35% of all the NFT sales on the Bitcoin blockchain. The collection has attracted over 34,000 owners in four days.\n\nData from CryptoSlam indicates a rapid rise of Bitcoin in the NFT space, said Yohann Calpu, Chief Marketing Officer at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cI have never seen an ecosystem boot up this fast, except for NFTs in 2020-2021, and I would argue that it\u2019s even moving faster this time around,\u201d said Calpu. He added that the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks are competing for NFT supremacy, with Bitcoin protocol potentially better suited for NFT projects \u201cthat see immutability and scarcity as features instead of weaknesses.\u201d\n\nPeter Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital Chief Economist and vocal Bitcoin critic, said on Saturday he had collaborated in an art project to launch 50 Ordinal inscriptions \u2013 the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s iteration of NFTs \u2013 on the Bitcoin blockchain, which will be open for bidding in an auction in early June.\n\n\u201cSeeing Peter Schiff convert makes me happy,\u201d tweeted Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao on Sunday.\n\nElsewhere, Our Force 1, the NFT sneaker collection launched by sportswear Giant Nike last Wednesday, has seen sales exceed 75,000 in five days to around US$1.48 million, giving each NFT sneaker a price of US$19.82, according to data from PolygonScan."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum: Two titans battle for NFT supremacy - Forkast News",
        "content": "This past weekend, two major cryptocurrency/non-fungible tokens events happened, Veecon Indianapolis 2023 and the BTC Miami/Ordinals Conference 2023.\n\nI chose to go to Indianapolis to meet my colleagues whom I\u2019ve worked with for almost three years without meeting them in real life.\n\nAt one point, as I was walking back to the hotel on the streets of Indianapolis, it became apparent to me that there was a split in the NFT community. One was the \u201cstatus quo\u201d ETH-based community that\u2019s in the pre-teen stage meeting up at Veecon, and the other was a newly birthed baby in Miami at BTC Miami/Ordinals 2023.\n\nAt Forkast Labs , we work on CryptoSlam.io to \u201cunite the NFT community.\u201d Ever since our co-founder Randy Wasinger added Loom (Sorare), Flow and WAX chains, alongside Ethereum in early 2021, we have always strived to include all new and relevant chains that we can.\n\nI also met loads of NFT industry celebs, including Richerd Chan from Manifold.xyz , who has created some of the most used Ethereum smart contracts in the NFT industry. He had actually reached out to me in 2020 through a client at the time and we had only talked online, but never met in person, and now he had so many folks around him that I could only briefly speak with him.\n\nAs an epic Ethereum NFT celebrity and developer, I decided to ask him a very telling question: \u201cAre you developing for Bitcoin?\u201d\n\nHis response made it clear that he wasn\u2019t and had no intention of doing so at the moment. He posed a great question in return: \u201cIs the BTC community even supporting Ordinals?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a great question, to be honest.\n\nIn Miami, it seems that the main theme revolves around the \u201claser-eyed maxis\u201d who view Bitcoin as having a single use case: being \u201cbetter money\u201d and a store of value that shouldn\u2019t be tampered with.\n\nOn the other hand, the new Ordinal crew, represented by individuals like @rodarmor , @TO , @LeonidasNFT and @udiwertheimer , are leading the charge on alternative use cases such as digital artifacts (NFTs) and BRC-20s, which are the bitcoin equivalent of fungible tokens like ETH and BTC.\n\nThe latest rankings on CryptoSlam.io show that $OXBT and $ORDI are in the top 10, indicating the rapid rise of Bitcoin in the scene.\n\nPersonally, I have never seen an ecosystem boot up this fast, except for NFTs in 2020-2021, and I would argue that it\u2019s even moving faster this time around.\n\nThe Bitcoin market cap of over US$500 billion is more than double the Ethereum currency market cap of over US$200 billion. The Bitcoin protocol may be better suited to certain types of NFTs, ones that see immutability and scarcity as features instead of weaknesses.\n\nFundamentally, there is a big difference forming between what we are seeing on ETH and what we are seeing on BTC. The community is splitting into people who value UX, and corporate partners and one who values ultimate security/scarcity and immutability. While I think there are strengths to each, there IS a place for both.\n\nNet new people are coming into the \u201cNFT\u201d ecosystem, even if they will only trade Ordinals on BTC or BRC-20s, and they are really small in numbers, they are net new people. What will happen when the Michael Saylors of the world see the value in Ordinal theory, and its burgeoning use cases on BTC?\n\nSaylor talks about why Ordinals & Inscriptions are an important conversation, saying \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n\"If I were to discourage application development, I would be destroying the Bitcoin mining network.\" pic.twitter.com/i2xAayWREz \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 21, 2023\n\nThe NFT ecosystem, while can be seen as splitting, is actually growing and innovating, and while Taylor Swift fans are not coming in en masse, the core set of people who see the future of this technology is more excited about the growth of this industry than ever before."

        "content": "The United States looks to avoid a catastrophic debt default after the White House and the House Republicans agreed upon a tentative deal on May 27. The U.S. equities markets rallied in anticipation of the deal on May 26 and the positive sentiment has rubbed off onto the cryptocurrency sector, which is attempting a recovery.\n\nBuying is not limited to Bitcoin (BTC) alone as select altcoins are also showing signs of a short-term up-move. However, sustaining the rally at higher levels may prove to be difficult for the bulls.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAfter the debt ceiling deal, traders are likely to focus their attention on the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes. The hot Personal Consumption Expenditures data on May 26 increased the likelihood of a rate hike at the Fed\u2019s June meeting. The probability of a 25 basis point rate hike has risen from 17% a week back to 64% on May 28, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, what altcoins that are looking ripe for a short-term up-move? Let\u2019s study the charts of these top five cryptocurrencies to spot the important levels to watch out for.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has reached the overhead resistance zone between the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,146) and the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This zone is likely to witness a solid tussle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price turns down from the overhead zone, the bears will make another attempt to yank the price to the pivotal support at $25,250. The bulls are expected to defend the zone between $25,250 and $24,000 with all their might because a break below it could intensify selling. The BTC/USDT pair could then tumble to $20,000.\n\nOn the contrary, if buyers overcome the overhead obstacle and push the price back into the triangle, it will suggest strong buying on dips. That increases the possibility of a break above the resistance line of the triangle. The pair may then soar to $31,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is trading inside a descending channel pattern, and the bears are trying to defend the resistance line. If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will indicate that dips are being bought.\n\nThe bulls will then again try to thrust the price above the channel. If they succeed, the pair may start an up-move to $28,400.\n\nContrarily, a break below the moving averages will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the channel for some more time.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nXRP (XRP) has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.45) is sloping up gradually and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bulls drive and sustain the price above the neckline, the XRP/USDT pair could start a rally to the overhead resistance zone between $0.54 and $0.58. The pattern target of the bullish setup is $0.55.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the neckline and plummets below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then descend to the important support near $0.40.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the neckline. The rising 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive zone indicate a minor advantage to the buyers.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break above $0.48. If that happens, the pair is likely to start its up-move. Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair may then drop to $0.44.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nThe bulls pushed Arbitrum (ARB) back above the 20-day EMA ($1.17) on May 28, indicating the start of a potential recovery.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are likely to pose a strong challenge at $1.20 but if bulls pierce this level, the ARB/USDT pair could pick up momentum. There is a minor resistance at the 50-day simple moving average ($1.29) but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then climb to $1.36 and later to $1.50.\n\nIf bulls want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair may slip to $1.06 and then to $1.01. This is an important zone for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the pair may witness a sharp fall to $0.73.\n\nARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern. The bears are trying to stall the up-move at $1.20, but if the bulls do not allow the price to re-enter the triangle, it will enhance the prospects of an upside breakout. The pattern target of the setup is $1.43.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down and breaks back into the triangle, it will suggest that the recent breakout may have been a bull trap. The bears will then try to sink the price back toward the support line of the triangle.\n\nRelated: Institutions seek detailed blockchain analytics for crypto adoption \u2014 Elliptic\n\nEOS Token price analysis\n\nEOS (EOS) has been oscillating between $0.78 and $1.34 for the past several months. Generally, in such a large range, traders buy near the support and sell close to the resistance.\n\nEOS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe EOS/USDT pair bounced off $0.81 on May 25 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.89) on May 28. This is the first indication that the range remains intact. The bulls will try to push the price to the 50-day SMA ($1) where the bears are likely to mount a strong defense.\n\nIf the next dip finds support at the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are on top. The pair could then rise to $1.11. The bears will have to tug the price below the vital support at $0.78 to indicate the start of a downtrend.\n\nEOS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe recovery attempt is facing selling near the overhead resistance at $0.93 but the bulls have not given up much ground. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.\n\nIf buyers drive the price above $0.93, the pair could pick up momentum and rise toward the psychological level of $1 and subsequently to $1.11. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern, which generally behaves as a bullish setup.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAfter struggling near the 20-day EMA ($65.50) for the past few days, the bulls pushed the price above the resistance on May 27. This suggests the start of a possible relief rally.\n\nThe AAVE/USDT pair could first rise to the 50-day SMA ($70) and thereafter attempt a rally to the resistance line. A break and close above this level may start a short-term up-move.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that demand dries up at higher levels. The next support on the downside is at $62.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern which will complete on a break and close above $67.40. The pair could then start an up-move toward the pattern target of $74.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the current level, it will indicate that bears are fiercely protecting the $67.4 level. If the price slips below the moving averages, it will suggest that the pair may remain inside the triangle for some more time. A break below the triangle will invalidate the positive setup, tilting the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe play-to-earn gaming craze might have faded, but believe it or not, there remains a slew of crypto-infused games out there that let you earn Bitcoin while you play\u2014and you don\u2019t have to buy any NFTs to get started.\n\nSolitaire is one of the most popular games to be injected full of Bitcoin rewards on iOS and Android, with no fewer than three competing takes that let you stack sats (or satoshis, a.k.a. 1/100,000,000 BTC) while stacking digital playing cards: THNDR Games\u2019 Club Bitcoin: Solitaire, Bling Financial\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire, and Viker\u2019s Solitaire - Card Game 2023.\n\nAll three games are broadly similar, serving up a simple game of digital solitaire that\u2019s chock-full of obnoxious video ads. But all three games also truly do let you earn Bitcoin along the way and then withdraw it to a wallet. Keep your expectations in check, however: we\u2019re talking pennies\u2019 worth of BTC across hours of gameplay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd I\u2019d know, because I played approximately two hours of each game to see how much Bitcoin I could earn from each. Here\u2019s a brief review of each game (played on iPhone), along with a verdict on which Bitcoin solitaire app is most worth your time and attention.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire\n\nTHNDR Games makes an array of Bitcoin-awarding mobile games, including Tetro Tiles, and its Club Bitcoin: Solitaire (iPhone, Android) is by far the most visually appealing of the bunch. It spruces up this very traditional card game with a little bit of visual panache, and the streamlined interface with one tap to send any card to its rightful pile feels intuitive and responsive.\n\nBut it\u2019s stingy with the sats. You earn tickets while playing, and those are put into prize draws that could earn you large-to-small bundles of satoshis. But after two hours of total gameplay, I\u2019d only earned 59 sats\u2026 that\u2019s less than $0.02 worth. Plus, you have to redeem the sats and withdraw them to a wallet within a few days, otherwise they disappear.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire by THNDR Games. Image: Decrypt\n\nClub Bitcoin was the most enjoyable of the trio in terms of look and feel, but also provided the least amount of rewards. Your mileage may vary, however. No matter how it shakes out, you\u2019ll still have to sit through some truly laborious video ads for scammy-looking mobile games.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire\n\nBling Financial is another publisher with a heap of crypto-tinged mobile games, and Bitcoin Solitaire (iPhone, Android)\u2014created with PlayDay Studios\u2014was by far the most generous game of this trio when it comes to earning satoshis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGranted, it\u2019s all relative: after two hours of play, I had earned enough \u201cBling Points\u201d to withdraw 339 satoshis, or about $0.09 worth. That\u2019s still basically nothing, but it\u2019s more than five times the amount of Bitcoin that I earned while playing Club Bitcoin, with a similar amount of obnoxious ads permeating the experience.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire by Bling/PlayDay. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire has a more spartan design than Club Bitcoin, but the interface is just as responsive and it serves up an enjoyable game of mobile solitaire. I noticed that I won a lot more games in Bitcoin Solitaire than the other two games, though. It feels tuned to go easy on you, but when you\u2019re coasting to victory and racking up sats, it\u2019s tough to complain.\n\nSolitaire - Card Game 2023\n\nThere\u2019s an odd discrepancy between the iPhone and Android versions: the iOS game has the bland title above, while the Android one has \u201cEarn Bitcoin\u201d in the title. But appearances are a bit deceiving here, as both games may ultimately earn you tiny amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nIn this case, Viker\u2019s take on solitaire is solid but not quite as streamlined as the others.

And overall, the payout puts this game right in the middle of the others\u2014I earned 122 satoshis in approximately two hours of gameplay, coming out to just over $0.03 worth of BTC.\n\nWhich should you play?\n\nAfter earning less than $0.15 total for six full hours of gameplay, it\u2019s fair to say that none of these games are likely to grant you any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. If you care about solitaire gameplay most of all, then you can probably find a mobile rendition with more polish and less-intrusive ads.\n\nBut among games with crypto rewards, Bling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire hits the sweet spot. It\u2019s not the most stylish-looking of the bunch, but the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable and I earned the most BTC by far out of any of these games\u2026 even if it was barely a dime\u2019s worth."

        "content": "In what seems like a parody but isn\u2019t, economist, gold proponent and vocal crypto skeptic Peter Schiff has unveiled a collaborative nonfungible token (NFT) art collection on the Bitcoin network that will soon go up for auction.\n\nThe reaction from the crypto community has been mixed, with people generally baffled, amused or welcoming \u2014 especially Ordinals proponents \u2014 with some keen to point out the apparent hypocrisy.\n\nits a hack right?\n\n\n\ndid i just teleport to a different timeline?\n\n\n\nim so confused \u2014 Deezy (@CryptoDmack) May 26, 2023\n\nFor years, Schiff has actively bashed crypto \u2014 especially Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 at any chance, with his arguments revolving around BTC being a Ponzi scheme with no inherent value.\n\nDespite all of that, Schiff unveiled the \u201cGolden Triumph\u201d NFT collection in a May 27 Twitter thread in collaboration with one of his \u201cfavorite artists,\u201d who goes by the pseudonym \u201cMarket Price.\u201c\n\n\u201cThis collaboration features the original painting \u2018Golden Triumph\u2019 as well as a series of prints and Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGolden Triumph consists of one physical painting on an oil linen canvas depicting a human hand holding a bar of gold, 50 prints on archival paper depicting the same image, and 50 digital versions inscribed as Ordinal NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nThe collection will be sold via a two-part auction starting on June 2 and ending on June 9. For the Ordinals, the highest bidder will receive #1 of the collection, with the next 49 highest bidders receiving #2 to #50 in descending order.\n\nIt appears, however, that Schiff hasn\u2019t done a complete turnaround on BTC, but has woken up to a use case for blockchain technology: verifiable ownership of assets such as art via NFTs.\n\nCommenting on Schiff\u2019s tweet, Twitter user LoneStartBitcoin asked: \u201cSo... it\u2019s valuable to put your \u2018gold\u2019 inscriptions on Bitcoin, but bitcoin [BTC] itself is not valuable?.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Schiff responded.\n\nRelated: Peter Schiff blames \u2018too much gov\u2019t regulation\u2019 for worsening financial crisis\n\nAlongside his disdain for crypto, Schiff has also criticized NFTs on several occasions in the past.\n\nIn a blog post from March 2021, Schiff described NFTs as \u201cfake assets\u201d that offer nothing other than ownership of a digital image that can be \u201creplicated endlessly\u201d online.\n\n\u201cBut even as the owner of the image, you won\u2019t be able to control access to it. The file has been copied thousands of times, so anyone with access to the internet can look at it as much as you,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe sharp change in sentiment follows in a similar vein to former United States President Donald Trump, who has also aggressively slammed crypto on multiple occasions before getting involved with NFTs.\n\nIn December 2022, Trump teased a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d that supporters thought was politically related before unveiling the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection.\n\nMagazine: NFT Creator: Top 10 crypto artist Trevor Jones on being rich, rekt and rich again"

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals: A leap forward for the Bitcoin network\u2019s utility - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Rajagopal Menon\n\nBitcoin, the unrivaled titan of cryptocurrencies, has recently witnessed a burst of energy with the introduction of the ordinals protocol. This groundbreaking development has ignited fervent debate within the Bitcoin community, injecting a fresh dimension into the digital currency. So, what exactly are ordinals? Why are they causing such a stir? And what implications could they hold for the future of Bitcoin?\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of ordinals, let\u2019s start with a basic understanding of Bitcoin\u2019s structure. As most Bitcoin enthusiasts are aware, each Bitcoin is composed of 100 million satoshis, or SATs. Ordinals, however, revolutionise this notion by enabling the individual transmission of SATs with the option to attach supplementary data. This data can take various forms, ranging from text and images to videos. This process of associating data with SATs is known as inscription. Impressively, over 100,000 inscriptions have already been created since the inception of ordinals earlier this week.\n\nThe name \u201cordinals\u201d stems from the protocol\u2019s unique approach to numbering sets based on the order of their mining. Among these 100,000-plus inscriptions, notable examples include ordinal punks and ordinal penguins. Given the Bitcoin and broader crypto communities\u2019 proclivity for embracing and expanding on novel ideas, it is only reasonable to anticipate an influx of innovative and derivative concepts etched onto SATs. Crucially, these advancements have been made possible by the recent major upgrade to Bitcoin known as Taproot, which was implemented in late 2021.\n\nBut are these ordinals akin to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum platform? The answer is both yes and no. While some distinctions can be drawn between ordinals and the familiar NFTs, the comparison holds merit. It is worth noting, however, that NFTs rely on smart contracts and often have their underlying assets hosted elsewhere, whereas ordinals are directly inscribed onto individual sets within blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the press release accompanying their launch, as cited in Bitcoin magazine, it was emphasised that \u201cordinals are fully on-chain and do not require a side chain or separate token. Inscriptions inherit the simplicity, immutability, security, and durability of Bitcoin itself.\u201d Furthermore, Casey Rodimore, the creator of ordinals, elucidated in an interview with Decrypt that \u201cthe ordinals protocol is just a system for numbering satoshis, giving individual sets a serial number, and then tracking them across transactions.\u201d\n\nEssentially, ordinals have unveiled a new use case for the Bitcoin network, extending its utility beyond the mere transfer of value. Inscribed sets now compete for block space alongside regular BTC transactions, leading to an increase in network fees. While this might not sound ideal, it is crucial to remember that these fees serve as vital incentives for miners to secure the network. As block rewards diminish over time, network fees will inevitably become the primary reason for committing hash power to Bitcoin. In this context, ordinals contribute additional functionality to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ordinals have not only propelled the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses to a record high of 44 million but have also ushered in a novel and unique chapter in Bitcoin\u2019s history. This innovation generates network activity without necessitating the classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes. Consequently, the user base has expanded, exerting upward pressure on the fee market beyond the conventional investment and monetary transfer use cases.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Bitcoin community agrees with this innovation. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and about as OG as they come, sees ordinals as a \u201cfrivolous waste of block space\u201d and objects to \u201cthe sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding\u201d that does not do anything efficient. This disagreement sums up the divide in the Bitcoin community, with some fervent and non-toxic Maxis like Adam and others believing that Bitcoin\u2019s relative simplicity and limitations to storing and transferring value should be preserved at all costs, while more progressive voices argue that Bitcoin needs to adapt in order to thrive and survive.\n\nThis fundamental argument is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, but one thing is for sure: ordinals are generating a lot of attention and debate within the Bitcoin community. This is a welcome change from the FUD that has been clouding the industry, and we can expect to hear more about ordinals and their impact on Bitcoin in the months and years to come.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"
