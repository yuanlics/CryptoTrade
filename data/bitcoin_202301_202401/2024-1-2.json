        "content": "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.\n\nMeanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.\n\nIn Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.\n\nThe New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.\n\nUntil June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader."

        "content": "The world's largest cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $45,913.30 early Tuesday morning, according to Coin Metrics. That was its highest level since April 5, 2022, and the first time it has traded above the $45,000 mark since then. It was last higher by nearly 3%, trading at $44,952.89.\n\nBitcoin surged to start 2024, topping $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid an uptick in geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and growing optimism around a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval.\n\nThe increase showed bitcoin's role as a hedge against uncertainty, which investors became familiar with last year. Over the weekend, a Maersk vessel came under attack by four small boats crewed by Houthi militants, who are based in Yemen and backed by Iran.\n\nMost of the six-month rally in bitcoin is tied to the potential ETF, but before that narrative came into play, bitcoin's biggest catalyst was the regional banking crisis in the U.S. That led to bitcoin's first big gain of the year, allowing the cryptocurrency to shine as an alternative to the legacy system in place and hedge against uncertainty.\n\nThe move also comes amid continued excitement among traders that the U.S. could approve the first bitcoin ETF. This would allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency directly, likely appealing to larger institutional investors.\n\nOn Friday, BlackRock and other potential issuers updated the registration forms for their proposed bitcoin ETFs, including names of authorized participants. Investors are reading that extra detail as evidence that a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is coming soon. Many industry experts expect the funds to be approved in January.\n\nThe continued price gains for bitcoin follow 2023's hot streak, when the price of the digital coin rose 157% \u2014 and many expect the pop to continue.\n\nInvestors have high hopes for bitcoin in 2024. A decision on an ETF is widely expected to come sometime in January. Shortly after, in the spring, the Bitcoin halving is expected to take place, an event that historically has preceded steep price increases. Plus, Fed officials are anticipating at least three interest rate cuts this year after almost two years of hikes that have hurt the cryptocurrency.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also ticked higher Tuesday. Ether traded at around $2,367, up roughly 1%.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

But recent activity suggests that the SEC will finally stop saying no.\"\n\nBitcoin did give up some of its gains over the course of Monday but was still up more than 2% over the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET. The total market capitalization for all crypto assets was up 3% to $1.73 trillion as of Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSeveral other cryptocurrencies and bitcoin-related stocks rode the same momentum Tuesday before also giving back some of their gains. Software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), a corporate holder of bitcoin, ended up more than 9% and bitcoin miner Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT) was down slightly.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, was down nearly 10%.\n\nBitcoin is still far from its all-time high of $68,789 set in 2021, a year it benefitted from a period of low interest rates and fiscal stimulus that put excess savings in the pockets of investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market crashed in 2022 as rates rose and the giant crypto exchange FTX collapsed, before making a surprise comeback during 2023.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 150% last year as optimism about the arrival of ETFs surged due to a filing by BlackRock and a court decision in favor of another ETF applicant, Grayscale Investments.\n\nThe bull case for 2024 is that many of crypto\u2019s biggest problems are now officially in the rear-view mirror after the criminal conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a guilty plea from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin soared to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday morning, representing a 7% gain on the day and the cryptocurrency\u2019s highest level since April 2022. The latest uptick comes after Bitcoin had remained stuck in a band close to $43,000 for most of the prior two weeks following a series of gains in the last quarter that appear to signal a new bull market for the crypto industry after a disastrous 2022.\n\nBitcoin finished the year up 154%, making it one of the best performing assets of the year, while other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana likewise posted big annual gains.\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin, which gave up some of its gains midday Tuesday to trade closer to $45,000, appears tied to widespread anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve bids by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the next two weeks.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin ETFs is expected to attract new pools of capital into the crypto markets from institutions and other conservative investors who are restricted from buying Bitcoin directly, but may be willing to do so in the form of ETFs, which package assets in the form of shares traded on mainstream exchanges.\n\nIn addition to firms from the traditional financial sector, including Franklin Templeton, a number of pure crypto firms like Bitwise are vying to launch Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC had long refused to approve such applications, but the agency appears set to reverse course after a unanimous federal appeals court concluded its earlier refusals were unreasonable.\n\nThe recent price gains for Bitcoin have led some to speculate that the ETF approvals will prove to be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, and that the price will sag once the products are finally approved. Others have taken a more bullish case, predicting the price of Bitcoin has plenty of room to climb.\n\nAs with previous crypto bull markets, other cryptocurrencies\u2014including so-called altcoins\u2014have ridden Bitcoin\u2019s coattails to achieve gains of their own. The biggest gainer has been Solana, a rival smart contract platform to Ethereum that had been pummeled for its association with the fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried but has since won back confidence from the market. Solana began 2023 around $16 and is now trading near $108, making it the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency."

Unlike banknotes or minted coins that have a tangible physical form, cryptocurrencies can only be accessed using computers and other electronic devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decentralized currency is a currency not issued by a government or financial institution. In fact, no single person, company, or government controls a crypto's blockchain. Instead, it's run by a decentralized network of computers worldwide. Anyone with advanced technology skills and coding experience can create a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe lack of a central authority can also make cryptocurrencies more secure. \"It's hack-proof because there's no one central point of failure,\" explains David Donovan, executive vice president at Publicis Sapient.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies work?\n\nWhile there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, many with unique traits, they all tend to work in similar ways. It's hard to avoid some jargon when discussing cryptos, but the concepts can be relatively easy to understand.\n\nBlockchain technology\n\nA cryptocurrency's blockchain is a digital record of all the transactions involving that crypto. Copies of the blockchain are stored and maintained by computers around the world. They're often compared to general ledgers, part of traditional double-entry bookkeeping systems where each transaction leads to debit and credit in different sections of the books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It works like a general ledger \u2014 it's that simple,\" says Donovan. Perhaps you start with two coins and send one to someone. \"On the blockchain, it would say I'm sending you one coin, and I now have one coin, and you have one coin.\"\n\nEach grouping of transactions is turned into a block and chained to the existing ledger. Once a block is added it can't be reversed or altered \u2014 which is why people describe blockchains as \"immutable.\"\n\nSome cryptos have their own blockchain. For example, there are Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. But there are also cryptos that are built on top of an existing blockchain rather than starting from zero.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, but is also available for trading on other exchanges like Coinbase, Binance.US, and Robinhood.\n\nPublic transactions under pseudonymous\n\nCryptocurrencies have another defining feature. The blockchains are public ledgers, which means anyone can see and review the transactions that occurred. However, they can also provide a degree of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You have a private key, which is how you initiate transactions, and a public key, which is how someone identifies you in the market,\" says Donovan.\n\nA blockchain's transactions are tied to a crypto wallet's public key, but nobody necessarily knows who controls that wallet. This is why cryptos are often described as pseudonymous \u2014 the public key is a person's pseudonym.\n\nComing to consensus Cryptocurrencies commonly use one of two mechanisms to create a system of trust and determine which transactions are valid and added to their blockchain:\n\n\n\nProof of work . This relies on people around the world, known as miners, competing to be first to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and add the next block to the blockchain. The winners are paid after the other members of the network confirm that the required amount of computing power was used to find the solution. \"The way you make sure all the participants are validating the transactions is the hard work, effort, and money they're spending solving the problem,\" says Donna Parisi, global head of financial services and FinTech at Shearman & Sterling. However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power.\n\n.

This is a newer and less energy-intensive mechanism. \"Proof of stake is they validate transactions on the blockchain by people putting value on the line,\" explains Parisi. \"They stake some of the currency they own to make sure they only validate true transactions.\"\n\nTypes of cryptocurrencies\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there were more than 25,149 different cryptocurrencies with a global market value of about $1.16 trillion as of May 30, 2023. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include:\n\nBitcoin\n\nDogecoin\n\nEther\n\nLitecoin\n\nTether\n\nBinance coin\n\nDai\n\nTRON\n\nCronos\n\nUSD coin\n\nBitcoin cash\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was launched in 2009 as an alternative type of decentralized and digital money. Since then, people have also created cryptocurrencies that serve other functions or are designed for specific types of transactions.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies can have many different uses,\" says Parisi. \"Some are used in gaming environments to earn rewards in a game, while others facilitate payments. Some are designed for cross-border remittances \u2026 some are designed for micro payments.\"\n\nFor example, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that try to maintain a steady and fixed exchange rate with another asset, such as the US dollar. Governance tokens are another example of a specialized cryptocurrency. They give token holders voting power in a corresponding crypto project.\n\nInsider's Featured Crypto Apps Public Investing\n\nWealthfront Investing Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

This money has no physical equivalent, unlike tangible forms of currency like banknotes or minted coins. But just like physical money, digital currencies can be used to purchase goods and services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, you'll be limited to online platforms and communities, such as investing platforms, gaming sites, and gambling portals. Some of the most popular forms of digital currency include cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\n\"There's a strive toward decentralization,\" says Nisa Amoils, a managing partner at A100xx Ventures. \"Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies continue to be a worthwhile investment for many investors.\"\n\nDigital currencies come in two forms:\n\nCentralized currency: Currencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public.\n\nCurrencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public. Decentralized currency: Currencies not issued by governments or financial institutions. Instead, decentralized currencies operate through peer-to-peer financial networks to eliminate the middleman (aka banks) and allow lending, trading, and borrowing directly with merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDigital currencies like crypto are often appealing to investors who are wary of government-issued funds and are that are seeking alternatives.\n\n\"Some people who had been excluded from the traditional financial system, or have had their currencies devalued, are seeking an opportunity to participate in the markets, and this is a retail-driven phenomenon first,\" says Amoils. \"There's this crisis of trust, and people want wealth creation for themselves. And so that spurred this whole kind of trading speculative movement.\"\n\nHow to invest in cryptocurrency\n\nYou can start investing in cryptocurrencies through existing crypto exchanges and investing platforms. Some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Kraken and Coinbase) offer assets like staking rewards, goal-planning features, low fees, and more.\n\nSome of the best investment apps that offer cryptocurrencies (such as Robinhood Investing) include a range of investment types, low fees, market access, and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can create your own crypto\n\nAnyone with coding skills and/or advanced technical knowledge can create their own cryptocurrencies \u2014 although this is not always an easy feat and isn't recommended for beginners. The three ways to create crypto are:\n\nBuilding a new blockchain: The most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.\n\nThe most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.

Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge. Building upon a blockchain: The simplest way to make your own coins or tokens is by expanding upon an already existing blockchain. But keep in mind that the success of your cryptocurrency will be reliant on the success of the original blockchain. Some blockchains that allow this are Binance and Ethereum.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies secure?\n\nThe blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies can help ensure that the coins and systems remain secure. \"What's never been refuted is the value of blockchain,\" says Donovan. \"The way the ledger system is set up and every transaction is recorded. And the fact that it's immutable.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you don't need to worry about security. The crypto world is rife with scams. Of course, that's also true of traditional financial systems and currencies. Someone asking you to pay with a gift card or wire transfer is a red flag that you're dealing with a scammer. But several factors could make crypto scams especially worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, cryptocurrency transactions can't be reversed. There's also less regulation of cryptocurrencies and platforms than of traditional financial services in the US. Plus, some people may feel pressure to act quickly and send or invest their money because they're worried about missing out on an opportunity.\n\n\"One way to avoid a scam is to invest in more well-established cryptocurrencies,\" says Parisi. \"You still may be subject to scams or fraud in terms of how you hold it, send it, or receive it.\" But you can have some certainty that the cryptocurrency itself isn't a scam.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies a good investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies may present a good investment opportunity, and there are many ways to invest in the crypto world.\n\nYou could buy a coin (or coins) and hold onto them, hoping they'll increase in value. Or you could use your coins in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to earn interest through staking or lending. You also might take a more traditional route, such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is tied to cryptocurrencies. There could even be opportunities to invest in projects or supporting industries rather than in the cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"From an investment perspective, crypto is rapidly evolving,\" says Parisi. \"You shouldn't put an amount of assets you're not willing to lose. It should be, relatively speaking, a small portion of your portfolio.\"\n\nBefore making any investment, consider the potential pros and cons:\n\nPros Cons Easy to invest\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity\n\nFaster and cost-effective transactions\n\nDecentralized currency\n\nSecurity and transparency through the blockchain Cryptocurrencies can be very volatile\n\nSome crypto projects may fail\n\nThe investment may be a scam\n\nEnvironmental impact due to excessive power consumption through ASIC computers\n\nLacking refund and cancellation policies\n\nShould you invest in crypto?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency investing is a hotly debated topic, it's worth understanding what's going on so you can make an informed decision. If you decide to get started, you could fully jump in or just dip your toe.\n\n\"Learn about crypto by opening up wallets, accounts, trading currencies, and learning more about the use cases,\" says Parisi. \"But do it in a reasonable way. We're still in the early days, and regulation of crypto is still evolving.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonovan suggests opening an account with a regulated and publicly traded company like Coinbase. But, he says, \"It's really about being smart and using the system to take baby steps.\"\n\nCrypto FAQs\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an electronic version of money that verifies transactions using cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information). As Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur Jimmy Song says, Bitcoin is \"decentralized, digital, and scarce money.\" Bitcoin is decentralized because this code is run by thousands of computers (i.e., 'nodes') spread across the globe, digital because it exists as a set of code that determines how it operates, and scarce because its code caps its overall volume to 21 million bitcoins. When you use bitcoin to buy something, it records the transaction on a blockchain, which is essentially a ledger or database whose entries can't be modified or erased.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing platform network. The Ethereum network works like the Bitcoin network in that it's built on blockchain technology, essentially a digital public ledger where financial agreements can be verified and stored entirely by software \u2014 without the intervention of a third party.\n\nWhat are privacy coins? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that obscure transactions on their blockchain to maintain the anonymity of users and their activity. Participants in a transaction will know the amount transacted and the parties involved. However, the same information will be unobtainable to any outside observer. The anonymity that privacy coins provide offers a potentially appealing outlet for money laundering or other criminal transactions. As such, privacy coins are a point of contention in the ongoing debate around cryptocurrency privacy and regulation.\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. A crypto wallet is a software program or physical device that allows you to store your crypto and allow for the sending and receiving of crypto transactions. A crypto wallet consists of two key pairs: private keys and public keys. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to send crypto to the wallet. The important part of a wallet \u2014 and the part where new users often find themselves getting into trouble \u2014 is the private key. A private key is like the key to a safe deposit box. Anyone who has access to the private key of a wallet can take control of the balance held there. But unlike a safe deposit box, crypto users who hold their own private keys and make transactions using non-custodial wallets (i.e., a wallet not hosted by an exchange or other third-party) become their own bank.\n\nWhat is hash rate? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Hash rate is a measure of the total computational power being used by a proof-of-work cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain. It can also be a measure of how fast a cryptocurrency miner's machines complete these computations. Miners use computers to run computations on complex mathematical puzzles based on transaction data. These systems generate millions or trillions of guesses per second as to what the solutions to these puzzles could be. These are hashes, alphanumeric codes randomized to identify a single, unique piece of data.\n\nWhat is yield farming? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your cryptocurrency, similar to how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account. And similarly to depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called \"staking,\" for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is crypto staking? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Crypto staking is similar to depositing money in a bank, in that an investor locks up their assets, and in exchange, earns rewards, or \"interest.\" \"Staking is a term used to refer to the delegating of a certain number of tokens to the governance model of the blockchain and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time,\" says Nicole DeCicco, the owner and founder of CryptoConsultz, a cryptocurrency consultancy in the Portland, Oregon area. A particular network's protocol locks up an investor's holdings \u2014 similar to depositing money in a bank, and agreeing not to withdraw it for a set time period, which benefits the network in a couple of ways, according to DeCicco. First, this can increase the value of a token by limiting the supply. Second, the tokens can be used to govern the blockchain if the network uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. A PoS system \u2014 as opposed to a proof-of-work (PoW) one, which incorporates \"mining\" \u2014 can be fairly complicated, especially for crypto newcomers."

        "title": "Fidelity sets Bitcoin ETF fee at 0.39% ahead of expected SEC approvals - Fortune",
        "content": "As the Securities and Exchange Commission appears on the precipice of approving the first wave of Bitcoin ETFs, issuers are jockeying for an early advantage to attract investors.\n\nIn late December, two of the major issuers\u2014Fidelity and Galaxy/Invesco\u2014released details on their fees, while a slew of issuers named authorized participants, setting the stage for a battle to gain crucial early-mover status.\n\nThe crypto industry has long looked at a spot Bitcoin ETF as a surefire vehicle to bring traditional investors, from retail traders to asset managers, into the volatile sector.\n\nSince the Winklevoss twins first filed for approval in 2013, the SEC has rejected applications, citing the immature Bitcoin market and the potential for manipulation. After the crypto asset manager Grayscale won a critical court case against the agency in 2023, however, the SEC has signaled its intention to open the floodgates to the investment vehicle, which tracks the current price of Bitcoin.\n\nThere are currently 12 issuers vying for spot Bitcoin ETF approval, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. In late December, Reuters reported that the SEC asked issuers to file their last revisions to their applications by the end of the year ahead of a launch date that could come as soon as Jan. 10\u2014the deadline for the SEC to approve or reject the first issuer in line, ARK/21Shares.\n\nNew details\n\nAs issuers file updates to their applications, the details of how the ETFs will function has come into focus. For weeks, the predominant question has focused on the model of redemption that issuers will follow. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, function with the help of institutional investors called authorized participants who can create or redeem individual shares in the fund as part of an arbitrage system that keeps the price of the ETF shares close to the value of the underlying asset. While most ETFs hold traditional stocks or bonds, which are simple for authorized participants to buy and sell, a Bitcoin ETF presents a more challenging model.\n\nRather than having authorized participants buy or receive Bitcoin directly from the issuer\u2014the \u201cin-kind\u201d model\u2014the SEC pushed issuers to follow a cash model, which would put the onus of Bitcoin buying and selling on the issuer, reflecting the agency\u2019s reluctance to allow broker-dealers to handle Bitcoin.\n\nIn updated filings from Dec. 29, Fidelity, Galaxy/Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and BlackRock all listed the first authorized participants that they will work with. Fidelity and WisdomTree both named Jane Street Capital, a secretive trading firm that previously employed FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. BlackRock and Galaxy/Invesco, a partnership between the crypto firm run by Mike Novogratz and the traditional investment management company, both named JPMorgan and Virtu, a market-making firm. Valkyrie named Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nMore critically, two of the issuers released details on the fees that they will charge investors for the ETF\u2014a key element that could determine the most popular options in a crowded field. Invesco/Galaxy announced that it would waive fees for its first six months of operation and for the first $5 billion in assets held, followed by a 0.59% fee. Fidelity announced its fee would be 0.39%. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, predicted on X that BlackRock would set its fee at 0.47%.\n\nAs the crypto industry waits for the SEC\u2019s final decision, the price of Bitcoin is rallying on an expectation of approval, soaring to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday morning\u2014its highest price since April 2022."

Today is even Bitcoin\u2019s 15th birthday.\n\nThe US government should also be chuffed. Thanks to a healthy price rally, the Feds are now holding at least $8.3 billion in bitcoin \u2014 up from $5 billion less than three months ago.\n\nBetween November 2020 and 2022, authorities in three separate actions altogether disclosed seizing 207,189 bitcoin (BTC) tied to seminal dark web market Silk Road, its hacker Jimmy Zhong, as well as the hackers of crypto exchange Bitfinex.\n\nRead more: DOJ gets Silk Road coins worth $305M stuck in Bitcoin mempool\n\nLess than 5% of those hauls have been sold after officials offloaded 9,861 BTC once owned by Silk Road on Coinbase last February. The trades netted $215 million for $21,800 per bitcoin on average, about half the current price.\n\nUS attorneys at the time said they intended to sell the rest of Silk Road\u2019s bitcoin \u2014 41,491 BTC worth $1 billion then and $1.8 billion today \u2014 in four batches over the next calendar year, a period which expires in two months.\n\nThe US government has historically sold bitcoin way too early\n\nOnly one batch has been potentially processed so far, when the US Department of Justice sent 8,200 BTC ($252 million then, $350 million now) to Coinbase last July. But it\u2019s so far unconfirmed whether any trades actually took place.\n\nCounting those transactions as sales would mean the US has generated $640 million by seizing and selling bitcoin over the past decade.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has multiplied 70 times in that time. Had the US government opted to hold all its seized bitcoin, rather than sell it, the Feds would still have around 400,000 BTC ($17.4 billion), nearly double its current cache.\n\nMarkets could indeed see more Silk Road bitcoin dumped by the US government over the next couple of months. There\u2019s however no word yet on a timeline to sell the bitcoin seized from Bitfinex hackers Ilya \u201cDutch\u201d Lichtenstein and Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan.\n\nToggle the chart to US dollars to see just how much the US has missed out on (figures rounded)\n\nIn any case, the US could have the largest government bitcoin stash in the world, according to at least one set of researchers last year. The US was found leagues ahead of El Salvador, Ukraine, Bhutan, Venezuela and Finland, which together hold only 4,000 BTC ($172 million).\n\nChina was left out of that particular paper. Beijing seized 195,000 BTC ($8.4 billion) from crypto Ponzi scheme PlusToken in 2020 alongside swathes of other cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH) and XRP.\n\nIf Beijing hasn\u2019t sold too early like the US, that would put the two superpowers basically tied for bitcoin holdings.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Read on to find out what's got people so excited about spot Bitcoin ETFs, why the SEC has hesitated to approve any up until now, and what it means for you as an investor.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nETFs, also known as exchange-traded funds, are baskets of securities that trade on the stock market. That could be stocks, bonds, real estates, or commodities. Think of it like buying shares in a company that owns and manages those assets. In this case, the ETF would contain Bitcoin and investors could get exposure to the lead cryptocurrency directly from their brokerage account.\n\nVarious groups, including ARK Investment, BlackRock, and Grayscale Investments have spot ETF applications in the pipeline. The SEC has rejected previous spot Bitcoin ETF proposals on fears of fraud and market manipulation. It's concerned there aren't enough investor protections in crypto. However, last year, a court ruled that it was wrong and the SEC did not challenge the decision.\n\nIn recent months, it's been in detailed discussions with various prospective ETF issuers, fueling speculation that we may soon see an approval. The SEC has until Jan. 10 to decide whether it will approve the initial applications. Several analysts believe it will happen before that. Others say the SEC might want more time, or reject the applications altogether.\n\nThe SEC approved a Bitcoin futures ETF a few years ago, but the spot ETF is a different kettle of fish. Futures are a type of derivative. If you own futures, you own a contract to buy or sell that asset at a certain price in the future. You don't actually own the asset. A spot Bitcoin ETF would hold Bitcoin rather than contracts to buy or sell the crypto.\n\nWhat a Bitcoin ETF might mean for crypto investors\n\nIf the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF it would mean people could buy Bitcoin without having to use a crypto exchange or broker. It won't solve all of crypto's issues, but being able to access Bitcoin from the stock market could remove one big hurdle for institutional and retail investors alike. It would make it safer and easier to buy and store Bitcoin.\n\nThe high-profile collapse of several top crypto exchanges highlighted the limited protections in the crypto world and severely dented investor confidence. Crypto assets do not have the same protections as securities in a brokerage account or cash in a bank. If you leave your cryptocurrency on an exchange, you may lose everything if that exchange fails or is hacked. While crypto investors can opt to store their Bitcoin in a crypto wallet, this takes knowledge and brings its own risks.\n\nIn contrast, shares in an ETF -- even a spot Bitcoin ETF -- would be held in a brokerage account and covered by SIPC insurance. SIPC stands for Securities Investor Protection Corporation and covers up to $500,000 of customer assets in the event your brokerage collapses.\n\nSIPC insurance does not protect against volatility or poor market performance. So if Bitcoin collapses completely, you would lose your investment whether you held Bitcoin in an ETF or any other form.\n\nWhat steps crypto investors might take\n\nFirst of all, try not to get tied up in the frenzy around a Bitcoin ETF. Speculation is rife in the cryptocurrency world, which can mean prices soar in the run up to big news events only to fall when the event actually happens. For example, Ethereum's (ETH) price dropped after its long anticipated merge to a more sustainable mining model.\n\nTake a step back and think about Bitcoin's long-term potential and how it might fit into your portfolio. Make sure you understand the risks involved. If the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, that won't automatically make crypto safe. The industry is still relatively new and unregulated and there are a lot of questions about how it might unfold.\n\nFor example, we don't yet know what shape a U.S. regulatory framework will take. Some fear it could cripple this emerging industry while others believe it would give the industry stronger foundations from which to grow. A lot depends on the details, which have yet to be hammered out. But increased regulation will have an impact on crypto prices in the short term.\n\nIf you're considering buying Bitcoin for the first time, be prepared for volatility. Crypto fluctuates much more dramatically than the stock market, which can come as a shock. I've seen my crypto portfolio's value drop by around 50% in a matter of months, and it is unnerving to say the least. Make sure high-risk assets like crypto only make up a small percentage of your portfolio, and only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF approval could change the crypto landscape, making it easier and safer to hold the granddaddy of crypto. However, don't assume it will solve all of crypto's issues. The volatility and regulatory challenges won't go away just because the SEC greenlights these ETFs, assuming it does grant the expected approvals."

        "title": "Why the Bitcoin Price Will Rise or Fall on the ETF Ruling - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin is up over 150% in 2023, and that momentum has captured hearts and minds on Wall Street, resulting in a landmark rush for its firms to launch the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll eyes are now on the upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, slated for January 10.\n\nIf the past is any indication, the ruling will have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price, though whether positive or negative remains to be seen.\n\nPotential for a Price Rise\n\nProponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that its approval by the SEC would open the door to a flood of institutional and retail investments, driving the price of Bitcoin to new heights.\n\nHistory offers a glimpse into how expectations surrounding ETFs have affected Bitcoin's price.\n\nIn 2017, the price of Bitcoin surged to over $1,400, driven in part by the anticipation of the first Bitcoin ETF. This was up from lows in the $600 range just the year before.\n\nInvestors believed then that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for institutional money to enter the market, leading to a frenzy of buying. However, the SEC ultimately rejected the proposal, causing a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price.\n\nWithin days, the price was trading back below $1,000.\n\nUltimately, however, the arrival of Bitcoin futures would bring new attention in 2017, the market surging above $20,000 that year.\n\nPrice increase from CME Bitcoin futures announcement to listing.\n\nElsewhere, we can fast forward to 2021, when Bitcoin once again rallied to all-time highs, reaching over $60,000.\n\nThis time, the rally was partly fueled by the successful launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs in Canada and Europe. These ETFs allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The anticipation of a similar product in the U.S. contributed to the bullish sentiment.\n\nFinally, in the wake of fake news of an ETF approval earlier this year, Bitcoin's price rose by several thousand dollars in minutes, a move that suggests upside volatility on approval is likely.\n\nThe Bitcoin price spikes on fake news of an ETF approval.\n\nPotential for a Price Fall\n\nOn the flip side, there are arguments suggesting that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to a price correction.\n\nSome market experts fear that the ETF could become a target for short sellers, leading to increased volatility, or that the ETF could be a \"sell the news event.\"\n\nMoreover, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may bring greater regulatory scrutiny to the cryptocurrency market as a whole. This heightened oversight could lead to increased taxation, reporting requirements, and potential restrictions on the use of Bitcoin, which may dampen enthusiasm among investors.\n\nAdditionally, some believe the market may already have priced in the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF approval, and any decision to deny it might lead to disappointment and a sell-off similar to what was witnessed in 2017 when the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF was rejected.\n\nBitcoin price sell-off after the ETF rejection in 2017.\n\nThe final decision by the SEC is eagerly awaited by the crypto community, but it's essential to remember that it is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin's price.\n\nMarket sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitical events will also play their part in shaping the coin's future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin's price is at a crossroads as investors await the SEC's decision on the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile past instances have shown that ETF expectations can have a substantial impact on Bitcoin's price, it is crucial to consider the broader market dynamics. Whether Bitcoin's price rises or falls after the SEC ruling will depend on a multitude of factors, including how the market interprets and reacts to the decision.\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, but it's undeniably a pivotal moment for the world's only decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "SEC, stock exchange officials meet ahead of potential spot bitcoin ETF approval - Fox Business",
        "content": "A series of meetings between the Securities and Exchange Commission and a handful of stock exchanges are fueling confidence that the approval of a long-awaited spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund could be imminent.\n\nFOX Business has learned that SEC staff attorneys from the Division of Trading and Markets are meeting Wednesday with officials from the major exchanges \u2014 the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange \u2014 where the ETFs would trade.\n\nThe meetings are seen as a positive sign that the SEC is nearing approval of some or all of the dozen applications by major money managers and crypto firms for the product, according to people at the firms who asked not to be quoted by name. Specifically, the SEC is asking the exchanges to revise and finalize their so-called 19b-4 filings, submitted by the exchanges on behalf of issuers, which must receive SEC clearance before the ETF can be sold to the public.\n\nSEC HOLDS CALLS WITH SPOT BITCOIN ETF HOPEFULS AS POSSIBLE APPROVAL NEARS\n\nWhile the final decision has not been made, sources close to the proceedings say the SEC could begin notifying issuers of approval on Friday with trading beginning as early as next week. ETF analysts and issuers alike remain confident that a favorable decision from the SEC will be made on or before Jan. 10, as the SEC continues to meet with key players on the matter.\n\nOf course, the SEC could deny the applications. Hours before FOX Business reported on Wednesday\u2019s meetings, Singapore-based crypto platform Matrixport released a research note stating it expects the SEC to reject all spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing the Democrat majority on the agency\u2019s five-member commission and Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s reluctance to embrace crypto.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell by more than 7% on the heels of that report after exceeding close to a two-year high of $45,000 on New Year\u2019s Day in anticipation of a spot ETF approval.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR,\" an SEC spokesperson told FOX Business. \"Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\"\n\nPress officials from the NYSE, Nasdaq and CBOE didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nIf approval does occur, retail investors would gain greater exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency at less cost than the already approved bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nPurchasing an ETF through highly regulated and trusted money management firms such as BlackRock or Fidelity may also encourage a larger pool of investors to add cryptocurrency to their portfolios."

        "title": "Will a Bitcoin ETF Make Crypto Go Mainstream? - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the idea of bringing bitcoin to the masses was but a twinkle in the Winklevoss twins\u2019 eyes. Bitcoin, of course, is much easier to buy than it was when Barack Obama was president, but the fees, delays, and existential risks of crypto exchanges have led most of the investing public, including nearly all institutional investors, to remain on the sidelines. To date, there arguably hasn\u2019t been an easy, cheap, low-risk way for regular folks with a 401(k) or a brokerage account to buy into the digital currency. But the widely expected approval by regulators of numerous bitcoin-exchange-traded funds in the coming days could change all that.\n\nETFs, as they\u2019re generally known, are a $7.7 trillion industry, making them one of the world\u2019s most popular ways to invest. A (usually) cheaper and easier evolution of the mutual fund, they\u2019ve been around for 30 years and are deeply ingrained in the way investors around the world now make, and lose, money on Wall Street. At the heart of it, these funds are just ways to buy and sell more complex investments in exactly the same way you might buy and sell a single company\u2019s stock. If you want to buy gold or a given category of bonds or even just stick it to Jim Cramer, you can buy or sell an ETF to do it. To date, the most notable exception to that rule has been bitcoin \u2014 with the Securities and Exchange Commission having rejected many applications over the years, starting with the Winklevii\u2019s in 2013. (There are a few bitcoin-related ETFs currently approved, but they are based on derivatives rather than actual bitcoin.)\n\nNow, voices ranging from laser-eyed bitcoin evangelists to Wall Street analysts are predicting that various versions of a bitcoin ETF will be available by January 10. The frenzy over the change has been enormous. The digital currency \u2014 abandoned by all but the most fanatical early last year \u2014 has been streaking to new recent highs and rose past $45,000 during the holidays, more than tripling its post-FTX low. In 2024, which is, as of this writing, not yet two days old, it has risen as much as 8 percent.\n\nBREAKING: Bitcoin is now trading above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\n\n\nThis puts #Bitcoin up 175% over the last year and 210% above its November 2022 low.\n\n\n\nA Reuters report this weekend said SEC Bitcoin ETF approvals could be coming as soon as this week.\n\n\n\nSince SEC\u2026 pic.twitter.com/u9hvRkNMbY \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 2, 2024\n\nThe hype comes down to this: An ETF makes investing in bitcoin easy and relatively more safe. People trust ETFs because they\u2019re simple to buy and sell nearly instantly \u2014 decidedly not the case when it comes to most digital currencies \u2014 and fully regulated. The ease and peace of mind could (in theory) lead to a flood of money that will push the price of bitcoin even higher over the coming weeks, months, and years.\n\nThe companies getting involved here are, in many cases, household names (and not just for people who have their own pet theories about what happened to Satoshi Nakamoto). Industry giants BlackRock and Fidelity are among those positioned to make the first offerings, which could trade on exchanges like NASDAQ. Expectations around the new ETFs have led to a boom not just of bitcoin\u2019s price but also boosted other digital currencies, including ones that were all but left for dead after their close association with convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about little people getting hurt in this stuff, you would want these big, reputable firms to be involved. We\u2019ve always said the ETF is SBF-proof,\u201d said Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who has been monitoring the creation of the crypto fund. He predicts there\u2019s a 90 percent chance that the ETF will be approved by government regulators in January. (An online prediction site pegs the odds at roughly the same.)\n\nSo what happened? If you take a look at the details of the Winklevoss twins\u2019 very first proposal for a bitcoin ETF and the ones that are being proposed today by BlackRock and other big firms, they are \u201cnot really\u201d all that different, Balchunas said. What changed was a big loss in court in August when a judge ruled that the SEC was arbitrarily preventing another massive crypto player, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, from offering its ETF in the U.S. (It\u2019s currently available in Europe and other markets.) The SEC, which is led by chairman Gary Gensler, has been a bogeyman for the crypto industry in large part because of the roadblocks it has set up against the creation of these kinds of funds. For a long time, the regulators said they were concerned about market manipulation \u2014 and about investors losing money. But after the start of the pandemic, when digital currencies of all stripes caught on in a big way with at least some sectors of the public \u2014 and with the agency green-lighting ETFs tied to bitcoin-futures contracts \u2014 the argument became less and less tenable.\n\nThere also has been a real change in the mood around crypto over the past few months, following a string of legal actions and prosecutions by the U.S. government. In the fall, Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO, was found guilty. Then his counterpart at Binance, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to money-laundering violations and stepped down from the company. Su Zhu, the founder of Three Arrows Capital, crypto\u2019s biggest hedge-fund flameout, got arrested; Do Kwon, the guy whose spectacular collapse presaged all the other reckonings, is on the verge of getting extradited to New York to face federal charges for financial crimes.\n\nIn the wake of the cleanup effort, and with growing interest from financial giants like BlackRock, it now appears that bitcoin is on the verge of going corporate \u2014 and fast. Balchunas pointed out that you could even see the changing market psychology in play in the way that some of these proposed ETFs are named. While fund manager VanEck uses the crypto slang term HODL as the ticker for its fund, BlackRock is using the much more sober-sounding IBIT. \u201cWhen it comes to, like, the 75-year-old boomer or a wealth manager, bitcoin is crazy enough. The ticker should almost offset a little bit of the volatility,\u201d he said.\n\nGrayscale, the company whose lawsuit was at the center of the SEC\u2019s legal about-face, is also moving quickly for approval. On the day after Christmas, the company announced that its chairman, Barry Silbert, would be stepping down. (He is a named defendant in a fraud suit from the New York attorney general\u2019s office, and there are multiple investigations into the company from New York and federal regulators over its lending business with the Winklevoss twins\u2019 exchange.) On January 2, the company filed an updated, though incomplete disclosure that included some technical changes that regulators are said to expect from these firms.\n\nThat the new bitcoin ETFs are probably almost here was confirmed in late December, as public filings have made it clear that the SEC is getting very involved. James Seyffart, also an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said:\n\nSo far we know there were at least 7 separate meetings/calls between SEC and potential #bitcoin ETF issuers yesterday. Total meetings at 32. Notably @BitwiseInvest, @InvescoUS, & @hashdex aren't showing official meetings (Yet?). Maybe SEC is okay with their current S-1 documents? pic.twitter.com/HoUI27RMqU \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 22, 2023\n\nSpeaking as someone who\u2019s neither a regulator nor a financier, that sure seems like a lot of meetings in a short period of time for something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. There have also been technical changes to the way people will be able to invest in the ETFs, which appear to be one of the final hurdles. \u201cBased on information that\u2019s come in in the last 24 hours, it looks like they\u2019ve given informal approval,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nEven Cramer \u2014 usual caveats apply \u2014 seems convinced that this is happening:\n\nJUST IN: Jim Cramer says you can't kill #Bitcoin and it's here to stay. pic.twitter.com/wYKrDqsfQm \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 2, 2024\n\nFor the bitcoin set, the timing of an approval could be a giant boon. Wall Street has all but placed its bets that the Federal Reserve will avoid a recession with the first cuts to interest rates expected around March, market data shows. The everything rally that has been going on for the past few weeks could certainly creep into crypto ETFs. Balchunas expects there will be about $55 billion to $60 billion invested in these ETFs by the end of the next two or three years. This is far from a guarantee that people wouldn\u2019t lose money \u2014 the digital currency is notoriously volatile, and it\u2019s unlikely that new funds would change that about it. But for people who just want to gamble a little bit, why not? \u201cIt is a bridge between the crypto underworld and the traditional finance world \u2014 and the baby-boomers of America who have a lot of money,\u201d Balchunas said."

        "content": "Bitcoin popped to start the new year as eager investors drove the price to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday. The rally began late Monday night and quickly pushed the cryptocurrency above $45,000. It hit a high of $45,913.30, a level not seen since April 2022. While bitcoin ended 2023 with a brief pause in its overall uptrend, it still posted its fourth positive month in a row and a 157% gain for the year. The next stop on the way to a new all-time high is between $48,000 and $50,000, chart analysts told CNBC. \"Bitcoin is breaking away from a three-week consolidation pattern which usually causes an acceleration in the direction of the break, i.e. higher,\" said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com. That means bitcoin shouldn't spend too long at its new level, he added. BTC.CM= 1D mountain Bitcoin rallying to start 2024 Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said the reacceleration following the recent consolidation is \"very encouraging action\" and that he \"would expect an overbought signal and consolidation to develop\" between $48,000 and $50,000. De Kempenaer said bitcoin should hold $45,000 for the next day or two for the breakout to be confirmed and for the price to become bitcoin's new support level. Even with small pullbacks in sight, investors have high hopes for bitcoin in 2024. In the first half of the year, a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is expected to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bitcoin halving that typically precedes strong gains in the price will take place just a couple months later. Some on Wall Street have expressed concern that the market reaction should an ETF get greenlit may not live up to the hype that has driven the crypto market for the past six months, and that the market could correct all the way down to $32,000. Nevertheless, traders broadly remain optimistic on the long-term view of the asset class. But first, bitcoin has to reach $48,000, de Kempenaer said. Bitcoin hasn't traded above $48,000 in about two years, according to Coin Metrics."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, and Riot Platforms Popped to Start 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The stock market has been off since Dec. 29, but the crypto market has been open, leaving four days of catch-up for equity investors. So, a relatively modest move of 3.6% over the last 24 hours for Bitcoin (BTC -6.30%) has driven a double-digit increase in crypto-related stocks.\n\nIf we go back to the market close on Friday, Bitcoin's value is up 7.3% after a big increase in value on Monday. MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%) responded by jumping as much as 15.2% in early trading Tuesday, and Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%) was up 10.6%. The two stocks are up 9.6% and 0.8%, respectively, at 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nBitcoin drives the market\n\nThere was a crypto rally to start 2024, and gains were widespread across the market. But the biggest tokens have seen the most gains as there's a flight to quality in both crypto and the stock market. That's why Bitcoin and Ethereum are up over the last few days, while Solana, Binance, and XRP are about flat.\n\nWhen Bitcoin rises, it greatly impacts some leveraged Bitcoin plays. MicroStrategy is one of the most impacted, with 158,400 Bitcoin on its balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, levered by $2.2 billion of debt.\n\nRiot Platforms produced 552 Bitcoin in November 2023 and sold 540 Bitcoin. However, the company held 7,358 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, so any increase in value for Bitcoin will make the company's balance sheet more valuable.\n\nIn the base of both MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms, today's price increase is catching up from four days of the market being closed and Bitcoin rising in value.\n\nWhere does Bitcoin go from here?\n\nIt's important to understand the opportunity and risk for the companies we invest in, and for Bitcoin-related companies, there can be some strange impacts. While investors can get direct exposure to Bitcoin by simply buying Bitcoin through a centralized exchange or a crypto wallet, companies like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms offer even more exposure by holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy levers returns by adding debt, and as a miner, Riot Platforms has operating exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThere continue to be rumors that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is imminent, but we haven't seen that come to pass. I'm not sure the market's reaction would be positive if an ETF were approved in the U.S. There's often a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" reaction from the market, and Bitcoin has been rising for three months in hopes that an ETF is near.\n\nIf an ETF is approved, I wouldn't be surprised to see values fall.\n\nOutside of an ETF, Bitcoin has traded hand in hand with growth stocks in the past three years, and that will likely be the case in 2024 as well. If the stock market -- specifically growth stocks -- does well, it would likely be positive for Bitcoin, but a correction could be bad news as investors seek out safety.\n\nBitcoin hasn't been a safe haven in a falling stock market. So, investors must be aware of the risks and rewards for top cryptocurrencies in 2024."

BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, as well as crypto-focused firms Valkyrie and Bitwise, revealed key details, including partnerships with vital trading firms and the fees their prospective ETFs will charge customers if the SEC gives the green light. Friday's filing rush suggests the firms aren't willing to take any chances on timing. Bloomberg analysts have said the SEC is likely to approve multiple issuers at once to avoid picking favorites. Thus, the eager issuers are getting all the ducks in a row so that they can be in the first group."

        "content": "Bitcoin Flash Crashes to $40,750, Causes Over Half a Billion in Long Liquidations\n\nOn Wednesday morning Eastern Time, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden crash in a matter of minutes, as the price of Bitcoin dropped from around $45,132 to as low as $40,750, erasing gains seen in the past week.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin's price has fallen by almost 9.5% in an abrupt flash crash. The crash resulted in the liquidation of over $595 million in crypto long positions in the past 24 hours, including $137 million in Bitcoin longs in the past hour alone, as per data from CoinGlass.\n\nAltcoins also suffered sudden losses alongside Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) plunged by 10.9%, while Solana (SOL) crashed by over 20% during the flash crash. However, Bitcoin and altcoins have subsequently recovered from the lows.\n\nIn a research note for clients released on January 3 titled \u201cWhy the SEC will REJECT Bitcoin Spot ETFs again,\u201d Matrixport\u2019s Head of Research Markus Thielen argued that the SEC would likely reject all applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, contradicting its earlier stance on January 2 that the approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs \u201ccould be announced today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe price slump comes as the crypto market awaits the SEC's decision on whether to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the coming days. Some analysts speculate that the decision could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" event. The reasons for the sudden sell-off are still unclear, but it could be related to profit-taking ahead of the SEC's decision, uncertainty in the broader financial markets, or a combination of factors.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

The regulator kicked the can down the road last year but it now faces a Jan. 10 deadline to either approve or deny Ark Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMany analysts expect the SEC will decide on several ETFs simultaneously to avoid giving one provider a head start. Financial giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are among the asset managers whose ETF applications could be approved soon.\n\nFederal regulators have long bristled at the idea of an ETF backed by Bitcoin, citing its susceptibility to fraud and market manipulation. But the odds of approval increased significantly last year when a court ruled that the SEC needed more reason than it had provided for denying asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc.

Both stocks fell slightly after midday but remained up on the previous close.\n\nShares of Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S.-domiciled crypto exchange and the preferred asset custodian of most prospective ETF providers, were more than 8% lower as of Tuesday afternoon.

Let's go to the Y-Fi Interactive because you're going to see a notable difference from the screen just as it was a few minutes ago. And there. There's all that green. And you put it over the last three days because we are in the midst of a multi-day rally, you can really see some of the outperformers here.\n\nFor what it's worth HEX's up 84% over this time, Solana up 10.8%, even Shiba Inu up 10%. And you take a look at some of the crypto stocks here, let me go to a market cap view. So the bigger ones that have Bitcoin exposure pretty much down here, but here's MSTR strategy, that's up about 4.2%. And we'll get a two-day chart there, you can see quite a big pop on the open.\n\nI was looking at some of the pre-market movers here, and this is over the last three days. If you take a look at the last-- at only one day, a lot of these losses that we were seeing over that period have been clawed back here. Let me just go back to Bitcoin and chart the price action over the last year because this latest breakout is par for the course.\n\nWe have seen just a series of higher lows and higher highs here. We've seen a number of consolidations, a lot of flags here, and they have all resolved to the upside. So this is the definition. This is a textbook stair stepping trend higher, not only over the short term, but over the long term as this has been in place for several months now.\n\nI want to show you Bitcoin seasonality. I was able to generate this. And Bitcoin, this goes all the way back to 2011, so it's basically the average of the returns every day of the year. And when I say that, it's every day of the year it trades. So that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nBut you can see it's a really choppy here. We tend to take a little bit of a tumble in May, June, early summer, then find our footing in July with another upswing in October. We'll have to see how it plays out this year, but seasonality worked so well last year with stocks, so worth paying attention to."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrency players have been expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a slate of spot bitcoin ETFs in January, but one crypto firm isn't so optimistic.\n\nIn a report published Tuesday, Matrixport said the SEC is poised to reject applications for spot bitcoin ETFs this month, and new products won't get the green light until at least the second quarter of 2024. Such a rejection would come as a surprise to the market, and it could result in a steep crash in bitcoin's price.\n\n\"While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves,\" the research firm said.\n\n\"We could see Bitcoin prices declining by -20% very quickly and falling back to the $36,000/$38,000 range,\" Matrixport added. The researchers forecast that a denial from the SEC could spark \"cascading liquidations,\" and most of the $5.1 billion in perpetual long bitcoin futures could unwind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey note that SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn't embraced cryptocurrency, and he still sees a long road ahead for the industry to mature.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, market experts say, would accelerate crypto's development.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, Matrixport said Gensler and the Democrat-heavy group of voting Commissioners are unlikely to want to legitimize bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nOf the $14 billion of extra fiat and leverage that's been deployed into crypto since September, researchers estimate that $10 billion of that could be tied to hopes for a spot bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStefan Rust, the chief executive of economic data firm Truflation, echoed Matrixport's prediction that the government isn't ready to green-light a spot bitcoin ETF \u2013 especially if it entails giving multiple providers simultaneous approval.\n\n\"Governments and regulators haven't yet identified how they can exert control over cryptocurrencies,\" Rust said in a note Wednesday. \"No doubt they are looking for more time and choke points to inhibit access to cryptocurrencies from a decentralized system.\"\n\nTo Matrixport, if regulators do not hand down any approvals by January 5, traders should hedge their long exposure by buying $40,000 strike puts for the end of the month, or even shorting bitcoin via options.\n\nThat said, should the SEC deny applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, Matrixport expects bitcoin prices to still end the year higher than $42,000, given bullish tailwinds including the US election and developments in bitcoin mining such as this year's halving event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin climbed more than 150% in 2023. On Wednesday, the token was down by 5%, trading around $43,780."

        "title": "Watch Bitcoin ETF Fully Priced In: Glen Goodman - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHow much is already in the price? How much further do you think this rally could go? Well, your guy James there is on record saying he thinks that there's about a 90% chance of approval, at least of some of the ETFs. And quite frankly, it's not just him. It's well, I mean, he's he's he's done really well. He's come up with a lot of the intelligence on this whole thing. But pretty much everyone is bought into this idea that the ETF is a coming. So, yeah, I mean, when it comes to it being priced in, I'd say it's pretty fully priced in probably. And when you look actually at the futures funding rates on various crypto exchanges like Binance and so on, you see that those there are quite frothy levels. A lot of people are borrowing a lot of money in order to buy Bitcoin. So if it did start falling, you could get that kind of domino effect where accounts start getting liquidated because people have overstretched themselves on the old on the old leverage. So this is what worries me is that it feels like a bit of a lose lose situation as it if you do get ETF approval, then perhaps a little of that is already priced in and in. If you don't get ETF approval, then who knows? Yeah. Do you have a sense of how far bitcoin could drop if you don't get that approval? It's worth talking about because it's been like it's been a foregone conclusion by the market standards. But Gary Gensler has not been shy about cracking down on this industry. Absolutely. That's the one factor I think that people are forgetting here, because we're hearing so many positive signs, like Cathie Wood, who you had on just the other day talking about how they've been sort of, you know, sort of behind closed doors discussions over the holiday period between S.E.C. officials and, you know, asking all kinds of technical questions, which makes it sound like they're about to dot the I's and cross the T's. But Gary Gensler, we know he just he never has anything to say about it, though, does he? So he is the unknown factor in all this. And frankly, he is the boss. So if he suddenly decides, no, it's not good enough, we need more things done. We need, for example, like the guy from Bitgo recently said, maybe they will insist on separating custody and exchanges in a very, very deliberate way. You know, something like that. That could be all kinds of factors that could just delay this. And if we get the impression from them that the delay is open ended as opposed to just, oh, we just want a few final things done, then it could be really bad. And you ask me how far the Bitcoin price could fall. I mean, we know from past experience when the Bitcoin price falls, sometimes it really falls in ways that stock markets very, very rarely do. You know, absolutely terrifying falls that could wipe out, as I said, a awful lot of banks could wipe out, you know, even months of gains. So what I've done, I'll tell you what I'm doing is I'm lighting up a bit. You know, I've been long for quite a while now following this trend all the way. I'm lightning. I'm not selling all my stuff because quite frankly, this is just a theory. And maybe the price will continue rising as more and more people get excited about the ETF approval, assuming it is approved. But, you know, just to be on the safe side, I'm kind of thinking the risk reward is not looking so great at this level. So that's why I've lightened up my holdings. Well, Glenn, it's interesting because what you're saying runs counter to what many people are telling us on this program who are very excited about what a spot ETF ultimately could mean. Obviously, when we talk about crypto, most of these tokens don't trade on anything fundamental. They maybe latch on to one narrative like, say, a spot ETF getting approved. So in the absence of that, what other catalysts do you see for 2024 that could be supportive or not to prices across the board? Well, I should just make the point I'm talking short term timescale here, but that talk about lightning up is because as we know, you know, Bitcoin could fall like 25% or something and barely break a sweat, you know, and then it could go all the way back up and further. That's the kind of thing Bitcoin does. And because I'd rather not lose 25% or whatever, that's what I'm lining up. But for the long term Bitcoin ETF approval is fantastic news. You've talked about it loads on Bloomberg, so I won't bore you too much with that. But but you know, you get the idea. It's a fantastic story for the longer term. Now other drivers for this coming year, gaming is pretty significant. A.I. is pretty significant. Decentralized social media is still one to look out for, I think, because it feels like the social media space is still trying to find its feet again after the whole kind of Twitter. You know, lots of people hating Elon Musk, setting up threads and blue sky and all these other platforms, It feels like this could still be space for a really major, decentralized, sort of decentralized social media platform. So that's something exciting. There are a lot for narrative that are good looking ahead, but frankly, the ETF approval is the best narrative of."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -7.01%) had a tremendous year in 2023, soaring 154%. This gain matches what some \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks were able to do.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still remains 35% below its peak price. So there is a lot of room to go to regain a new high.\n\nAs of early January, the price sat at roughly $45,000. But bullish investors have their sights set on a major milestone: the $100,000 mark. Can the world's top cryptocurrency reach this six-figure sum?\n\nMultiple catalysts to benefit from\n\nIt's easy to be optimistic that Bitcoin's price will rise 122%, even within the next 12 to 24 months. There are numerous catalysts the digital asset can benefit from.\n\nAbout every four years, Bitcoin's blockchain undergoes what is arguably the most bullish event for this cryptocurrency. The so-called \"halving,\" set to take place in April, is when the reward that miners receive for processing transactions gets cut in half, thus reducing the new supply of Bitcoin hitting the market. When you add this to steadily rising demand over time, the recipe for strong price gains is there.\n\nHistorically, the months before and after a halving have seen Bitcoin post huge growth. Based on the price performance in 2023, investor enthusiasm is already there.\n\nAnother catalyst would be the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). There are a number of asset management firms vying to introduce this product to the market. Some experts believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve these ETFs this month.\n\nSome investors, whether individuals or institutions, might still be skeptical about buying Bitcoin directly. They could be worried about how to custody it, or about the uncertain regulatory outlook.\n\nHowever, if spot Bitcoin ETFs become a reality, I think it would make this crypto a legitimate financial asset with the government's stamp of approval. The result could be that huge sums of capital flow into Bitcoin, demand that can support a higher price.\n\nWhile both the halving and the approval of a spot ETF capture the minds of investors, there's an under-the-radar catalyst that could propel Bitcoin.\n\nAnd this is the reversal of the Fed's tighter monetary stance. Inflation has shown signs of cooling over the past several months. And with it getting more under control, the central bank could institute rate cuts throughout the course of 2024. This would be a welcome sign, especially for risky assets.\n\nIf the Fed adopts looser monetary policy, economic activity could begin to pick up. And more capital can flow toward various asset classes, particularly those further out on the risk spectrum. Plus, Bitcoin could benefit from its continuing media coverage.\n\nMaintain a long-term focus\n\nI think there's a very high probability Bitcoin could reach the $100,000 mark within the next three years. I also wouldn't be shocked if the crypto hit that figure by the end of 2024. There are just so many positive developments working in its favor right now.\n\nDespite the reasons to be optimistic, investors must always keep their sights set on the long term. Anything can happen in a given month, quarter, or year. And the last thing you want to do is panic at the absolute worst time and sell your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nInstead, aim to grow your knowledge about Bitcoin, gaining greater conviction in the process. And don't be discouraged if your portfolio doesn't immediately register monster gains. This is an asset that should be held with a time horizon of five to 10 years, at least."

Discover SCENE\n\nLong-time crypto critic Jim Cramer appears to have had a change of heart\u2014at least regarding Bitcoin. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill it,\u201d the Mad Money host said on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street show on Tuesday.\n\nAlong with Warren Buffett and his late business partner, the CNBC host has been notoriously bearish on cryptocurrency. But Cramer says Munger missed the boat on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe late Charlie Munger, who was so brilliant on so many things, was blind to this,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer's comments come as the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed $45,000 on January 1 for the first time since April 2022. It was in June of that year that Cramer noted a growing pessimism about crypto in Silicon Valley after the last market dump, which he dubbed \u201cCrypto Monday.\u201d\n\n\"A lot of younger people and people who borrowed money, they are going to be gone today if they are not careful,\u201d Cramer said at the time.\n\nCramer's track record of dubious calls has been the source of multiple eye rolls from the crypto faithful, even inspiring an Inverse Cramer meme and applications for an Inverse Cramer ETF. The hook? Doing the opposite of everything Cramer says. And now that he's warming to Bitcoin, some crypto faithful are worried.\n\n\u201cShit, now Bitcoin is dead,\u201d prominent Bitcoiner Dan Held wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean BTC is doomed?\u201d Director of Operations at Nillion, Amro Shihadah, said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer\u2019s tone began to change in November after Bitcoin crossed $38,000, which also led some to speculate a subsequent drop because of the notion that the opposite of anything Cramer predicts will happen.\n\nDespite his previous comments, Cramer called Bitcoin a technological marvel today, and noted the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's inability to shut it down.\n\n\u201cIt's a reality and it's a technological marvel,\u201d Cramer added. \u201cI think people have to start recognizing that it's here to stay; the SEC has been against it the whole time.\u201d\n\nEven though Cramer may be changing his tune on Bitcoin, he did note that enthusiasm does not translate to the crypto market as a whole.\n\n\u201cNow, that doesn't mean that every one of these is here to stay,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cBut I do think that it's about this, a remarkable comeback, that was unexpected. Except for all the bulls who turned out to be right.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Not too long after touching a high of $45,000 for the first time since April 2022, bitcoin witnessed a sharp fall to trade at $42,685 on Wednesday, registering a 6 percent fall in 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data revealed.\n\nFollowing a high of $45,500 on Wednesday, bitcoin slipped to as low as $40,550, registering 10.9 percent fall before bouncing back to $42,200, revealed CoinDesk data. The unanticipated slide is seen as an outcome of jitters around the expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. The fall has wiped off most of the gains that took place on Jan 1 which led to the liquidation of $500 million of positions across derivatives exchanges. Ironically, the massive slide coincides with the release of a new video by ETF applicants Galaxy and Invesco commemorating bitcoin's birthday.\n\nWhat led to the fall?\n\nExperts point out that there are several reasons for the fall, which include the lower likelihood of passage of ETF, decline in stocks of companies which deal in the mining off cryptos and the rising sell-offs.\n\nOne user Greeks.live wrote on X Platform, \u201cThe likelihood of the ETF's passage became less and less likely, and the market saw a stalemate. Weakness in crypto mining stocks, and the sell-off in several crypto-related U.S. stocks, also reinforced the market's skepticism.\"\n\nOther crypto tokens also followed suit with Ethereum losing 6.91 percent to trade at $2,228, Solana fell 12 percent, ripple lost 13 percent of its value and Cardano fell over 10 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\nIt is vital to mention here that bitcoin ETF was expected to be approved as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday, Reuters had reported citing sources.\n\nConversely, financial services firm Matrixport rebuffed the optimism in a report.\n\n\"From a political perspective, there is no reason to approve a bitcoin spot ETF that would legitimize bitcoin as an alternative store of value,\" the report reads.\n\n\u201cWhile we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refilling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves. This might be fulfilled by Q2 2024, but we expect the SEC to reject all proposals in January,\" the report further adds.\n\nMilestone Alert!

For the latter, Jan. 3 is the actual date Bitcoin materialized as a store of value and transferable currency.\n\nBitcoin genesis block details. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThe genesis block, a.k.a. the first Bitcoin block, was mined on Jan. 3, 2009, by its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

On the occasion of Bitcoin\u2019s 15th birthday, we take a bird\u2019s eye view of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin ATM Network\n\nBitcoin ATMs were first conceived nearly five years after the first block was mined, with historical data confirming that the first ATM went live in October 2013. The motive was to provide another avenue for people to exchange their local fiat currencies for Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ATM network saw staggered growth initially, thousands of Bitcoin and crypto ATMs were added yearly across the globe as mass Bitcoin adoption brewed. At its peak, nearly 40,000 Bitcoin ATMs were active on the network in 2021.\n\nCrypto ATM installations growth to date.

The growing interest from individuals and corporations in mining Bitcoin confirms the process as a viable business model that also helps secure the Bitcoin network from external attacks.\n\nLatest BTC blocks.

On the other hand, several countries like China and Saudi Arabia continue to restrict the use of Bitcoin \u2014 given its ability to provide unsolicited freedom from centralization.\n\nBitcoin's journey from worthless to priceless\n\nBeating all odds, Bitcoin now boasts a nearly $900 billion market capitalization, a valuation accumulated in just 15 years. In 2010, an early Bitcoiner convinced a pizza joint to sell him two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Today, he could start his own pizzeria business for not much more than just one Bitcoin.\n\nEstablishments across nearly all business verticals have started to accept Bitcoin in exchange for their services.

Reuter reported that the US regulator may approve issuers on 2 or 3 January 2024.\n\nThe SEC has only permitted bitcoin futures ETFs, and has so far rejected all the applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.

Authorised participants have an agreement with the ETF issuer that it can manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares in the primary market so that the ETF accurately tracks the value of its underlying index.\n\nFor example, Balchunas noted that BlackRock was the first to name APs for its proposed bitcoin ETFs on 29 December \u2013 Jane Street Capital and JP Morgan Securities. Subsequently, WisdomTree and Fidelity both named Jane Street as an AP and Valkyrie Digital Assets also named Jane Street as an AP, alongside Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nJust to be clear: the AP names weren't due in S-1s, so BlackRock adding them in there is a bit of a flex in that regard. So if we see other S-1s not naming AP doesn't mean they don't have one lined up. But this does make BlackRock the first horse officially ready imo. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nFidelity's S-1 in as wow, it included its fee which will be 0.39%, by far lowest so far, also names Jane Street as AP. Fidelity is officially ready to party. pic.twitter.com/Taq32IGB0L \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nBalchunas found that Invesco named Virtu and JPMorgan as APs and the fund manager waiving fees for first six months and for first $5bn in assets:\n\nInvesco/Galaxy is in and here's a whopper: it will be waiving fee for first six months AND for first $5b in assets, APs named as well, Virtu and JPMorgan (again lol). Another horse in. Are we having fun yet? pic.twitter.com/mDUOOSnA29 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nAll or almost all of these filers have their AP's lined up and they know what their fees are going to be (at least roughly). These N/A's will have to be filled in before launch and before SEC signs off on the S-1's but are not needed for 19b-4 approvals as far as i'm aware \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 2, 2024\n\nData provider CCData said in a report in December that the pending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF contributed to the performance of bitcoin in 2023.\n\nBitcoin rose 156% in 2023 which CCData said was more than traditional financial benchmarks such as Nasdaq, S&P500, and Gold, and will remain a catalyst this year. The approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF could propel Bitcoin\u2019s price to \u201cnew, extraordinary heights\u201d according to CCData.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application sent waves through the market, as the world\u2019s largest asset manager signalled keen interest in the digital asset industry,\u201d said the report. \u201cInstitutionally, we have observed key signs of positive sentiment following the rebirth of the industry post-FTX, with participation by sophisticated players rising at a consistent pace.\u201d\n\nCCData highlighted the performance of gold following the launch of the first SPDR ETF and said bitcoin may be entering a new period of accessibility and adoption.\n\nBlockworks Research said in a daily newsletter that 2024 is starting with bitcoin pumping at over $45k, a new local high\n\n\u201cThe CME BTC Futures are trading at a ~2.5% premium to spot, showing that TradFi is certainly getting ahead of the announcement,\u201d added Blockworks. \u201cBTC miners are also rallying after a large sell-off across the board on 29 December.\u201d\n\nGrayscale Investments, the digital currency fund manager, said in a blog that if the SEC approves trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this may broaden the number of investors with regulated access to digital asset investment products, and potentially result in new net demand for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIn light of a relatively \u201ctight\u201d supply backdrop, as well as the halving of Bitcoin issuance scheduled for April 2024, new net inflows into the asset should have positive implications for Bitcoin\u2019s valuation, in our view,\u201d added Grayscale.\n\nIn August 2023 Grayscale won a lawsuit against the SEC, challenging the regulator\u2019s decision to deny conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale, said in a statement at the time that the win brought the market one step closer to making a US spot Bitcoin ETF a reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d added Sonnenshein. \u201cGrayscale has adhered to US financial rules and regulations in building our product suite since our founding in 2013, underpinned by one fundamental belief: investors deserve transparent, regulated access to crypto.\u201d"

Mike is also an advocate for the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the US. In a recent interview, the CEO of blockchain investment firm Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, announced that \u201cbig things are coming\" (Mike Novogratz/Facebook)\n\nEver since the first Bitcoin ETF was launched in Canada, American investors have sought that such an investment vehicle be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This will potentially make sure there is an index fund that mirrors the price of bitcoin. There would also be no need to directly buy the cryptocurrency. Companies like Fidelity, SkyBridge, and Valkyrie have lately filed applications, and Galaxy Digital, in partnership with Bloomberg, also happens to be a candidate.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nIt is unclear when a Bitcoin ETF may actually be approved. However, the Federal Reserve previously acknowledged that bitcoin could really become an important digital asset. Back in September 2022, the White House appreciated the technological innovation of digital assets. It also praised the way these assets may be potentially applied. The four existing Bitcoin ETFs in Canada reportedly totals over 1.5 billion dollars in assets.\n\nMike\u2019s statement, thus, appears to be a ray of hope.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAccording to Corporate Finance Institute, \u201cBitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the value of Bitcoin and trade on traditional market exchanges rather than cryptocurrency exchanges. They allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to go through the hassle of using a cryptocurrency exchange while providing leverage to its price.\u201d\n\n\u201cnvesting in a Bitcoin ETF provides leverage to the price of Bitcoin without having to learn about how Bitcoin works, having to sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange, and taking on the risks of owning Bitcoin directly. For example, Bitcoins are held in a wallet, and if an investor loses the password to the wallet, their Bitcoin is lost forever. A Bitcoin ETF simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin,\u201d it adds."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d That includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through January 2, 2024)\n\nBitcoin finished 2023 up ~155% and is already off to a hot start for 2024 as its price nears $45,000.\n\nXRP\u2019s price closed out 2023 at $0.61 for a gain of 82%.\n\nEther\u2019s price closed out 2023 near $2,300 for an annual gain of 90%.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nVettaFi is hosting its Cryptocurrency Symposium on January 12th where industry experts will discuss the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the strategic role of futures-based products, and other crypto insights.

        "content": "The city of Hong Kong is serious about crypto. After three years of struggles with COVID-19, the city is vibrant and flourishing again as business executives and tourists of all kinds pour back into Asia's financial center. New guidelines from the Securities and Futures Commission are paving the way.\n\nSince Hong Kong FinTech Week last year regulators have been building a comprehensive license regime for digital assets. Regulated under the principle of \u201csame business, same risks, same rules,\u201d digital assets are now being approached with similar rules to traditional financial ones. This has resulted in breakthrough moments for the industry this year such as when Hong Kong's licensed exchange HashKey launched a digital asset exchange App, and various traditional financial institutions received relevant licenses allowing them to offer digital asset retail trading.\n\nThis was made possible by the Hong Kong government's comprehensive strategy to make the city a desirable Web3 hub. It started with a goal to improve foreign investment and talent recruitment.\n\nThe Hong Kong government sees the digital assets industry as a driving force behind its immigration and foreign investment back into the city. Other steps the Hong Kong government has taken in this area include: announcing a series of policies focused on attracting overseas family offices with tax incentives and releasing a plan that allows Bitcoin to be purchased through compliant exchanges which is currently under consideration by Hong Kong's Investment Immigration Program.\n\nBy attracting foreign investment and top talent, city leaders hope to recover business confidence and a more diverse digital economy. In addition, the updated immigration talent scheme is designed to attract high earners and foreign graduates from top universities. So far the Secretary for Labour revealed the office has received more than the expected number of applications. All these efforts will lay a stronger foundation for the city to have a diverse pool of talent for the digital economy.\n\nDigital asset licensing has opened up opportunities to create powerhouse Hong Kong-based crypto companies. At Metalpha, we recently obtained an uplift on our Type 4 license (advising on securities). This will enable us to expand our efforts in advisory and issuing analysis, and allow us to publish reports to qualified investors on digital assets. This is a milestone for us and it further shows SFC\u2019s confidence in our business approach.\n\nIn fact, since the start of this year, we have observed strong demand from family offices and public companies asking how to invest in Bitcoin in a compliant way. Smart investors who see through the noise and beyond the negative headlines are being rewarded with clear opportunities to grow and benefit from crypto and Web3. I believe more companies will apply for licenses to attract investment, boost their business credibility, and pursue new opportunities as a result.\n\nA recent story reported by the Financial Times shows that Hong Kong is projected to overtake Switzerland as the world\u2019s leading cross-border wealth management as Asia spearheads the growth. This massive global wealth shift presents a great opportunity for investors eyeing digital assets. As regulations become clearer for the digital assets industry in the coming years, Hong Kong will stand out as a city that offers a balanced approach to innovation and risk assessment.\n\nLooking forward to the new year, I am confident that Hong Kong will keep playing a key role in building the Web3 hub and enter further direct competition with Singapore, which had an early mover advantage in crypto. And this is a good thing. Investors should have more options to choose the best crypto projects or companies to work with. As for customers, it will boost confidence once they know their service provider is secure and compliant in the eyes of regulators.\n\nThis is a guest post by Adrian Wang.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has made a triumphant return as 2024 commenced, breaking through the elusive $45,000 price barrier for the first time since April 2022, per a CNBC article. This remarkable resurgence comes as investor confidence swells in anticipation of the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), offering a more accessible avenue for institutions to invest in digital assets.\n\nImpressive Price Rebound\n\nBitcoin's comeback in 2024 has been nothing short of spectacular, defying previous market trends. The cryptocurrencies winning trend started from late 2023 only. The digital coin recorded a staggering 157% price increase last year. Investor confidence grew amid prospects of a Bitcoin ETF (read: 5 Favorable Events Bitcoin Had in 2023: ETFs in Focus).\n\nA bitcoin ETF would provide investors with a regulated and simplified way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, without the need to directly hold the cryptocurrency. Prominent players like BlackRock and others have recently updated their registration forms for proposed bitcoin ETFs, hinting at an impending decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Industry experts are optimistic about the approval of these funds, with expectations running high for an announcement in January.\n\nHalving Event in 2024\n\nAnother key factor contributing to Bitcoin's positive outlook is the upcoming halving event scheduled for 2024. During a halving event, the rewards offered to miners are halved, effectively reducing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, these events have often preceded significant price surges, making them a point of anticipation for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Momentum Extends Beyond Bitcoin\n\nThe bullish sentiment is not exclusive to Bitcoin; other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing substantial gains. Ethereum (Ether), a prominent altcoin, has seen a notable 4% increase in its price, reaching approximately $2,387. Solana, another rising star in the crypto world, surged by an impressive 7%, attaining a price point of around $113.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgainst this backdrop, following are the regular ETFs on this concept that may win in the near term.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nVanEck Digital Transformation ETF DAPP \u2013 Up 290.5% in 2023\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF BKCH \u2013 Up 275.4% in 2023\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI \u2013 Up 310% in 2023\n\nFirst Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT \u2013 Up 205.7% in 2023\n\nFidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF FDIG \u2013 Up 171.2% in 2023\n\niShares Blockchain and Tech ETF IBLC \u2013 Up 202.2% in 2023\n\n(Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

        "content": "January 02, 2024 12:27 pm | Updated 12:27 pm IST - SINGAPORE\n\nBitcoin rose above $45,000 on Tuesday for the first time since April 2022 as the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency started 2024 with a bang buoyed by optimism around possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin touched a 21-month peak of $45,488, having gained 154% last year in the strongest performance since 2020. It was last up 2.6% at $45,344 but remains far off the record high of $69,000 it touched in November 2021.\n\nEther, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, was 1% higher at $2,376 on Tuesday.\n\nInvestor focus has been squarely on whether the U.S. securities regulator will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would throw open the bitcoin market to millions more investors.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected multiple applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in recent years, arguing that the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nIn recent months, however, there have been increasing signs that regulators are prepared to sign off on at least some of the 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, with expectations that the decision will likely come in early January.\n\nRising bets that major central banks will cut interest rates this year has also been a boon for cryptocurrencies, helping shake off the gloom that had settled over crypto markets following the collapse of FTX and other crypto-business failures in 2022.\n\n\"The crypto market is set to experience notable growth this year, with key influencing factors being the influx of investment funds from spot ETFs, Bitcoin halving, and a more accommodative monetary policy both in the United States and worldwide,\" said Jupiter Zheng, partner of liquid funds at HashKey Capital."

        "content": "On this day, 15 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block of the Bitcoin network, laying the foundation for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSince 2009, the community has celebrated Bitcoin\u2019s birthday every January 3, reminiscing about one of the most significant moments in crypto history.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 15th Anniversary\n\nThe genesis block contains the first 50 BTC earned as a reward for the transaction, which was released on Sourceforge, a web-based service offering developers a centralized online location to control and manage free and open-source software projects. Sourceforge was the original repository for Bitcoin\u2019s open-source code base before it was moved to GitHub.\n\nDue to the absence of a previous block to be referenced, the first 50 Bitcoins are unspendable and have remained in the transaction address.\n\nThe block contains a message from Nakamoto quoting a headline from the UK\u2019s Times newspaper: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious Bitcoin creator released the project\u2019s whitepaper the year before in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, considered the most severe economic fallout since the Great Depression in 1929. The Bitcoin concept introduced a pseudonymous, decentralized, and trustless financial system far from the reach of banks and intermediaries, which Nakamoto did not like.\n\nHow Far Has BTC Come?\n\nFifteen years down the line, BTC has altered the landscape of digital assets and the financial market as a whole. Bitcoin has evolved into a network with a market capitalization of more than $888 billion, leading an ecosystem worth $1.8 trillion while maintaining 52% dominance in the cryptoverse.\n\nAlthough BTC is currently worth around $43,000, its value once rose above $68,000. The asset has garnered the interest of governments, banks, traditional finance giants, corporations, and high-networth individuals, leading to the creation of several derivatives, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe crypto community anticipates the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a feat that more than a dozen asset management firms are vying for. There is also the upcoming Bitcoin fourth halving set to reduce the production rate of BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC finished 2023 as the best-performing asset with an increase of 160%, ahead of stock indexes, bonds, equities, and gold."

        "content": "Bitcoin pared back its big new year gains on Wednesday before slightly recovering on the third day of the year, thanks in part to a new bearish report by a crypto researcher.\n\nOn the 15th anniversary of the minting of Bitcoin\u2019s genesis block, the most popular cryptocurrency was trading down 4% at about $43,300, down from the two and a half year high of $45,800 it reached on Tuesday, according to CoinGecko. That high came as Bitcoin jumped nearly 8% to start the new year.\n\nOn Wednesday the coin hit a speed bump on its path to what some say is an extended bull run in the making in response to a new report by Markus Thielen, founder and head of research for 10x Research. In the report, Thielen, who was previously head of crypto research and strategy for digital asset investment firm Matrixport, rejected the commonly held belief that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMuch of Crypto Twitter painted the new report as Thielen\u2019s personal opinion that was mostly not backed by new information. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X that he had \u201cheard nothing to indicate anything but approval.\u201d A report by Fox Business on Wednesday also claimed that the SEC was holding meetings today with exchanges such as Nasdaq, CBOE, and the New York Stock Exchange to finalize comments related to spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDespite the pushback, Bitcoin still fell.\n\nPeople tagging me like crazy on this \u201crejection\u201d report.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith anticipation of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF reaching fever pitch levels in the opening days of 2024, frenzied discourse on the subject has now settled around one question: Is it already priced in?\n\nSome in crypto think the answer\u2019s yes. It\u2019s been over two months of non-stop gains for BTC, fueled almost entirely by excitement surrounding a Bitcoin ETF\u2019s imminent approval. At this point, with the cryptocurrency at near-double its price in October, how much more juice could possibly be left to squeeze?\n\nBut many diehard Bitcoin advocates are emphatic that the event hasn\u2019t been priced in\u2014meaning that, in their opinion, BTC is poised to rocket even further upwards if and when a Bitcoin ETF is approved in coming weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would at long last give traditional retail investors an easy way to gain exposure to BTC\u2014no crypto exchanges or wallets needed. But the SEC has rejected every proposal for such a product over the last 10 years, pointing to the potential for market manipulation in Bitcoin as its primary reason. But that was then and BlackRock is now\u2014and the Wall Street titan\u2019s entry into the Bitcoin ETF race means it\u2019s finally going to happen, most analysts say.\n\nMy strategy is understanding ETF has been priced in over the past few months - so no new big positions Holding spot, with a few low leverage trades on strongest altcoins and a few small caps Angel investing and preparing for new launches Keeping it simple at the time being, a\u2026 \u2014 Rager (@Rager) January 3, 2024\n\nAll signs point in the direction of an approval, which could then lead to a wave of fresh capital entering the market. It\u2019s the reason some traders and analysts are so bullish and expect a near immediate impact on BTC\u2019s price following the SEC\u2019s green light.\n\nSuch predictions tend to center on a belief that even taking recent gains into account, a substantial portion of the market has not been able to process the importance of a Bitcoin ETF approval, which some experts predict will change Bitcoin forever by integrating the digital asset into the global economy.\n\nThe ETFs are not priced in. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) December 31, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs much as the event has been priced in, considering how much hangs in the balance, there is definitely some money sitting on the sidelines waiting for an actual confirmation,\u201d Joel Kruger, a strategist at LMAX Group, told Decrypt.\n\nKruger predicts that in the day or two following the first Bitcoin ETF\u2019s approval\u2014which analysts predict will happen in the next week\u2014BTC\u2019s price will likely jump by 10%. At that point, he says, there may be a brief period of consolidation and correction before the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency begins pumping again. As early as spring, according to the strategist, BTC could shatter its all-time high price of $69,000, which it briefly touched in late 2021.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, concurs that BTC is poised to continue its winning streak through and past the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cWe don't think it\u2019s fully priced for several reasons,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nButterfill points to the almost $14 trillion worth of American assets that he says will have the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin once a spot Bitcoin ETF is greenlit. While only a fraction of that market is likely to opt in, it's nonetheless difficult to overstate the significance of the fact that Bitcoin might soon have theoretical interconnectivity with the majority of the US economy.\n\nFurther, the analyst has observed that, in the last quarter, inflows into existing Bitcoin investment products have come principally from Europe\u2014suggesting to him that many U.S. investors are waiting for U.S.-based ETFs to become available to then jump into Bitcoin.\n\nOther analysts, though, have been hesitant to paint such an unambiguously rosy picture of a Bitcoin ETF\u2019s likely price impact.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a report Wednesday that he finds it 75% likely that a Bitcoin ETF approval becomes a \u201csell the news\u201d event\u2014meaning one that drops BTC\u2019s price due to a flood of investors selling off the cryptocurrency at the perceived crest of medium-term hype.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything points towards traders being considerably exposed ahead of the verdict, with derivatives pushing massive premiums following BTC\u2019s last three months of continuous upside momentum,\u201d Lunde said.\n\nThe analyst did note, though, that if ETF inflows were substantial enough to offset that \u201csell the news\u201d outflow, the event could end up becoming a net boon for BTC. By Lunde\u2019s estimates, Bitcoin ETFs would need to attract fresh inflows of $2.3 billion in January alone to keep the asset\u2019s price from dropping. That new capital would have to be genuinely new; moving funds from Bitcoin futures ETFs to newly minted spot Bitcoin ETFs wouldn\u2019t count.\n\nLunde puts the likelihood of such an outcome at 20%\u2014certainly not impossible, but also not particularly likely. John Palmer, president of spot crypto clearinghouse Cboe Digital, previously told Decrypt that a terrific outcome for spot Bitcoin ETFs in their first year would be to attract $10 billion to $15 billion worth of investment by the end of 2024."

Along with Bancel\u2019s comments, Moderna shares got a lift Tuesday when brokerage firm Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to \"outperform,\" arguing that Moderna could develop ways to use its mRNA technique to fight diseases beyond COVID-19 over the next few years. Analysts at Oppenheimer led by Hartaj Singh wrote they believe the company will have five new products on the market by 2026. Moderna shares tumbled about 40% last year, making it one of the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks. -Bill McColl\n\nApple Stock Tumbles Following Barclays Downgrade Shares of Apple (AAPL) sank 4% Tuesday, wiping more than $100 billion from its market capitalization after Barclays expressed doubts about the health of iPhone demand. Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201cunderweight\u201d and warned clients in a research note that iPhone 15 sales have been \u201clackluster.\u201d Long also cautioned that muted demand for Apple\u2019s best-selling product could impact sales of its next model, the iPhone 16, and other hardware categories like Macs, iPads, and wearables. Apple\u2019s hardware sales and total revenue have declined for four straight quarters, yet its stock steadily climbed over the same period. Apple\u2019s fast-growing services unit was one bright spot for the company last year, but Long expects growth to slow and regulatory scrutiny over the company\u2019s App Store and revenue-sharing agreements with Google (GOOGL) to intensify. Barclays\u2019 bearish outlook puts the firm squarely in the minority. Of the 44 analysts covering Apple tracked by the Wall Street Journal, 22 rate the stock a buy, and 5 are overweight\u2014one step below \u201cbuy\u201d in terms of conviction. Just 4 analysts have assigned the tech giant a rating of \u201cunderweight\u201d or \u201csell.\u201d\n\nMidday Movers: Moderna Rises After an Upgrade, While Apple Falls Following Downgrade Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other semiconductor firms fell after the Dutch government curbed exports of some chipmaking equipment by ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) to China. Apple (AAPL) shares also slumped after Barclays downgraded the stock and cut the price target, pointing to concerns about iPhone demand and the company\u2019s overall hardware sales. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and rival cruise lines dropped as naval military action in the Middle East region raised worries about sea travel. Moderna (MRNA) shares soared as CEO Stephane Bancel indicated the vaccine maker expects sales to grow in 2025, and as Oppenheimer analysts upgraded the stock, saying its mRNA technique used in COVID-19 vaccines could be used to fight other diseases over the next few years. An upgrade and price target increase from Wells Fargo sent Centene (CNC) shares higher. Tapestry (TPR) shares increased when JP Morgan raised the price target, arguing earnings growth for the owner of Coach and Kate Spade brands will accelerate. -Bill McColl\n\n\n\nASML Falls After The Netherlands Curbs Exports of Some Tech to China American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) dropped over 3% in intraday trading Tuesday as Dutch officials blocked the semiconductor production equipment maker from exporting some of its products to China. The company said a license for shipment of its NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i lithography systems in 2023 \u201chas been partially revoked by the Dutch government, impacting a small number of customers in China.\" The move came as the U.S. has also ramped up restrictions on certain tech exports to China over concerns about national security. ASML said it doesn\u2019t believe that the decision by Amsterdam or the latest American export controls will impact its 2023 financial outlook. Despite Tuesday's decline, ASML Holding N.V. ADRs have gained more than 30% over the past year. -Bill McColl\n\nTesla Spared Big Tech Sell-Off After Meeting 2023 Delivery Goals Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were little changed Tuesday morning, bucking the trend among its Magnificent Seven peers, after the electric vehicle leader said it had met its 2023 production and delivery goals. The company produced 495,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, bringing its 2023 total to nearly 1.85 million, a 35% increase over 2022. It delivered about 485,000 last quarter for a total of 1.81 million in 2023. Both figures were slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates and the guidance Tesla issued in October. Still, America's largest EV maker trails its main competitor on the global stage, China's BYD Co. (BYDDY), which delivered more than 3 million fully electric and hybrid vehicles last year.\n\nBitcoin Surges to 21-Month High The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed Tuesday to its highest since April 2021 as anticipation of a spot exchange-traded fund built. Investors are increasingly convinced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week will approve at least one of the many spot Bitcoin ETF applications it is currently considering. The regulator kicked the can down the road last year but it now faces a Jan. 10 deadline to either approve or deny Ark Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. Many analysts expect that the SEC will decide on several ETFs simultaneously to avoid giving one provider a head start. Financial giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are among the asset managers whose ETF applications could be approved. Federal regulators have long bristled at the idea of an ETF backed by Bitcoin, citing its susceptibility to fraud and market manipulation. But the odds of approval increased significantly last year when a court ruled that the SEC needed more reason than it had provided for denying asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nOne company that\u2019s likely to win regardless of which applications are approved is Coinbase (COIN), which has been named the asset custodian in the majority of the ETF applications before the SEC.\n\nStocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Coinbase Global (COIN): Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange gained about 3% as the price of Bitcoin shot up above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nFrontline Plc (FRO): Shares of the oil shipper gained 2%, following oil prices higher after Iran sent a warship to the Red Sea, ratcheting up tensions in the key shipping corridor.\n\nLosses: ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML): Shares of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker fell 4% after the Dutch government ordered it to halt some shipments to China.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL): Shares of the tech giant fell 2% after Barclays downgraded the stock to \u201cunderweight,\u201d citing weak demand for the iPhone 15.\n\nBaidu Inc. (BIDU): Shares of the Chinese tech firm fell about 2% after it called off its $3.6 billion acquisition of social media company JOYY\u2019s live-streaming unit, YY Live. JOYY (YY) shares fell nearly 10% in early trading."

(REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBitcoin surged above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid renewed optimism around the possible approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF).\n\nDespite multiple rejections in recent years, there is growing anticipation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve some of the 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs as early as 10 January.\n\nJupiter Zheng, partner of liquid funds at HashKey Capital, told news agency Reuters that the cryptocurrency market is likely to see positive momentum in 2024.\n\nRead more: FTSE wavers and European stocks rise as UK manufacturing slips into red\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The crypto market is set to experience notable growth this year, with key influencing factors being the influx of investment funds from spot ETFs, Bitcoin halving, and a more accommodative monetary policy both in the United States and worldwide,\" he said.\n\nShares in Chinese automaker BYD were trending in after-hours trading after it announced it produced more than 3 million new electric vehicles (EVs) in 2023.\n\nThe figures put the Chinese electric car maker on track to takeover Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) production for a second straight year.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe Shenzhen-based automaker said it sold about 1.6 million battery EVs as well as about 1.4 million plug-in hybrid EVs.\n\nTesla said it produced 1.35 million cars during the first three quarters of 2023.

        "content": "IQVIA Drops as FTC Temporarily Blocks Its Acquisition of Propel Media Shares of IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV), dropped 4% in intraday trading Wednesday after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that its request to temporarily block the health technology company from purchasing Propel Media Inc., a digital advertising firm, was granted. The FTC filed to block the purchase in July 2023, saying that IQVIA, \"the world\u2019s largest health-care data provider,\" acquiring Propel Media \"would give IQVIA a market-leading position in programmatic advertising for health-care products, namely prescription drugs, to doctors and other health-care professionals.\" The agency, which monitors marketplace competition, said that the merger \"would harm competition, raise prices for consumers, and hurt patients. An administrative trial is scheduled to start on Jan. 18. -Naomi Buchanan\n\nCan the Magnificent Seven Keep It Up in 2024? Last year was a big one for stocks\u2014at least, for big stocks. The Magnificent Seven\u2014the S&P 500\u2019s seven largest companies\u2014posted an average total return of 104% last year and accounted for more than 62% of the S&P 500\u2019s 26% gain. The rest of the index didn\u2019t fare quite so well. According to Bank of America, just 27% of S&P 500 stocks outperformed the index in 2023, making it the calendar year with the narrowest breadth in the firm\u2019s data going back to 1987. The equal-weight S&P 500 was in the red through October before a 17% rally in the last two months of the year pulled it into positive territory. The consensus on Wall Street, according to BofA, is that small-caps will continue to rally, gaining ground on the stocks that ran away with 2023. \u201cCrowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024,\u201d wrote BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian in a note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven, she added, \u201ccould be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks.\u201d That said, not everyone agrees with that assessment. Some, like analysts at UBS, expect the largest tech companies, which have \"the significant resources needed to build and benefit from complex AI models,\" to continue to thrive in 2024. The first two trading days of the year appear a vindication of the bears. The Magnificent Seven are down an average of 2.3% as of Wednesday afternoon, while the equal weight S&P 500 has lost about 1%.\n\nA Chart to Watch Wednesday: XLV ETF The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) gained nearly 2% Tuesday after COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) gave the group a boost by projecting sales growth in 2025 and receiving an upgrade from independent investment bank Oppenheimer. CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel told investors the company could launch a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate this year and a two-in-one flu/COVID vaccine in 2025, positioning the drugmaker for future growth. Meanwhile, analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to \u201coutperform,\u201d saying that the company could have five products on the market by 2026. Upbeat news from Moderna helped lift sentiment among other leading drug manufacturers, such as Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), which each carry weightings of over 5% in the ETF\u2019s portfolio of 66 holdings. Source: TradingView.com. The fund\u2019s price cleared the top of a yearlong trading range Tuesday on the highest share turnover since mid-November. Given that the price has rallied sharply from the range\u2019s lower trendline over the past two months, it may need to retest the initial breakout point before potentially attempting another leg higher. It\u2019s also worth keeping an eye on the $142 level\u2014an area on the chart that may run into resistance from a horizontal line connecting several prominent swing highs over the last two years.

Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) also sank after a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said that lower interest rates could hurt Schwab's profits. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares slumped ahead of its financial report tomorrow, as analysts expect a drop in earnings because of a big decline in COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and other energy providers gained as oil prices spiked after a disruption in production at a key oilfield in Libya. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares advanced as the U.S. Air Force awarded it a $9.2 million contract to improve the range of air-to-air missiles. Shares of AutoZone (AZO) rose with Phil Daniele officially taking over as CEO from longtime company head Bill Rhodes. -Bill McColl\n\nOil Jumps as Fear of Regional Middle East Conflict Builds Oil futures surged Wednesday morning as fighting in the Red Sea and a deadly attack at the gravesite of an Iranian military commander fanned fears of a larger conflict engulfing the oil-rich region. More than 100 people were reported dead Wednesday after two bombs detonated near the grave of Qassem Soleimani in the city of Kerman on the fourth anniversary of his killing by a U.S. drone strike. The bombing comes a day after Hamas accused Israel of ordering an air strike that killed a senior official in Lebanon. This week\u2019s violence has fanned fears that fighting between Israel and Hamas will spill over into neighboring countries like Lebanon and draw in Iran, which supports Hamas and allies like Hezbollah. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have for weeks been targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, leading many oil tankers and shipping companies to redirect traffic around Africa. In response, the U.S. and Iran have both sent naval vessels to the waterway. West Texas Intermediate futures jumped more than 3% Wednesday, rising from below $70 a barrel to nearly $73 by midday. Brent crude, the European benchmark, rose from $75 to about $78 a barrel.\n\nFord Falls After Recalling Over 112,000 F-150 Pickups For Roll Away Risk Ford (F) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday morning after the automaker recalled 112,965 F-150 pickups due to roll away risks. The automaker said that the recall, which potentially affects 112,965 pickup trucks, concerns a rear axle hub bolt that \"may fatigue and break\" which could \"result in damage to the axle hub splines.\" The company reported that a \"remedy is currently under development\" and that \"owners will be instructed to take their vehicle to a dealer for an interim repair if they experience symptoms related to rear axle bolt breakage, such as a clicking or rattling noise.\" -Naomi Buchanan\n\nWalt Disney Reaches Agreement with ValueAct in Bid to Fend off Peltz Shares of Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose early Wednesday after the company said it was teaming up with hedge fund ValueAct to fend off a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz. The companies said in a joint statement Wednesday that they had reached an agreement allowing Disney to share otherwise confidential information with ValueAct and consult the investment firm on strategic decisions. As part of the pact, ValueAct has agreed to support Disney\u2019s slate of nominees to its Board of Directors. \u201cValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its Co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we\u2019ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders,\u201d said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. Disney is facing a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz, who through his firm Trian Fund Management nominated himself and former Disney CFO James Result to the company\u2019s board in December. It is Peltz\u2019s second proxy battle with Disney in two years. He attempted to join the board in 2022 before dropping his bid after the company announced sweeping cost-cutting measures.\n\nStocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG): Shares of the storage company rose about 6% after S&P Global said it would join the S&P 400 MidCap Index effective Jan. 5, replacing Patterson Companies Inc. (PDCO).\n\nNovartis AG (NVS): Shares of the pharmaceutical company rose 2% a day after it announced a gene therapy deal with biotech Voyager Therapeutics that will see it pay $100 million upfront, plus an additional $1.1 billion if certain regulatory and sales milestones are met.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Shares rose nearly 2% after KeyBanc upgraded the telecom provider to \u201coverweight,\u201d citing its relative strength compared to AT&T, one of its only real competitors.\n\nLosses: Coinbase Global (COIN): Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange fell more than 6%, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses, as the price of Bitcoin tumbled ahead of the SEC\u2019s decision, expected this week, on a spot ETF.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL): Shares of the cruise operator fell nearly 2% as investors continued to sell off 2023\u2019s biggest winners; Carnival was the third-best performing stock in the S&P 500 last year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA): The chipmaker\u2019s shares fell about 1%, extending yesterday\u2019s losses alongside other chip stocks Arm Plc (ARM), down 2% premarket, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), down more than 1%."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was hit with a deep correction on Wednesday as a report suggesting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could reject multiple spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications made the rounds, sparking the latest round of FUD and instigating a widespread sell-off.\n\nMany analysts have said the reaction was overblown, especially because the SEC reportedly held meetings on Wednesday with the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE exchanges to finalize comments on the 19b-4 forms submitted by the prospective BTC Spot ETF issuers.\n\n\u201cThings you prob don't do if you going to deny or delay,\u201d said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in response to reports of the meeting and the circulating rumor that the applications would be denied. \"Hearing similar by the way... when we see updated (final) 19b-4s roll in that is a sign approval is imminent as SEC has been doing back and forth with issuers offline to perfect their 19b-4s.\"\n\nStocks also fell under pressure after the latest jobs report in the U.S. showed there were 8.79 million job openings at the end of November, the lowest reading since March 2021, and below the expected 8.82 million openings. This led many to reevaluate their expectations that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates as soon as March, leading to declining asset prices as some traders moved to derisk.\n\nAt the market close, the S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq were in the red, down 0.80%, 0.76%, and 1.18%, respectively.\n\nData provided by TradingView shows that Bitcoin underwent a rapid sell-off over two hours on Wednesday morning, plunging more than 10% from $45,150 to a daily low near $40,635 before dip buyers arrived to halt the sell-off. BTC has since climbed back above support at $42,800 and currently trades at $42,840, a decline of 4.7% on the 24-hour chart.\n\nBTC/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nThe rapid decline of BTC resulted in January Bitcoin futures prices trading \u201csolidly down on a big corrective pullback after hitting a contract high on Tuesday,\u201d according to Kitco senior technical analyst Jim Wyckoff.\n\nBitcoin futures 1-day chart. Source: Kitco\n\n\u201cBulls still have the near-term technical advantage but may be getting tired now and may need to pause for a while,\u201d Wyckoff said. \u201cA price uptrend remains in place on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have the firm overall near-term technical advantage.\u201d\n\nDespite Wednesday\u2019s price plunge, most analysts remain positive about the outlook for Bitcoin and crypto in 2024 and beyond, and think it's only a matter of time before the top crypto hits a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cMy base-case expectation is for new all-time highs, hopefully over $100,000, so hopefully six figures,\u201d said popular macro expert Lyn Alden. \u201cThat range is entirely reasonable.\u201d\n\nBut Alden doesn\u2019t think that would be the top and said a peak price of $100,000 during the current bull cycle would be somewhat of a letdown.\n\n\u201cI think that something like $100,000 plus would be kind of disappointing for a bull market cycle, especially after the prior bull market cycle was on the disappointing end, too,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d kind of hope for $200,000 or more over the next two-plus years.\u201d\n\nInsight into what could push BTC to those prices was provided by John Palmer, the president of Cboe Digital, during an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cSeeing that approval is going to pave the way for pension funds and RIA-based funds to be able to invest in assets in a spot Bitcoin ETF where they may not be able to gain that access today in just a native, spot Bitcoin token,\u201d he said.\n\nPalmer added that institutional players would utilize both a spot BTC ETF and other Bitcoin derivative products in unison to hedge risks associated with Bitcoin investments.\n\nWhile some analysts see the approval of a spot BTC ETF as a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event, long term, most remain bullish.\n\nAccording to the latest report from K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde and head of research Anders Helseth, there is a 75% chance of a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event occurring, as opposed to a 20% chance of the ETFs receiving approval and generating substantial inflows that could mitigate selling pressure. They also gave a small bit of credence to Wednesday\u2019s denial rumors, saying they see a 5% chance that the ETFs might be rejected.\n\nDouble-digit gainers in a sea of red\n\nAll but two dozen tokens in the top 200 recorded losses on Wednesday, but as usual, several tokens managed to buck the trend to post double-digit gains.\n\nDaily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360\n\nPowerledger (POWR) was the biggest gainer, increasing 39.25% to trade at $0.51, while Chromia (CHR) climbed 25.4%, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gained 15.6%. Tellor (TRB) led the losers with a decline of 20.1%, followed by a loss of 18.9% for GMT (GMT), and a loss of 17.4% for Memecoin (MEME).\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rate is 51.2%."

        "content": "For the first time since April 2022, cryptocurrency Bitcoin crossed the $45,000 mark on Tuesday, touching its 21 month high. Bitcoin, which is the world's largest cryptocurrency, recorded a hike of 6 percent on Tuesday, January 6. Bitcoin continues to rally forward amid the $45,000 mark break (Reuters)(REUTERS)\n\nBitcoin was up by a total of 6.43% on Tuesday, touching its all time high since 2022 at $45,317.67. A day after breaching the historic mark, Bitcoin continues to go strong, up by a little less than one percent on Wednesday.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nOn January 3, the Bitcoin rates were recorded at $45,257.70, not close to dipping below its 21-month high. The rates were 0.70 percent higher than the closing price of the cryptocurrency. This also led to an overall surge in the cryptocurrency market in the first few days of January.\n\nWith the Bitcoin prices surging above $45,000 for the first time in months, the rates of the cryptocurrency in India were recorded at \u20b937,66,766.47 on Wednesday, up by \u20b922,454 after the sudden price surge.\n\nOther tokens in the crypto market traded higher on January 2-3 due to Bitcoin, with Ethereum surging by 3.8%, Solana (SOL) gaining over 7% while Cardano up over 5%. It is expected that the surge in cryptocurrency will continue during the week.\n\nReason behind Bitcoin price surge\n\nThe prime reason behind the hike in the prices of Bitcoin is the expectation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the launch of a spot bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nThe decision of the SEC will be finalised by January 10, when it will either approve or reject the Ark/21Shares ETF, reported Reuters. However, the decision regarding the same can come this week, by Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected multiple applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in recent years, arguing that the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nAs per past trends, Bitcoin often rallied forward during the US Election season, which means that the crypto markets will continue to buzz for the next few months. However, the rise and fall of crypto in the United States will primarily be determined by the decision of the SEC.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)"

        "content": "There are two main events that can drive the Bitcoin prices up: BTC's fourth halving event, and the US Security Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision for spot BTC ETFs in the US\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nIf 2022 was the year that almost wrote off cryptos, 2023 saw them bouncing back. This is despite a churn of technological innovation, market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and fall of titans (Both Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, and Changpeng Zhao, CZ of Binance, pleaded guilty of violating money laundering rules). The most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin saw a whopping 154% surge in 2023. From around $17,000 at the start of the year, BTC went up to $44,000. Of this, however, much of the gains came later in the year. The overall crypto market cap also swelled to $1.62 trillion from $831.8 billion at the beginning of the year.\n\nSays Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch, \"BTC has recorded a substantial price surge and has been breaking past crucial resis- tance levels with healthy volume. Various narratives have influenced this price action, with investor sentiment undeniably strengthening.\" According to Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay, this growth can broadly be attributed to increasing interest in the crypto market by both retail and institutional investors. \"Global macroeconomic factors have also contributed to this growth with countries coming together to decide the future roadmap of crypto assets through regulatory frameworks,\" says Pagidipati.\n\nBITCOIN IN 2024\n\nSo what does 2024 look like for Bitcoin? The cryptocurrency started the year with a bang. On January 2, 2024, the Bitcoin crossed past $45,000. The big question is: Will it soar even higher during the year? There are two main events that can drive the Bitcoin prices up in 2024: BTC's fourth halving event, and the US Security Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision for spot BTC ETFs in the US.\n\nTHE HALVING EVENT\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event occurs every four years and reduces the supply of Bitcoins by half which means there are less Bitcoins to buy in the market after that. The most direct way the Bitcoin halving impacts price comes down to simple supply and demand. If there are fewer Bitcoins being made available, the price ought to rise, assuming demand remains constant or increases. In addition, miners only have half as much Bitcoin available to sell to cover their operational expenses, reducing overall selling pressure in the market.\n\nPAST HALVING EVENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE BTC PRICE\n\nThe first halving occurred on November 28, 2012, and reduced the block reward to 25 BTC from 50 BTC. Price at the time of halving was $13. However, the following year it reached a peak of $1,152. Prior to the first halving, Bitcoin was unknown to almost everyone but when the price in dollars ballooned from double digits to over $1,000, Bitcoin started making some headlines. The second halving occurred on July 16, 2016, and reduced the block reward to 12.5 BTC. Price at time of halving was $664.However, the following year it peaked to $17,760. The third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, and reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC. At that time the price of Bitcoin stood at $9,734. Following year it touched a peak of $67,549. The third halving was different in the sense that it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, when most of the global economy had been shut down. Despite this, the price pattern for BTC/USD mostly held true to previous cycles. The next halving event will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBITCOIN ETFS\n\nAnother major driver that can lead price of Bitcoin further is Bitcoin ETFs. Asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are among the 13 companies that have submitted applications to the US SEC for it. Such a fund is expected to pull in as much as $3 billion from investors in the first few days of trading and billions more thereafter. \"The chatter surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF in 2024 excites me. If approved, it could unlock a flood of institutional capital, potentially trillions of dollars, propelling the market to new heights. This potential influx is what makes me bullish on the entire crypto space, and I see current price movements as early signs of this shift,\" says Minal Thukral, EVP(Growth & Strategy), CoinDCX.\n\nSOARING TO $100000 IN 2024?\n\nWhile analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have projected that Bitcoin's value could soar to $100,000 by the end of 2024, the views of industry insiders differ. Says Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, \"Crypto market may suffer a supply shock after Bitcoin halving and the price of Bitcoin may surge to $50,000-$55,000 after the event and may touch $65000 by the end of 2024 without factoring the impact of Bitcoin halving.\" Adds Thukral, \"Predicting Bitcoin's 2024 price is intri- cate, even with the forth- coming halving. While the event likely contributes to the current price, its full impact remains uncertain. His- torical associations between halvings and price surges exist, but market complexities make precise predictions challenging. Investors should recognize that the market efficiently absorbs information, potentially factoring in anticipated events.\n\nFactors like market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements could influence outcomes.\"\n\nSays Chaturvedi, \"Past Bitcoin 'halving events' have ushered in a bull run in prices. In-built in the Bitcoin network's algorithm is the halving of miner rewards after every 210,000 blocks, with the next halving scheduled for around April 2024. This 'supply shock' will be met with massive institutional demand if the submission of spot BTC ETF applications gets approved by the SEC. These demand and supply factors, coupled with decreasing interest rates, could send BTC prices higher and the markets already seem to be reacting in anticipation of the same. Says Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, \"Analysts point out that Bitcoin often sees a rally around 60 days before a halving, followed by a \"pre-halving retrace\" around the time of the event. Investors often use this pre-halving retracement as an opportunity to reaccumulate or \"stack Sats.\" However, it's also a period where some investors might exit due to impatience or disappointment from the lack of immediate significant returns post-halving. After the halving and reaccumulation phase, Bitcoin has historically entered a phase of parabolic price increases. For example, months following each of the previous halvings, Bitcoin reached new all-time highs, with the last significant peak being around $69,000 in late 2021, following the May 2020 halving.\"\n\nHowever, experts also point out towards focusing on fundamentals. Says Pagidipati, \"The growing interest in Bitcoin and the increased participation of institutional investors could coincide with the Bitcoin halving event. 2024 is going to be a very important year for crypto and could set the tone for the next market cycle.\"\n\nFATE OF OTHER CRYPTOS\n\nBitcoin is often seen as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Take for instance, Etherium, the second most popular currency. It has already crossed the level of $2200 as of Dec 14, 2023, which is a whopping 80% rise from what it was trading at the beginning of the year. According to experts, Bitcoin's performance can set the tone for the broader market. \"This is followed by an Ethereum rally. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, attention turns to various altcoins in the market. Altcoin season typically involves a surge in the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon can lead to a decline in Bitcoin dominance,\"\u0101dds Menon.\n\n\"For the broader markets, the typical cycle follows a set pattern with capital first heading towards BTC increasing its market capitalization dominance, which has already surpassed 50%. This is followed by the rotation of capital into Ethereum's ETH and finally the peak 'bull-run' gains steam as the capital rotates into 'riskier' alt-coins. We are still in the first phase of the capital rotation cycle and there's a lot of steam for growth in broader crypto prices. It is worth highlighting that several token-specific developments are playing out as well, that will impact individual token prices based on their respective narratives,\" adds Chaturvedi.\n\n\"We have seen in the past that Bitcoin mostly leads the market rally followed by Ethereum and other altcoins. Most of the digital assets have touched year highs which gives us a glimpse of positive 2024 market trends,\" adds Thakral.\n\n\"Historically, surges in prices have served as leading indicators, sparking increased developer activity and funding for new projects. This positive momentum creates a ripple effect, fostering more innovation and growth within the crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, the ongoing technological advancements, such as L2 solutions and zero-knowledge proofs, add another layer of optimism. These developments pave the way for a multitude of new applications, driving real adoption in the coming years,\" says Thukral.\n\nTAKE AN SIP APPROACH\n\nAccording to industry insiders, SIP (Systematic Investment Planning) or DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) are widely recommended strategies for investing in volatile assets like Bitcoin. \"These methods involve investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions, which can mitigate the impact of volatility. A disciplined investment approach, considering a time horizon of 3-5 years, can be sensible. However, it's essential to tailor the strategy to individual risk tolerances and financial goals.\"\n\nAgrees Chaturvedi, \"The best way to mitigate volatility risks is by systematically investing over a longer timeframe, using a SIP-type investment strategy. As per industry experts, a 2-5% allocation of your portfolio into crypto, can help boost risk-adjusted returns over longer duration time frames. So don't put all your eggs in one basket and diversify your allocation.\"\n\nAccording to Pagidipati, focusing on fundamentals is crucial, \"Historically, we did see the price take a bullish turn after the halving event. But one should focus on the fundamentals and understand the underlying economics without getting carried away by the possibility that the price could rise.\" Thukral insist on diversification, \"While Bitcoin is a prominent player, diversifying your portfolio can help manage overall risk exposure. Bitcoin's historical performance suggests that patient investors tend to fare better.\""

Discover SCENE\n\nMichael Saylor, the co-founder of software firm MicroStrategy, is to sell $216 million worth of stock options in the company, with some of the proceeds going towards buying more Bitcoin for his personal stash.\n\nThe sale of his stock options was revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in which Saylor proposed to sell 310,000 stock option awards granted in 2014.\n\nSpeaking on MicroStrategy's fourth-quarter earnings call, Saylor explained that, \"I was granted a stock option in 2014 with respect to 400,000 shares, which is going to expire next April if I don't exercise it by then.\" He added that he plans to exercise and sell 5,000 shares each trading day, starting on January 2nd and ending on April 25th, \"subject to a minimum price condition.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSaylor said that, \"Exercising this option will allow me to address some financial obligations as well as to acquire additional Bitcoin for my personal account.\"\n\nMichael Saylor and Bitcoin\n\nThe MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, having undergone a Damascene conversion since claiming that the cryptocurrency's \"days are numbered\" in 2013. Since then, MicroStrategy has undergone a Bitcoin buying spree, acquiring 189,150 BTC, worth over $8.5 billion at today's prices.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 14,620 BTC for ~$615.7 million at an average price of $42,110 per #bitcoin. As of 12/26/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 189,150 $BTC acquired for ~$5.9 billion at an average price of $31,168 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/PKfYY59sTW \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) December 27, 2023\n\nSaylor has also bought Bitcoin for his personal holdings, revealing in a 2020 tweet that he had acquired 17,732 BTC at an average purchase price of $9,882. Saylor retweeted his 2020 post in October 2021, stating that, \"You do not sell your #bitcoin.\"\n\nAt current prices, Saylor's personal Bitcoin holdings are worth just over $800,000,000. Assuming it's held in one address, Saylor's personal Bitcoin holdings would place him among the top 103 Bitcoin addresses, per BitInfoCharts (with the caveat that Bitcoin can be held across multiple addressess by one individual).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking during the conference call, Saylor said that he remains \"optimistic\" about MicroStrategy's prospects, and will retain a \"very significant\" equity stake in the company. Buoyed by Bitcoin's recent price surge above $45,000, MicroStrategy's stock price rose to $691.74 in pre-market trading. In a December 31 tweet, Saylor celebrated MicroStrategy's 2023 performance, noting that the company had been \"empowered\" by Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin; Joe Raedle/Getty Images; Skye Gould/Insider\n\nBitcoin bull Michael Saylor is dumping $216 million worth of MicroStrategy stock options.\n\nSome of that money will be used to scoop up more bitcoin, Saylor said in an earnings call.\n\nSaylor has been a bitcoin evangelist for years and touted the crypto even during its 2022 rout.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor is dumping some of his stake in his software company in order to scoop up more Bitcoin, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSaylor is selling a total 315,000 of stock options in Microstrategy, 5,000 of which were exercised on Tuesday, the filing said. That amounts to around $216 million worth of stock options based on MicroStrategy's stock price, which traded around $685 by the end of the Tuesday.\n\nIn a recent MicroStrategy earnings call, Saylor said he needed to exercise those stock options before they expired in April this year. He planned on selling around 5,000 shares each trading day of the year through April 25, he added.\n\n\"Exercising this option will allow me to address some financial obligations as well as to acquire additional Bitcoin for my personal account,\" Saylor said on the call.\n\nThose sales come amid a prosperous time for bitcoin, which soared 153% last year as investors dialed up their expectations for hefty interest rate cuts from the Fed. Central bankers raised interest rates aggressively to control inflation in 2022, leading to bitcoin's price to plunge by two-thirds \u2013 marking its worst-ever year.\n\nSaylor, though, has been a die-hard bull on the crypto coin, touting it to his followers even amid the crypto rout in 2022. Previously, he said MicroStrategy's plan was to acquire as much bitcoin as possible, as the \"next logical step\" would be for the cryptocurrency to rise tenfold in value.\n\nThat proved to be a good bet for MicroStrategy, which scooped up $593 million worth of bitcoin in November. That, combined with a year-end rally in crypto, brought MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings to over $8 billion last year, SEC filings show.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "The crypto-focused financial services platform, Matrixport has shaken the crypto community with a bold forecast recently on Bitcoin price and SEC\u2019s stance on spot Bitcoin ETF decisions. According to their recent report, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is anticipated to reject all spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, potentially triggering a sharp decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value to as much as $36,000.\n\nMeanwhile, this revelation has sent shockwaves through the market, prompting Matrixport to advise investors to consider protective measures, such as purchasing put options or even engaging in direct shorting of Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMatrixport Predicts SEC\u2019s Potential Rejection of Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications\n\nMatrixport\u2019s report challenges the optimistic expectations surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s future, citing the SEC\u2019s likely rejection of spot ETFs as a pivotal factor. Despite the crypto platform\u2019s earlier bullish stance, they now express skepticism about the SEC\u2019s willingness to embrace cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the report highlights the dominant influence of Democratic leadership within the SEC, particularly Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s cautious approach to crypto regulation. In addition, Matrixport suggests a potential delay in ETF approvals until Q2 2024, dampening hopes of an imminent market boost.\n\nThe firm contends that the current influx of funds into crypto, driven by expectations of spot Bitcoin ETF approval, could result in significant liquidations if the SEC denies the proposals. Besides, an estimated $10 billion of the $14 billion additional investments might be linked to optimistic ETF prospects, the report showed. Notably, the report foresees a rapid 20% decline in Bitcoin price, reverting to a range of around $36,000-$38,000, should the SEC reject the ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: Internet Computer Protocol Grabs Limelight With 222% ICP Price Rally\n\nAdvise For Traders\n\nWith an ominous January 5, 2024 deadline looming, Matrixport urges traders to hedge their long exposure by considering protective measures. Notably, the recommendation includes purchasing $40,000 strike put options expiring at the end of January or even opting for outright short positions through options.\n\nDespite the potential SEC setback, Matrixport maintains a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin, expecting the BTC price to end 2024 above the $42,000 mark, at which it started the year. The analysis also highlights the historical trends in US election years and Bitcoin mining cycles for the potential rally.\n\nMeanwhile, as of writing, the Bitcoin price was down 5% from yesterday and traded at $42,470. Over the last 24 hours, it has touched a high of $45,503 and a low of $41,804.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Dismisses Fraud Allegations Report"
