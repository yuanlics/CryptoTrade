        "title": "This Bitcoin-themed bar in Mexico City is a hub for the crypto community. - Slate",
        "content": "It\u2019s 7 p.m. on a Thursday, and I\u2019m drinking a beer next to a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOn the wall in front of me is an illustration of a masked Satoshi Nakamoto: \u201cDon\u2019t Delay\u2014Be Your Own Bank,\u201d it announces. It\u2019s one of several portraits of Satoshi, including one that features him taking off from a dollar bill as if he were a superhero. (The portraits are particularly creative, since no one knows who Satoshi\u2014a pseudonym\u2014really is.) A TV is mounted above the bar, displaying the current values of hundreds of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin occupies the biggest space on the screen, followed by Ethereum and Binance Coin, and then other coins, many with squares so tiny that they\u2019re imperceptible. The numbers on the screen fluctuate steadily: A Bitcoin is worth $21,163.64, then $21,112.75, then $21,101.05. Behind me is a case full of Bitcoin memorabilia for sale: mugs, T-shirts, rings.\n\nThis is Bitcoin Embassy Bar, a hip two-story establishment in Mexico City\u2019s Roma Norte neighborhood. It\u2019s a place where you can use Bitcoin to pay for a hot doge (Doge Coind, Multidoge, or Dogechain, depending on your liking), or exchange pesos to reload your Bitcoin wallet. It also hopes to be a gathering place for the Bitcoin community in Latin America. As it does so, it weaves a sort of tension: creating a physical gathering space for a community that is, in its DNA, digital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatin America is arguably the most important testing ground for building physical infrastructure and community around digital currencies\u2014from El Salvador to Puerto Rico to Guatemala. Depending on how you feel about crypto, this is either incredibly exciting or incredibly problematic. According to a report by Americas Society/Council of the Americas, the use of cryptocurrencies in Latin America rose 1,370 percent between 2019 and 2021. Mainstream adoption is still quite far away, but crypto proponents make big promises in the region: that a new, decentralized financial system could promote financial inclusion, combat corruption, and serve as a counterweight to hyperinflation. Still, those promises are hard to deliver on\u2014and, as in the case of El Salvador, those who pay the real price of failure are rarely the people with red lasers shooting out of their eyes on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorena Ortiz, the cofounder and owner of Bitcoin Embassy Bar, first started investing in Bitcoin in 2017. She needed quick money for a trip to Japan\u2014her friend was producing a tour and invited her to go along. \u201cIt made total sense to me to have a tool that could help people break free of the failed system we live with,\u201d Ortiz, 33, said. Bitcoin was punk, and so was she. Around November, she started with a small investment of about $25 USD. In December, Bitcoin hit an all-time high. But Ortiz decided to forgo the trip to dedicate herself to her newfound crypto passion.*\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Ortiz started talking with the bar\u2019s cofounder, David Noriega, about the need for a physical gathering space for Bitcoiners in Mexico City. Noriega brought the technical Bitcoin experience, and Ortiz knew how to run a restaurant. The bar opened its doors in December of that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Ortiz told me, the business has grown mostly through word-of-mouth. There are ups and downs: During bull markets, she said, the yet unconverted often wander in with questions about Bitcoin. During bear markets, most of Ortiz\u2019s customers are more dedicated Bitcoiners, who attend frequent meet-ups and share tips. Shortly after our interview, the bar\u2019s second floor welcomed 20 or so Bitcoiners for one such meet-up about myths in Bitcoin, led by a Colombian crypto influencer. During meet-ups, up to 50 percent of customers pay the tab in Bitcoin, Ortiz said, but that drops down to 10 or 20 percent when there isn\u2019t an event. Plastered around the bar are print-outs with tips to avoid crypto scams\u2014and this, Ortiz tells me, is one of her core goals: to create a space where people can learn and ask questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Embassy Bar isn\u2019t the first business of its kind: There\u2019s a coffee shop in Prague, a bar in Manhattan, and a burger joint in L.A. that follow similar models. This makes sense, because for its core believers, Bitcoin is \u201cnot an investment but an ideology,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth remembering that the community that\u2019s formed around said ideology includes many documented cases of misogyny, racism, harassment, extremism, antisemitism, conspiracy, and outright scams. The crypto community is often hostile to outsiders or critics, and online crypto discourse is known for its toxicity\u2014it\u2019s hard to imagine \u201ccrypto bro\u201d culture is a culture worth replicating. But while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the more pernicious elements of this ecosystem, it\u2019s also not necessarily fair to use the loudest, most problematic voices to generalize about such a large group of people. A recent Pew survey found that 16 percent of U.S. adults have invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. And among this community, gathering spaces and meet-ups are foundational. \u201cAll revolutions, all social movements, all of these kinds of systemic disruptions wouldn\u2019t have been possible if a small minority hadn\u2019t started to grow, grow, grow through community,\u201d Ortiz told me. In Latin America, she continued, \u201cwe have a deeply rooted tradition of making community \u2026 in person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexico\u2019s crypto ecosystem has grown since the bar opened\u2014four years in Bitcoin is equivalent to 20 normal years, Ortiz says. In May 2021, Mexico-based Bitso, a cryptocurrency exchange, became Latin America\u2019s first cryptocurrency unicorn, and in December of that year, the department store Elektra announced it would accept Bitcoin for online sales. Billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the (very!) controversial chairman of Grupo Elektra, is probably the country\u2019s most influential Bitcoin proponent\u2014in June 2021, he announced that Banco Azteca, which he also leads, would endeavor to become the first Mexican bank to accept Bitcoin. (Mexican regulators quickly shot this suggestion down.) In 2022, Salinas Pliego announced that 60 percent of his liquid portfolio was in Bitcoin or Bitcoin equities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalinas Pliego was a topic of conversation at the first meet-up I attended at Bitcoin Embassy Bar, which featured a lawyer, a consultant, and an economics professor debating whether Bitcoin could\u2014and should\u2014be regulated. Salinas Pliego has a longstanding relationship with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and an attendee wanted to know whether he might be able to convert the president into a Bitcoiner. (The consensus: no.)\n\nThat night\u2019s conversation lasted about an hour and a half, during which the attendees collectively rolled their eyes at Sam Bankman-Fried for dirtying crypto\u2019s reputation and used their iPhones to flip between Instagram, Twitter, and Bitcoin wallets. A Brit who recently moved to Mexico tried to get me to open a Bitcoin wallet right then and there (I don\u2019t own crypto), and a Mexican who worked at a crypto start-up asked what I, as a newcomer, thought were the biggest advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin. Someone at the table next to me, I noticed, had a Sharpie rendering of the Bitcoin logo drawn on their thumbnail. The wall in front of us held a neon sign that read Eat Sleep Crypto Repeat and a large chalkboard with an illustration of an alien ship, complete with the caption We\u2019re going to the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the moon, it turns out, is still pretty far away. As I reported this story, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about a tweet Ortiz posted in early January: One of the city pipes connected to the restaurant was broken, and the restaurant, as a result, was having problems with leaking wastewater. They hadn\u2019t been able to get local authorities to do anything for the past month, and were hoping their followers could help up the pressure on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis struck me as the perfect representation of what it\u2019s like to run a Bitcoin bar: You can spend all the time you want talking about a decentralized, digital, financially autonomous future. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re still stuck with clunky government bureaucracy and sewer water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Ortiz about this, she laughed. It\u2019s a familiar sensation: Every time she goes to the bank, has to knock on the door of government officials, or juggles headaches like the drainage issue, \u201cIt\u2019s like coming back to Earth: \u2018Hey, Lore, don\u2019t fly away. This is your reality,\u2019 \u201d she told me. She treats it as a lesson. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, you have to know where you\u2019re standing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some stories from the recent past of Future Tense.\n\nFuture Tense Fiction\n\nJanuary\u2019s story was \u201cBigfeet\u201d by Future Tense editor Torie Bosch. Written as if it were a New Yorker-esque article, Bosch\u2019s brilliant fiction debut chronicles a billionaire\u2019s revenge-driven quest to \u201cde-extinct\u201d a bigfoot-like creature. The story is largely told from the perspective of Dr. Shelley, one of the researchers who, sequestered on a distant island, helped combine ape, cow, and bear DNA to create Bigfeet: docile, bipedal creatures that look like \u201ca bizarro A.I. rendering of the traditional Bigfoot,\u201d complete with purple tongues. In a response essay, conservation researcher Challie Facemire discusses the unforeseen consequences of introducing species where they don\u2019t belong.\n\nWish We\u2019d Published This\n\n\u201cWhy My Bittersweet Relationship With Shein Had to End,\u201d by Zeyi Yang, MIT Technology Review\n\nFuture Tense Recommends\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving found myself in a bit of a streaming rut last month, I finally heeded the recommendations to watch Bad Sisters on Apple TV+. The 10-episode first season premiered in August, and the show was recently renewed for a second season. It follows the five Garvey sisters\u2014Eva, Becka, Bibi, Ursula, and Grace\u2014and begins by showing the body of John Paul, Grace\u2019s husband, in a coffin. We quickly learn that Eva, Becka, Bibi, and Ursula were trying to kill John Paul, who is presented as controlling, manipulative, and emotionally abusive (for starters \u2026 he eventually gets much worse). The show weaves past and present story lines\u2014the events leading up to John Paul\u2019s death, and the fallout from the same\u2014and guides us through stunning Irish landscapes, which, along with the show\u2019s dark-but-smart humor, serve a sort of numbing function for the heavy topics embedded in the plot. Reviewers have pointed out that the show simplifies many of these topics and flattens naturally complex characters, and I think that\u2019s true\u2014we walk away with little understanding of John Paul as anything other than a caricature of misogyny, for example. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s just really entertaining television.\n\nWhat Next: TBD\n\nOn Friday\u2019s episode of Slate\u2019s technology podcast, host Lizzie O\u2019Leary interviewed Tim Requarth, a Slate contributing writer, about how COVID really affects our immune systems. Last week, Lizzie talked to the Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus about what the rise of A.I. tools like ChatGPT mean for consumers. She also chatted with Bloomberg\u2019s Leah Nylen about why the Department of Justice thinks Google\u2019s ad-tech business needs breaking up, and whether that\u2019s actually likely to happen. And on Sunday, Lizzie will be joined by Ron Lieber of the New York Times to discuss why JPMorgan says it was conned by a young founder who promised to help students get financial aid\u2014and what made her story so magnetic in the first place.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 7, 2023: This piece originally misstated that Lorena Ortiz went on a trip to Japan after Bitcoin hit an all-time high. She decided to forgo the trip to focus on Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society."

        "title": "Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over the last 14 years, investors have been attracted to Bitcoin (BTC) for many reasons \u2014 from being a potential solution to the economic woes of the existing fiat economic system to reaching the unbanked and diversifying portfolios. However, a large portion of the general public sees Bitcoin as a gateway to financial freedom amid growing fiat inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nTraditional banking systems have, time and again, served as a tool for centralized governments to dictate financial access, especially during emergencies. Most recently, the Ukraine-Russian war served as a case study for how cryptocurrencies helped the displaced and the unbanked access funds for basic necessities.\n\nAs intended by the creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin seeks to bring power back to the people. No amount of regulations, sanctions or bans can stop people from using Bitcoin as money. Beyond that, a calculated investment in Bitcoin has the potential to bring people closer to attaining their dream of financial freedom. But how can people achieve that?\n\nHodl\n\nThe massive volatility of cryptocurrencies coupled with the restlessness of an investor is a recipe for an instant loss. Many fail to understand that Bitcoin \u2014 unlike other cryptocurrencies \u2014 is a long-term investment. Hence, Bitcoin veterans recommend holding the asset during bull markets and buying the dips during bear markets.\n\nAccording to data from UpMyInterest, setting aside a few off-years, Bitcoin holders witnessed a mean annual return of 93.8%, which in its best-performing year, spiked to 302.8%.\n\nHistorical summary of Bitcoin annual returns. Source: UpMyInterest\n\nAs simple as it sounds, hodling (crypto lingo for holding assets) has proved difficult for investors. Some factors that trigger abrupt Bitcoin selling include the spreading of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and price movements.\n\nWhile it makes sense in the short-term to earn profits off Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, zooming out the price chart reveals a long-term greater incentive in holding. Moreover, investors owning Bitcoin will always have the option to utilize this spending across geographical boundaries without losing value.\n\nDollar-cost averaging\n\nConsidering Bitcoin as a viable long-term investment option, many investors tend to implement the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. This involves setting aside a predetermined dollar amount from a regular income to be reinvested in Bitcoin every day, week or month.\n\nWhile El Salvador was initially criticized for adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender amid crippling inflation, the country could repurpose the resultant unrealized gains to fund social projects, such as building hospitals and schools.\n\nWith the Bitcoin bull run running out by 2022, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele followed a strategy similar to DCA, wherein the country would purchase 1 BTC every day.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nWhen Bukele announced his plan for buying Bitcoin, it was priced roughly at $16,600, as shown by data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBitcoin price movement ever since Nayib Bukele announced plans to purchase 1 BTC every day. Source: TradingView\n\nSince then, BTC\u2019s price has surged 40.46%, providing much-needed relief to Salvadorans. Investors looking for financial freedom must pursue a similar strategy while reacting to market changes and public sentiment.\n\nSelf-custody\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term holding of Bitcoin, the key is not to trust any other third-party entity with the assets' private keys. Investors who store Bitcoin on crypto exchanges unknowingly give away complete control of their assets.\n\nEver since the FTX fraud came to light, the case of self-custody grew stronger. Investors that suffered losses owing to the alleged misappropriation of funds realized the importance of self-custody. Maintaining ownership of the private key \u2014 via self-custodial wallets \u2014 becomes paramount for those that seek financial freedom in its truest sense.\n\nWill be sending an email every week strongly advising our people to never keep savings on any exchange, including @paxful This is the way ! Self custody your savings ALWAYS! pic.twitter.com/DI95Gaa5Y6 \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) December 11, 2022\n\nThe FTX fallout also forced crypto exchanges to prove the existence and safety of users\u2019 funds in order to avoid a low liquidity situation.\n\nBinance Releases Proof of Reserves System | Binance Support https://t.co/pdA2OdvAKG \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) November 25, 2022\n\nAlthough hardware alternatives for crypto self-custody require an upfront investment, it is up to the users to choose an ideal method of storing the private keys, even if it means writing the private keys on a piece of paper.\n\nThe three practices mentioned above \u2014 hodl, DCA and self-custody \u2014 form the main pillars of financial freedom. However, users are not limited from trying other strategies that suit their needs.\n\nAchieving financial freedom with Bitcoin is possible. Given the nascency of the crypto ecosystem, investors are advised to focus on the long-term benefits of Bitcoin while reaping short-term gains in the process."

        "title": "Here's Why Nicholas Taleb Called Bitcoin a 'Malignant Tumor' - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Black Swan author Nassim Nicholas Taleb lashed out at Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent interview. The well-known risk analyst compared the leading cryptocurrency to \"malignant tumors\" and said it\u2019s a \"magnet for idiots.\"\n\nCredited with predicting the 2007/2008 financial crisis, Taleb, who writes about probability and risk, was once a fan of Bitcoin. He thought it could offer an alternative to centralized monetary policy at a time when he didn't agree with the Fed's decisions. But as time went on, he lost faith, as he explained in a recent interview with L'Express in France.\n\nHere are some of the reasons he now compares Bitcoin to cancer.\n\n1. It doesn't work as a currency\n\nTaleb says that Bitcoin hasn't managed to become a \"currency without government,\" in spite of the hype. He points out that it doesn't work as a store of value or guard against inflation -- two common selling points we hear from Bitcoin advocates. \"Worse than anything,\" he says, \"It does not remotely constitute a shield against government tyranny or a vehicle to protect against catastrophic episodes.\"\n\nThere are a lot of arguments around whether Bitcoin works as a currency. On the one hand, it's extremely volatile. If you're using Bitcoin to pay salaries or pay your rent, it becomes problematic if it gains or loses 50% of its value in a short space of time. It's also relatively slow in processing transactions and transaction fees can be expensive.\n\nOn the other, Bitcoin fans believe it could become the currency of the internet, or function as a form of digital gold, and say there are tech solutions that will reduce transaction times and costs. It's also been adopted by countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic as legal tender (though there are questions about how successful those moves actually were.)\n\n2. It's part of a Disneyland-eque asset bubble\n\nTaleb believes the low interest rates we've seen in the past 15 years have distorted the way we see investments. \"Lowering rates creates asset bubbles without necessarily helping the economy,\" he argues. According to Taleb, Bitcoin has flourished in a speculative environment where people have lost any sense of what long-term investments really are. He goes further, claiming that young Bitcoiners do not understand finance. He says some young people who bought Bitcoin early \"got temporarily rich without knowing anything except computer programming.\"\n\n3. It attracts scammers\n\nThe idea that crypto is a hotbed for fraudulent activity is nothing new. Even Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said last year that the industry was suffering a black eye because of the numbers of fraudsters involved. Taleb says, \"I think the crypto universe attracts manipulators and scammers.\"\n\nBitcoin fans would argue it's not fair to slam the entire crypto industry just because Bitcoin has been used by bad actors -- in the same way that you can't you couldn't criticize the U.S. dollar because some criminals use it. Scammers have used crypto just as they would use any new technology where there are high expectations and a relatively low knowledge base. That said, the lack of regulation in terms of the functioning of individual cryptocurrencies and trading on crypto exchanges has opened the door to a disproportionate number of bad actors.\n\nIs he right?\n\nMany crypto investors have seen the value of their portfolios drop significantly in the past year, particularly those who bought for the first time during the frenzy of 2020/2021. It isn't surprising that some people regret their crypto purchases and wonder if Bitcoin still has long-term potential.\n\nThe difficulty is that nobody knows for sure. Taleb raises important questions about Bitcoin's utility, which is fundamental to its ability to do well in the coming 10 or 20 years. But the idea that it's an asset bubble or that it has attracted scammers doesn't necessarily rule out an eventual recovery.\n\nInvestors like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood still believe Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. Ark cites several industries where it could take a portion of the market -- such as the international remittance market or working as a currency in emerging markets. But it's impossible to guess at the impact of increased regulation. Regulation is just one of several hurdles that crypto needs to cross. For example, right now, crypto isn't that easy to use, which stops it reaching new users.\n\nOne thing is clear. Bitcoin remains a high-risk investment and it is important to listen to critics like Taleb as well as advocates like Wood. If you do decide to buy Bitcoin, make sure it only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. If you only invest money you can afford to lose in high-risk assets like crypto, you won't be knocked off course financially if they eventually fail."

It attracts scammers\n\nThe idea that crypto is a hotbed for fraudulent activity is nothing new. Even Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said last year that the industry was suffering a black eye because of the numbers of fraudsters involved. Taleb says, \"I think the crypto universe attracts manipulators and scammers.\"\n\nBitcoin fans would argue it's not fair to slam the entire crypto industry just because Bitcoin has been used by bad actors -- in the same way that you can't you couldn't criticize the U.S. dollar because some criminals use it. Scammers have used crypto just as they would use any new technology where there are high expectations and a relatively low knowledge base. That said, the lack of regulation in terms of the functioning of individual cryptocurrencies and trading on crypto exchanges has opened the door to a disproportionate number of bad actors.\n\nIs he right?\n\nMany crypto investors have seen the value of their portfolios drop significantly in the past year, particularly those who bought for the first time during the frenzy of 2020/2021. It isn't surprising that some people regret their crypto purchases and wonder if Bitcoin still has long-term potential.\n\nThe difficulty is that nobody knows for sure. Taleb raises important questions about Bitcoin's utility, which is fundamental to its ability to do well in the coming 10 or 20 years. But the idea that it's an asset bubble or that it has attracted scammers doesn't necessarily rule out an eventual recovery.\n\nInvestors like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood still believe Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. Ark cites several industries where it could take a portion of the market -- such as the international remittance market or working as a currency in emerging markets. But it's impossible to guess at the impact of increased regulation. Regulation is just one of several hurdles that crypto needs to cross. For example, right now, crypto isn't that easy to use, which stops it reaching new users.\n\nOne thing is clear. Bitcoin remains a high-risk investment and it is important to listen to critics like Taleb as well as advocates like Wood. If you do decide to buy Bitcoin, make sure it only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. If you only invest money you can afford to lose in high-risk assets like crypto, you won't be knocked off course financially if they eventually fail.\n\nOur picks for the best credit cards\n\nOur experts vetted the most popular offers to land on the select picks that are worthy of a spot in your wallet.

        "content": "A New Jersey man who admitted to paying a hitman $20,000 in cryptocurrency to have a 14-year-old child murdered may face up to 10 years behind bars.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with one count of \u201cknowingly and intentionally using and causing another to use a facility of interstate and foreign commerce, that is the internet, with the intent that a murder be committed,\u201d the Department of Justice said Thursday.\n\nThe Haddonfield man is accused of exchanging sexually explicit photographs and videos with the then-13-year-old victim during the summer of 2015. The victim lived in New York at the time.\n\nAfter the victim\u2019s parents learned of the \u201cinappropriate contact,\u201d they notified law enforcement, who identified Musbach in the case.\n\nIn March 2016, Musbach was arrested on child pornography charges, the DOJ said.\n\nProsecutors allege that Musbach decided to have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case.\n\nMusbach repeatedly contacted the administrator of a murder-for-hire website on the dark web, which purported to offer contact killings or other acts of violence in exchange for cryptocurrency, from May 7, 2016, to May 20, 2016.\n\n\u201cMusbach asked if a 14-year-old was too young to target, and upon hearing that the age was not a problem, paid approximately 40 bitcoin (approximately $20,000 at the time) for the hit,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nHe paid about $20,000 worth of bitcoin while trying to hire a hitman to kill the 14-year-old victim. Getty Images\n\nFollowing his payment, Musbach repeatedly messaged the website\u2019s administrator to inquire about when the murder would occur. The administrator then requested an additional $5,000, which prompted Musbach to try and cancel the hit and get his $20,000 returned.\n\nThe website\u2019s administrator then revealed to Musbach that the operation was a sham, and threatened to turn Musbach over to law enforcement.\n\nMusbach faces a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine \u201cof the greater of $250,000, twice the gross profits to Musbach or twice the gross losses to the victim of his offense.\u201d\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced on June 13."

        "content": "Apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTC/USD remains the most valuable in the world with a market capitalization of $450 billion, more than double that of second place Ethereum. Despite the high valuation, Bitcoin is still down from all-time highs set in November 2021.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what a return to all-time highs could mean for hodlers and investors.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency and one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies in the world. The apex crypto remains a favorite future investment option for notable investors like Cathie Wood.\n\nThe war in Ukraine led to more discussions on countries adopting Bitcoin as a currency, and some analysts have raised their price targets and bull cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nGlobal investment management company VanEck said money has changed due to sanctions on Russia\u2019s central bank, and the result could be traditional reserve currencies taking a backseat to Bitcoin.\n\nWood, who is the CEO of Ark Funds, has called for more companies to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. If all corporations put 1% to 10% of their cash balance into Bitcoin, the valuation of the coin could rise significantly.\n\nIn 2021, Ark Funds highlighted a $500,000 price target for Bitcoin. A bull case for Bitcoin from Ark Funds has the coin hitting $1 million per Bitcoin by 2030.\n\nArk is sticking by that price target according to its latest Big Ideas report.\n\nVanEck analysts Eric Fine and Natalia Gurushina put out a note titled \u201cHow One Bond Manager Values Gold and Bitcoin\u201d in April 2022.\n\nIn the note, the duo laid out a target price of $1.3 million to $4.8 million for Bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is adopted as a global reserve currency.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin\n\nInvesting $100 in Bitcoin: A $100 investment in Bitcoin today could buy 0.00429 BTC, based on a current price of $23,349.88 at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789.63 in November 2021. The coin failed to reach a price of $69,420, a figure that some suggested could break the internet, combining two of the most popular memeable numbers.\n\nIf Bitcoin returns to an all-time high, a $100 investment today would be worth $295.11. This would represent a return of 195.1%.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may never reach the $500,000 or $1 million price targets from Ark Invest, a return to all-time highs could be more likely. Those who have followed cryptocurrency for years know that there are many waves and cycles that happen, and Bitcoin could hit new all-time highs during the next bull run.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Will Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Or Solana Gain More In 2023, 39% Of Benzinga Followers Said This"

        "content": "A hearing to determine the financial penalty and possible sanctions for the company ordered to shut down its unregulated bitcoin mining facility in Sturgeon County has been delayed for over a year due to the company facing a second investigation, and\n\nA hearing to determine the financial penalty and possible sanctions for the company ordered to shut down its unregulated bitcoin mining facility in Sturgeon County has been delayed for over a year due to the company facing a second investigation, and because the company has been unable to file audited financial statements with the provincial utility regulator.\n\nAfter receiving multiple noise complaints from residents of Greystone Manor in Sturgeon County through the fall of 2020, an investigation was opened by the Alberta Utilities Commission's (AUC) enforcement staff into a nearby bitcoin mining facility operated by Vancouver-based Link Global Technologies, which changed its' name to Green Block Mining Corp. in 2022.\n\nThe AUC is an independent agency mandated by the provincial government to regulate Alberta's utilities sector.\n\nNo regulatory approval\n\nIn 2021, AUC investigators found that Green Block hadn't acquired regulatory approval for the Sturgeon County facility, which was powered through a natural gas well owned by MAGA Energy; hadn't notified nearby residents or completed a noise assessment; and hadn't completed an environmental impact assessment prior to operating \u2014 which lead to the AUC ordering the facility, as well as another owned by Green Block in Kirkwall, Alberta, to shut down in August, 2021.\n\nFollowing the cease order, the commission was scheduled to take the next step in their enforcement proceeding process \u2014 hold an oral hearing between Green Block and the AUC to determine exact penalties and sanctions \u2014 in November 2021, but that hearing has been delayed ever since due largely to Green Block being unable to file audited financial statements with the AUC, as well as the AUC completing another investigation into Green Block for a third unregulated facility located in Westlock, Alberta.\n\nIn September 2021, CBC reported that Green Block could face a $7.1-million fine for the Sturgeon County and Kirkwall facilities. However, that fine, called a disgorgement penalty, was based on the estimated economic gain Green Block realized through operating the facilities, which was determinable only through un-audited financial statements the company filed with the AUC in the fall of 2021.\n\nThe commission's enforcement staff took issue with the un-audited financial statements Green Block filed because the company claimed to have no crypto-mining revenue between December 2020 and May 2021.\n\n\"The absence of reported crypto-mining revenues calls into question the completeness of the revenue reported for the six months ended May 31, 2021,\" enforcement staff wrote in a September 2021 proceeding filing.\n\nEnforcement staff suggested the commission should assign little weight to the interim financial statements, nothing that unless Green Block produces audited financial statements, the proposed disgorgement penalty of $7.1 million should be considered by the AUC as reasonable.\n\nIn response, Gavin Fitch, Green Block's legal representative in the proceeding, wrote a letter to the AUC saying that enforcement staff made a \"very serious allegation\" by claiming the company's financial statements were potentially incomplete, although Fitch did not give an explanation as to why the company had no reported mining revenue during the time period, despite the company reporting $854,962 in mining revenue in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nBetween Dec. 2020 and May 31, 2022, Green Block's un-audited financial statements say the company generated about $1.5 million through hosting, which is when a company rents a bitcoin mining facility like the one that operated in Sturgeon County to another company to actually mine bitcoin. In many cases the company that rents a facility pays for the energy used to operate the computers, while the company that owns the facility services and maintains the operation.\n\nThe Westlock facility and hearing delay\n\nPart of the reason why the hearing to determine the penalties for Green Block's operations in the county and Kirkwall has been substantially delayed is because just three weeks after enforcement staff presented their case to the commission, staff had opened a second investigation into Green Block and another facility the company was operating in Westlock, Alberta.\n\nIn an Oct. 29, 2021, letter to the AUC, Fitch requested that the second investigation be included in the original, as it was Green Block's opinion that both investigations were for the same issues, and should be tried in one proceeding.\n\nIn response, the AUC agreed, and the final hearing was delayed indefinitely so as to incorporate the second investigation into the first, and to allow enforcement staff and Green Block to each file written evidence submissions regarding the Westlock facility.\n\nAs part of AUC enforcement proceedings, the commission takes into consideration submissions from the relevant parties before issuing what's called a phase one ruling, which is then used as part of the hearing when fines and sanctions are imposed.\n\nOn May 25, 2022 the AUC released the phase one ruling in the case of Green Block's Westlock facility, which said Green Block contravened the Hydro and Electric Energy Act by operating the facility without regulatory approval, just as the company did with their Sturgeon and Kirkwall facilities.\n\n\"Green Block acknowledged that it did not conduct a noise impact assessment before starting up the Westlock Power Plant, nor did it take steps to determine the environmental effects of the Westlock Power Plant before operating,\" the ruling says adding the company didn\u2019t take any steps to ensure the Westlock Power Plant was in regulatory compliance.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the AUC tentatively scheduled a hearing for Sept. 21-23, 2022, with the provision that Green Block file audited financial statements beforehand so that enforcement staff can recommend an updated disgorgement penalty for the AUC's consideration. Green Block was given a deadline of July 18, 2022 to file the financial statements.\n\nBut Fitch requested an extension to file the audited financial statements, which said the company\u2019s auditors had finished the work but a third party company was now auditing Green Block\u2019s power consumption and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe ACU approved the original extension, and a Fitch went on to request multiple other extensions for filing financial documents to the AUC. An extension in August 2022 was requested as the audit of Green Blocks\u2019 crypto-mining activity was nearly complete, but they had yet to audit former Green Block CEO Stephen Jenkins' cryptocurrency 'wallet'.\n\nPut simply, a cryptocurrency wallet can be thought of as a digital software that stores and protectors the owner's cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Mr. Jenkins is, for the most part, cooperating with this audit but perhaps not surprisingly does not share Green Block\u2019s sense of urgency in relation to the completion of the audit,\" Fitch wrote.\n\nThe AUC said it would reschedule a hearing for the company after the audited financial statements have been submitted.\n\nIn an email to The Gazette on Jan. 16, Fitch said the company was expecting the statements \"shortly.\"\n\n\"Green Block expects to receive its audited financial statements shortly, following which the AUC proceeding will re-activate,\" Fitch said.\n\nIn turn, AUC spokesperson Geoff Scotton told The Gazette an update from Green Block had not been received since Nov. 7 last year.\n\n\"However, according to the commission\u2019s October 6, 2022 ruling ... Green Block is under an ongoing obligation to keep the commission updated about the status of the auditing of the financials,\" Scotton said.\n\nOn Jan. 20, the AUC sent a letter to Green Block requesting an update on the audited financial statements, and implemented a requirement for Green Block to provide an update once a month, regardless of whether or not the situation has changed.\n\nFitch responded to the AUC in a letter dated Jan. 25 saying that Green Block had no updates to provide, and that the auditors had recently told the company they \"need a couple more weeks.\"\n\nThrough the commission's online filing system The Gazette accessed all of the files in the enforcement proceeding, which includes letters and reports sent by the AUC, enforcement staff, and Green Block."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and select altcoins set to resume rally despite February slump - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After the impressive rally in January, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be taking a breather in February. This is a positive sign because vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. A minor dip could shake out the nervous longs and provide an opportunity for long-term investors to add to their positions.\n\nHas Bitcoin price bottomed?\n\nThe opinion remains divided, however, on whether Bitcoin has bottomed out or not. Some analysts expect the rally to reverse direction and nosedive below the November low while others believe the markets will continue to move up and frustrate the traders who are waiting to buy at lower levels.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko said \u201cthe crypto summer\u201d could begin as early as the second quarter of this year.\n\nHe expects risk assets to turn bullish if the United States Federal Reserve signals that it will slow down or pause interest rate hikes. Another potential bullish catalyst for Bitcoin is the block reward halving in 2024.\n\nCould the altcoins continue their up-move while Bitcoin consolidates in the near term? Let\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins that may outperform in the next few days.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin has been gradually correcting since hitting $24,255 on Feb. 2. This indicates profit booking by short-term traders. The price is nearing the strong support zone between $22,800 and $22,292. The 20-day exponential moving average ($22,436) is also located in this zone, hence the buyers are expected to defend the zone with all their might.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will again attempt to catapult the BTC/USDT pair to $25,000. This level should act as a formidable resistance.\n\nOn the downside, a break below the support zone could trigger several stop losses and that may start a deeper pullback. The pair could first drop to $21,480 and if this support also fails to hold up, the next stop may be the 50-day simple moving average ($19,572).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel but the RSI has been forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the channel could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then fall toward $21,480.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will again attempt to kick the pair above the channel. If they manage to do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nETH/USDT\n\nEther (ETH) has been trading near the $1,680 resistance for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near an overhead resistance resolves to the upside.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile the upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,586) indicates advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls may be losing their grip. If bulls want to assert their dominance, they will have to propel and sustain the price above $1,680.\n\nIf they do that, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $1,800. This level may again act as a resistance but if bulls do not allow the price to dip below $1,680, the rally may stretch to $2,000.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could tumble to $1,500. This is an important support level to monitor because a bounce here could keep the pair range-bound between $1,500 and $1,680. On the other hand, if the $1,500 support cracks, the pair may dive to $1,352.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA. This is the first indication that the bulls may take a step back. There is minor support at the 50-SMA but if it fails to hold, the pair may slide to $1,550 and then to $1,500.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will again attempt to thrust the pair above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the pair may resume the uptrend.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are well below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) hit a new high on Feb. 5. This suggests that bulls are in command.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSome traders may book profits near the overhead resistance of $44.35 as it may act as a formidable resistance. If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($37), it will suggest that bulls continue to buy the dips.\n\nThat could increase the possibility of a break above $45. The OKB/USDT pair could first skyrocket to $50 and thereafter to $58.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be rushing to the exit. The pair could then drop to $34 and later to the 50-day SMA ($30).\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to protect the $44.35 level. The pair could turn down and reach the moving averages, which is an important support to keep an eye on. If the price bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at $45 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nContrarily, if the price breaks below the 50-SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may slump to $36 and then to $34. Such a move could delay the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nRelated: Fantom\u2019s 5-week winning streak is in danger \u2014 Will FTM price lose 35%?\n\nALGO/USDT\n\nAlgorand\u2019s (ALGO) recovery reached the breakdown level of $0.27 on Feb. 3. The bears defended this level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls expect the relief rally to continue.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price turns up from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above $0.27 increases. The ALGO/USDT pair could then travel to $0.31 where the bears may try to offer strong resistance.\n\nIf the price turns down from this level but bounces off $0.27, it will suggest that the downtrend could be over in the short term. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.38.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the pair turns down from the current level and slides below $0.23. The pair could then dive to the 50-day SMA ($0.21).\n\nALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the $0.27 level but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to stay below the 50-SMA. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they do that, the pair could pick up momentum and surge toward $0.31.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues and breaks below the moving averages, the pair risks a drop to $0.23. The bears will have to smash this support to gain the upper hand.\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nTheta Network (THETA) successfully completed a retest of the breakout level on Feb. 1, indicating that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $1.20. This level may act as a minor hurdle but if bulls do not give up much ground from $1.20, the THETA/USDT pair could extend its up-move to $1.34. This is an important level for the bears to defend because if this resistance crumbles, the pair could soar to $1.65.\n\nIf bears want to stop the bulls, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then fall to $0.97 and later to the 50-day SMA ($0.89).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off the $0.97 level, which becomes an important level to watch out for on the downside. A breach of this level is likely to tilt the advantage in favor of the bears and open the doors for a possible drop to $0.85.\n\nThe rally is facing resistance near $1.20 but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push the price above $1.20, the momentum should pick up for a rally toward $1.34.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Genesis Upgrade: Bitcoin's rebirth - CoinGeek",
        "content": "February 4 is a special day for Bitcoin, but only those in the Bitcoin SV (BSV) ecosystem fully understand why.\n\nWhile the original Bitcoin protocol was released on January 3, 2009, with the infamous and much-misunderstood Times headline in its Genesis block, those familiar with Bicoin\u2019s history will be all too aware that the original Bitcoin lost its way, or more accurately, was deliberately driven off the rails by a shadowy cabal with an agenda.\n\nWhat was designed as an infinitely scalable peer-to-peer electronic cash system was hijacked by a group of ideologically driven and corrupt developers in the pocket of Silicon Valley VCs and big data monopolies who wanted nothing more than to stop the Bitcoin protocol in its tracks.\n\nPretty soon, BTC became little more than a glorified pyramid scheme, pumped to unimaginable heights by fake United States dollar derivatives such as USDT as a propaganda machine that would have made Joseph Goebbels proud. The masses were convinced they could become rich by \u201cHODLing\u201d BTC, which, from a protocol perspective, was no longer Bitcoin at all.\n\nYet, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, wasn\u2019t going to let the invention he had worked on for decades die so easily. After being outed as Satoshi by Wired and Gizmodo, Australian entrepreneur Dr. Craig Wright gradually started to take back control of Bitcoin. This ultimately led to Bitcoin\u2019s second Genesis on February 4, 2020.\n\nA second chance to build a Bitcoin-powered world\n\nIt\u2019s an old saying that there are no second chances in life, but like all old sayings, there are exceptions. Thankfully, the original Bitcoin is alive and well, and with the Genesis protocol upgrade, its original capabilities were restored. Thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s second Genesis, led by its inventor and the true believers in the original protocol, we have a second chance to build a Bitcoin world.\n\nWith the return to unbounded block sizes determined by free market economics, alongside the reactivation of many of Bitcoin\u2019s original capabilities, including the ability to use so-called smart contracts to create applications on the blockchain, Bitcoiners were given another chance to create the world they originally envisioned before Blockstream, Digital Currency Group, and others seized control.\n\nWhat sort of world is this? A world where true peer-to-peer transactions are possible, where unlimited transactions can be sent and received globally in seconds for fractions of a cent, and in which micropayments power new economies and unlock new business models.\n\nThe bigger picture is that the very internet itself will be transformed as the parasitic middlemen and data extractors are stripped of their power, and the original dream of the internet pioneers comes true. Metanet will see the web powered by micropayments with true data ownership and sovereignty returned to the people, solving many of the problems created by how the internet works today.\n\nUltimately, everything will change in a Bitcoin-powered world. Nothing will be the same, and in a few decades, historians will look back and see just how monumental an event the return to Genesis was.\n\nWhile February 4 may only be celebrated by a relative handful of BSV supporters today, it will be remembered as the second most important day in Bitcoin\u2019s history. 11 years, one month, and one day after the original Genesis block came the restoration of the original creation and the resetting of the foundation upon which the new world will be built.\n\nLet\u2019s take the time to celebrate what has been achieved so far while we dream, build, and create the future!\n\nWatch: A World of Good\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Bitcoin Resurgence Brings Back Old Phenomenon of Wild Weekends - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amid this year\u2019s rally, Bitcoin has resumed one of its old habits: it\u2019s back to posting big moves on weekends, a phenomenon that\u2019s become an intriguing characteristic of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTake last Sunday, when it gained 3.4%, a similar amount to what it notched the Saturday on the weekend prior. And the Saturday before that, the coin advanced 5.5%.\n\nThat Bitcoin posts large moves is nothing new. But the token, like all other cryptocurrencies, trades around the clock, every day of the week, counter to most other assets, which tend to trade Monday through Friday on regulated exchanges. And it\u2019s been seen in crypto markets in the past, with Bitcoin shooting higher \u2014 or posting big down days \u2014 while other assets are taking a rest from work.\n\nThe most compelling theory on the strong weekend moves might be that liquidity is thinner, meaning that price swings on large orders can be more pronounced, says Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter. Liquidity has been thinner for Bitcoin recently, with traders and investors staying on the sidelines and hodlers hodling, she says.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the year, volatility has picked up \u2014 still not at \u2018normal\u2019 levels, but getting there,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cThis should herald the return of the weekend phenomenon, with lower weekend liquidity leading to stronger moves as traders and investors tentatively come back into the market.\u201d\n\nCrypto tokens have skyrocketed at the start of the year as other riskier assets like stocks also rise and as investors look ahead through the remainder of 2023, when they expect the Federal Reserve to dial back in its monetary policy hawkishness. Bitcoin has risen roughly 40%, bringing its losses from its November 2021 all-time high to around 60%. Ether, the second-largest by market value, has rallied a similar amount.\n\nBut, given the troubles that plagued the digital-assets space all of last year \u2014 including the downfall of a number of previously-grand projects like trading platform FTX \u2014 investors have largely shied away amid the turmoil. Trading volumes remain in the gutter: the hundreds of exchanges worldwide \u2014 clocking in at 650, according to CoinGecko \u2014 have recently been seeing 24-hour trading volumes of around $100 billion, compared with more than $200 billion in November 2021. Thinner volumes can, therefore, exacerbate any weekend price moves.\n\nStill, no one knows for certain why crypto prices go berserk on weekends. A similar phenomenon \u2014 sometimes dubbed the overnight effect \u2014 can be found with stocks, too.\n\n\u201cCompanies release a lot of information after the markets close because they want people to have time to digest it \u2014 and by the time you come in the next morning, you have a chance to say, OK what\u2019s the impact of that news,\u201d said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management. \u201cAnd some of that could be true in the crypto space where people are maybe waiting to release information on a Friday evening so that you have the weekend to digest it. That would be the fundamental explanation for why that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nChris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank who oversees a currencies desk, attributes yet another potential reason: less dependence on institutional buying in crypto compared with traditional markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of the individuals,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cFor that reason, you could see wider swings on the weekends just because it is just individuals trading.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Lu Wang.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "title": "Why Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple are Must-Have Cryptocurrencies? - Nairametrics",
        "content": "If you have been monitoring recent crypto trading charts, you must be aware of the newfound rally in major cryptocurrencies since the start of 2023. The truth of the matter is that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple are going northward and are gaining more traction among existing and new traders, businesses, and investors. Moreover, Big Eyes Coin has also joined the party by raising more than $21 million by Stage 10 of its presales. However, the presale phase is about to reach its end and if you are yet to pounce on the opportunity to grab a staggering 200% bonus, it is time to act.\n\nAlthough many cryptocurrencies offer similar services, some have stood out in a positive light. Each of these Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple has a special something that makes it unique and popular among other cryptocurrencies.\n\n1. They are Decentralized\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin are not controlled by any central authority or government because they are decentralized. It adds an extra layer of security and protects their privacy, which allows users to trust their transactions. Decentralized networks don\u2019t have a central point of control, thereby mitigating the risk of a single point of failure.\n\nMoreover, hackers find it hard to breach into decentralized networks because they would need to attack many nodes in the network. These networks are more resistant to intervention from government entities or financial regulators.\n\n2. They Offer Security\n\nThe use of cutting-edge cryptography makes Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin safe and secure options for their users. Security is an important factor when it comes to crypto trading. And the demand for secure and private financial transactions is always on the rise, which means this quality will take them to places in the times to come.\n\n3. They Deal with Liquidity Issues\n\nBitcoin and Ripple are widely traded, thereby making it easier to buy, sell and transfer them. Big Eyes Coin also comes with an innate ability to better deal with liquidity issues, which means it will soon join the ranks of the top cryptocurrencies for its innovation. All these three cryptocurrencies can easily be sold, bought, and transferred.\n\n4. Can\u2019t Ignore Immutability Factor\n\nIt\u2019s important to check out the immutability factor of these three cryptocurrencies. Transactions on their blockchain networks are permanent and unalterable, creating trust and transparency in the system. This is a significant advantage over traditional financial systems, where transactions can be altered or reversed.\n\n5. They Offer the Potential for High Returns\n\nWhether it is Big Eyes Coin, Ripple, or Bitcoin, the potential for price appreciation is on the higher side. It has been the case with both Bitcoin and Ripple in the past and the same is expected from the cat-themed meme coin Big Eyes Coin. With more people entering the crypto world, the chances for potentially high returns are unmatched.\n\nDon\u2019t Let the Opportunity Go Begging!\n\nThe opportunity is knocking on your door to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and make it big right away. Yes, you read it right! Big Eyes Coin, as part of its promotional campaigns, is offering a phenomenal 200% bonus. However, time is running out fast and if you want to get your hands on this incredible offer, you must act now. Use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 today and give your crypto career the headstart it needs.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThere are around 1,200 cryptocurrencies now and choosing the right one is nothing like a walk in the park. However, we have highlighted the above-mentioned factors that can help you in making the right decision.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is the most popular of the lot, Big Eyes Coin and other such cryptocurrencies are making their way into contention for leading the show in the years to come. Some of the other significant cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, Namecoin, Syscoin, Dogecoin, and so on.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple are all excellent investment opportunities for those looking to enter the cryptocurrency market with a bang.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: Nairametrics is not affiliated with any cryptocurrency company.

        "title": "El Salvador: will bitcoin bonds arrive in 2023? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The soap opera about the Bitcoin bonds that El Salvador should issue to finance the construction of Bitcoin City continues.\n\nEl Salvador: the failure to launch Bitcoin bonds.\n\nThe announcement of the plan to launch these bonds occurred in November 2021, at the height of the bubble.\n\nIn theory, they were supposed to be put on the market in March of that year, but the launch eventually skipped, despite it being stated that there were $500 million in applications.\n\nIn reality, El Salvador\u2019s goal was to raise $1 billion, to be allocated partly to the implementation of Bitcoin City, and partly instead to the mere purchase of BTC.\n\nRaising dollars in March 2022 and investing them in BTC would not have been a good idea, given what happened next, so it is possible that they decided to postpone the bond launch to wait for better times to buy Bitcoin.\n\nThose times may be here now, so it is not surprising that it is precisely in February 2023 that they seem to want to finally launch them.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s public debt and Bitcoin bond issuance.\n\nMoreover, there was a potentially big problem, related precisely to the country\u2019s public debt, which was only resolved in late January.\n\nWell, we just paid in full, 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost nobody is covering the story. I just found one, yes ONE, in spanish, from Colombia https://t.co/PcRES3poE1 They lie and lie and lie, and when their lies are exposed, they go on silence mode. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023\n\nThe country has a public debt that while not excessively high in relation to GDP (83 percent) is still by no means easy to sustain.\n\nAmid the 2020 crisis, due to the pandemic, it skyrocketed in a single year from 73% to 92% of GDP, partly due to the reduction in GDP itself.\n\nIt must not have been easy to cope with such a rapid and major surge in the debt-to-GDP ratio, but it already dropped to 84 percent the following year.\n\nSo it has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, but it has already come down quite a bit, partly because of the rebound in GDP in 2021.\n\nGiven that bonds are also for all intents and purposes government debt, and given that several international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have expressed a negative opinion on the country\u2019s financial strategies, the government may have had to slow down a bit so that it could first give a clear signal of the sustainability of its debt.\n\nFor it should not be forgotten that El Salvador\u2019s creditors include the IMF, which therefore has a say in the matter.\n\nNow that the situation seems to have softened, the chances that it can finally issue Bitcoin bonds, also known as Volcano bonds, seem to be greater.\n\nLaunching in 2023?\n\nA few days ago Bloomberg published an article speculating that the launch of El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin bonds could take place later this year.\n\nSpecifically, Bloomberg writes that the crypto exchange Bitfinex expects the bond token to be launched later this year.\n\nIn fact, the bonds are expected to be launched in a tokenized format, with the tokens created by the specialized company Blockstream. The bond tokens should be listed on Bitfinex so that they can be purchased by investors.\n\nDigital securities law will enable El Salvador to be the financial center of central and south America.\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb https://t.co/1QBcrjxQCC \u2014 Paolo Ardoino \ud83c\udf50 (@paoloardoino) November 23, 2022\n\nIn December last year, El Salvador\u2019s parliament officially passed a special law allowing the country to issue its first bond.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino, at this time there should be sufficient market demand to allow El Salvador to raise the full $1 billion it intends to collect from the bond issue.\n\nHowever, there is still one bureaucratic step that needs to be taken before the bond can be launched, and that is the creation of a digital securities regulator so that the prospectus can be drafted for potential investors.\n\nIn addition, Bitfinex still needs to obtain a license from the local regulator to be able to offer the security exchange, and this should happen once its El Salvador office becomes operational.\n\nAlthough Ardoino claims that they are on track to make things happen on time, it seems like it will still be a while before the Bitcoin bond can be launched.\n\nBitcoin in El Salvador\n\nAfter adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, El Salvador is looking to become a sort of crypto hub of Latin America.\n\nIn fact, in Central America, where the small state of El Salvador is located, there are currently no real crypto hubs. However, it could suffer from possible competition with Mexico, which is a much larger and more powerful state where signs of interest in the crypto world have been beginning to appear for some time.\n\nAs of now, Mexico has not taken any concrete steps to try to become a crypto hub, while El Salvador has.\n\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that Central America is adjacent to, and very similar to, South America. In South America, there are in particular two nations where cryptocurrencies could attract a lot of interest, namely Brazil and Argentina.\n\nIndeed, there are already many people interested in Brazil, but the nation has no crypto hub on its soil.\n\nIn Argentina, the spread of cryptocurrencies is less, but given the huge problems they have with their local currency, it\u2019s possible that sooner or later the interest of Argentines will pick up.\n\nNot to mention Venezuela, where the first state \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d experiment failed, and neighboring Colombia.\n\nSo the chances that El Salvador could become Latin America\u2019s crypto hub par excellence are there, so much so that the adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has already brought benefits in this respect.\n\nIndeed, both the number of tourists traveling to the country has increased, thanks in part to the fact that they can conveniently pay in BTC with minimal fees thanks to the use of Lightning Network, and the number of businesses that are opening locations in the country, Bitfinex foremost among them.\n\nThe importance of a favorable regulatory framework\n\nThe fact is that Bitcoin being by all means a legal tender, in El Salvador the regulatory framework is, by necessity, favorable to its use. This also implies a favorable framework towards the use of similar instruments, such as Ethereum and to some extent stablecoins.\n\nThe very idea of creating Bitcoin City reveals quite clearly the intentions of the Salvadoran government, namely to make its territory decidedly favorable to people and companies that want to use Bitcoin, and other crypto assets.\n\nGiven that there is still no real crypto hub in Latin America, and given that cryptocurrencies are beginning to spread throughout the continent, President Bukele\u2019s gamble may eventually turn out to be a very good idea, especially if indeed many crypto companies decide to also operate with territorial offices physically located in El Salvador.\n\nIn other words, it appears that the country is voluntarily, and purposely, building a favorable environment for the crypto sector to attract companies and individuals, effectively opening up a whole new world of economic opportunities that have historically been in short supply instead.\n\nEl Salvador is not only a poor country (111th in the world in per capita GDP, out of 196 total countries), it also has a recent history of violence, abuse, corruption, and dictatorship behind it, from which it is eager to finally emerge.\n\nover the past decade it has already come a long way to get out of that condition bordering on acceptable for a Latin American country, and becoming a crypto hub could finally give it the big break out of poverty as well, should many crypto companies open physical and active locations in its territory.\n\nIt is, however, a very slow and bumpy path, but the way now seems open. In the absence of strong competitors in that area of the world, the chances of it succeeding are definitely greater than zero."
