        "content": "Microsoft is reportedly working on an Ethereum-based Web3 wallet for its flagship browser, allowing users to send and receive digital assets and NFTs.\n\nThe wallet is currently in a limited testing phase and is not yet available to the public, IT media outlet Bleeping Computer reported Friday.\n\nFirst reported by Microsoft sleuth Albacore, who shared screenshots of the wallet on Twitter, Microsoft is asking \u201ctesters\u201d via its Edge browser to put up their own assets.\n\n\u201cWe encourage you to test our first Web3 wallet and provide candid feedback along the journey,\u201d Microsoft said in one of the screenshots. \u201cAs the first testers, you have the unique opportunity to shape our foray into cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe wallet is non-custodial, meaning users are in control of their funds and the tech giant will not have access to their passwords or recovery keys. The wallet generates an Ethereum address that allows users to receive funds through the Ethereum network.\n\nUsers can also manage multiple Ethereum accounts and choose between the built-in Edge wallet or an extension.\n\nMicrosoft has partnered with Consensys to make available a swap feature supporting ETH, DAI, UNI, USDC, and USDT, according to Bleeping Computer.\n\nMicrosoft and Consensys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Microsoft will add support for other digital assets in the future.\n\nAccording to Albacore, the wallet may launch soon.\n\n\u201cEnabling the crypto wallet ended up being less complex than I anticipated, which is also why I think that a launch might not be far away,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nAccording to the screenshots, the beta version of the wallet also features a news section to keep track of industry developments, which includes the ability to connect to decentralized apps.\n\nSimon Kertonegoro, who previously helped usher in the implementation of a collaborative program between Microsoft and Enjin known as Azure Heroes, told Blockworks the tech giant\u2019s Web3 wallet was a \u201csavvy play\u201d as it sought to \u201cgain an upper hand\u201d against rival Google Chrome.\n\n\u201cThis would be amazing for us as users too, we\u2019ll no longer need to input our credit card information every time we make a payment,\u201d the founder of MyMetaverse said.\n\nWhile the Edge crypto wallet is still in the testing phase, it could be a significant development for Microsoft, as it allows users to easily send and receive crypto without installing additional extensions or apps.\n\nThe move signals a pivot from its previous Web3 endeavors; Microsoft axed its metaverse unit in February, just four months after it had created a team tasked with building industrial networks.\n\nJane Ma, co-founder of zkLend, a layer-2 money-market protocol built on StarkNet, told Blockworks the emergence of Web3 technologies has spurred a growing trend of Web2 infrastructure companies looking to explore ways to integrate these decentralized solutions into their platforms.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s prototype crypto wallet for its Edge browser is a prime example of this trend, as it aims to simplify the onboarding process for new users,\u201d Ma said. \u201cWith a massive user base of over 200 million, Microsoft Edge\u2019s approach of providing a ready-made, packaged solution within its browser would break down technical barriers,\u201d she said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "NYAG calls Ethereum a security and destroys decentralization myth - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s developers have locked in a date for the network\u2019s next big upgrade, dubbed \u2018Shanghai\u2019: April 12. While ETH fans will laud the update for introducing the ability to \u2018unstake\u2019 ETH, it couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse time.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler indicated again this week that proof-of-stake models\u2014like those used by Ethereum\u2014are securities. Meanwhile, the NYAG filed charges against the KuCoin exchange for illegally selling securities and specifically named ETH as a security in large part due to the fact that Ethereum is not decentralized after all.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the past 12-24 months have seen legislators, regulators, and law enforcement all clamp down on illegalities within the industry in different ways. For instance, in January, the SEC took action against lend-to-earn programs jointly operated by Genesis and Gemini on the basis that they amounted to illegal securities offerings. Nexo Capital paid the SEC a $45 million dollar settlement over its lend-to-earn program around the same time.\n\nMost notable about these actions is that they confirm that the SEC is beginning to deconstruct the myth of decentralization and the role it plays in determining whether a given asset offering amounts to a security. Look at the language used by Gensler in an interview with The Block in 2021, right as the SEC began to look at lend-to-earn products:\n\n\u201cI would note to your readers that if you\u2019re investing on a centralized exchange or a centralized lending platform, you no longer own your token. You\u2019ve transferred ownership to the platform. All you have is a counterparty risk. And that platform might be saying, as many of them do, we\u2019ll give you a four percent or seven percent return if you stake your coins with us or you actually transfer ownership and we the platform will stake your tokens. That takes on all the indicia of what Congress is trying to protect under the securities laws.\u201d\n\nThis should represent an enormous red flag for Ethereum and BTC\u2014two projects that the SEC has long considered the rare exceptions to its general position that most digital assets are, in fact, securities. That\u2019s because these exceptions arise from the SEC\u2019s assumption that both projects are decentralized: without a centralized body governing projects like these, according to the SEC\u2019s logic, it can\u2019t be said that investors had a reasonable expectation of profits relying on the efforts of others, as is required by the Howey test for securities (their belief that BTC is not a security is also based on a misguided interpretation of that project\u2019s history).\n\nThese exceptions were always highly tenuous and at odds with reality. As time has gone on, they have become increasingly difficult to justify. Now, it seems, regulators and law enforcement have finally seen the lie for what it is.\n\nEthereum was always a security\u2014but now it\u2019s obvious\n\nThe idea that Ethereum is anything but a security has always been a sham. This was obvious from Buterin\u2019s own marketing at the time of the ETH ICO right through to the language used on Ethereum websites today. The point is made repeatedly: ETH production will slow dramatically over time, increasing scarcity and, as a consequence, value.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nThe Ethereum foundation website also refers to the fact that ETH is viewed as an investment.\n\nBut the biggest lie of all was that Ethereum is or has ever been decentralized. This was obvious back in 2016 when a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) holding almost 15% of all ETH in circulation was hacked. Ethereum\u2019s developers, led by founder Vitalik Buterin, proposed, approved, and implemented the solution to fork the network and recover the stolen assets. There was the charade of a vote on the proposal, but just 6% of all ether holders participated, and 25% of the votes came from a single address, while the proposals at the heart of the vote were still authored by Ethereum\u2019s core team. This can be seen again as recently as this week with the Shanghai update announcement: If Ethereum is decentralized, then who is designing, proposing, and implementing these radical upgrades? That would be the very same people that intervened after the DAO hack, of course. This is not decentralization by any realistic definition.\n\nThe notorious Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which moved the network\u2019s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, did nothing to change this reality. If anything, the migration to Proof-of-Stake moved Ethereum even deeper into security territory. In contrast to Proof-of-Work, where miners are at least undertaking work of their own in solving hash puzzles, those staking under a Proof-of-Stake system are relying entirely on the work of others to deliver profits on whatever coins have been staked. In fact, this week, Gensler again indicated that Proof-of-Stake networks are likely to trigger U.S. securities laws, saying:\n\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019re promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that\u2019s often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators \u2026 seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries,\u201d he said, reported by The Block.\n\nAuthorities are already taking action on the basis that ETH is a security\n\nThis sea change by authorities is not just a speculation over some hypothetical future enforcement drive. Instead, the enforcement drive is already here.\n\nLast week, the New York Attorney General filed charges against exchange KuCoin over failing to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer: ETH, which is listed by the exchange, was expressly labeled a security in the charges. The language used by the NYAG couldn\u2019t be clearer:\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.\u201d\n\nFurther down:\n\n\u201cButerin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the functionality and price of ETH.\u201d\n\nThe language could have been taken straight from Howey: ETH is not decentralized, and the continued development of the network is closely governed by a core group of developers who promote the asset on the basis that its value will increase over time. It is a classic security.\n\nThe NYAG\u2019s action is against KuCoin rather than anyone directly connected to Ethereum, but between Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrades, Gensler\u2019s public statements on centralization and the SEC\u2019s recent enforcement actions, it seems that the SEC charges against Ethereum and its developers directly can\u2019t be far away. The ramifications of an SEC case against Ethereum can be much wider reaching: the SEC is empowered to levy fines and penalties against those violating the U.S.\u2019 securities regime, including disgorgement of all profits made in connection with an unregistered securities offering and injunctions against carrying on further business. In short, it could spell the end of Ethereum altogether.\n\nAnd if the myth of decentralization with respect to ETH has finally been pierced, then you can bet that BTC is up for the same treatment.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) technicals and fundamentals suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency may massively outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming cycle.\n\nIn a new interview on the crypto-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, Pal says he has his eye on the chart of Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\nAccording to the macro guru, the ETH/BTC pair is coiling inside a wedge, and a breakout could send ETH into a rally that leaves Bitcoin in the back seat.\n\nSays Pal,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the chart of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. That\u2019s one hell of a wedge.\n\nIf that plays out, then we should see ETH doing 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x [or] 5x Bitcoin in the next run. And ETH probably won\u2019t be the best performing crypto either.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Pal, the ETH/BTC pair must take out resistance at around 0.077 BTC ($2,115) to confirm the breakout. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0639 BTC ($1,755).\n\nAs for Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals, the Real Vision executive believes that the leading smart contract platform\u2019s total addressable market is much larger than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a broader basis architectural protocol of which we can build more stuff on top of.

        "title": "What Is Arbitrum? Speeding Up Ethereum Using Optimistic Rollups - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has a lot going for it\u2014it\u2019s decentralized, reliable, supports smart contracts written in a programming language familiar to many crypto developers, and is home to a thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is also slow and expensive to use, and will remain so unless users opt to move to another blockchain (like Solana, Fantom or Avalanche), or until planned Ethereum upgrades speed things up within the next couple of years.\n\nWhile the world waits, a third fix has arisen: scaling solutions. These are pieces of software that sit atop the base layer of a blockchain, in this case Ethereum, to speed things up. Arbitrum is one such scaling solution, and it\u2019s become a popular venue for Ethereum users to complete their transactions.\n\nOn March 23, 2023, Arbitrum plans to airdrop its new ARB token, allowing holders to vote in decisions related to the protocol. In so doing, Arbitrum is enacting its long-awaited transition to a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nArbitrum is cheap and quick to use, and relays all transaction information back to the main Ethereum blockchain. While Ethereum manages a mere 14 transactions per second, Arbitrum races ahead at 40,000 TPS. Transactions cost several dollars to complete on Ethereum, while they cost about two cents on Arbitrum.\n\nAnd Arbitrum also supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning that Ethereum DeFi developers can integrate their decentralized applications (dapps) with Arbitrum without having to make any modifications.\n\nArbitrum was created by Offchain Labs. The company raised $120 million in a Series B funding round in September 2021.\n\nHow does Arbitrum work?\n\nArbitrum\u2019s development documentation says that this is the most important graph to understand:\n\nArbitrum workflow. Image: Arbitrum\n\nPut simply, people and smart contracts ask Arbitrum\u2019s blockchain to do something by placing transactions into the chain's \u2018inbox\u2019. Then Arbitrum processes it and outputs a transaction receipt. How Arbitrum processes that transaction\u2014what determines its \u2018chain state\u2019\u2014is decided by the transactions in its inbox.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Arbitrum processes Ethereum transactions through a method called an optimistic rollup, and settles these on a sidechain before reporting back to Ethereum. Let\u2019s break that down.\n\nWhat is an optimistic rollup?\n\nA rollup is a type of data compression technique for blockchain transactions. It involves \u2018rolling up\u2019 batches of transactions into a single transaction.\n\nThe benefit of this is that a blockchain need only process a single transaction\u2014the rolled-up transaction\u2014instead of confirming each individual transaction contained within the rollup. This saves time\u2014multiple transactions are confirmed at once, so you do not have to wait until the blockchain gets around to your transaction\u2014and money, since the blockchain only has to confirm one transaction.\n\nAn \u2018optimistic\u2019 rollup is a specific technique for rolling up transactions. To speed things up, optimistic rollups assume that the transactions contained within the rollup are valid. It is possible to contest transactions through a dispute resolution mechanism if a validator suspects fraudulent behavior. (Optimistic rollups are separate from \u2018zero knowledge\u2019 rollups, which bypasses a dispute resolution mechanism by validating transactions before they are added to the rollup).\n\nOptimistic rollups are the present *and future* of Ethereum scaling. We explain why here:https://t.co/FG0OGC8TJB \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) December 17, 2021\n\nArbitrum\u2019s optimistic rollups are settled on a proprietary sidechain. A sidechain is a blockchain that is connected to a main chain; in this case, Ethereum. Arbitrum collects batches of transactions, settles them on its sidechain, and then feeds the transaction data back to the Ethereum blockchain ledger.\n\nArbitrum says that any transactions confirmed through this process are rubber stamped with the \u201cAnyTrust Guarantee\u201d\u2014when all the validators agree with the validity of transactions contained within a block. Validators stake ETH before they can confirm transactions; by putting money on the line, they are incentivized to act honestly.\n\nUnlike other rollup networks, like Boba or Loopring, Arbitrum does not have a token. Offchain Labs claims the network does not need one, since all transactions on the sidechain are settled with ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nArbitrum has been integrated into several decentralized finance protocols, such as SushiSwap, Curve and Abracadabra. Data from DeFi Llama show that $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency is locked up within Arbitrum\u2019s smart contracts. Approximately 30% is from decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap.\n\nThe project\u2019s blockchain, Arbitrum One, is in mainnet \u201cbeta\u201d, which allows Arbitrum\u2019s developers \u201cvarious levels of control over the system\u201d, including \u201cthe ability to pause the system\u201d. Offchain Labs plans to eliminate these controls once it is certain the project is robust.\n\nHow to use Arbitrum\n\nYou can use Arbitrum through a decentralized application, like Aave, 1inch or Gnosis Safe, or directly on Arbitrum\u2019s token bridge. For the token bridge, you can deposit funds to the Arbitrum network after you\u2019ve connected your Web3 wallet. It takes about 10 minutes for deposits to clear.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay an Ethereum gas fee\u2014at Ethereum\u2019s rates. To deposit under a cent of ETH to Arbitrum, MetaMask wallet quoted us $5.41 in gas fees."

        "title": "After scalability, privacy is the next big thing in the blockchain space - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Public blockchains provide decentralization and transparency, but they lack on the privacy side. The anonymity of transactions on blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is steadily losing ground, as transactions and addresses are easily tracked. With KYC imposed on most crypto exchanges, the majority of blockchain transactions can be traced to their initiators, exposing user activity, holdings, and financial data.\n\nEven decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions can be easily monitored by advanced on-chain analysis systems. This is why privacy is just as important as speed and scalability for crypto to reach mainstream acceptance. Average consumers expect at least bank account level privacy to freely transact and RAILGUN is a ZK (Zero-Knowledge) based solution for existing blockchains that provides such wallet-level privacy.\n\nThe utility of digital assets comes with major downsides amid a lack of privacy. What happens when a crypto user pays for a coffee in crypto? They risk revealing their holdings, income and shopping preferences to merchants, peers and anyone who wants to extract value from their data. And taking it a step further, how many people would be comfortable receiving their salaries in crypto if it meant broadcasting all their financial information to the world? The necessity for increased privacy in the crypto space is essential to mainstream adoption.\n\nPrivacy gains more attention across the blockchain community\n\nPrivacy is an important goal for public blockchains, especially Ethereum, which accounts for about two-thirds of all DeFi activity. The need for privacy on Ethereum has increased after the adoption of the widespread adoption of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nIn January 2023, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted the need for improved privacy on the blockchain. He proposed a \u201cstealth address system\u201d to increase the privacy degree of Ethereum transactions. Stealth addresses would be generated by wallets and would represent obfuscated public key addresses to receive funds in a private environment. Access to stealth addresses would require a special code referred to as a \u201cspending key.\u201d This would enable two parties to transact without being visible to the public. However, stealth addresses are an incomplete solution as they don\u2019t account for full DeFi functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to know when Ethereum will implement privacy features and to what extent, but the good news is that there are solutions that can already achieve a high degree of privacy. RAILGUN is a smart contract system that provides crypto and DeFi users with privacy through zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARK) technology.\n\nRAILGUN is currently among the leading complete privacy solutions for the DeFi space, as it generates zk-SNARK encryption entirely within a smart contract. That enables users to store their funds anonymously and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) in an anonymous, noncustodial manner.\n\nSource: Railgun\n\nRAILGUN, which is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), employs zk-SNARKs to encrypt transaction details, wallet balances and transaction history. Unlike other third-party, Layer-2 privacy solutions, RAILGUN works directly on-chain, enabling users to transfer, swap, lend, borrow and transact with all kinds of DApps anonymously.\n\nOn top of that, the RAILGUN smart contracts can be plugged into any Ethereum Virtual Machine DApp for shielded transactions using the RAILGUN Connect dev toolkit.\n\nRecently, RAILGUN was deployed to Arbitrum \u2014 a layer-2 rollup technology for Ethereum, bringing privacy combined with speed and high throughput to the second-largest decentralized network. RAILGUN DAO'S co-founder Alan Scott stated:\n\n\u201cThe Arbitrum deployment of RAILGUN is a massive accomplishment for privacy in DeFi. Arbitrum\u2019s scaling and RAILGUN\u2019s zk-SNARK-based privacy together are an exciting match. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how DeFi builders will use RAILGUN\u2019s infrastructure to create interesting and new privacy-preserving DeFi solutions on Arbitrum.\u201d\n\nBesides working on Ethereum and Arbitrum, RAILGUN enables on-chain privacy for BSC and Polygon. What\u2019s more, contributors are working on adding support for Solana, Near and Metis as well.\n\nDevelopers and users are starting to pay more attention to privacy as blockchain adoption expands across multiple use cases. Therefore, if developers can crack the puzzle, privacy is poised to become one of the most important trends in blockchain in the coming years.\n\nMaterial is provided in partnership with RAILGUN DAO"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPolygon and Immutable, both heavyweights in the Ethereum scaling space, are teaming up to create a new network designed specifically for Web3 gaming powered by Polygon\u2019s anticipated zkEVM technology.\n\nToday, Polygon Labs and Immutable announced a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d to collaborate on the creation of Immutable zkEVM, a new Ethereum scaling network that will pair the soon-to-launch Polygon zkEVM tech with the Immutable platform designed for blockchain-based games. The news was revealed amid the start of the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC).\n\nTo be clear, Polygon and Immutable aren\u2019t merging, and they\u2019ll continue their respective projects and initiatives. Polygon\u2019s own zkEVM mainnet network is set to launch in beta on March 27, while the existing Immutable X scaling network\u2014based on the StarkEx zk-Rollup tech\u2014will also continue on alongside the new Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmutable co-founder and President Robbie Ferguson told Decrypt that the partnership was an \u201cobvious move\u201d that lets the core builders behind both existing networks combine their efforts in the service of Web3 video game adoption.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is the endgame,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThis is how the next billion users will be onboarded into Web3.\u201d\n\nBoth are Ethereum scaling networks: Polygon\u2019s current primary network is a sidechain, while Immutable X is a layer-2 network. Although the approaches are different, both ultimately make Ethereum more useful for things like video games, large-scale NFT projects, and other decentralized apps (dapps) by enabling faster, cheaper transactions than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nA zkEVM solution like Polygon\u2019s and others is expected to take Ethereum scaling to the next level, pairing transaction rollups based on zero-knowledge proof cryptography with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. In other words, it\u2019s billed as a fast and secure solution that is natively compatible with Ethereum\u2019s own smart contract capabilities.\n\nImmutable X and Polygon are competing scaling networks, however, and have previously competed to lure in developers, brands, and users alike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt admitted to Decrypt that it was a bit awkward at first to discuss a unified path forward when the two sides began chatting about nine months ago.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came together\u2014yeah, it was certainly hard to wrap our heads around it,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIt took time for both sides to figure out: OK, how does this actually make sense for all of us? The more that we talked and the more time that we spent together, it\u2019s actually very naturally aligned.\u201d\n\nFerguson said that despite their history as competitors, both Polygon and Immutable X sought to scale Ethereum rather than try to compete against it as a layer-1 rival. That shared belief in expanding the capabilities of Ethereum, rather than try to beat it with a new, bespoke network, also gave them a shared foundation to work from.\n\n\u201c[That] made it a very easy philosophical alignment,\u201d Ferguson added, \u201conce we looked past the intense competition we'd had on the gaming front over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nImmutable zkEVM is slated to start rolling out towards the end of Q2 2023, Ferguson said, which is when Immutable is \u201caiming for usable things to go live,\u201d but developers can start building on software development kits (SDKs) today to explore the tech.\n\nThe network will use Immutable\u2019s IMX token for gas fees and transaction sequencing. The current Immutable X network will continue operating, and Ferguson said his team\u2019s goal is to develop cross-rollup liquidity between the networks.\n\nHe also expects there to be bridges built to help move assets between Immutable zkEVM and Polygon\u2019s own zkEVM network, for example.\n\nUltimately, the pair said they see Immutable zkEVM as the best of both worlds\u2014a network that will utilize Polygon\u2019s next-generation scaling tech while tapping into the gaming infrastructure that Immutable has built, providing a potentially appealing place for developers to take root as the Web3 gaming market expands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWyatt believes that Web3 gaming is inching closer to a point of mainstream adoption, despite previous pushback from many traditional video game fans. He pointed to this weekend\u2019s live event for the Polygon-powered shooter Deadrop\u2014from a studio founded by Twitch personality Guy \u201cDr. Disrespect\u201d Beahm\u2014as an example of Web3 games that can appeal broadly.\n\nAs he also recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast, Wyatt reiterated what he sees as an increasing push to \u201cabstract away a lot of the crypto and tech jargon\u201d around Web3 games, and just focus on \u201creally fun games where I own assets that I pay for, I can trade them easily, and I can have this really seamless experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's ultimately what the combination of the partnership does,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn 2023, the total amount of destroyed Ethereum (ETH) coins has reached a staggering 66,000 ETH, worth approximately $117 million at the current price of $1,780 per coin. This significant reduction in supply is expected to alleviate some of the pressure on the second-largest digital asset in the market and make it increasingly scarce. With the present burn rate, an estimated 614,000 Ethereum will be removed from circulation annually, which, at the current price, equates to an astounding $1.09 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum network underwent a crucial update in August 2021, known as the London Hard Fork, which introduced the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. This proposal led to the implementation of a base fee mechanism that burns a portion of transaction fees. Since then, the Ethereum network has been steadily destroying coins, reducing the overall supply and creating deflationary pressure.\n\nThe ongoing burn has a direct impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, as it reduces the total number of coins in circulation. This reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand for the digital asset, has the potential to drive the price of Ethereum higher. The current burn rate of approximately 614,000 ETH per year further highlights the magnitude of the change brought about by EIP-1559.\n\nIt is essential to consider that the burn rate can fluctuate based on various factors, such as the number of transactions on the network and the gas fees associated with them. As Ethereum moves toward Ethereum 2.0, a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the network is expected to become more efficient, which could impact the burn rate and its influence on the market.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing annual burn rate of Ethereum has led to a significant reduction in the overall supply of the digital asset, making it increasingly scarce. As the total amount of destroyed coins surpasses 66,000 ETH, the market dynamics are expected to evolve, with the potential for increased demand and higher prices. Investors and traders should keep a close eye on the developments in the Ethereum ecosystem and the factors influencing the burn rate, as these could play a crucial role in shaping the future of the digital asset."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic sees a surge in TVL fueled by increased activity from one of its DEXes.\n\nETC bulls make a comeback but market conditions will dictate its next move.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) just concluded a bullish week but its price action is not the only aspect that achieved a pivot. Its total value locked also registered some upside after previously experiencing outflows.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Classic Profit Calculator\n\nETC had a $363.982 TVL, at the time of writing, which represented a significant improvement and pivot from its $279,884 low in February.\n\nBut despite this noteworthy improvement, Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL was immensely dwarfed by Ethreum\u2019s impressive $28.93 billion TVL. ETC\u2019s anemic TVL is a rough indicator of just how far behind the network is in the DeFi race.\n\nA major reason for Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL shortfall is that it has not been very successful in attracting DeFi projects to run on its network.\n\nNevertheless, there is one particular protocol running on the Ethereum Classic network that seeks to change that. The HebeSwap decentralized exchange currently accounts for most of Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL.\n\nThe amount of TVL that HebeSwap contributed to Ethereum Classic peaked at $236,928 after surging by 42.87% in the last 7 days.\n\nIt had the highest gains out of the DeFi projects currently running on the Ethereum Classic network.\n\nThe DEX recently expressed its commitment to improving ETC\u2019s ecosystem through the latest addition, a farm APY pool.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) price action\n\nETC bounced back by as much as 25% from its weekly low to its weekly high. Its 40% gain from its current monthly low is even more impressive. It traded at $21.12 at press time.\n\nCan ETC sustain the rally for the next few days? Its latest upside has so far pushed above the 50% RSI level which means relative strength is now leaning in favor of the bulls. Multiple on-chain metrics also support this observation.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETCs worth today?\n\nThe weighted sentiment metrics remained high after the rally it secured in the last 7 days. In other words, investors are still optimistic about ETC\u2019s bullish prospects.\n\nInvestors should also note that the price volatility metric ended last week with a pivot. It remains to be seen whether this volatility surge will carry the momentum forward for the next few days.\n\nMore good news from the NFT side of things. Ethereum Classic\u2019s total NFT trades volume registered a surge in the last few days. A confirmation that the demand for NFTs on the network was also enjoying improved health.\n\nAlthough these are favorable observations, Ethereum Classic\u2019s development activity demonstrated signs of weakness during the weekend."

The use of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts enables these services to be transparent, efficient, and secure, providing a new level of financial access and inclusion to those who were previously excluded from the traditional financial system.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are unique and cannot be exchanged for one another. Ethereum has played a significant role in the growth of the NFT market, providing the ability to create, buy, and sell NFTs in a secure and decentralized manner. NFTs have a wide range of use cases, from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual real estate. The growth of the NFT market has been driven by the ability to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets, and Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts enable this proof to be stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe gambling industry has seen significant growth in the use of digital assets, and Ethereum has played a role in enabling this trend. Ethereum casinos allow players to use cryptocurrencies to gamble, providing increased security and privacy compared to traditional online casinos. The use of Ethereum smart contracts also enables provably fair games, which ensures that the outcome of a game is not manipulated by the casino or any other third-party. The growth of the gambling industry using digital assets has been driven by the convenience and security of using cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum\u2019s capabilities have made it a popular choice for this use case.\n\nSupply chain management is another area where Ethereum has the potential to drive innovation and transparency. By using Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology, supply chains can be made more transparent and secure, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. The use of smart contracts enables the automation of supply chain processes, reducing the need for intermediaries and improving efficiency. Additionally, by storing supply chain data on the Ethereum blockchain, it becomes tamper-proof and transparent, allowing for increased accountability and traceability throughout the supply chain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Impact on the Blockchain Landscape\n\nThe growth of the Ethereum network has had a significant impact on the broader blockchain landscape. Ethereum has become one of the most widely used blockchain platforms, with a large developer community and a wide range of use cases. Its popularity has contributed to the growth of other blockchain platforms as well, as the technology continues to gain mainstream acceptance. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s success has led to the development of new technologies and platforms that build on its architecture, such as Polkadot and Cardano.\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to drive innovation and disruption in various industries is significant. Ethereum\u2019s ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts has opened up new possibilities for industries such as finance, supply chain management, and even social media. However, there are still challenges and limitations facing the adoption and scalability of the Ethereum network. The current gas fees required for transactions on the Ethereum network can be prohibitive, and the scalability of the network needs to be improved to handle the growing number of transactions. Despite these challenges, the potential for Ethereum to drive innovation and disruption in various industries is significant and will continue to be a driving force in the blockchain landscape.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nEthereum has emerged as a significant player in the blockchain landscape, offering unique features that differentiate it from other blockchain platforms. Ethereum\u2019s ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts has opened up new possibilities for industries such as finance, supply chain management, and even social media.

        "content": "Venture capitalist Chris Burniske says that Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) could be setting itself up for a massive move to the upside.\n\nBurniske, a former ARK Invest analyst and a current partner at venture capital firm Placeholder, says that a big rally may be in store for Solana if it can clearly break the 200-day simple moving average (SMA),\n\n\u201cSOL definitively reclaiming its 200-day SMA should be a glorious move.\u201d\n\nSOL\u2019s 200-day moving average is currently hovering at about $23. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $22.42.\n\nBurniske has previously predicted that Solana could be the next \u201cEthereum-level\u201d opportunity should another bull market happen.\n\nLast month, Burniske said,\n\n\u201cI think if I had to pick an ecosystem that\u2019s contentious and that you should pay attention to, and in its contentiousness is undervalued, it would be Solana. Placeholder, each bear market, tends to pick an ecosystem or two and build an aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem. And so the last bear [market], it was ETH and Bitcoin, because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify.\n\nAnd what I mean by aircraft carrier \u2013 if you take Ethereum, buy a bunch of the core ETH asset, but then venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are working on say, at that point in time, lending or DEXs [decentralized exchanges] or asset management or whatever. And then you can pick the best teams of the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective. We\u2019re doing that exact same aircraft carrier strategy around Cosmos and Solana right now.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Billionaire and Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin is highlighting what he thinks is the best way for users to self custody their crypto.\n\nIn a new Reddit post, Buterin says that using multisigs, plus what he calls \u201cguardians\u201d or a network of trusted devices or individuals, is his preferred method of crypto security.\n\nA multisig wallet requires two or more signatures before it could confirm and process a transaction.\n\nButerin says that both he and the Ethereum Foundation use a multisig wallet to store the bulk of their crypto funds. The Ethereum creator also references \u201csocial recovery wallets,\u201d which he covered in more detail in a January 2021 blog post.\n\n\u201cMultisig wallets (eg. Gnosis Safe) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of self custody \u2013 namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all \u2013 without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\n\nButerin says trusting other people to help secure one\u2019s coins means having a level of trust, but also allows for easier recovery of the crypto if you become compromised somehow.\n\n\u201cIt makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices \u2013 it doesn\u2019t reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it is your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you\u2019re also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear, there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, you should control at least one guardian, and at most N(set of addresses) -M (trusted people) guardians. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with new technologies and trends emerging every year. In 2023, Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two tokens that are expected to reach new heights.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is already a popular choice among investors due to its strong development team and widespread adoption. RenQ Finance, on the other hand, is a relatively new blockchain platform that offers unique features and advantages over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this Report, we will explore why these two tokens are expected to grow in popularity and reach new highs in 2023, with a particular focus on RenQ Finance.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has been around since 2015. It is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to execute complex smart contracts that are automated, transparent, and secure.\n\nOne of the reasons why Ethereum is expected to reach new heights in 2023 is its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This upgrade introduces a new consensus mechanism that makes the network more efficient and scalable. It also brings in new features like staking, which allow users to earn rewards by holding ETH tokens. Additionally, the upgrade reduces transaction fees, making it easier for users to interact with DApps on the network.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ): AI Meets DeFi\n\nRenQ Finance is a new token that combines AI with blockchain technology to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and make investment decisions. This unique approach to AI has gained significant attention from investors who are looking for new investment opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nOne of the key advantages of RenQ Finance is its fast and secure network. It can process millions of transactions per second, making it ideal for DeFi applications that require quick and efficient data processing. Additionally, the platform has a limited supply of tokens, which could lead to increased value as demand increases.\n\nRenQ Finance has already raised $2.7 million in its presale, indicating a high level of interest from investors. The platform has also passed the Certik audit, which provides additional security and reliability to the token.\n\nWhy Ethereum and RenQ Finance?\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance have unique features that make them stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Ethereum\u2019s ability to execute complex smart contracts and the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade makes it an attractive investment option. RenQ Finance\u2019s AI-powered approach to DeFi and fast, secure network make it an appealing choice for investors who are looking for new opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum and RenQ Finance are both backed by strong development teams, which provides confidence to investors that the tokens will continue to grow and evolve. In addition, both tokens have gained significant attention from the crypto community and have a growing user base.\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2023, experts predict that Ethereum and RenQ Finance will soar to new heights. Ethereum\u2019s capacity to handle intricate smart contracts following its upgrade and RenQ Finance\u2019s innovative AI methodology and rapid, secure network make them both appealing investment opportunities.\n\nNonetheless, it is vital to conduct thorough research and comprehend the risks before deciding to invest in any token.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Dogetti (DETI) looks set to break into the top ranks within the cryptocurrency market, as its developers look to leverage its DAO principles to surprise existing projects like Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM). The DAO principle and other features empower the users, making them more involved in the platform\u2019s activities. Read on for more information on Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) new protocol and its implications for the DeFi space.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Elite Blockchain with Extensive DApps\n\nEthereum\u2019s launch in 2015 presented a more relatable platform than Bitcoin, where users could access a wide range of DeFi tools and Web3 applications for a better blockchain experience. The network has become a first stop for a complete cryptocurrency experience, given its many attractive features.\n\nEthereum (ETH) initially operated a proof of work protocol, which encouraged the mining of Ethereum tokens using different devices. The proof of work protocol is not scalable, so increased traffic on the Ethereum blockchain caused many network lags and delayed transactions. Also, its intensive energy consumption affected network charges, as users paid huge fees to complete their transactions on time.\n\nAs the trading traffic on Ethereum (ETH) increased, the developers incorporated other platforms like Polygon to help with handling transactions, particularly in the NFT sector. By 2022, they scheduled an upgrade, dubbed \u2018the Merge,\u2019 that will take Ethereum to a proof of stake protocol. The shift took place in September, and users are expecting the gas fees on Ethereum to start dropping soon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is host to several popular NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea and EtherScan, which the ETH token directly powers. Its involvement in the NFT trade has made Ethereum the biggest NFT trade centre in the cryptocurrency market, with over $500 million in market capitalization.\n\nETH token provides fuel for the platform, and it now functions as a stake token with the latest developments. ETH is listed on Coinbase for about $1605.55.\n\nCosmos \u2013 Internet Of Blockchains\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is an independent decentralised platform that hopes to host DApps and tokens like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. It aims to create a network of blockchains that will be able to interact with other blockchains in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCosmos (ATOM) runs on a proof of stake protocol called the Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol. The code uses a small group of validators to quicken transaction processing, which ultimately maximises energy requirements on the platform.\n\nThe protocol helps coordinate the two aspects of Cosmos\u2019s operations, the software development kits and the Cosmos Hub. The software development kits are frameworks or models for creating public domain blockchains that interact with one another and the main blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, the Cosmos Hub is the central part of the Cosmos economy and establishes connections between the platform and other platforms in the cryptocurrency market. It features bridges that allow token transfers to Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and maintains security within the blockchain.\n\nCosmos runs using the ATOM tokens, which serve the roles of staking, voting, and fueling the platform. ATOM is listed on Coinbase for about $12.92.\n\nDogetti \u2013 NFTs and So Much More\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) protocol will serve multifocal uses, as the developers have managed to compile several user-oriented features to provide users with a unique crypto journey. Top of these features is the DAO structure which will encourage more active participation from the users, contributing to increased wealth creation and longevity of the platform.\n\nA Decentralised Autonomous Organization represents a token community where the protocol upgrades and improvements are subject to approval from the community. The users have an enormous stake in the project\u2019s holdings, and so hold the deciding factor in policy-making and protocol alterations.\n\nDogetti (DETI) has earmarked 50% of the total coin supply for the presale event, giving its users a significant advantage in terms of token stake. This will promote user participation and ensure that only the user-friendly features get to the protocol at every upgrade.\n\nAnother significant feature Dogetti (DETI) will be offering its users is the NFT marketplace. Dogetti intends to keep up with contemporary DeFi trends and will allow users and developers to create and sell their NFT collections and projects on the platform. The whitepaper also promises that future upgrades will enable the NFTs to grow and breed, increasing user wealth on the network.\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) presale is on and the best time to join is now.

        "content": "Shiba Inu may be a meme, but where it comes to wealth, it ain\u2019t no joke! Data from WhaleStats shows that out of the top 100 Ethereum Whales, SHIB is the most popular of all altcoins, accounting for over 1/5th of all the (non ETH) crypto held by these ETH whales. Orbeon Protocol is an up and coming crowdfunding and community VC project, whose token is up by over 20x since last November, and is still in presale.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nShiba Inu swims with the Whales\n\nThe ocean has been full of Shiba Inus this week (not literally thank goodness!), as a few days ago, a huge ETH and SHIB whale purchased 118,058,494,947 SHIB, worth $1.34 million. That might seem a lot but to for crypto behemoth it merely seems to be \u2018buying the dip\u2019, since they already hold a staggering $214 million worth of SHIB.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nThe Story of Shiba Inu\n\nSHIB started as a small project on the Ethereum blockchain, with anonymous developers, capitalizing on the crypto and internet\u2019s love of Shiba Inu dogs and Dogecoin. At first many thought it was merely a joke, but things began to change for the crypto after anonymous developer \u2018Ryoshi\u2019 sent 50% of the supply to Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin promptly sent 10% to a covid relief fund for India and burnt the rest, pumping the price and ensuring that he didn\u2019t have further power to move the markets, something he said he didn\u2019t want.\n\nThe team kept developing, and built an initially criticized dex and DeFi platform \u2018ShibaSwap\u2019. With time, though, the team got the bugs fixed and the Shiba Inu project became more decentralized, with various community projects, dapps and games being developed for the ecoystem.\n\nElon Musk famously has a pet Shiba Inu and takes pleasure in tweeting things that often send both SHIB and DOGE, if not to the moon, at least pumping to the clouds.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nThe Shibarium finally arrives\n\nThe long awaited news for SHIB holders, is the release of the Shibarium, a totally functional layer 2 blockchain, which has just gone live on beta mode on the Goerli and Puppynet test networks, (at time of writing I was unable to connect using Puppynet but Goerli was working). Similarly, the beta of the Orbeon Protocol staking dashboard has just gone live on Goerli.\n\nCurrently, in beta, the Shibarium mainly has robot looking dogs and forms to work or collaborate with them, though it does have what seems to be staking dashboards.. They are apparently recruiting people for web3 AND web4 now. Hope they let us know what that means.\n\nRyoshi reminded people that this is just a testnet, nothing on there has any real world value and therefore, not to fall prey to any scams.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol to be the next big thing\n\nIt takes time to become a top 50 altcoin, and Orbeon Protocol, still in presale, has a long way to go. However if SHIB can capture the hearts of the people, then Orbeon Protocol can capture the budding venture capitalists of the people. Orbeon Protocol allows small and medium sized businesses to access a new way of funding, by using fractionalised NFTs and enabling the ordinary investor to get involved, no matter where from, who they are, or how much money they have.\n\nIn general, if you want to get in on really great investing deals, you need to be early. Even if SHIB increases dramatically in price, it still can\u2019t go that high, due to its already high market cap. ORBN on the other hand, is still in presale, so those getting involved now are still very early. Experts predict that ORBN, now worth $0.0877 could reach $0.24, which is 173% gain for those getting in today.\n\nFind Out More About the Orbeon Protocol Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with Their High Transaction Speeds in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Top 10 cryptocurrencies with high transaction speeds in 2023 are enlisted and detailed below\n\nIf you are a crypto enthusiast, you might be curious as to which cryptocurrencies have the fastest or fastest transaction speeds. You won\u2019t need to look any further because the information you require is right here. This article will focus on the top cryptocurrencies with the fastest transaction speeds and delve deeply into the world of Blockchain transaction speed. In addition, we will investigate the reason why speed is so important in the cryptocurrency industry. In this segment, we should investigate a portion of the highest-level 10 cryptocurrencies in 2023 with their high exchange speeds.\n\nThere are several cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is the most well-known and costly one. However, bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed is rather sluggish. Due to their high transaction speeds, some cryptocurrencies are regarded as the most efficient.\n\nIn 2023, these are the top 10 cryptocurrencies with high transaction speeds.\n\nRipple (XRP): Ripple (XRP) is a digital payment protocol that facilitates low-cost, near-instantaneous international transactions. Ripple\u2019s rapid transaction speed is one of its key characteristics. The XRP Ledger settles transactions in 3-5 seconds, as stated on the Ripple website. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can take several minutes or even hours to process transactions, this is significantly quicker.\n\nEOS: EOS is a 2018-launched Blockchain platform. It is intended to give a quick and versatile framework for decentralized applications (dApps). Transaction speed is one of EOS\u2019s most important features. The maximum transaction speed of EOS is approximately 4,000 TPS. One of the most scalable Blockchain platforms currently available, the EOS Blockchain can process up to thousands of transactions per second (TPS).\n\nNEO: NEO is a Blockchain platform that first debuted in 2014 under the name Antshares before changing its name to NEO in 2017. Transaction speed is one of NEO\u2019s most important features. As indicated by the Bitdegree article you gave, NEO has an exchange speed of around 15 exchanges each second (TPS). Even though this is significantly faster than Bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed, it is still significantly slower than EOS and Ripple, and other Blockchain platforms.\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano (ADA)\u2019s transaction speed is one of its most important features. Cardano can process more than 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), which is comparable to other high-speed Blockchain platforms like EOS and is significantly faster than Bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed.\n\nSolana (SOL): One of the most widely used payment processors, Solana (SOL), can process up to 24,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum, one of the largest Blockchain networks, can process approximately 15 transactions per second. Solana (SOL) Solana is a Blockchain platform that was launched in March 2020 to resolve the scalability issues faced by other Blockchain networks.\n\nSteller (XML): Steller (XML) According to Stellar\u2019s official website, the Stellar Core software enables the platform to process up to 1,000 transactions per second. Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few other well-known Blockchain platforms, this speed is significantly higher.\n\nTron (TRX): TRON professes to have an exchange speed of roughly 2,000 exchanges each second (TPS). Utilizing delegated proof-of-stake, a network with high bandwidth, and a quick block time of just three seconds are some of the optimizations that contribute to this high speed.\n\nCosmos (ATOM): Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos boasts high transaction speeds, with a Tendermint consensus algorithm throughput of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, the application and network congestion may affect the actual transaction speed.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum (ETH) The most recent version of Ethereum, known as Ethereum 1.0, can process approximately 15 transactions per second (TPS) of transactions. Ethereum has been working on Ethereum 2.0, or Eth2, a significant upgrade. The current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism will be replaced by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism as part of this upgrade. It is anticipated that this change will significantly boost the network\u2019s transaction speed, with estimates indicating that Ethereum 2.0 could eventually process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nWaves: Waves is a Blockchain platform for creating custom digital assets and developing decentralized applications (dApps). Up to 6,000 transactions per minute, or about 100 transactions per second, can be processed by the platform (TPS). This is made conceivable through the execution of Waves-NG, which utilizes a unique block size and focuses on exchanges in light of their expense rate.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "ONWIN and Other Online Betting Sites Are Now Accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum As Payment! - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As cryptocurrency continues to grow, so does its demand for being accepted as payment, especially within the digital world. In this day and age, it\u2019s quite surprising that so few online betting sites accept it. Below, we will discuss the top three different online betting sites that offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies!\n\nTake Advantage of ONWIN\u2019s Amazing Odds Using Crypto!\n\nONWIN is still new to the scene, and though it\u2019s yet to stand the test of time, this platform has gained a mass following and is already presenting itself as a serious threat to other online betting sites in the industry. Their main demographic is based in Brazil, which is unsurprising given that the world of online sports betting is more popular there than in any other country. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, ONWIN also accepts other cryptos too, such as USDT and BNB.\n\nHowever, welcoming cryptocurrency as a payment method is only a fraction of the desirable features ONWIN offers. The main reason the site has attracted so much attention in so little time is down to their incredible and unprecedented betting odds. ONWIN also offers some other fun and interesting features such as eSports betting, Casino betting, and live sports betting! They have been praised for their awesome bonus deals and Sports betting promotions. Newcomers get a 100% welcome bonus for Bingo and $100 worth of bets!\n\nCrypto in Return for Loyalty\n\nBwin has been around for more than 15 years and has since become a top-class booker maker and a public favorite in the world of online betting. Bwin\u2019s fan-base claims they are the perfect choice for punters looking for a platform that offers a wide range of sports, fast payouts, and impeccable betting odds. In terms of complaints, many customers have requested that Bwin launch a live chat service.\n\nThey also offer a good range of payment options, which is what we\u2019re highlighting here. They use \u201cpay with crypto,\u201d which is a payment method that allows customers to deposit their money into their Bwin account. Then, through BVNK, a third-party virtual assets service provider, they provide them with a fixed exchange rate for an hour and convert their cryptocurrency into euros. There is a small catch, which is that paying in crypto is exclusive to customers that have been using the platform for over three months.\n\nGet A Weekly Crypto Allowance with Stake.com\n\nStake.com is an online betting site that advertises itself as a \u201ccrypto casino & sports betting\u201d platform. It\u2019s best known for offering a high RTP (percentage return to player) and lots of unrestricted weekly and monthly bonuses. In addition, all users of their platform get a weekly allowance of 5-10 dollars.\n\nThe cons? Since Stake.com is a cryptocurrency betting site, there is currently no means of withdrawal into traditional fiat money, but considering the rising number of customers strictly choosing to gamble with crypto, there\u2019s a huge market for what their offering.\n\nFor More Information on ONWIN, Click On the Links Below!\n\nWebsite: Onwin.com\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/on_win\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_OnWin_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Grayscale: focus on the Ethereum PoW crypto - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Grayscale Investments, the crypto investment firm, announced on 16 March that it will extend the review period for evaluating the market environment to determine whether it can acquire Ethereum PoW (ETHW) tokens.\n\nExtending the purchase period of the Ethereum PoW (ETHW) crypto\n\nThis move comes after much speculation about Grayscale\u2019s potential acquisition of forked Ethereum tokens after the merger. Grayscale will now take up to 180 days to decide whether, when and how to sell ETHPoW on behalf of shareholders with registration dates.\n\nThis decision by Grayscale highlights the careful consideration that must be given when considering the potential acquisition of a new asset. Even though the company has been notoriously bullish on Ethereum in the past, it is clear that it is taking a cautious approach when it comes to ETHPoW.\n\nThe decision to extend the review period indicates that Grayscale is taking the time to carefully consider all the factors involved and make an informed decision in the best interest of its investors.\n\nThe post-merger forked Ethereum tokens, ETHPoW, were created as a result of the transition of the Ethereum network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This transition was one of the most significant changes made to the Ethereum network since its inception and was met with mixed reactions from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAlthough PoS is considered a more energy-efficient and scalable consensus mechanism, some community members have expressed concern about the potential centralization of the network that could result from the transition.\n\nIn addition, the creation of ETHPoW has caused some confusion, with some investors uncertain about the value and utility of the forked asset.\n\nDespite these concerns, the potential of ETHPoW is still very exciting. The forked asset represents a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a new asset class and potentially benefit from the growth and adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nGrayscale Investments has long been an advocate of investing in digital assets and has played a significant role in bringing cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.\n\nThe decision-making factors of Grayscale Investment\n\nThe firm is best known for its Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which was the first publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle in the United States. Since then, Grayscale has expanded its offerings to include a range of other digital assets, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWith the potential acquisition of ETHPoW, Grayscale has the opportunity to continue its mission of providing investors with exposure to innovative and disruptive technologies.\n\nHowever, it is clear that the company is taking a cautious approach to this new asset, recognizing that the decision to acquire and sell ETHPoW must be made with great care and consideration.\n\nSeveral factors are likely to have influenced Grayscale\u2019s decision to extend ETHW\u2019s review period. One of the most significant factors is the current regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nGovernments and regulators around the world are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, particularly their potential use for money laundering and other illicit activities.\n\nThis has led to increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market and could potentially lead to new regulations or restrictions on the market in the future.\n\nAnother factor that could influence Grayscale\u2019s decision is the current state of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe market has been extremely volatile in recent months, with the prices of many cryptocurrencies rising and falling dramatically in short periods of time. This volatility has made it difficult for investors to predict how the market will evolve in the coming months and may cause institutional investors like Grayscale to take a cautious approach to the market.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to extend the ETHW review period also has several potential implications. One of the most significant implications is that it could further increase uncertainty and confusion in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe creation of ETHW has already created confusion among investors, and Grayscale\u2019s decision to extend the review period could potentially increase this confusion by creating further uncertainty about the future of the forked asset.\n\nAnother potential implication of Grayscale\u2019s decision is that it could signal a change in the way institutional investors approach the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEven though institutional investors have become increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies in recent years, the market is still relatively new and untested.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s cautious approach to ETHW may signal that institutional investors are becoming more risk-averse when it comes to cryptocurrencies and may be less willing to invest in new and untested assets in the future.\n\nEthereum Merge, common creative license"

        "title": "Microsoft may integrate an Ethereum wallet into its browser - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago, screenshots surfaced on Twitter that appear to refer to an Ethereum wallet for Edge, Microsoft browser.\n\nNewest in the gauntlet of questionable upcoming Microsoft Edge features, a crypto wallet \ud83d\udcb8\n\nNot really sure how to feel about this kind of thing being baked into the default browser, what are your thoughts?\n\nMore screenshots of the UI in the next tweet \u27a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/GAUPiZGLIY \u2014 Albacore (@thebookisclosed) March 17, 2023\n\nIt appears from the screenshots that this is supposed to be a non-custodial Ethereum wallet, but for now there is no official confirmation.\n\nThe speculation is that the company is testing this new feature, namely the possible integration of an Ethereum wallet within its Edge browser.\n\nIs Microsoft Edge about to integrate an Ethereum wallet?\n\nEdge is Microsoft browser that replaced the historic Internet Explorer as of 2015.\n\nIndeed, Internet Explorer, born in the very distant 1995, was finally abandoned this year, overtaken by more advanced alternatives such as Google\u2019s Chrome, Apple\u2019s Safari, or Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.\n\nAs of today, with Internet Explorer still being used by 0.25% of web users, Edge has surpassed 4%, so it is among the little-used browsers although it is more widely used than Firefox. But Safari stands out with 19% and especially Chrome with almost 66%.\n\nMoreover, lately these percentages appear to be fairly stable, so much so that the use of Microsoft browser does not appear to be increasing significantly in recent times.\n\nAt one time, Internet Explorer dominated, and a decade or so ago it was still used by more than 30% of web users.\n\nThus it has been a real decline for Microsoft, from a dominant position to a totally marginal one in the space of some twenty years, with the new Edge failing to even remotely take the place of the old Explorer.\n\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that there has been a boom in smartphone browsing over the past two decades, and with Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS dominating the smartphone world, it is more than logical that the respective browsers have also taken over.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that Microsoft is trying to evolve its new browser, for example by doing something that neither Chrome nor Safari have already done natively: integrate a crypto wallet.\n\nThe other browsers compared\n\nThere are actually two other browsers, Opera and Brave, that have already integrated a crypto wallet natively, but they are used very little, less than Edge.\n\nIn addition, there are third-party crypto wallets that can be easily integrated into Chrome, such as MetaMask, so Microsoft\u2019s is not much of a novelty.\n\nTherefore, this is not an attempt to challenge other browsers on the cryptocurrency terrain, but probably just an attempt to keep Edge up-to-date with new technologies.\n\nCrypto and Ethereum ecosystem: the importance of Microsoft initiative\n\nDespite the fact that there is still no official confirmation that Microsoft is really integrating an Ethereum wallet on Edge, the fact that it apparently stands the concrete technical feasibility may be something important.\n\nAccording to screenshots posted on Twitter, the initiative would be related to Web3 and NFTs, and not so much to cryptocurrencies, and this actually could make sense.\n\nA company like Microsoft has already approached the world of NFTs years ago, and since it is very much in the gaming business, it inevitably has to deal with these new technologies.\n\nAn eventual integration of an Ethereum wallet into Edge could have positive repercussions for the crypto markets.\n\nIn fact, it would be for all intents and purposes a kind of endorsement of the US giant toward the entire crypto sector, and not just the NFT sector.\n\nIn fact, it is worth mentioning that to send NFTs on Ethereum one has to pay fees in ETH, so if that wallet is integrated it will inevitably lead to an increase in cryptocurrency usage.\n\nMoreover, it also appears from the published screenshots that the wallet integrated into Microsoft Edge would also in turn have integration with Coinbase to enable cryptocurrency buying and selling and swaps.\n\nWhile the actual use of this wallet might be marginal, given the low usage of Edge in the world, it could, nonetheless, lead the way for possible similar initiatives by Google and Apple.\n\nIt is worth not forgetting that with Xbox, Microsoft is one of the world leaders in online gaming, so an eventual integration with one of its crypto wallets within the browser could easily convince Google to do the same with Chrome.\n\nGoogle has also been in this industry for some time, and should crypto wallets integrated into the browser be successful, it is to be expected that some initiative of its own in this regard will be forthcoming.\n\nBrowser-integrated crypto wallets\n\nBrowser-integrated crypto wallets have a huge advantage: they allow direct and immediate interaction with websites.\n\nFor example, they allow in-browser crypto payments, but also logins without passwords or digital signatures.\n\nThe more widespread the use of cryptocurrencies and NFTs becomes, the more users will feel the need to have a crypto wallet integrated within the browser.\n\nThen again, the resounding success of MetaMask, which was born only in 2016, shows how much need there already is for such technology. It is enough to mention that by the end of 2021 MetaMask already had more than 21 million monthly active users.\n\nConsidering that a crypto wallet can be a profit-making service, especially through fees or spreads on trades and swaps, it is hard to imagine that Google and Apple will pass up this opportunity.\n\nEspecially should Microsoft seize the opportunity, not least because no one prohibits Microsoft from creating its own Chrome extension that integrates its crypto wallet within Google\u2019s browser.\n\nMicrosoft other integrations\n\nRecently, another major integration made by Microsoft has caused a lot of buzz.\n\nAfter buying the company behind ChatGPT, Microsoft integrated the now-famous AI-based chat within its Bing search engine.\n\nNowadays the search engine market is dominated by Google, with 93% of searches, but in second place is Bing itself with just under 3%.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT has brought a lot of interest in Bing, although so far it does not seem to have succeeded at all in undermining the almost absolute dominance of Google.\n\nNonetheless, this shows that Microsoft has by no means given up on competing with Google, and Apple, although so far none of its initiatives have produced big results in this respect. In terms of browsers and search engines Microsoft is still clearly behind Apple, but especially Google.\n\nIt could move forward with cryptocurrencies and NFTs thanks to a native Ethereum wallet that its two main competitors do not have.\n\nMoreover, theoretically speaking, the native crypto wallet could also turn a profit, so Microsoft could benefit twofold.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the stock market Microsoft still capitalizes more than Alphabet (formerly Google), and slightly less than Apple.\n\nIndeed, the company is still a leader not only in gaming, but also in office software (thanks to Microsoft Office, which is now pay-for-use), and in some industrial and professional areas, such as with its Azure cloud.\n\nIt is still a real giant with very few equals, even though it has long since lost its leadership in the web sector. Thus a public endorsement of Ethereum by it might be of significant importance to this network.\n\nEthereum Merge, common creative license"

        "title": "How is ERC-721 Used to Create Unique Digital Assets on the Ethereum Blockchain? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Welcome to the world of non-fungible tokens, where digital assets are as unique as your fingerprints, and ownership is forever engrained on the blockchain. ERC-721 is a groundbreaking standard on the Ethereum blockchain that has paved the way for the creation and exchange of non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs.\n\nWhat makes ERC-721 different from other token standards on the blockchain? This is a stark contrast to fungible tokens like ERC-20s, which are interchangeable with one another. This article aims to tell you everything you need to know about ERC-721.\n\nWhat is ERC-721?\n\nERC-721 is a technical standard on the Ethereum blockchain that defines the rules for creating and exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike fungible tokens like ERC-20s, each ERC-721 token is unique and represents a specific asset, whether it be a piece of artwork, a collectible, or even a virtual plot of land.\n\nSo, how does ERC-721 differ from other NFT standards on the blockchain? One key difference lies in its simplicity. ERC-721 is a straightforward and easy-to-understand standard that allows developers to create and exchange NFTs with ease. This has led to the widespread adoption of ERC-721 in the blockchain industry and beyond.\n\nAnother important feature of ERC-721 is its flexibility. Users can use ERC-721 to create truly unique assets that cannot be replicated or duplicated, unlike other NFT standards like ERC-1155. This has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for digital asset creation and ownership, with countless use cases across industries.\n\nERC-721\u2019s technical specifications are based on the Ethereum blockchain and implemented through smart contracts. Each ERC-721 token is stored on the blockchain and is associated with a specific owner, making it impossible to counterfeit or manipulate. The lifecycle of an ERC-721 token includes minting, transferring, and burning, all of which are governed by the smart contract rules defined in the ERC-721 standard.\n\nERC-721 was first proposed in 2017 by a developer named Dieter Shirley. The proposal outlined a new standard for creating and exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike fungible tokens like ERC-20, each ERC-721 token is unique and represents a specific asset, whether it be a piece of artwork, a collectible, or even a virtual plot of land.\n\nThe Ethereum community officially adopted the ERC-721 standard in March 2018, after undergoing a rigorous review process. The blockchain community quickly embraced the standard, with developers using ERC-721 to create a wide range of unique digital assets, from virtual cats and monsters to rare digital artwork and virtual real estate.\n\nOne of the most notable early adopters of ERC-721 was the popular blockchain game CryptoKitties, which allowed players to buy, sell, and breed virtual cats using ERC-721 tokens. The game quickly became a sensation, with players spending millions of dollars on rare virtual cats and driving up the price of some of the game\u2019s most valuable assets.\n\nCountless applications have used ERC-721 since then, from virtual real estate and collectibles to ticketing and even identity verification. Its unique properties and flexibility have made it a powerful tool for creating and exchanging unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow Does ERC-721 Work?\n\nSmart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain create and manage ERC-721 tokens. These smart contracts established the rules for minting, transferring, and burning ERC-721 tokens, ensuring that each token is unique and non-fungible.\n\nMinting an ERC-721 token begins with a smart contract that defines the parameters of the token, such as its name, symbol, and metadata. By interacting with the smart contract through a user interface like a web application or mobile wallet, the creator can deploy the smart contract on the blockchain and mint new tokens.\n\nWhen one user transfers a token to another, the smart contract updates the ownership record on the blockchain. When one user transfers a token to another, the smart contract updates the ownership record on the blockchain, ensuring that the new owner is now the rightful owner of the token. This process is completely transparent and auditable, making it impossible to manipulate or counterfeit ERC-721 tokens.\n\nBurning ERC-721 tokens is another important function of the ERC-721 standard. When they burn a token, they reduce the total supply of that asset by permanently removing it from circulation. This can be useful for creating scarcity and increasing the value of certain assets, such as limited edition collectibles or rare digital artworks.\n\nUse Cases for ERC-721 Tokens\n\nThe potential uses for ERC-721 tokens are virtually limitless, with applications across a wide range of industries. Some of the most popular and innovative use cases for ERC-721 tokens include gaming, collectibles, real estate, ticketing, and even identity verification.\n\nIn the gaming industry, ERC-721 tokens have revolutionized the way we think about in-game assets. Instead of simply buying or earning in-game items, players can now truly own and trade unique assets that are verifiable and secure on the blockchain. This has opened up new opportunities for gaming companies to create rare and valuable in-game items, while also providing a more engaging and immersive experience for players.\n\nCollectibles are another popular use case for ERC-721 tokens. Whether it\u2019s rare digital artwork, limited edition sports cards, or even virtual pets, ERC-721 tokens provide a secure and transparent way for collectors to own and trade unique assets. This has led to the emergence of new marketplaces for digital collectibles, such as OpenSea and Rarible, that are powered by the ERC-721 standard.\n\nIn the realm of real estate, ERC-721 tokens can represent unique properties or plots of land in a decentralized world. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about property ownership and management, with the possibility of creating new marketplaces for virtual real estate that are powered by blockchain technology.\n\nTicketing is another industry that stands to benefit from the use of ERC-721 tokens. By issuing tickets as ERC-721 tokens, event organizers can prevent fraud and scalping, while also providing a more streamlined and secure process for attendees. This has the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency for event organizers, while also creating a better experience for attendees.\n\nWe can use ERC-721 tokens to revolutionize the way we think about online identity verification, with each token representing a unique digital identity. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about online identity and security, with the possibility of creating new decentralized identity systems that are verifiable and secure on the blockchain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nERC-721 is a remarkable standard on the Ethereum blockchain that has changed our idea of digital assets and ownership. Its non-fungibility and flexibility have opened up new opportunities for creating and exchanging unique digital assets, paving the way for a more decentralized and fair future. The potential applications of ERC-721 tokens are vast and varied, spanning industries from gaming and collectibles to real estate and ticketing."
