        "content": "STEM\n\nYuzhe Tang, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and his research team have been awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation for research to advance the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This grant will support Tang and his Ph.D. students in designing, developing and evaluating the security hardening code to protect the Ethereum network stack.\n\nEthereum is a network made up of several communities and toolsets that allow users to communicate or make transactions with digital money. Since the network is decentralized, users are in complete control of their data and what\u2019s being shared, so they don\u2019t need to give up any personal information\u2014all users need to access Ethereum is an internet connection.\n\nDenial of service security is critically important to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and the research will explore ways to protect the Ethereum network from cyberattacks, involving systematic vulnerability discovery using applied formal methods. As cyber criminals attack networks like Ethereum and security concerns grow, Tang believes this research could have a lasting impact on the current landscape of cybersecurity and blockchain platforms.\n\n\u201cWith this grant, we can help solve some of the most critical problems in the real world. We expect to continue developing code merged into Ethereum codebase,\u201d Tang says. \u201cI am most excited about making real-world impacts out of the research works from my group.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs are all the rage \u2014 why not Ethereum? - Blockworks",
        "content": "As optimism grows regarding the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF in the United States, industry watchers suggest that fund issuers may soon apply to launch products holding crypto\u2019s second-largest asset.\n\nYet the fate of such yet-to-be-filed ether funds would likely hinge on how the SEC treats the latest wave of filings from spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls.\n\nThe recent effort by asset management titan BlackRock to launch an ETF that would hold bitcoin directly has reinvigorated a decade-long attempt by a range of firms to get such an offering past the SEC.\n\nThe $9 trillion asset manager\u2019s filing was followed by renewed attempts by Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie to launch similar products.\n\nThe latest rush of spot bitcoin ETF proposals indicates prospective issuers believe \u201cnow is the time,\u201d according to Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised to see an application to launch a spot ether ETF in the coming weeks,\u201d she told Blockworks. \u201cIf one issuer starts the process, others would quickly join the race, not wanting to be left behind.\u201d\n\nBut Townsend Lansing, head of product at crypto asset manager CoinShares, said ether ETF filings likely don\u2019t make much sense right now \u2014 beyond being a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cThe SEC would react the same way it has reacted to all the BTC filings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would analyze the filing, seek public comments, look at the underlying market and presumably reject it for a failure to evidence a proper surveillance-sharing agreement.\u201d\n\nRead more: How \u2018surveillance-sharing\u2019 is designed to deter bitcoin ETF manipulation\n\nBut a spot bitcoin ETF approval would further add interest from fund issuers to try ether (ETH) next, some said.\n\n\u201cIt would indicate that the new proposed surveillance arrangement is enough to address their concerns and the same would apply to the second largest cryptocurrency,\u201d Mishra said.\n\nLansing agreed, in the case of the SEC greenlighting a spot bitcoin ETF, that fund issuers looking to launch an ether ETF next is \u201ca reasonable assumption.\u201d\n\nBut the potential for such a product to be approved would depend on the SEC\u2019s reasoning for permitting a spot bitcoin ETF, \u201cand the extent to which the ether market exhibits similar characteristics,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent press and surge of filings, we continue to believe approval of any spot crypto ETF remains a difficult proposition,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nAndra Nicolau, head of business development and strategy at Origin Protocol, believes that it might still be premature to expect a spot ether ETF based on the demand for such a product.\n\nShe noted that institutional investors who hold bitcoin understand the asset\u2019s scarcity and the need for it as a store of value amid inflation.\n\n\u201cEthereum is better understood by those who understand technology and rebuilding the internet from the ground up,\u201d Nicolau said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that ETH is not ETF worthy. It just means it may take a little while longer.\u201d\n\nAn ether futures ETF first?\n\nThe SEC greenlit bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021 after Chair Gary Gensler said earlier that year the regulator would prefer reviewing filings limited to such contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nBitcoin futures are cash-settled and are regulated by the CFTC \u2014 attributes some have said offer the SEC an additional layer of comfort.\n\nGrayscale Investments and Bitwise were among several firms in May to file for ETFs that would hold ether futures contracts. But these firms quickly halted plans to do so.\n\nTwo sources directly familiar with the matter told Blockworks those moves came after the SEC asked the firms to pull the plans \u2014 telling them the regulator is not yet ready to approve such products. A spokesperson for the regulator did not return a request for comment at the time.\n\nIndustry participants have labeled concerns around current ether futures liquidity levels, as well as a lack of clarity on whether ether is considered a security or a commodity, as possible rationales.\n\nBut concerns over the liquidity of the ether futures market would not apply to spot ether ETFs, Mishra argued.\n\n\u201cThe approval of a spot bitcoin ETF would mean that the SEC\u2019s main concerns regarding fraud and manipulation, which many thought were inconsistent, have been addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any need for the agency to experiment with a futures-based ether ETF first.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency self-custody platform Casa has rolled out support for Ether (ETH) storage, touting its support for multisignature Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH self-storage as a first in the industry.\n\nSince its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security.\n\nCasa\u2019s service originally catered to Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.\n\nAccording to Casa CEO Nick Neuman, with Bitcoin and Ethereum operating as entirely different protocols, the industry had not yet built a security solution that accommodates both on the same platform, aside from various hardware wallet models.\n\nThe firm is also engaging with users over the potential of adding self-custody support for various ETH-related assets, including nonfungible tokens, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Casa co-founder and chief technical officer Jameson Lopp highlighted increasing calls for a multisignature ETH self-custody from its users and the wider cryptocurrency community.\n\nCasa announced its intent to launch an ETH storage solution amid several high-profile collapses of custodians like FTX, as many users not only lost access to ETH, but also to their Ethereum-based stablecoins and other ERC tokens.\n\nRelated: Ledger CEO says crypto key recovery service makes self-custody easier\n\nHackers also wrought havoc within the Web3 space in 2022, with billions of dollars stolen through decentralized finance bridge hacks and smart contract exploits. It\u2019s a point Neuman highlighted when Casa announced its plans for ETH storage on its platform, with many hacks across the \u201cWeb3/crypto space due to poor private key management.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, cypherpunk Jameson Lopp stressed the importance of making self-custody solutions more accessible and easier to give users complete control of their assets and peace of mind managing the associated responsibilities.\n\nIndustry experts have also suggested that its difficult to estimate the amount of BTC currently held in self-custody wallets.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Although Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling to regain the psychological threshold of $2,000 despite the recent positive momentum on the wider cryptocurrency market, its outlook might not look as bearish by the year\u2019s turn if BlockchainCenter\u2019s rainbow price chart for Ethereum is any indicator.\n\nSpecifically, some crypto traders and investors use Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to observe the historical movements of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in relation to various moving averages (MAs) and find patterns that could help them make better investment decisions.\n\nAs it happens, this chart suggests that Ethereum is currently still in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 phase, indicated by the color purple, and ranges between $0 and $2,593, below the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 blue zone between $2,593 and $3,668, as per data seen by Finbold on June 23.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum has been stuck in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area since early October 2022, which, judging by the previous behavior, it might get out of in a matter of weeks, as the same had happened in July 20202, when ETH moved into the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone after a period of eight months in the \u2018Fire Sale.\u2019\n\nFurther crunching the numbers, it took Ethereum 10 months to peak at the \u2018But have we *earned* it?\u2019 level at $4,336. If the same trend occurs this time around, it would mean that the crypto asset would end up in the same zone \u2013 currently between $16,353 \u2013 $23,742, by April 2024.\n\nIn other words, seven months from now, around January 1, 2024, Ethereum could be changing hands in the \u2018Still cheap\u2019 price area on the rainbow chart, which currently stands between $5,290 and $7,705, taking into consideration the exact same pattern.\n\nBefore that action, Ethereum was in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area only one time \u2013 in October 2015 \u2013 soaring to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 price level four months later, followed by a subsequent drop to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone in January 2017, where it stuck around very shortly until moving up again and beyond the \u2018Maximum Bubble Territory.\u2019\n\nShould this pattern repeat itself instead, it would mean that Ethereum could skyrocket to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 area in October 2023, at a price between $23,742 and $34,283, before dropping to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone at $2,593 and $3,668 once again in January 2024.\n\nAlternatively, another Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool developed by CoinCodex estimates that under the same scenario, the asset\u2019s price would hover around $778 per token if ETH remained inside the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 (or \u2018BUY!\u2019) zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: CoinCodex.com\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,872.40, recording a decline of 1.31% on the day but still an increase of 12.48% across the previous week and a 3.21% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, whether Ethereum moves in either of the two rainbow chart patterns will depend on further developments surrounding the Ethereum network, as well as the overall sentiment on the general crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe recovery that began last week\u2014after U.S. inflation appeared to cool\u2014hit its stride this week as markets continued to reverberate from the bombshell of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing an application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nDozens of companies apply for ETFs, and dozens have been rejected. To date, not a single Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the crypto-skeptic SEC, despite the fact that Canadian regulators have approved many of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are high: a spot ETF would offer investors the chance to buy into Bitcoin and either ride the gravy train or go to hell in a hand basket, but if the latter, they\u2019ll be safe in the knowledge that their investment is protected, unlike those who purchase and store crypto directly.\n\nIf anybody has a chance of getting an ETF approved, it\u2019s BlackRock. The firm boasts an incredible $9 trillion in assets under management and has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting an ETF approved by the SEC.\n\nThe news inspired two more U.S. asset managers, WisdomTree and Invesco, which have both previously applied for their own ETFs\u2014to file fresh ETF applications this week. Valkyrie followed suit shortly after.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC) both surged this week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency shot up 18% to its current price of $30,687, while the biggest runner up rallied 12.7% to trade at $1,893 at the start of the weekend.\n\nInvestors flooded into other cryptocurrencies this week as well. In fact, most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market cap shot up by double-digit percentages. There were no losses among the major unbacked coins.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ballooned a staggering 80.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $192.90.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulation and expansion\n\nWhile all eyes were on the SEC and big asset managers this week, there were a couple of other stories that indicated the steady adoption of crypto is continuing around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial project backed by the Bank of England published its findings, concluding that a centrally-issued sterling-pegged digital currency could \u201cenable a robust ecosystem to foster innovation, and to help meet the future needs of a more digitalised society.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2014dubbed Project Rosalind\u2014emphasized the programmability of crypto through smart contracts, which facilitate automatic payments and enable new kinds of online transactions.\n\nOn Monday, British parliamentarians in the House of Lords (upper chamber) voted through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, a piece of legislation that proposes regulation for stablecoins, crypto and crypto promotion.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House of Commons and has made it through to the final stages: the Consideration of Amendments, where both chambers debate the proposals and tighten the screws until they both agree. The final stage requires a signature from King Charlie himself.\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that Germany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, applied for a digital asset custody platform license with the German finance regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nDuring a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC) on Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should play a \u201crobust federal role\u201d in crypto regulation and added that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power\u201d while implying the same about stablecoins.\n\nFinally, XRP progenitor Ripple was granted an in-principle payments license in Singapore. Ripple has long felt heat from U.S. regulators. A lawsuit against it by the SEC has been ongoing since 2020 and, like Coinbase, the company is now hedging its bets through global expansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "ERC 6551 Ethereum Standard Changes Game in Ethereum NFTs: Guide - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe launch of ERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts (TBAs) is arguably the most impressive addition to Ethereum's (ETH) open-source stack in the segment of NFTs since the onset of ERC-721, a mainstream digital collectible standard.\n\nOnce it reaches massive adoption, it can change the narrative in the usage, economics and functionality of NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and EVM ecosystem blockchains.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: Highlights\n\nERC 6551, dubbed \"Non-fungible Token Bound Accounts. An interface and registry for smart contract accounts owned by ERC 721 tokens,\" was launched on May 7, 2023.\n\nERC 6551 is a standard of Ethereum (ETH) non-fungible tokens that can act as noncustodial wallets of Ethereum (ETH) accounts;\n\nERC 6551 allows every ERC 721 token to achieve all the functionalities of a cryptocurrency wallet: sending/receiving transactions, storing its own NFTs, participating in airdrops and so on;\n\nERC 6551 standard is backward-compatible: it can equip every existing non-fungible token with advanced functionality;\n\nNew standard is authored by CryptoKitties co-creator Jayden Windle and Benny Giang of Future Primitive;\n\nERC 6551-enabled NFTs can be used in decentralized gaming, reputation management, on-chain messaging, analytics, trading and so on.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the standard has been developed in an open-source manner. However, its authors stressed that some Web3 companies are already working on instruments designed to make the \"upgrading\" of NFTs easier.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent the type of cryptocurrency token with some unique features. While basically all cryptocurrency tokens (just like fiat currencies) are fungible \u2014 e.g. you can always replace 1 USDT with 1 USDT, 1 BTC with 1 BTC \u2014 every NFT is a unique token.\n\nUnder the hood, NFTs should be considered as contracts regarding ownership of some content. Should we check out the code of the majority of NFTs, we can find that they are tokenized agreements: \"This is to certify that Ethereum account 0xabcd\u2026owns the file Azuki4771.jpg starting from the block 123456.\" As such, most NFTs can be interpreted as tokenized digital property rights.\n\nUsers typically mint NFTs associated with digital content: images, texts, songs, videos, characters and in-game assets.\n\nWhat is ERC 721?\n\nEthereum Request for Comments 721, or ERC 721, is a standard on the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., the standardized design of non-fungible tokens. Introduced in December 2017, this format paved the way for standard NFTs: developers are able to launch them in a streamlined manner.\n\nOn the other hand, ERC 721 is a sample of a smart contract, i.e., a code template that describes basic NFT functionality. All mainstream NFT collections \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, RTFKT \u2014 include ERC 721 tokens. Also, it is a backbone element of the tooling of all of the top NFT marketplaces: OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur and so on.\n\nHow to create NFTs?\n\nBasically, there are two ways to create non-fungible tokens yourself. First, you can try using no-code instruments like Mintable. With them, users can just upload their content, pay gas fees and get their NFTs minted. On some L2 chains, NFTs can even be minted in a gasless manner.\n\nThen, NFTs can be created with OpenZeppelin code templates. To create a token this way, the user needs to set up a MetaMask wallet, pay fees (or claim testnet tokens from the faucet), take the ERC 721 code template, compile it and deploy it to the network \u2014 either Ethereum or Polygon.\n\nWhat are Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nWhile, typically, NFTs are associated with programmable blockchains (that support smart contracts), in 2023, the hype around \"Bitcoin NFTs\" \u2014 also known as \"Inscriptions\" or \"Ordinals\" \u2014 gained steam.\n\nOrdinals is a technology that allows attaching data to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. As satoshis in Bitcoin (BTC) can be modified, users can equip them with content, from .jpeg files to JSON data.\n\nHowever, this standard cannot go mainstream as it is technically sophisticated: to create Ordinals, you need to run a full Bitcoin (BTC) node. Also, the activity of Ordinals creators made the Bitcoin (BTC) network almost unusable.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount Abstraction, or ERC 4337, is a technology that allows Ethereum (ETH) wallets to act like decentralized banks. It blurs the line between wallets and smart contracts and paves the way for a new type of entity in Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains, i.e., \"smart wallets.\"\n\nAccount Abstraction was introduced in early 2023 and is usually described as the \"next big thing\" in Ethereum (ETH) functionality.\n\nVitalik Buterin described this concept as one of the three pillars of Ethereum's (ETH) progress in its transition toward a mature tech stack.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: First comprehensive guide\n\nERC 6551 is a novel mechanism in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It allows NFTs to be equipped with an additional layer of wallet functionality.\n\nERC 6551: Basics\n\nERC 6551 is a protocol that makes \"regular\" NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and other EVM blockchains act like \"smart contract wallets,\" i.e., to perform all actions that are normal for noncustodial crypto wallets. That said, it allows ERC 721 NFTs to receive and send transactions, to store their own NFTs, to swap ERC 20 tokens and so on. ERC 6551-enabled tokens are called \"token-bound accounts,\" or TBAs.\n\nImage by TokenBound\n\nERC 6551 was proposed in early 2023 by Ethereum (ETH) veterans Benny Giang, co-author of ERC 721 standard and co-creator of CryptoKitties, and Jayden Windle, lead software developer at Future Primitive. In February 2023, it was published as an EIP on Ethereum Foundation forum while, on May 7, 2023, it was activated in mainnet.\n\nThe standard is fully open source and is subject to active discussion in the Ethereum (ETH) community. ERC 6551 is backward compatible; every existing NFT can be turned into TBA. Support for ERC 6551-enabled tokens has already been researched by OpenSea and a number of other blue-chip NFT institutions.\n\nERC 6551: Tech design\n\nTechnically, ERC 6551 is an adjustment to ERC 721, the most common standard for Ethereum's NFTs. \"Regular\" ERC 721/ERC 1155 NFTs contain just three types of entries, including the address of the NFT owner, the address of the person who can transfer the NFT and the characteristics of the associated metadata (content).\n\nImage by Ethereum Foundation\n\nAs such, the functions of NFTs are limited: they only can be transferred among Ethereum (ETH) addresses. However, should we use \"registries\" and \"proxies\" (other types of smart contracts), we can map a certain NFT to a standard Ethereum smart contract address (say, BAYC 1234 to 0xabcd..).\n\nNFT researcher and contributor to ERC721A standard 0xCygaar highlights that ERC 6551-enabled NFTs can control an unlimited number of crypto wallets:\n\nA single NFT may control more than one contract account, however, each contract account only belongs to a single NFT.\n\nOnce this mapping happens, NFT-bound wallets become smart contracts. Not unlike multi-sigs, the owner of a smart contract can authorize a transaction by the executeCall command on the wallet.\n\nERC 6551: Possible implementations\n\nAs ERC 6551 NFTs become regular crypto wallets \u2014 but without losing their NFT-specific features \u2014 they have a lot of use cases in Web3 and classic economics.\n\nFor instance, thanks to impressive composability opportunities, all NFTs can be mapped to a single ERC 6551 NFT with his avatar. In a similar manner, a Web3 gamer can collect his/her in-game assets to streamline their display and usage. The entire procedure becomes user friendly and transparent. Everyone is able to track the true history of this or that NFT, which removes the possibility for cheating and selling stolen NFTs.\n\nThen, ERC 6551 NFTs can interact with DeFis, trading bots and marketplaces without revealing the identity and core wallet of their holders. This significantly increases the anonymity and security of the NFT experience.\n\nEven more impressive opportunities are unlocked in the \"real-world\" economic context. For instance, here's how NFTs of new standards can be used in the tourism segment to create a holistic travel experience.\n\nTravel experiences thanks to NFT technology pic.twitter.com/q3R9hYM18Z \u2014 Andrei (@andreiponi) May 31, 2023\n\nHere's how ERC 6551 tokens can be used even by customers with no previous cryptocurrency experience.\n\nERC 6551: How can you benefit?\n\nAs an average user of cryptocurrency, you can benefit from starting to work with ERC 6551 tokens in multiple ways:\n\nFor gamers: With the new standard, you can create a collection of your in-game assets and map it to a single NFT somehow associated with your profile (with an avatar, personal name and so on); this will make your reputation and status more visible;\n\nFor NFT collectors: With ERC 6551, you can apply the \"don't trust, verify\" rule to your experience with buying NFTs as you can see the history of their ownership. Also, you can map your entire collection to a single NFT and exhibit it as such;\n\nFor metaverse enthusiasts: With ERC 6551, you are able to equip your character in this or that metaverse with a more advanced toolkit of \"personal\" features.\n\nAs such, the activation of ERC 6551 paves the way for more immersive, transparent and feature-rich experiences in plenty of Web3 segments for new and existing NFT enthusiasts. It can actually do for NFTs what ERC 4337 or Account Abstraction does for Ethereum (ETH) as a whole.\n\nWrapping up\n\nERC 6551 is an impressive innovation in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It enriches the tooling of non-fungible tokens with the functions of a regular crypto wallet. Everyone can turn his/her NFTs into \"Token Bound Accounts\" via a newbie-friendly dashboard.\n\nWith ERC 6551, NFTs become as functional as \"smart crypto wallets,\" a new form of cryptocurrency wallet unlocked by the Account Abstraction mechanism. Starting from 2023, the line between NFTs, crypto wallets and smart contracts is blurred."

        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from $1,930 against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh increase unless there is an extended decline toward $1,820.\n\nEthereum is currently correcting lower from the $1,930 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,900 and $1,930 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Is Stable Above $1,850\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rallied above the $1,850 resistance zone. ETH even spiked above $1,900 before the bears appeared. A high is formed near $1,930 and the price is now correcting gains, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is still trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,900 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf the bulls manage to pump Ethereum above the recent high, the price might even surpass $1,950. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the bulls could aim a move toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains above the $2,050 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Limited in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,930 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,865 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,820 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a break below the $1,820 support, the price could test $1,800. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,750 zone or even $1,720 in the coming days.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,820\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,930\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A majority of the top crypto tokens dropped sharply during the early day on Friday on the back of profit booking. Traders remain concerned about the US SEC lawsuits filed against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase, despite spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the US market regulator by three financial giants.\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after the gains of two days as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $30,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading lower and dropped about 2 per cent to slip below the $1,900-level. However, pain in the other altcoins was severe.\n\nMarkets have slipped after a three-day rally. The crypto fear and greed index has registered no movement. Bitcoins price is beginning to stall after the BTC ETF excitement within the market. Though we can expect the BTC price to hold firmly around the current levels with support at $29,700, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Institutional entry into the crypto market has shifted the narrative and investor sentiment away from regulatory developments from last week. Furthering this case, French regulators have granted registration to CACEIS, the asset servicing division of banking giants Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Santander, allowing them to provide crypto custody services,\" he said.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. BNB dropped about 5 per cent, while Solana and XRP declined 4 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon shed 3 per cent each. Litecoin, Cardano and Shina Inu were other laggards.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling to $1.17 trillion-mark as it dropped more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes plunged more than 32 per cent to $40.41 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged to over $30,000 for the first time in two months after recent filing of multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications. The surge came after the recent filing of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, Invesco, and other large asset management firms has given investors hope that the crypto market is starting to recover, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of bitcoin directly, and their approval would allow investors to buy and sell bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The recent developments could help to stabilize the crypto market and pave the way for further growth in the future,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum has retraced some gains from earlier this week. The ETH/USD pair is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,950 resistance level. After a period of corrections and consolidations, ETH has started showing signs of appreciation by breaking out of its descending channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading above its 100-day moving average of $1,844 which acts as an immediate support level. The RSI reading is currently at 58, slightly in overbought territory. If ETH is unable to break through the $1,900 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,850 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,845, $1,795\n\nResistance: $1,900, $1,950\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nStaking becomes lucrative\n\nUsers have shown significant interest in ETH staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live on the mainnet in April. As the ambiguity surrounding withdrawals was put to rest, people got more confidence in restaking their ETH.\n\nThis resulted in a sharp spike in the number of ETH staked with deposits consistently outpacing withdrawals over the last two months. At the time of publication, the total amount locked accounted for 16.7% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply, as per a Nansen dashboard.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply on exchanges, i.e. liquid supply, has steadily dropped in the same time period. As per the information provided in the aforementioned tweet, the exchange supply fell to 23.5 million from about 28 million at the start of April.\n\nThis equated to 19% of the ETH\u2019s total circulating supply of 120.2 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe convergence underlined that people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yields. And even though staking rewards have progressively reduced over the past two years, people have preferred utilizing ETH as a savings option, as per a recent report by CoinShares.\n\nETH slips below $1900 after rally\n\nETH failed to hold its gains as it slipped below $1900 to trade at $1,885.59 at the time of writing, according to data from Santiment.

Snapping up some breakout cryptos right now can lead to some hefty gains if the trends continue.\n\nRegardless, there are still more long-term positive catalysts at play that can propel the crypto market. The upcoming Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving and potential rate cuts are principal catalysts to keep in mind. Even if we see a cooldown from here, these three cryptos could 10x in the next few years.\n\nAs a side note, I will be excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD), as they are two obvious choices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTicker Coin Price SOL-USD Solana $16.66 CKB-USD Nervos Network $0.0029 STORJ-USD Storj $0.25\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is the leading \u201cEthereum killer\u201d and it remains a very solid competitor to other alternative Web 3.0 blockchains. While stability issues have always been my top concern with Solana, their focus on fixing such issues this year makes me believe this is a great contender for cryptos that could 10x by 2025.\n\nSolana has a lot of potential to become a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, as it offers low fees, scalability, and interoperability with other blockchains. It is capturing a lot of the non-fungible token market share from Ethereum, and once the project figures out its stability issues, I believe more developers are likely to migrate.\n\nStill, Ethereum remains the top dog, and fees are very low. Solana is much more cyclical and volatile and I only expect it to deliver substantial gains when the Ethereum network is congested.\n\nNervos Network (CKB)\n\nAn image of the blockchain, distributing digital crypto from a phone through the web to another tablet\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nNervos Network (CKB-USD) is an under-the-radar project with one very bullish catalyst this year. CKB will be undergoing a halving event sometime in November and we could see the price climb significantly from there.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the lack of momentum here, I\u2019m optimistic about this project. The multi-layered blockchain network provides a secure, scalable, and interoperable platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nNervos consists of two layers: the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which is a public and permissionless proof-of-work blockchain that stores data and assets; and the Application Chain Layer (ACL), which is a set of layer-2 solutions that enable fast and low-cost transactions. Simply put, it can combine the best aspects of both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, I believe a lot of patience is needed here. That primarily concerns the lack of marketing. But as blockchain development continues to advance, the flexibility and interoperability offered by this project will make it very appealing.\n\nNervos Network is currently trading with a market cap of over $120 million and that leaves a lot of room for upside.\n\nStorj (STORJ)\n\nAn image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD) is similar to Filecoin (FIL-USD), as it buys data storage from individuals worldwide with its STORJ token and then resells it in bulk to others. This project is overshadowed by the Filecoin project, and especially after the launch of FWS, many wonder why they should buy STORJ.\n\nThe answer here is tokenomics. Unlike Filecoin\u2019s inflationary model (94% supply inflation), Storj does a great job of providing long-term value. The supply inflation here is at just 1% and your holdings won\u2019t be eroded over time while enjoying the tailwinds from the decentralized cloud storage market.\n\nOf course, blockchain cloud storage has a long way to go. But both Filecoin and Storj have better pricing than their traditional counterparts and their customers enjoy the perks of no censorship, decentralization, and better stability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s on-chain movements indicate bullish pressure building around Ether as its exchange balances reached an all-time low and staking deposits keep surging.\n\nEther\u2019s (ETH) technical charts suggest that the asset can reclaim $3,000 if buyers are able to push above the resistance between $1,900 and $2,000.\n\nETH held on exchanges hits an all-time low\n\nExchange balances for ETH reached a new low of 12.6%, dropping sharply in the last 30 days, according to Glassnode data. Reduced supply on exchanges is usually a bullish sign, as it means fewer tokens are readily available for selling.\n\nPercentage of ETH\u2019s supply on crypto exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe netflow volume of deposits and withdrawals from exchanges shows a steep surge in withdrawals at the start of June amid a regulatory crackdown on Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThe data should be taken with a grain of salt, as withdrawals were caused by investors spooked by centralized exchanges.\n\nHowever, the magnitude of withdrawals and bullish price action show similarity to the November 2022 levels, when ETH quickly surged over 33% following an equivalent dip in exchange balances.\n\nNetflow of ETH deposits and withdrawals from exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s supply locked in staking contracts has surged significantly since April\u2019s Shapella upgrade. Currently, over 23 million ETH is deposited in staking contracts, representing 19.1% of its total supply.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data shows that nearly 30% of ETH\u2019s supply is locked in smart contracts, including decentralized finance and staking contracts, up from 25.5% at the start of 2023.\n\nIncreased withdrawals from exchanges and deposits in smart contracts are positive for ETH's price, as it reduces its liquid supply.\n\nETH/USD price analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price broke above the 50-day moving average at $1,823.09, staging a bullish breakout.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair is currently facing resistance around the horizontal level of $1,906. The pair has recorded higher lows since November 2022, with the $1,900-$2,000 level acting as technical and psychological resistance levels, according to the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout above $2,000 could quickly propel ETH toward the 2022 breakdown levels of around $3,000. The targets of the bullish ascending channel pattern also coincide around these levels.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is looking to establish support around the 2023 lows of 0.06255 in Bitcoin (BTC) terms. If sellers push the price below this level, bearish targets of 0.05689 BTC would get exposed.\n\nNevertheless, the relative strength index metric is showing oversold readings for the ETH/BTC pair, suggesting that a pullback is likely.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe funding rate for the ETH perpetual swap contract surged toward monthly highs, acting as a cautionary flag for late buyers.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF impulse fuels \u2018fantastic\u2019 $29K BTC price breakout\n\nPerpetual swap traders pay funding rates on their open short or long positions, depending on the demand for the asset. When the demand for short orders surpasses the demand for long orders, shorting becomes relatively more expensive, leading traders on the short side to pay longs.\n\nThere is a chance that the price pulls back toward the bottom of the ascending triangle pattern on the ETH/USD pair to around $1,680.\n\nFunding rate for ETH perpetual swap contracts. Source: CoinGlass\n\nNevertheless, on-chain movements and market indicators give the upside a higher chance over a short- to medium-term bearish trend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action and BTC buyers\u2019 ability to hold the $30,000 level will also play a crucial role in maintaining Ether\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss-owned cryptocurrency exchange Gemini continues to expand its services worldwide actively, debuting Ethereum staking in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn June 23, Gemini officially announced the expansion of Gemini Staking Pro in the United Kingdom. The service allows institutions and high-net-worth individuals to become Ethereum validators by locking up at least 32 Ether (ETH), worth around $60,000 at the time of writing.\n\nProvided by Gemini Trust Company, the institutional ETH staking program is immediately available on the Gemini web interface, the firm noted.\n\nAt launch, Gemini Staking Pro is the only staking product available in the United Kingdom. According to Gemini Support, the U.K. is the only country of Gemini\u2019s coverage where the platform runs institutional staking exclusively.\n\nThe Gemini Staking Pro service is currently live in the United States (excluding New York), Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil and more than 30 other countries.\n\nGemini\u2019s staking services are not regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the announcement said.\n\nGemini also mentioned that the platform will reimburse stakers for \u201ccertain penalties imposed in connection with staking.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018The Great Accumulation\u2019 of Bitcoin has begun, says Gemini\u2019s Winklevoss\n\nCiting challenges related to running a validator node, Gemini referred to \u201csmall mistakes\u201d that can lead to network-imposed penalties and even losing staked tokens, known as \u201cslashing.\u201d The firm promised to help stakers avoid this issue, stating:\n\n\u201cAt Gemini, we simplify the staking process for you. With Gemini operating the validator nodes, users can stake their assets with more confidence and without the technical know-hows.\u201d\n\nThe news comes amid Ethereum core developers planning to increase the maximum amount of Ether required to become a validator from 32 ETH to as much as 2,048 ETH, worth roughly $3.9 million at the time of writing. The minimum staking amount would remain at 32 ETH.\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, the U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini is currently facing a lawsuit from the U.S. States Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator believes that Gemini has violated securities regulations by offering unregistered securities as part of its lending platform known as Gemini Earn. Shortly after getting sued by the SEC, Gemini announced plans to expand into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Neon EVM is a low-friction solution that enables Ethereum dapps to settle transactions on Solana, eliminating the gap between these two leading blockchains.\n\nNeon EVM positions Ethereum developers to enjoy the best of Solana\u2019s network, from low fees to high transaction speeds and parallel transaction execution capabilities.\n\nWhile Solana is one of the fastest, organically-growing chains, its incompatibility with EVM has left several hundred million in TVL, millions of users, and an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain dApp developers \u2014 until now.\n\nYou might also like: USDT issuer freezes Ethereum address with over $4.1m\n\nNeon EVM\u2019s pioneering solution is the anticipated innovation in the Solana ecosystem. It makes Solana a viable option for multichain builders. Neon EVM brings together the best of both chains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM closed beta?\n\nThe launch of the closed beta version of Neon EVM, Neon EVM\u03b2, to Solana\u2019s Mainnet, is a significant milestone on the roadmap.\n\nNeon EVM\u03b2 is a fully-functioning Neon EVM with one major alteration: it supports fee-free transactions.\n\nThis means all transactions are settled to Solana\u2019s layer-1 and require payment in SOL, as per any Solana-settled transaction.\n\nHowever, in beta, the NEON token is not requested by the Proxy Operator responsible for accepting the transaction request and ensuring that it is finalized.\n\nWhy launch in beta?\n\nThe Neon EVM ecosystem includes many more players than just the Neon EVM and the Proxy Operators that accept and settle transaction requests. It includes DAO, oracles, indexers, wallets, multisigs, bridges, explorers, and more. Neon EVM\u03b2 allows all parties to deploy and test to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana Mainnet launch.\n\nWhile Neon EVM could have chosen to do a Shadow Mainnet launch on a fork of the Solana mainchain, launching directly to Mainnet offers significant advantages. Not least, deployed and tested contracts will retain their addresses on Solana Mainnet.\n\nWhy launch in closed beta?\n\nLaunching in closed beta allows the Neon EVM team to onboard and test the services of ecosystem players in controlled phases. The first phase onboarded the infrastructure components, and the second phase accepted dapps and tested the connection of wallets.\n\nOperating in closed beta also controls the budget by limiting the activity to an invite-only list. Remember, while the Proxy Operator is not charging a fee, the Solana network still does. It is impossible to provide an open beta and predict the cost in SOL for such an initiative (though it is possible to expect that the SOL cost will be less than the equivalent ethereum (ETH) cost for an EVM settling to Ethereum). SOL is the native currency of Solana.\n\nWhen the testing period ends and NEON tokens are available on the market to pay for transactions, Neon EVM will switch back to its normal operation mode. This means that independent Proxy Operators (P2P and Everstake) will resume responsibility for accepting and processing transactions. The Proxy Operator\u2019s RPC endpoints will be made available on ChainList.\n\nWant to get involved?\n\nWhile Neon EVM is deployed to Solana Mainnet at address NeonVMyRX5GbCrsAHnUwx1nYYoJAtskU1bWUo6JGNyG, as this is a closed beta, unless you are on the guest list, it won\u2019t accept your transactions yet.\n\nYou can find us on Twitter to engage with the community and join Neon EVM\u2019s active Discord to meet some of our long-term and loyal community builders.\n\nFor a high-level overview of Neon EVM\u2019s technical architecture and features, the whitepaper is available at NeonEVM.org/whitepaper.pdf.\n\nTo follow the network activity, you can view Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana with the NeonScan dashboard.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "InQubeta (QUBE) Price To Increase 20x As Binance Coin (BNB) And Ethereum (ETH) Battles The Bear Market - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving crypto space, new projects are rising up every day. However, only a few have lived up to their promises and InQubeta (QUBE) is one of them. Experts believe that InQubeta (QUBE) has the potential to rival the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) in the coming months. Let us look at some features that InQubeta has to offer and why you should invest in it.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The First Crypto Crowdfunding Platform To Embrace Blockchain Technology\n\nInQubeta is now a major attraction in the crypto space attracting investors from all over the crypto ecosystem. It is the first crypto crowdfunding platform and has introduced the deflationary QUBE token which experts believe will soar 20x when it launches.\n\nThe project\u2019s primary objective is to revolutionize AI startup fundraising and community engagement using blockchain technology. The platform has developed a fractional investment system that allows investors to acquire partial ownership of promising AI startups from anywhere in the world. Through NFTs and fractionalization, individuals can invest with little capital.\n\nThis approach democratizes the investment landscape, empowering both low and high-income individuals to invest in AI startup funding. The platform has an NFT marketplace where AI startups can mint investment opportunities, list them for other QUBE token holders to invest in, and earn rewards as they flourish.\n\nAdditionally, the QUBE token has several benefits like voting rights and staking rewards. InQubeta\u2019s presale phase has attracted a wide audience, raising over $500,000 in just a few weeks and selling approximately 45% of the allocated QUBE tokens during its stage 1 for $0.00875 per QUBE. Binance Coin (BNB) Losses Continue\n\nRecently, the price of Binance Coin has dropped significantly from its position above $280. The lawsuit filed by the SEC against Binance has affected the token\u2019s price and has also exerted bearish pressure on top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter soaring to $352 a few weeks ago, the price of Binance Coin underwent a sharp correction breaching the crucial support levels at $280 and $250 and eventually testing the significant support zone at $220. Over the last few weeks, BNB has been trading below the 100-day simple moving average around the $220 \u2013 $250 zone.\n\nDespite recording marginal price increase since the second week of June, Binance Coin (BNB) has failed to break out of the $220 \u2013 $250 trading zone, and fails to surpass the resistance at $250, there is a possibility of further downward movement. The initial support level to watch out for on the downside is around $220.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Fails To Surpass $1,780 Resistance\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been bullish since the start of 2023, but suffered a sharp decline in June after being caught in regulatory webs. The decline saw Ethereum (ETH) trade under $1,700 for the first time since March, but the number one altcoin has since recovered.\n\nDespite the rally, Ethereum has failed to break above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels despite multiple attempts. The altcoin is currently having difficulties surpassing the $1,800 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe lack of momentum has kept ETH trading between the $1,600 and $1,800 range for weeks now. If Ethereum fails to overcome the immediate resistance at $1,755 in the coming weeks, crypto analysts expect more price decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Binance Coin and Ethereum have garnered attention in the crypto space for a long time, newcomers like InQubeta are taking things a step further using nascent technologies. Analysts have even forecasted a potential 20x surge as the QUBE token continues to gain traction and widespread adoption, propelled by its innovative approach and robust technology. Early investors can capitalize on the potential 20x rise by investing in InQubeta today.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "USDT freezes $4.1m in Ethereum addresses: Is decentralization the way forward over centralization? - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT, has recently frozen an account with over $4.1 million, as shown by on-chain explorers. This once again raises the question of whether centralization, with its concentration of power, is the ideal path forward or if decentralized projects like Tradecurve are essential for the survival of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nNo explanation for $4.1 million freeze of USDT\n\nOn June 19th, Tether froze $4.11 million of USDT without providing any further comment on the action. The analytics platform Etherscan marks the USDT wallet as frozen.\n\nA Reddit user traced the frozen account back to a Huobi user, and on-chain data indicates that the USDT was funneled into the wallet in March 2023. There is ongoing speculation that the owner of the account may be involved in illegal activities, which appears to have prompted Tether to actively freeze the holdings in the address.\n\nTether Holdings Limited acts as a centralized entity and manages over $83.1 billion worth of USDT in circulating supply. Each USDT token on any blockchain is issued and backed 1:1 with cash or cash equivalents.\n\nTether and USDT play an essential role in the cryptocurrency market but face concerns regarding centralization, which are further highlighted by the issuer's ability to freeze assets. This stands in contrast to the core principles of blockchain technology, which is inherently borderless and decentralized.\n\nCritics on social media are raising their voices, pointing out that Tether Holdings Limited behaves like a bank by freezing the address. A Reddit user highlighted the fact that Tether has integrated a \"kill switch\" in the token's code that can potentially be triggered at any point to block an address. This carries a certain risk for the overall market and the financial system.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand and evolve, it remains to be seen to what extent USDT can achieve decentralization in its final state.\n\nOn the other hand, Tradecurve aims to revolutionize the trading industry by offering a decentralized hybrid exchange.\n\nTradecurve.io: Decentralized trading\n\nTradecurve represents the next step in decentralized trading. By combining the worlds of decentralized and centralized exchanges, it provides access to thousands of financial instruments across multiple international markets. Users can leverage their cryptocurrency to trade commodities, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.\n\nTradecurve users enjoy complete anonymity without the need for KYC procedures, making trading accessible to everyone and facilitating easy onboarding to a wide range of markets and instruments. Tradecurve offers various advantages, such as AI-driven algorithmic trading, 500:1 leverage, a VIP account service for whales, copy trading, and a Metaverse Trading Academy, which provides all the necessary materials for self-education.\n\nThe TCRV token is currently priced at $0.018 in the 4th stage of the official presale, and analysts predict a 100x return when the presale ends.\n\nFor more information about $TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "How A Truly Decentralized Ethereum Ensures the Security and Integrity of the Network - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has gained significant attention and popularity since its launch in 2015. Vitalik Buterin created it to provide a more versatile and programmable blockchain system than Bitcoin. One of the core principles of Ethereum is decentralization, which means it operates without a central authority or governing body controlling the network.\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum\u2019s decentralization is its blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records all transactions and smart contracts executed on the platform. Instead of relying on a single entity or server to validate and store information, Ethereum utilizes a network of thousands of computer nodes participating in the consensus mechanism.\n\nThe consensus mechanism Ethereum uses is called Proof of Stake (PoS), designed to ensure the security and integrity of the network. In PoS, participants must hold and \u201cstake\u201d a certain amount of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks. Doing this helps eliminate the need for energy-intensive mining, as seen in Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work system, making Ethereum more energy-efficient.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s decentralization extends beyond its consensus mechanism. It also allows anyone to develop and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions, enable developers to create decentralized applications for various purposes, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These applications run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a decentralized computing system that executes smart contracts across the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature is a fundamental characteristic that sets it apart from traditional centralized systems. Its reliance on a distributed network of nodes, PoS consensus mechanism, and support for decentralized application development all contribute to its vision of a trustless, transparent, and censorship-resistant platform.\n\nUnderstanding decentralization Ethereum\n\nDecentralization is a critical concept in cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum is one of the most prominent platforms that embodies this principle. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nAt its core, decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network rather than being concentrated in a central authority. In the Ethereum context, the platform operates on a peer-to-peer network where multiple participants, known as nodes, validate and record transactions on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike traditional centralized systems, where a single entity or authority controls the network, Ethereum relies on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake to achieve decentralization. In a PoS system, participants, known as validators, are chosen to create new blocks and secure the network based on the number of cryptocurrency tokens they hold, thus willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. This mechanism ensures that no single entity can control the network, as the power to validate transactions and create new blocks remains distributed among multiple validators.\n\nDecentralization on Ethereum extends beyond the validation process. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules encoded on the blockchain, are a fundamental feature of Ethereum.\n\nThese contracts are executed in a decentralized manner, meaning they automatically enforce the agreed-upon terms without the need for intermediaries. It eliminates the need for trust in third parties and opens up many possibilities for applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more.\n\nThe decentralized nature of Ethereum provides several advantages. First, it enhances security by eliminating single points of failure. Since the blockchain remains distributed across multiple nodes, it becomes highly resistant to censorship, manipulation, and cyberattacks. Additionally, decentralization promotes transparency, as all transactions and smart contract interactions are recorded on the public blockchain, making them verifiable by anyone.\n\nFurthermore, decentralization fosters innovation and empowers individuals. Anyone can participate in the Ethereum network as a developer, user, or validator, without requiring permission or approval from a central authority. Again, it helps lower entry barriers and encourages a diverse ecosystem of applications and services.\n\nHowever, decentralization also poses challenges. As the number of participants in the network grows, scalability becomes a concern. Ethereum has been upgrading its infrastructure, transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more scalable and energy-efficient PoS mechanism, Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade addresses scalability limitations and further enhances the network\u2019s decentralization.\n\nEthereum enables a new paradigm of trustless, permissionless, and innovative applications by distributing control, eliminating intermediaries, and promoting transparency. As the platform continues to evolve, it strives to achieve greater decentralization and scalability, paving the way for a more inclusive and decentralized future.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, offers several benefits that have contributed to its popularity and widespread adoption. Here are some of the key benefits of Ethereum:\n\nSmart contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks or lawyers, and enable automated and trustless execution of transactions.\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of computers, known as nodes, which are spread across the globe. This decentralization makes Ethereum resistant to censorship, single points of failure, and control by any central authority. It provides a transparent and open platform for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nProgrammability: Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is programmable, allowing developers to create and deploy their applications on the network. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enables developers to write smart contracts and build decentralized applications using programming languages like Solidity. This programmability fosters innovation and enables a wide range of use cases.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum\u2019s design allows for interoperability with other blockchain projects and tokens. Through standardized token protocols like ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens), Ethereum has become a hub for creating and exchanging digital assets. This interoperability promotes integrating blockchain-based projects and facilitates liquidity and compatibility between tokens.\n\nTokenization and fundraising: Ethereum has revolutionized fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales. These mechanisms allow startups and projects to raise capital by issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, liquidity, and new models of investment and fundraising, opening up opportunities for innovative projects and democratizing access to investment opportunities.\n\nCommunity and ecosystem: Ethereum has a large and vibrant community of developers, enthusiasts, and contributors. This active community fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the continuous development of the platform. Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem includes various tools, frameworks, and libraries that simplify dApp development, making it easier for developers to build on the forum.\n\nUpgrades and scalability solutions: Ethereum is continuously evolving to address its scalability challenges. Ethereum 2.0, a significant upgrade currently underway, aims to transition the network from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake mechanism, enhancing scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-rollups, provide off-chain scaling while leveraging Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance structure\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance structure was primarily decentralized, with decision-making power distributed among various stakeholders within the Ethereum community. However, it\u2019s important to note that the Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, and there may have been changes or developments in its governance structure since then.\n\nThe core of Ethereum\u2019s governance is the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. EIPs are proposals for making changes or improvements to the Ethereum protocol. Anyone can submit an EIP, and the Ethereum community, including developers, miners, and users, can discuss and provide feedback on the proposals.\n\nThe decision-making process for accepting or rejecting an EIP is typically based on rough consensus, meaning that broad agreement and community support are sought before implementing any changes. The Ethereum community achieves harmony through discussions on various platforms, including forums, social media channels, and developer conferences.\n\nAnother critical element in Ethereum\u2019s governance structure is the role of core developers. These individuals or teams are responsible for maintaining and developing the Ethereum software. Core developers have significant influence in the decision-making process as they propose and implement changes to the protocol.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s governance is not solely reliant on core developers. The Ethereum community, including users and miners, also plays a crucial role in shaping the platform\u2019s direction. Major decisions like upgrades or hard forks often involve community-wide participation and signaling through rough consensus.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Ethereum has been working towards a more formalized governance structure. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, includes plans for a dedicated governance mechanism called the Ethereum DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The Ethereum DAO is intended to provide a more structured and decentralized governance framework for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNode distribution and mining are integral parts of the Ethereum network. Here\u2019s an overview of these concepts:\n\nNode distribution\n\nEthereum relies on a network of nodes to maintain the blockchain and ensure its decentralized nature. Nodes are computers or devices running Ethereum software that participate in the network by validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and storing a copy of the blockchain.\n\nNode distribution in Ethereum can remain categorized into the following types:\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes store and validate the entire Ethereum blockchain. They participate in the consensus process and perform all necessary computations, making them resource-intensive. Full nodes contribute to the security and integrity of the network.\n\nArchive Nodes: Archive nodes go beyond full nodes by storing the blockchain\u2019s current state and the network\u2019s entire history. These nodes provide access to historical data, enabling developers to explore past transactions and smart contract states.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes, known as \u201clight clients,\u201d do not store the entire blockchain. Instead, they rely on full nodes to access specific data when needed. Light nodes offer fewer resource requirements and faster synchronization times but with fewer security guarantees than full nodes.\n\nPruned Nodes: Pruned nodes store a subset of the blockchain, usually limited to recent blocks. They discard older block data, which helps reduce storage requirements while still participating in the network.\n\nStaking\n\nThe concept of Ethereum staking refers to the process of participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network has transitioned from proof-of-work (PoW) model, which relies on mining, to a PoS model, which relies on staking.\n\nStaking involves holding a certain amount of Ether (ETH) in a specialized wallet known as a staking wallet or validator node. Validators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks in the Ethereum blockchain. By staking ETH, participants contribute to the network\u2019s security and decentralization.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key elements in Ethereum staking:\n\nValidators: These are participants who lock up a minimum required amount of ETH as a stake to become validators. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the amount of ETH they hold.\n\nStaking Rewards: Validators earn staking rewards for their participation in block validation. The rewards are distributed in the form of additional ETH, encouraging validators to act honestly and follow the protocol rules. However, validators may also face penalties for malicious behavior or network rule violations.\n\nSlashing: Slashing is the penalty imposed on validators for violating the network\u2019s rules. It can occur if a validator attempts to manipulate the system or behaves dishonestly. Slashing may result in a partial or complete loss of the validator\u2019s staked ETH.\n\nStaking Pools: Staking pools, also known as staking services or staking providers, allow individuals to participate in staking without needing to run their own validator node. Participants pool their ETH together, and the staking pool operator manages the technical aspects of staking on behalf of the participants. Rewards are distributed proportionally to each participant\u2019s stake in the pool, minus any fees charged by the operator.\n\nChallenges to decentralization in Ethereum\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to distribute power and control among its participants. While Ethereum has made significant progress toward decentralization, several challenges still need to be addressed. Here are some of the critical challenges to decentralization in Ethereum:\n\nScalability: One of the primary challenges for Ethereum is scalability. As the network grows and more users participate, the blockchain faces congestion and slower transaction processing times. This issue is particularly evident during periods of high demand, such as during popular decentralized applications (dApps) or token sales. Scalability solutions like Ethereum 2.0\u2019s implementation of shard chains and the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism aim to address this challenge.\n\nCentralization of Mining Power: Currently, Ethereum relies on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Centralization of power has led to the concentration of mining power in a few large mining pools, creating centralization concerns. Ethereum\u2019s planned transition to PoS through Ethereum 2.0 aims to address this challenge by allowing token holders to become validators, reducing the reliance on specialized mining hardware.\n\nGovernance and Decision-Making: As Ethereum evolves and grows, making decisions about protocol upgrades, changes, and improvements becomes increasingly challenging. The Ethereum community follows a decentralized governance model, where stakeholders participate in discussions and signaling processes. However, achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders with varying interests can take time and effort. The Ethereum community actively explores various governance models, such as on-chain voting and delegated governance, to improve decision-making processes.\n\nUser Experience: Another challenge to decentralization in Ethereum is the user experience. Interacting with decentralized applications often requires specific technical knowledge and can be daunting for non-technical users. Improving the user experience and creating intuitive interfaces that abstract away the complexities of blockchain technology remains crucial to increasing user adoption and decentralization.\n\nRegulatory Challenges: The decentralized nature of Ethereum can sometimes clash with regulatory requirements and frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still grappling with addressing decentralized technologies like Ethereum, which can present challenges regarding compliance and legal frameworks. Striking the right balance between regulatory compliance and preserving the decentralized nature of Ethereum is an ongoing challenge.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collective effort from the Ethereum community, developers, and stakeholders. Ethereum 2.0\u2019s phased rollout addresses scalability and mining centralization concerns, while ongoing research and development in governance models and user experience improvements can further enhance decentralization. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for Ethereum to maintain its position as a leading decentralized blockchain platform and foster its long-term sustainability and growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature is a subject of ongoing debate within the blockchain community. While Ethereum has made significant strides toward decentralization through its governance structure, node distribution, and active community participation, challenges remain.\n\nThe distribution of network nodes and the involvement of individual miners across the globe contribute to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization. However, concerns about the concentration of mining power and the rise of large mining pools pose challenges to maintaining a fully decentralized network.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum\u2019s commitment to ongoing development and the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0 demonstrates its dedication to enhancing decentralization. Introducing PoS and other scalability solutions aims to address these challenges and further distribute decision-making power among participants.\n\nWhile Ethereum has its challenges, it remains one of the most decentralized blockchain platforms. Its governance structure, community involvement, and active development efforts illustrate Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized network that fosters innovation, transparency, and trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction by ChatGPT and Promising Tokens That Could Experience Bullish Trends - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement in the last 7 days has stirred the crypto market, raising several predictions for the crypto by both technical analysts and artificial intelligence, ChatGPT.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Ethereum\u2019s market price was $1,650.50. However, the strong bullish momentum on its price sent it to $1,716.67 by June 17.\n\nAlthough the crypto had traded within the $1700 level in the last four days, recording $1,727.19 on June 18 and $1,792 on June 21, Ethereum has reached a new price level today, June 23.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,878.40, with a 0.77% price difference compared to its last price on the historical data (June 22).\n\nConsidering the recent bullish signals of this cryptocurrency, many crypto enthusiasts may rely on the correlating price prediction of experts and AI tools like ChatGPT, hoping it could reach the $2000 mark before 2023 ends. As such, here\u2019s a price prediction for Ethereum in the short and long-term by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT Price Prediction for Ethereum 2023\n\nThe OpenAI product, ChatGPT, is an artificial intelligence model that has experienced an exponential growth level since its release. Its diverse utility includes information research and prediction.\n\nChatGPT is not a 100% prediction tool, especially for digital currencies and some other digital assets. However, its predictions can provide investors and crypto enthusiasts with a higher viewpoint concerning the outlook of crypto.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, ChatGPT predicts Ethereum in the bullish market to trade between the values of $16,391 and $18,213 by the end of 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, the bearish outlooks of ChatGPT\u2019s prediction showcased Ethereum to experience potential price dips to $2000 or further to $1,000 also by the end of 2023.\n\nSince ChatGPT\u2019s prediction for Ethereum by the end of the year is not definitive, the technical analysis of the crypto on Tradingview could hint at what to expect in the nearest future.\n\nEthereum Short and Long-Term Price Outlook Based on Technical Indicators\n\nThe technical indicators on the crypto analytics platform, Tradingview, signal bullish trends for Ethereum in the short and long term.\n\nETH\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator is above the signal line, confirming the strong bullish momentum of the crypto\u2019s price. Considering the bold green bar on the histogram, ETH is likely to uphold its green candlestick throughout today.\n\nAlso, the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are below Ethereum\u2019s current price, indicating the asset\u2019s short and long-term bullish market.\n\nAs such, ETH is prone to prolong green days in the coming days to weeks, tipping at the possibility of the crypto reaching $1900 in the next few weeks.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows a neutral market position of Ethereum, sitting at 59.01.

        "title": "Who is the Founder of Ethereum? ETH Crypto - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Launched after Bitcoin, Ethereum has retained its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency both in market cap and trading volume. The token remains one of the biggest inventions in the crypto market with unprecedented market impact.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is meant to only work as a cryptocurrency, Ethereum comes with a diverse computing and infrastructural design to work as a cryptocurrency and also support the development of other decentralised applications (Dapps). The effectiveness of Ethereum has made it successful in various use cases like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralised finances (DeFi).\n\nWith the token becoming more integral, it\u2019s only natural to wonder who created Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin and the creation of Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, 19 years by then, conceived the idea of Ethereum in 2013. He was looking to expand the reach of blockchain technology by developing a platform that supported the development of Dapps. By then, he was working on various Bitcoin projects.\n\nButerin had first heard about Bitcoin in 2017 from his father. He, however, downplayed the possibility of Bitcoin becoming successful. He later had a chance second interaction with the token and understood how it would impact the financial landscape. Having no financial or computing capacity to mine Bitcoin, he opted to work and get paid in the currency. He would contribute to various online Bitcoin sites then get paid in BTC. He later teamed with Mihai Alisie, to create Bitcoin Magazine in 2011.\n\nThe magazine allowed him to gain much information about Bitcoin. He started analysing Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology while creating various projects on the codebase like Coloured Coins, Mastercoin, and other altcoins. These projects led him to realise how Bitcoin\u2019s scope was limited.\n\nWithin the two years in Bitcoin, Buterin had interacted with several crypto enthusiasts. These excerpts were working on ways to expand the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s functionality. It, however, became apparent that the only way to have a limitless platform is to create a new network.\n\nThe realisation led to the idea of Ethereum. Buterin started working on the project and within four weeks he had completed the Ethereum whitepaper. He released the document in November 2013 to become the founder of Ethereum. The document detailed a new open-source platform for developing decentralised applications.\n\nThe idea was a hit among various cryptocurrency enthusiasts, with various joining the project. Some of the renowned names that started working on the project include; Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Lorio, Amir Chetrit, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood.\n\nEthereum was officially launched in 2014 on the Bitcointalks forums. The Ethereum foundation held the most successful crowd sale at the time, in July 2014 selling over 60 million Ether. 12 million of the tokens were set aside for the platform\u2019s development and marketing. It then released a barebone platform after a year for developers to start utilizing to create decentralised applications.\n\nThe Ethereum network and community have since grown to be an integral part of the crypto market.\n\nWhat is Vitalik Buterin Networth?\n\nGiven the success of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth has increased over the years. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Buterin is worth over $1Billion. He holds around 335,000 Ether, whose value changes with the market value of ETH. He also has substantial amounts of SHIB and Rugging, both altcoins."
