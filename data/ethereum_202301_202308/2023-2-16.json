        "content": "What Is Ethereum Proof-of-Stake?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Ethereum officially switched to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022 as a more secure and energy-efficient way to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Consensus mechanisms like PoS are integral to a network\u2019s security. It is a complex system, and to make informed decisions it is important to gain an understanding of the underlying system.\n\n\n\n\u2014 In this article, we aim to demystify the complex concepts behind Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus algorithm to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding to our readers.\n\nProof of stake (PoS) is the underlying mechanism for Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm. For those unversed about this change, in 2022, Ethereum officially switched to the PoS mechanism, which is believed to be less energy-intensive and provides a platform for implementing new scaling solutions.\n\nIn this article, Ledger Academy will help you understand the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus algorithm in a simple yet concise manner, so let\u2019s start!\n\nWhat Is Proof of Stake (PoS)?\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism that is used to secure blockchain networks. Consensus mechanisms are the backbone of all blockchains, as the underlying rules that determine how a network functions.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nLet\u2019s start by understanding the idea of consensus. Generally speaking, consensus is a process used to reach an agreement among a group of people.\n\nIn terms of blockchain, the consensus is the process by which a group of nodes on a network determines which blockchain transactions are valid. A consensus mechanism is the methodology to achieve this agreement.\n\nSo, a blockchain is a digital ledger of distributed, decentralized, and often public transactions. Each transaction on a blockchain is recorded as a \u2018block\u2019 of data and must be verified by peer-to-peer computer networks before being added to the chain. This system helps secure the blockchain against fraudulent activity and double-spending.\n\nThere are many types of consensus mechanisms. Each work in different ways but have one purpose: to ensure that transaction records on a blockchain are true and honest. Proof of Stake (PoS) is one of the most popular consensus mechanisms.\n\nPoS Consensus Mechanism\n\nA Proof of Stake (PoS) network is a system that uses staked cryptocurrency to secure itself. Every validator node must have \u201clocked up\u201d a security deposit consisting of ETH on the network in order to participate in consensus. By using the crypto as collateral, it compels the nodes to behave properly and helps to keep the network secure.\n\nWhat Is a Validator?\n\nA validator node is a vital part of a blockchain network. It is responsible for participating in the consensus-building process of a Proof of Stake blockchain. Validator nodes vote on the authenticity of a new block of transactions, thus communally ensuring new blocks are valid before permanently adding them to the blockchain. Meanwhile, one specific node is selected as the \u201cblock proposer\u201d for the current time slot. This node is responsible for building the new block of transactions and broadcasting it to the other nodes to be verified.\n\nHow Are New Blocks Verified?\n\nEach validator node has the same copy of the blockchain\u2019s history. Using this common history, they assess whether new blocks of transactions are valid. Then vote on this point as a group before adding them to the main chain.\n\nHow does the Ethereum Network select Validators?\n\nThe validator selection in Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) system is based on a validator\u2019s stake in the network. To explain, the greater the stake, the more likely that node will be selected to add the new block to the chain.\n\nEthereum Staking Requirements\n\nIn the Ethereum PoS system, each validator must stake the network\u2019s native tokens (in this case, 32 ETH). The requirement to stake ETH incentivizes validators to act in the network\u2019s best interests. This because validators stand to lose their investment if they try to subvert the system, or fail to validate reliably and effectively.\n\nThrough the Ledger Live app, you can easily and securely stake Ethereum coins to a validator and start earning ETH rewards, passively.\n\nWhat Is Finality?\n\nFinality is the time it takes to protect a transaction on the blockchain. Finality guarantees that a particular block in the blockchain cannot be changed or reversed. The transactions within the block are therefore immutable.\n\nEven after a transaction is confirmed as part of the most recent block, it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be changed or undone. For a short period that follows, a transaction may be vulnerable to attacks from bad actors who try to exploit weak points in the blockchain.\n\nBlock Finality Under Ethereum Proof of Stake\n\nUnder Proof of Stake (PoS), Ethereum uses \u201ccheckpoint\u201d blocks to manage validator votes. The first block of each epoch (a period of 32 slots where the validators propose and attest for blocks and is of 6.4 minutes) is a checkpoint.\n\nAs well as voting for the validity of individual blocks, validators subsequently vote for whole checkpoints. If the checkpoint receives votes from at least two-thirds of the total staked ETH, it is upgraded. The most recent checkpoint then becomes \u201cjustified.\u201d The earlier checkpoint, which is already justified because it was the target in the previous epoch, is now upgraded to \u201cfinalized.\u201d\n\nIf an attacker wants to revert a finalized block, they would therefore have to be willing to lose at least one-third of all the ETH that\u2019s been staked.\n\nWhat Is Slashing?\n\nSlashing is a disciplinary system used by PoS protocols to penalize validators for any harmful or irresponsible behaviors. This usually involves the network deducting some of their security deposit (their initial staked coins).\n\nTo understand it further, let\u2019s take a look at some of the key elements of slashing:\n\nIncentivizing Validators\n\nIn the Ethereum PoS system, the sum of crypto staked by validator nodes (32 ETH) acts as a security deposit. Since the amount can be \u201cslashed\u201d by the network (if a validator fails to behave appropriately) validator nodes have a vested interest in behaving in a way that benefits the blockchain.\n\nDeterring Downtime\n\nOne of the most common behaviors that lead to slashing is downtime. The term \u201cdowntime\u201d refers to the period of time during which a validator is offline and unable to produce new blocks. This can be due to network delays, software issues, or hardware problems.\n\nWhen a validator is down, they cannot participate in the consensus process. Since this is detrimental to the overall functioning of the network, it is penalized by the network via slashing.\n\nHow Proof of Stake (PoS) Differs from Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nBoth PoW and PoS are types of consensus mechanisms that allow cryptocurrency networks to operate with no central governing authority. But they achieve this in different ways and have varying degrees of security and reliability.\n\nProof of Work: Security via Energy Consumption\n\nWith Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, a new block can only be added if the block hash is calculated via an incredibly complex equation. It can take trillions of guesses before that value is randomly discovered by a miner. Which can consume a lot of power. Only the miner who achieves this first will confirm the block and be rewarded. In this system, energy is the resource the network uses to secure itself. The huge amount of energy required to overcome the blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism is a key deterrent for bad actors.\n\nProof of Stake: Security via Staked Coins\n\nA proof-of-stake network like Ethereum secures itself via staked cryptocurrency. Instead of expending computing energy to solve a puzzle, the nodes validating new transactions stake their own value as collateral. These nodes then run efficiently and honestly to avoid losing that collateral.\n\nMeanwhile, any bad actor wishing to gain control over the network would need to own more than 51% of the coins staked at that time. Controlling 51% of all staked coins on the network is so difficult that it makes such an attack extremely unlikely. This is how the consensus mechanism that secures Proof of Stake networks works.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake\n\nWith the recent Merge now complete after years of work, Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake is now active. But the process as a whole is not complete, so its full impact is still not seen. Ethereum 2.0 is still yet to arrive.\n\nAt the time of writing, staked ETH and staking rewards are yet to be unlocked. Moreover, we are yet to see the implementation of some major new scalability options, such as sharding. Only time will tell exactly how secure the network is under this new consensus mechanism.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus mechanism will help you make informed decisions about interacting with the blockchain. Knowledge is power, and Ledger Academy is here to act as your guide. Unraveling the complex yet powerful consensus mechanism securing the behemoth blockchain that is Ethereum.\n\nKnowledge is Power."

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade? The Ethereum blockchain went through an upgrade termed \u201cthe Merge\u201d in September 2022 that changed the consensus mechanism of the chain. Another upgrade to the chain termed the \u201cShanghai\u201d is expected around mid-March and may have economic implications across the board. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is also called the \u201cEthereum Shanghai fork.\u201d As part of this upgrade, there are five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that are expected to be rolled out. EIP-4895 is perhaps going to be the one grabbing all the headlines, as it will unlock staked Ether (ETH) and allow withdrawals. Through the Merge that happened in September 2022, the consensus mechanism of the blockchain moved from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). In doing so, the governance of the chain moved away from a resource-intensive mechanism and became more environmentally, socially and governance (ESG) friendly. While PoS might be more environmentally friendly, it relies on a staking process. ETH holders had to stake at least 32 ETH to participate in the consensus mechanism. They earn a staking yield that is currently just over 5%. As 32 ETH is around $52,000 at present, it is unfeasible for smaller investors to participate. However, platforms such as Lido and Coinbase offer staking facilities to users even for smaller Ether holdings and charge them a fee on their staking income. The staked Ether has been locked for about two years or since the staking market emerged. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade allows users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. As a result, the Ethereum community is eagerly waiting to unlock their Ethereum post-upgrade.\n\nWhat does the Shanghai fork mean for Ethereum stakeholders? The Ethereum blockchain went live on July 30, 2015, and only had the Bitcoin blockchain to draw inspiration from. As a result, it still suffers from several suboptimal features from which subsequent blockchains have learned and implemented better. Can the upgrade help with addressing these pain points? Historically, Ethereum has suffered from slow transactions and high transaction fees. This has especially been noticeable since the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom increased the transaction value locked (TVL) on the chain. The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the craze to mint NFTs through 2021 and early 2022 has added to bad user experiences and high gas fees. Apart from EIP-4895, which is largely focused on Ethereum stakers, EIP-3855 and EIP-3860 are expected to be shipped as part of the upgrade. EIP-3855 should help with transaction speeds, and EIP-3860 hopes to reduce transaction costs. These improvements should help improve network usage across DeFi and NFTs, as some of these ecosystems were affected by high gas fees and slow transactions. Projects had moved to other chains, such as Solana or Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon, due to these issues. These projects and newer ones consider Ethereum more favorably with these upgrades. More flexible staking, better performance and a rise in ecosystem stakeholders could amplify the resulting network effect and help the chain in the long run.\n\nHow will the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade affect ETH traders? Most blockchain upgrades have an impact on price action. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade would be no different. Ether supplies on exchanges have already started to plunge as investors choose to move their assets to self-custody. The previous Ethereum upgrade created good volatility in the market, which traders tapped into. ETH prices skyrocketed from around $1,000 in July 2022 to over $2,000 in August and reached about $1,800 just around the time of the Merge. With exchange supplies of Ether plummeting fast, traders may see yet another spike in price leading to the Shanghai upgrade. However, short-term traders might want to note the fall in Ether\u2019s price since the Merge was pushed in 2022. This upgrade may not be too different. The other factor to keep in mind is that Ethereum users who haven\u2019t been able to withdraw their staked Ether for over two years will have access to do so right after the Shanghai upgrade. With over 16.4 million ETH staked, if some of that hits the market, it could increase the supply of Ether and bring prices down right after the Shanghai upgrade is complete. This relationship between supply and demand is a fundamental principle of economics and is a key factor in determining the price of any asset, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds and commodities. It\u2019s also worth noting that, although downside risks for price action exist after the Shanghai update due to staking withdrawals, ETH withdrawals will only be available in small chunks. For instance, traders who want to withdraw their Ether after the upgrade will only be able to do so in stages over time. This might mitigate downside risks to Ether prices. But the fear of increased supply is something that could hurt market sentiment in the short term.\n\nHow will the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade affect ETH users? Ethereum has long suffered from poor user experiences due to transaction inefficiencies and high costs. Some of these user experiences should improve with the Shanghai upgrade. As several Ethereum use cases have emerged since the 2018 bear market, the TVLs and usage of the chain have increased exponentially, resulting in network effects. The chain wasn\u2019t engineered for this explosive growth and has struggled with high gas fees and slow transactions. As a result, Ethereum has often been tagged as the \u201crich people\u2019s chain.\u201d The minting of Yuga labs\u2019 \u201cThe Otherside\u201d was one such event when gas fees as high as 2.5 ETH were paid to get the NFTs. Such expensive affairs are non-existent in next-generation blockchains, such as Solana, where the user experience and low transaction fees have helped draw a large user base. Ethereum could be the chain of choice for all users if it solved the gas fee issue. Many gaming projects had moved off of Ethereum onto Solana, Polygon and Immutable X, as gaming had to support micro-transactions. Ethereum must become more efficient, fast and scalable to attract these kinds of projects. Sharding is one feature that Ethereum has in its pipeline, which is similar to parallel processing in traditional computing terms. The Shanghai upgrade is a stepping stone toward achieving sharding later in 2023. As transaction speeds increase and costs lower in due course, Ethereum will have more exciting applications for its user base and will be able to accommodate more than just wealthy users.\n\nWhat does the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade mean for investors? Investors generally tend to take a longer-term view of an asset than traders. As a result, they focus more on fundamentals than short-term price action and technical indicators. On that note, the Shanghai upgrade improves the fundamentals of the chain and should be viewed favorably by investors. Ethereum has the ability to lead the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. The Merge was the first step in that direction, as checking the ESG box could bring in more institutional capital onto Ethereum and, eventually, into the broader crypto ecosystem. Also, the ability for institutional investors to participate in staking and earn a yield resembles fixed financial instruments \u2014 e.g., bonds \u2014 in capital markets. As Ether becomes the blue-chip asset of the cryptocurrency market, the staking yields from Ether could be synonymous with the risk-free rate that traditional capital markets often use to price their assets. As a result, staking rewards from other chains and DeFi applications native to Ethereum must at least match \u2014 but, ideally, exceed \u2014 Ethereum staking yields. Therefore, the Ethereum upgrade is likely going to have economic model implications as other chains and applications design their product and service offerings. With the fundamentals of Ethereum improving through the Merge, the Shanghai upgrade and the introduction of sharding in 2023, retail and institutional investors will want to be part of the Ethereum ecosystem growth story."

        "title": "Ethereum Merge : Understanding the Merge Made Easy ! - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum completed its long-awaited merge in mid-September last year. The \u2018Ethereum Merge\u2019, which was completed in about 15 minutes, helped the network switch its consensus method from one that utilizes proof of work to one that employs proof of stake. The shift also brought dozens of blockchain projects it supports on the new consensus method.\n\nCryptocurrency brokerage Caleb & Brown\u2019s COO Jake Boyle had weighed that the Merge is the most major Ethereum upgrade and most talked about event in the crypto community since it totally reshapes how Ethereum runs.\n\nHe went on to add that the switch considerably lowers energy consumption, provides improved crypto economic security, and makes it easier for anybody to contribute to protecting the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Merge?\n\nThe Merge, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0, is the much-anticipated switch from the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus process to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism for the Ethereum blockchain (PoS).\n\nPoW and PoS are protocols for adding transaction-containing blocks to the blockchain and for confirming and achieving consensus on the accuracy of the transactions. Currently, the PoW mechanism is used by the two most widely used blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding the Merge:\n\nThe Ethereum merge was one of the historic moments in the crypto world. The shift from PoW to PoS essentially changed how new blocks are added and how transactions are recorded onto Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nWith PoW, miners compete by leveraging their combined computing power to create blocks containing transactions. This calls for specialized computer gear that consumes a lot of energy to solve a challenging mathematical puzzle. The first miner to complete the problem creates a new block and is rewarded with the blockchain\u2019s native currency, in this case, ETH. PoW is less scalable than PoS and requires more energy, which is its main drawback.\n\nValidators, instead of miners, propose new blocks and validate transactions in a PoS system. Validators must stake a certain quantity of native currencies as collateral to participate in this procedure.\n\nAn algorithm determines which validator gets to propose a new block of transactions instead of competing to create new ones. The blocks of transactions are then added to the blockchain once a specific number of additional validators have confirmed the transactions\u2019 accuracy. After that, native coins are given to the validators. Individuals who fail to validate transactions (for example, by staying offline) or validate fraudulent transactions risk losing the collateral they staked.\n\nBecause it will occur when Ethereum developers merge the mainnet of Ethereum, PoW, with the Beacon Chain, the conversion of Ethereum to PoS is known as \u201cThe Merge\u201d (a separate PoS blockchain the developers have set up to facilitate the transition).\n\nThe Timeline of Ethereum Merge:\n\nThe Merge has been under development for years, gradually advancing through several tests and upgrades while engineers try to address flaws at each stage. Important checkpoints on the path to The Merge include:\n\nBeacon Chain launched in December 2020\n\nLondon hard fork in August 2021\n\nAltair upgraded in October 2021\n\nArrow Glacier was upgraded in December 2021\n\nKiln testnet merged in March 2022\n\nMultiple mainnet shadow forks started in 2022 April\n\nRopsten testnet merged in 2022 June\n\nGray Glacier upgraded in 2022 June\n\nSepolia testnet merge in 2022 July\n\nGoerli testnet merged in 2022 August\n\nEthereum Merger completed in September 2022\n\nHow does Ether staking work?\n\nWith the Ethereum Merge, node validators will have to stake 32 ETH into a smart contract as collateral to be eligible for block rewards. This Ether will be locked up till a network update makes withdrawals possible.\n\nEthereum handles rewards by holding a random lottery to choose who will suggest a new block to be added to the blockchain, in contrast to some PoS blockchains that give a greater chance of rewards to users who stake a more significant amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Ethereum, \u201cwhen validator withdrawals are enabled, stakers will be incentivized to remove their earnings/rewards (balance over 32 ETH) as these funds are otherwise not contributing to their stake weight (which maxes out at 32).\u201d\n\nAnyone who wants to stake Ether but does not have 32 ether or does not want to run a validator node can join a staking pool. To stake the requisite 32 ETH for an Ethereum validator node, a stake pool pools the deposits of several people.\n\nThe staking pool then receives a percentage of the block rewards from that node based on the amount of ETH initially invested per user account. A variation of this is also available on cryptocurrency exchanges, where users can stake tiny sums in exchange for a set reward.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Merge required?\n\nPrior to the merge, Ethereum was plagued with several problems. The long-pending Ethereum Merge offered solutions to many of these problems as well as several advantages on how the token is created and how transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor improving scalability:\n\nCracking The Blockchain Trilemma is a hypothesis that claims blockchains can only fulfil two of the three goals of security, decentralization, and scalability. Still, not all three are one of the blockchain\u2019s holy grails.\n\nScalability problems are now plaguing Ethereum, which is the most crucial aspect of expanding the user base. Transactions have increased due to the growing use of cryptocurrencies and the massive expansion of decentralized applications (Dapps) that use the Ethereum blockchain, such as those connected to DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, and GameFi.\n\nSlow transaction speeds have, however, made it difficult for Ethereum\u2019s network to keep up. The resulting network congestion has also caused gas fees (Ethereum transaction fees) to soar, making the blockchain unusable for most individuals.\n\nThe first step towards future upgrades like sharding , which are anticipated to increase significantly transaction speeds and lower gas costs, is the transition to PoS. Therefore, many people expect that The Merge will commence the start of a new chapter in enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nImproving decentralization and security:\n\nAdvocates of The Merge claim that because PoS has lower entry hurdles for validators than PoW, it will promote the decentralization and security of the blockchain. Because miners must purchase expensive computer hardware (often called mining rigs) and pay significant electricity expenses to compete to be the first miner to create blocks, PoW has high entry barriers.\n\nA lower access barrier may minimize the possibility of a small number of validators controlling the validation process, which may increase security.\n\nHowever, critics point out that validators with higher amounts of ETH staked as collateral may have a higher chance of selection, suggesting that people with access to more ETH reserves may have excessive influence over the validation process.\n\nAffects the supply of ETH, making it Deflationary:\n\nThe two competing forces of issuing new ETH coins and destroying current ETH coins significantly impact the amount of ETH coins available (the removal of existing ETH coins from circulation).\n\nDue to the present PoW and PoS implementations on the Ethereum mainnet and beacon chain, new ETH coins are created to compensate miners and validators, respectively.\n\nBut, the necessity for PoW mining rewards will disappear once the Ethereum network switches to PoS. Some commentators think this should lead to a decrease in the overall issuance of new ETH coins, making ETH deflationary or gradually reducing its supply.\n\nReduces energy consumption:\n\nPoS uses less energy than PoW because fewer miners are required to compete with one another using powerful computers, which wastes a lot of energy.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation claims that switching to PoS will cause the Ethereum blockchain to use about 99.95% less energy.\n\nThe significance of the Ethereum Merge:\n\nThe second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum, recently underwent a significant software upgrade that promises to increase security while purportedly reducing its carbon impact almost entirely.\n\nThe redesigned system, dubbed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d will do away with the requirement for cryptocurrency miners and massive mining farms, who previously powered the blockchain via a system known as \u201cproof-of-work\u201d (PoW). In its place, a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d (PoS) mechanism has been adopted, which randomly selects \u201cvalidators\u201d to approve transactions in exchange for a modest payment.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized cryptocurrency. Organizations like banks are only required to approve transactions after they take place on their network. Before, transactions were approved using the PoW consensus mechanism, which miners mainly carried out.\n\nThe first miner to complete a complicated mathematical puzzle would be the validator. After that, miners would compete to solve these riddles using a vast infrastructure of cutting-edge computer technology. Crypto farms, enormous warehouses filled with rows of computers that would solve the problems, were essentially the only power source for this method.\n\nThere was, however, one major issue: these mining farms were energy hogs. As a result, one of the biggest criticisms of the cryptocurrency industry was that they occasionally consumed more electricity than entire nations, which raised serious questions about their ability to maintain the environment. the switch to the PoS consensus process and \u201cThe Merge.\u201d Although the new idea would eliminate the need for miners and mining farms, Ethereum would still be a decentralized platform.\n\nInstead, an algorithm will choose a validator randomly from a group of individuals who have \u201cstaked\u201d (basically, pledged at least 32 Ethereum tokens on the network) their money. As a result, the Ethereum network would no longer require any miners.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Change After Merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been fluctuating a lot after the completion of the merge. The token\u2019s price went up slightly after the merge to reach around $1,640 on September 14, 2022. It, however, fell sharply in the next twenty-four hours and was trading at around $1,450.\n\nEthereum fell further in October and traded at around $1300-$1400 the entire month. While it made a slight recovery towards the end of November, reaching around $1600, it again fell in November to around $1150.\n\nThen came 2023, Ethereum saw a sharp uptick in its price. It possibly witnessed the best rally after the merge. In February 2023, Ethereum\u2019s price reached nearly $2100, which is also its highest price since the merge.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has seen many fluctuations in its price, but never went below the $1500 mark. It is comfortable trading in the $1700-$1900 region as of now.\n\nHowever, if you look from a holistic view, the merge didn\u2019t help etherum\u2019s price to skyrocket, as it is trading nearly at the same levels as it was before. Remember that ETH\u2019s all time high is $4,891.70, and it is nowhere near to reaching that spot anytime soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Net Supply Down\n\nFollowing the merge, Ethereum\u2019s net supply down has come down. The decline has come in the backdrop of a higher burn than generation. Since the merge happened, Ethereu has burned 924K ETH while minted only 699K ETH.\n\nThis means it has created a gap of 255K ETHS in the past 415 days. The supply has decreased by 0.19% in annualized percentage terms, as per the ethereum analytics dashboard ultrasound.money.\n\nEthereum Staking\n\nAfter the Ethereum merge, the staked Ethereum has almost doubled. The total number of staked Ethereum stand at a total of 28 million Ethereum, equivalent to nearly $51.5 billion. The growth stands at around 94% in percentage terms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOne of the most awaited moments in cryptocurrency is The Merge, the most significant update in Ethereum\u2019s history. The Ethereum blockchain\u2019s fundamentals are expected to undergo significant advancements, with scalability likely the most significant change. So mark your calendars because developers have established a soft target date of September 15, 2022. Delays, meanwhile, could still pose a threat to The Merge."

        "content": "Two-fifths of institutions expect the price of Ethereum\u2019s native token ether to be above $2,000 at the end of 2023, according to a survey.\n\nConducted by London-based crypto hedge fund firm Nickel Digital Asset Management, the research, published Thursday, polled 200 institutional investors and wealth managers across seven countries that manage a combined $2.85 trillion in assets.\n\nWhile 41% of institutions said they expected ether (ETH) to be above $2,000 at the end of 2023, 72% predicted growth from its level of $1,254 when the research was conducted.\n\nETH\u2019s price stood at about $1,725, as of Thursday, at 11 am ET \u2014 up about 8% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe expectation for positive price action comes after Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake last year \u2014 an event estimated to reduce the blockchain\u2019s energy consumption by as much as 99.9%.\n\nIndustry participants told Blockworks last year the Merge \u201ccompletely changes\u201d ETH\u2019s investment case, adding that the staking yields investors can now earn from the asset were poised to bring in institutional capital.\n\nRoughly 85% of the survey respondents were aware the Merge took place, with 77% saying they believed it would increase adoption.\n\nRead more: The Investor\u2019s Guide to the Ethereum Merge\n\nNickel Digital CEO Anatoly Crachilov said Ethereum is benefitting from what he called \u201cthe flight to quality\u201d in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to see so many traditional investors not only cognizant of the Merge, but aware of its mechanics and the benefits that came with the upgrade,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis can only be a positive for the space and especially the DeFi sector, which lives primarily on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIsidoros Passadis, master of validators at liquid staking protocol Lido, told Blockworks the rollout of Ethereum\u2019s highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade will bring many benefits to Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\n\u201cBy allowing for withdrawals, the Beacon Chain de-risks liquid staking thereby opening it up to a wider set of stakers with lower-risk appetites,\u201d Passadis said.\n\nColin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon Labs, added: \u201cWe\u2019re hearing anecdotally that many institutions are waiting for Shanghai since it\u2019s impossible to underwrite duration currently. If you can\u2019t unstake and your [limited partners] start trying to redeem, you could face a pretty toxic liquidity crunch, so post-Shanghai, this risk is lessened.\u201d\n\nNickel Digital Asset Management\u2019s research comes a few days after a study by blockchain-based finance firm Avantgarde found that 74% of institutional investors plan to increase their use of DeFi this year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ether Capital Corporation (\u201cEther Capital'' or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (NEO: ETHC) is pleased to announce it has committed 8,000 Ether (C$18.1 million equivalent) to Ethereum Staking, which is in addition to the 7,488 Ether the Company Staked in January 2023. In total, Ether Capital has Staked 36,000 Ether (C$81.4 million equivalent), representing 79.4 per cent of its portfolio.\n\nStaking Ether is a core part of the Company\u2019s three-pronged strategy: To continue being a net accumulator of Ether, Stake the majority of the Company\u2019s Ether balance to generate yield (Staking Rewards), and use a portion of the revenue generated from Staking to build institutional-grade infrastructure that supports the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe view Staking as the most reliable way to generate yield in the space and create additional value for our shareholders,\u201d said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital. \u201cWhen individuals or companies Stake ETH, they are making a commitment to help secure the network and validate future transactions that take place on Ethereum. This is a protocol we believe will one day act as a primary settlement layer for the global economy and support trillions of dollars of activity. Our goal has always been to stake as much Ether as possible and put our weight behind Ethereum as the number one platform of choice for user and developer activity.\u201d\n\nEther Capital will continue to monitor developer progress when it comes to Ethereum upgrades and will update the market if it decides to stake more of its Ether balance.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that Brett Bergmann will be advising the Management Team on technical strategy and execution over the coming months. Mr. Bergmann has several years of experience in the crypto industry and was part of the initial team that designed the Company\u2019s multi-signature wallet in 2018. Shayan Eskandari will be stepping down from the role of Chief Technical Officer as of March 7, 2023. Mr. Eskandari joined Ether Capital in fall 2021 to assist with developing technical infrastructure that allowed the Company to build out its operating businesses. Since that time, Ether Capital has expanded technical resources, become one of the first public companies in the world to stake Ether and will continue developing in-house products to further bolster the Ethereum ecosystem. Mr. Eskandari is planning to return to academia and focus on his PhD. The Company thanks him for his contributions and wishes him well on his next chapter.\n\nAbout Ether Capital Corporation\n\n\u200b\u200bEther Capital (NEO: ETHC) is a public technology company with a long-term objective to become a central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem. The Company has invested the majority of its balance sheet in Ethereum\u2019s native utility token \u201cEther\u201d as a core strategic asset and yield-generating instrument.

        "title": "How Many Ethereum Are There in 2023? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Like many cryptocurrencies, the supply of Ethereum on the market is constantly changing, as new blocks are mined in the blockchain. Currently, Ethereum is the most popular altcoin (alternative to Bitcoin) on the market, and has been the top altcoin for a long time.\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know about the availability of Ethereum tokens today.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Are There in 2023?\n\nThere is a total of 121,826,163.06 ETH or Ethereum coins in circulation (Q1: Year 2023). Notably, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin. While there can only ever be 21 million BTC (Bitcoins) in circulation, Ethereum\u2019s supply is potentially unlimited.\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum, he made the network suitable for an unlimited amount of coins. This prevents ETH from having a fixed security budget.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nExploring the Number of Ethereum Coins Available\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s most popular altcoin, operating on a different principle from Bitcoin. There\u2019s no specific Ethereum supply cap, which means the total number of coins in circulation will continue to increase for as long as people mine the blockchain.\n\nA total of 18 million ETH coins can be mined per year.\n\nWhile there\u2019s essentially no limit on the number of Ethereum coins we can mine in total, there are caps on the number of coins anyone can mine in a specific time frame.\n\nAccording to the explanation on the Ethereum coin limit shared by Vitalik Buterin, it\u2019s only possible to mine 18 million ETH coins per year. This equates to around 2 ETH being mined per block in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n(Ethereum.org)\n\nThere are 135.3 billion ETC (Ethereum Classic coins) in circulation.\n\nWhen looking at the circulating supply of Ethereum, it\u2019s worth noting there are two different types of coins on offer. The most common and popular coin is ETH.\n\nHowever, a disagreement between members of the Ethereum community meant a new blockchain was created called \u201cETC\u201d or Ethereum Classic. Both of these coins use the same technology platforms and have a similar formal roadmap for development.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nIn 2021, the size of the Ethereum blockchain was 175 GB.\n\nThough the exact size of the Ethereum blockchain today is difficult to estimate, we do have some insights into how large it might be. Peter Szilagyi, a team lead and the lead developer of the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, revealed the blockchain was 175 GB large in 2021.\n\nIn comparison, a node of Bitcoin is approximately 412 GB. While Ethereum is currently generating more data than Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain is still much larger.\n\n(Peter Szilagyi, Twitter)\n\nThere are 5750 blocks of Ethereum mined per day.\n\nThere are around 5750 Ethereum blocks mined per day as of June 2022. This is a reduction of around 11.61% from the same period in 2021, and insight into how the Ethereum coin limit is maintained. According to some calculators, the average number of Ethereum blocks an individual could mine per hour at a hash rate of 2500 would be 0.00134985 ETH.\n\nWith more miners contributing additional power to the network, the difficulty of mining Ethereum has increased dramatically over the last year. This means even if you mine a full block in a matter of seconds, you\u2019ll only get a small amount of Ethereum.\n\n(YCharts)\n\nThere are around 2,151 nodes running on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most active country contributing to the amount of Ethereum in circulation is the USA. Around 1,060 of the full 2,151 nodes active right now are located in the US. The United Kingdom is the second biggest player, with 205 nodes.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nEhereum has the potential to become deflationary.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no limit on the Ethereum total supply available to be mined in the long term, there are some potential risks. According to a disclaimer published on GitHub, if more money is burned on the cost of mining ETH than the value of the rewards, it could become deflationary.\n\n(GitHub)\n\nUnderstanding the Total Ethereum Supply\n\nUltimately, while there\u2019s no chance of ETH running out any time soon, there are still limits on what people can reasonably mine and contribute to the current circulation. Right now, the supply of Ethereum continues to grow at a rapid pace, as it remains the number one altcoin on the market.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "content": "A top analyst and trader is detailing the path forward for the two leading crypto assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nStarting with Bitcoin, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 10,700 YouTube subscribers in a new video that if the flagship digital asset rises above the 2023 high of around $24,200, it would indicate that it is in a bullish phase.\n\n\u201cSo we consider this high around $24,000: if it breaks that area cleanly\u2026 like a solid break to like $26,000 or something at that point I think that we can see it coming back down, going higher and just continuing up\u2026 That, in my opinion, would be a clear bullish market structure at this point.\u201d\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, however, says that a lower high would be a bearish indicator for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s some bearish indicators where you know, if we hit a lower high, comes back up to say $22,000, $23,000 and then just brings us down or just breaks down here, obviously at that point we\u2019re just going to go down to $20,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin could rally by over 30% from the current levels and then collapse to the 2022 low of under $16,000.\n\n\u201cTo be clear I actually don\u2019t really necessarily think the bottom is totally in. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if price continues higher, maybe to $25,000. I have always expected it going to $25,000 \u2013 $30,000 and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it goes to $30,000 eventually.\n\nBut it would make a lot of sense to me if price trades up to $25,000 to $30,000 and then comes back all the way down to $20,000 or something like that. Or $17,000. Or even $15,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $22,568 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to ETH, Altcoin Sherpa says that depending on Bitcoin\u2019s behavior, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could surge by over 25% from the current levels.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks pretty strong overall. I really still am shooting for the highs around $2,000\u2026 I do believe personally that the $2,000 areas will come through as long as Bitcoin is steady.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous crypto analyst, traders should wait for Ethereum to rise above the $1,700 resistance level before considering a long entry.\n\n\u201cBut still, would wait for a break of $1,600 \u2013 $1,700 before really considering the $2,000 area.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,577 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum on-chain data suggests ETH sell pressure could be a non-event after the Shanghai upgrade - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The upcoming Ethereum Shanghai hard fork is slated to occur in March 2023, and the upgrade will cap off the network\u2019s move to proof-of-stake (PoS), which started during the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022. Once Shanghai is implemented, previously locked Ether (ETH) will gradually become liquid for the first time since December 2020.\n\nAccording to on-chain Etherscan data, over 16.6 million ETH is currently locked in the PoS staking protocol, which was valued at $28 billion on Feb. 16, 2023. Ethereum\u2019s move from proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS has started to achieve the original goal, which was to make Ether\u2019s supply deflationary. In the 154 days since the Merge, over 24,800 ETH has been burned to make the token 0.05% deflationary on a yearly basis.\n\nKey Ether stats since the Merge. Source: Ultra sound money\n\nOn. Feb. 16, the total Ether supply sits at 120 million, meaning that a little over 10% of the supply will be unlocked, with yield rewards starting with the Shanghai update.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what on-chain metrics can help identify what may happen during the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nA portion of locked ETH is liquid thanks to liquid staking derivatives\n\nIn order to benefit from yield rewards before the Shanghai update, investors had to lock their ETH and run a reliable node. The minimum staking requirement of 32 locked ETH is entirely illiquid, meaning traders had limited utility options for these coins.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives (LSD) allow users to benefit from staked Ether while retaining the ability to sell the derivative token received on the secondary market. The LSD protocols took a fee and locked the native Ether, giving users another token that represents a stake in the pool.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives did not gain prominence until Lido and other protocols began to see a rush of cash flow after the Merge. Since Ether staking began, liquid staking has surpassed illiquid staking. As of Feb. 13, 57% of staked Ether is liquid versus 43% illiquid.\n\nLiquid vs. illiquid staking. Source: Binance\n\nSince a majority of the locked Ether is through LSD, investors currently have access to liquidity, which could reduce sell pressure post-Shanghai.\n\nVery few stakers are in profit\n\nBack in December 2020 when Ether staking opened, the price of Ether ranged from $400 to $700. Conversely, many investors began staking when Ether was near its all-time high of $4,200. According to Binance:\n\n\u201cWe note a sizable amount of ETH (around 2M) was staked at prices in the US $400\u2013700 range \u2014 this represents the earliest stakers in Dec 2020 \u2014 a group that is likely illiquid given that liquid staking was far less known at the time.\u201d\n\nBecause of Ether\u2019s 69% correction since hitting an all-time high, many of the investors who staked their Ether are currently at an unrealized loss.\n\nPrice when staking occurred. Source: Binance\n\nThe minority of stakers who are in profit are likely to be strong believers in the Ethereum network since the date for liquidity was still unknown at this time. With a large number of stakers at a loss and those who are profitable likely to be long-term investors, Ether\u2019s price may not see a massive dump when the tokens are able to be unstaked.\n\nLido overtakes solo stakers\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2023, Lido officially overtook MakerDAO as the highest total value locked in decentralized finance. As of Feb. 13, Lido is also the largest staking entity in Ether. With over 5 billion ETH staked in Lido, the protocol represents 29.2% of all entities. Notably, almost 30% of all stakers have the option for current liquidity through Lido.\n\nSolo stakers who run nodes took a risk to run nodes from home or with a small group. Solo stakers likely believe that Ether is a long-term currency since nodes carry cost and risk. Solo stakers currently make up 24.9% of all stakers.\n\nStaked Ether by entity.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has printed a death cross technical pattern versus Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time since May, suggesting more pain ahead for ETH/BTC in the coming weeks.\n\nPrevious ETH price death cross preceded 27.5% drop\n\nA death cross appears when an asset\u2019s short-term 50-day moving average moves below its long-term 200-day moving average. Such a chart pattern was seen in December 2007, ahead of the global economic crisis.\n\nSimilarly, the ETH/BTC\u2019s previous death cross, in May, preceded an approximately 27.5% price correction, dropping in part as investors reduced exposure to altcoins and sought safety in Bitcoin amid the Terra collapse.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart.

Staking is a key feature of many blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price up today?\n\nMeanwhile, capital flows to and from Bitcoin and Ethereum-based funds also reveal BTC gaining the upper hand.

        "content": "Crypto analytics platform Santiment says investors quickly picked up about $260,000,000 in Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM).\n\nSantiment says that as Fantom skyrocketed in price this year, shark and whale addressed unloaded $259.7 million of FTM within weeks.\n\nHowever, most of the unloaded tokens were snapped up by small addressees holding anywhere between 0.01 to one FTM token.\n\n\u201cFantom\u2019s shark and whale addresses have dumped heavily during this 2023 rise. Addresses holding 10,000 to 100 million FTM dropped $259.7 million worth of coins in the past four weeks. These coins have largely been scooped up by micro addresses holding 0.01 to 1 FTM.\u201d\n\nFantom opened the year at $0.200 and hit a high of $0.656 on February 3rd, a 228% increase. Fantom is trading for $0.55 at time of writing.\n\nSantiment also looks at the meteoric rise of the artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain project Fetch.ai (FET), calling attention to a huge whale transaction of 135,000,000 FET on February 14th.\n\n\u201cFetch.ai now the #102 asset by market cap in crypto after skyrocketing +395% in 2023, has seen its largest transaction in 567 days. $61.2M worth of FET has been transferred to an existing whale address, which also holds 224.46 million in Ethereum (ETH).\u201d\n\nSanitment says that overall altcoins are showing a lot of strength again as the NASDAQ and tech stocks moved up on February 14th. They say the strongest performers are FTM along with Immutable X (IMX) and The Graph (GRT).\n\n\u201cAltcoins are bouncing back big as Nasdaq and tech stocks performed well on Valentine\u2019s Day. There is still an evident correlation between equities and cryptocurrencies that traders are hoping dissipates, as a correlation break historically foreshadows bull runs.\u201d\n\nLastly, the analytics firm says small shark investors are fleeing stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD) after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to sue its minting company Paxos for allegedly violating investor protection laws. Paxos has already agreed to shut down issuance of the stablecoin but will continue to honor redemptions. BUSD sharks are instead investing in Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\n\u201cWith BUSD being in hot water, small shark addresses are declining rapidly for Binance\u2019s stablecoin that is being sued by the SEC. Instead, these sharks are increasing their positions in USDT and USDC instead.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum is about to undergo a significat update, one dubbed as \"the single most significant event in crypto history.\" The update would result in a complete restructuring of the blockchain technology, the world's second-largest blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAfter an event known as \"the merge,\" the blockchain network, which presently uses the proof-of-work algorithm that drives bitcoin and other cryptos, will move to proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nTop crypto fund Bitwise Asset Management has hailed this upgrade as the year's most intriguing narrative in the digital asset market.\n\nSo, here is a tutorial for you on \"Ethereum Merge\" to understand how this new evolution of Ethereum will affect and grow the crypto world.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat is the Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d? By transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) method, the merging attempts to increase the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCrypto miners secure the Proof of Work (pioneered by Bitcoin), by coming up with solutions for complex, but practically useless mathematical problems-a process that often takes a lot of energy to execute.\n\nMeanwhile, individuals staking crypto to perform transactions do it using a Proof of Stake system.\n\nBoth the techniques are now being used on Ethereum. Combining both the layers is expected to bring about a single proof-of-stake chain.\n\nThe merge and transition of the 2 layers will however have no effect on other Ether cryptocurrency present on the network.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Merging? Ethereum is in the early stages of transitioning to the Beacon Chain, which uses the \"proof of stake\" consensus process. Previous Method: Proof-of-Work When Bitcoin and Ethereum originally launched, every blockchain transaction was validated via a technique known as \"proof of work.\"\n\nIn blocks, a systematic mechanism adds transactions to the Blockchain or digital ledger.\n\nThe proof-of-work system necessitates agreement among all computer networks and the generation of new blocks, which consumes a lot of computational power. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program New Method: Proof-of-Stake Instead of depending on computers, proof-of-stake models conserve energy by requiring network participants to stake ETH as collateral to vouch for new blocks added to the chain.\n\nIts mechanisms in crypto enable ecosystems to circulate cryptocurrency in the same way that fiat money is circulated.\n\nIt takes less time and energy to vouch for new blockchain transactions than proof-of-work models because the coin was previously mined once.\n\nPros and Cons of \u201cThe Merge\u201d Pros Proponents of the PoS model hope that the merger will make Ethereum more scalable, safe, and long-lasting.\n\nPoS will lower the network's energy consumption by 99.95%. This may persuade more people to invest in Ethereum. Cons The transition would render Ethereum's miners obsolete and reduce emissions of the numerous applications that rely on the Ethereum infrastructure, including many NFT platforms.\n\nHowever, the benefits are not universally accepted. Critics have highlighted security problems and reservations regarding Ethereum's scalability.\n\nWhen is the Merge Happening? Although the Ethereum merge was first proposed in 2016, the transition has proven more difficult than anticipated.\n\nThis was expected to happen in June 2022, but insiders have warned of further delays this month.\n\nTim Beiko, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, tweeted on April 12 that the merge \"won't be in June, but likely in a few months after.\"\n\nWhat Will the Ethereum Merge mean for Crypto Investments? According to several experts, the update would help Ethereum thrive as new blockchain projects have pulled into its market share in the last six months.\n\nThe Ethereum merge could speed up processing, improve security and stability, and reduce Ethereum's energy use by 98% or more.\n\nThis upgrade may result in price increases for related altcoins.\n\nThe upgrade will enable the network to scale, lower transaction costs, and encourage more people to use blockchain technology.\n\nIs There Anything Investors Need To Do With Their Ethereum? According to the Ethereum website, present ETH holders are not required to take any action due to the Merge.\n\nThey can get more involved in the upgrading by staking or assisting in testing the enhancements, but their holdings stay unchanged.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Ethereum? The upgrade is expected to reduce the supply of fresh ETH, and demand in the Ethereum blockchain could rise due to the quantity of ETH available to stake.\n\nFor most Ethereum investors, the fall in supply is good.\n\nInvestors in Defi appear to be eager for the Merge to be completed. At least $31 billion in ETH has been deposited in the new Ethereum Consensus Model staking mechanism, ready to validate new transactions as soon as the green light is given.\n\nHigh-profile crypto experts are expecting a $10,000 ETH bull run in 2022. The signals all point to the Ethereum blockchain maintaining its position as the premier smart contract blockchain and maybe being the next leader in cryptocurrency \u2014 but Ethereum's developers will have a lot of work ahead of them.

The main breakdown support is situated in the $23,250 zone. Assuming the price closes below the $23,250 level, it could prompt another decline in the coming days.

        "title": "Why Ethereum Price Could Reach $1,800 Before The Rally Burns Out - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price has followed the recovery trend of Bitcoin over the last two days, which has helped it wipe the losses from early February. Currently, the digital asset is up around 9% which saw it break above $1,600 once more. However, the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down as there is still some runway for it.\n\nETH Deflation Paints Bullish Picture\n\nOne of the most bullish arguments for Ethereum right now is the fact that while most coins in the space are experiencing inflation, the coin\u2019s supply is deflating. This is a result of the Ethereum Merge that was completed last year, which works to reduce the supply of ETH in the market.\n\nOver the months that have followed the Merge, there has been a steady decrease in the Ethereum supply. Between the time of the Merge and now, the supply of Ethereum has shrunk by more than 23,900 ETH (around $40 million), a 0.047% decrease since the Merge.\n\nThis reduction in supply has pushed the ETH issuance rate into the negative. According to data from the ETH tracking website, Ultrasound Money, the ETH issuance rate now sits at -0.7%.\n\nThe burn rate has also accelerated this time, coming out at more than 4,000 ETH burned daily. This means that around 1.55 million ETH are burned per year going by the current burn rate. Additionally, the website projects that by 2025, the total ETH supply will fall below 118 million.\n\nETH supply expected to fall below 118 million in two years: Source: Ultrasound Money\n\nCan This Push Ethereum Price Above $1,800?\n\nWith the current momentum, coupled with the fact that the Ethereum supply is declining rather than increasing, it serves as a bullish basis for the cryptocurrency since lower supply and higher demand are a recipe for rising prices.\n\nETH, on one hand, is already trying to test the $1,700 resistance. This is a hard one given that bears have pitched their tents at this level, but a break above here can easily guarantee a run-up above $1,800 in short succession.\n\nThere is also the fact that over 14% of the total supply worth over $28 billion is still staked in the Beacon contract. This reduced circulating supply and the spike in the Coinbase Premium Index show more attention from investors, all of which work to cement the bullish trend for the digital asset.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trending at a price of $1,685. The digital asset\u2019s price is up 8.79% in the last 24 hours and 3.17% in the last seven days.\n\nETH price remains steady above $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Ethereum Price, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Layer 2s Escalate Battle to Rule Ethereum Scaling Solutions\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nThat didn\u2019t take long.\n\nA day after Polygon announced plans to release a zero-knowledge-based scaling solution for Ethereum, zkSync opened up registrations for developers to deploy applications to its blockchain-based platform, known as a \u201cmainnet.\u201d\n\nzkSync, one of the most well-known projects in the zero-knowledge rollup space, said it is not a full-blown launch \u2014 developers must register their blockchain addresses before they can deploy code.\n\nEthereum Race\n\nYet the move escalates the contest between two of the most dynamic Layer 2 blockchain networks in the race to ramp up Ethereum\u2019s ability to support decentralized transactions. It also demonstrates how zero-knowledge technology is rapidly reshaping the way users may interact with the No. 2 cryptocurrency network and its smart contract capabilities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Polygon said its zero-knowledge solution would go live on Mar. 27.\n\nSo far, no zero-knowledge rollup has gained the upper hand in the Ethereum scaling challenge. This type of ZK-rollup is known as a zkEVM.\n\nIt\u2019s a highly competitive marketplace. ZK-rollups are competing with Optimistic rollups, another technology whose two main implementations, Optimism and Arbitrum, dominate the Layer 2 space with over 80% market share, according to L2BEAT.\n\nStephen Goldfeder, Arbitrum\u2019s co-founder, has recently been turning up the heat on ZK-rollups by questioning their superiority to Optimistic systems.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a narrative out there that ZK Rollups will be able to do everything that Optimistic Rollups do but better,\u201d he said on Twitter last month, before diving into ways in which the EVM, the set of rules which dictate how the Ethereum blockchain processes transactions, can be expanded on.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nTaking Heat\n\nGoldfeder discussed a new offering which he said would provide even more useful functionality than EVM-compatible systems, in an interview with The Defiant earlier this month.\n\nzkSync has taken some heat before for another announcement regarding its system. On Oct. 28, the project launched a mainnet open only to its own developers. This meant that no external projects were live on the network, bringing into question whether the announcement needed to be made at all.\n\nEcosystem Fund\n\nDespite some criticism, zkSync has picked up momentum. Holders of UNI, the token of Uniswap, DeFi\u2019s largest decentralized exchange by volume, voted to deploy the protocol to zkSync\u2019s solution, when it goes live, back in October.\n\nMatter Labs has raised a total of $258M, according to Crunchbase. The company also has raised another $200M to develop an \u201cecosystem fund,\u201d to foster adoption of zkEVM.\n\nStarkWare, a key competitor with zkSync and other solutions, raised $100M at an $8B valuation in May despite not having launched an open mainnet.\n\nZero-knowledge refers to a cryptographic proof that verifies a statement to be true without revealing what it is. Use cases include the ability to verify citizenship without needing to reveal passport details, enabling private transactions on public blockchain networks, and offloading transaction processing from impacted blockchains.\n\nStarkWare\n\nThe proofs are useful for scaling blockchains because they allow ZK-rollups to validate transactions off of Layer 1 platforms like Ethereum, which are expensive to use. ZK-rollups can then post those validated transactions to Ethereum, reducing the computational load on the Layer 1.\n\nWith Polygon\u2019s announcement earlier this week, and the zkSyncs team\u2019s today, the pressure may have increased for other ZK-rollup providers like StarkWare to launch their mainnet platform.\n\nCorrected on Feb. 23 to report that zkSync opened up registrations for developers to deploy applications to its blockchain-based platform after Polygon announced plans to released its own solution."

        "content": "The Ethereum layer-2 scaling race has just gotten tighter.\n\nPre-registered projects are now able to deploy Matter Labs\u2019 latest zero knowledge (zk) roll-up technology on the Ethereum network.\n\nTo differentiate the distinct versions of their scaling solutions, Matter Labs has rebranded zkSync 1.0 to zkSync Lite and zkSync 2.0 to zkSync Era, the latter allowing dapps compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM).\n\nZkSync Lite saw lackluster adoption compared to other layer-2s due to the lack of smart contract support, leaving it with minimal utility, Blockworks Research analyst Sam Martin noted in a report.\n\nDubbed the Fair Onboarding Alpha Stage, this will be the final stage before zkSync Era becomes fully available for all projects on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis stage will last roughly four to six weeks before Full Launch Alpha, given that there are no security considerations, Anthony Rose, the head of engineering at Matter Labs, told Blockworks.\n\nDuring this time, mainnet will be closed to end users, enabling projects to deploy and test their applications in a closed environment, Shazia Hasan, protocol marketing lead at Matter Labs wrote in a blog post.\n\nZkSync Era will be completely open source \u2014 though Matter Labs does not advise forking the code now, as there may still be security updates that need to be addressed.\n\nRose does not envision a prover standard to emerge following the launch of ZkSync Era, but notes that \u201cyou could imagine a world in which there are the standard network effects \u2014 perhaps ~1-2 main players, space for a handful of smaller players \u2014 and it isn\u2019t a given that a single prover is required for this scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat being said, there are obvious benefits from standardization and our plans for Hyperchains are possible due to (in part) some functionality that is possible when you share a proof system,\u201d Rose said.\n\nHyperchains are what Matter Labs calls layer-3 blockchains that the team says \u201cwill enable limitless scaling with limitless customization,\u201d according to a blog post.\n\nFierce competition for roll-up technology solutions\n\nMatter Lab\u2019s launch of Era comes just two days after layer-2 scaling giant Polygon Labs announced that its zkEVM solution would go live on Ethereum mainnet next month.\n\nThis latest deployment \u201cmarks another milestone in zk rollup development as teams from Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and others get closer to a fully fleshed out zkEVM fully accessible to everyone,\u201d Martin said.\n\nUnlike Polygon\u2019s zkEVM which has been classified as a type-3 by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Era is classified as a type-4 zkEVM.\n\nThis is because \u201cit takes high-level smart contract source code written in Solidity and compiles it to a more zk-SNARK friendly language,\u201d Martin said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "While the crypto market is still in an uptrend despite the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) increase in regulatory actions, projects have been seen taking advantage of the so-called \u2018mini bull run\u2019 with new launches. NFT marketplace Blur is one of them.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s day, February 14, Blur airdropped its native token under the ticker BLUR. The digital asset was launched on the Ethereum blockchain to users who have actively traded NFTs on the marketplace over the past six months.\n\nFollowing the project\u2019s token airdrop, network activity on the Ethereum blockchain has soared, spiking the network\u2019s gas prices and the amount of ETH burned in a day. This network\u2019s spike in activity can be linked to Blur users claiming their respective airdropped tokens and to the transactions on the marketplace.\n\nBLUR Token Surges Ethereum Network Activity\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, a total amount of 2,469 ETH worth roughly $4 million has been burned in the last seven days, removing a portion of ETH from circulation permanently, which has had a positive effect on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOver the past weeks, Ethereum network activity has been trending to the upside, mirroring ETH\u2019s surge in price. Two weeks ago, NewsBTC reported that the amount of Ethereum burned recorded a new high exceeding the 3,000 ETH mark.\n\nThis metric seems relatively low to the ETH burned due to the BLUR token airdrop, which hasn\u2019t been the only new high Ethereum has recorded in the past month. In January, the Ethereum staked on the Beacon chain, the proof-of-stake blockchain, reached an all-time high of over 16.16 million ETH, which holds more than 13.28% of the total ETH supply.\n\nEntering The Spotlight\n\nWhile the token has boosted Ethereum\u2019s activity, the marketplace is beginning to seize the spotlight with massive recognition. According to the data provider, Dune analytics, the Blur NFT marketplace has gained traction, obtaining a larger share of the NFT market ecosystem.\n\nBlur controlled 64.6% of NFT market trading volume in the past week as opposed to OpenSea\u2019s 24.4% and X2Y2\u2019s relatively low trading volume of 5.1%. Though OpenSea has the most recognition, Blur\u2019s recent airdrop has increased its popularity.\n\nBlur is an NFT marketplace and market aggregator that offers services such as advanced analytics, excellent portfolio management capabilities, and the ability to compare NFTs on multiple marketplaces.\n\nUnlike Opensea\u2019s royalty fee, Blur takes a distinct approach of enforcing royalty fees only when requested by creators. The platform currently does not enforce full royalties. Instead, it enables the enforcement of only a 0.5% minimum creator royalty, allowing users to pay more when purchasing an NFT item on the marketplace.\n\nWhile the marketplace has begun to gain needed traction, its native token BLUR hasn\u2019t been left out of the equation. Amid the increase in activity, BLUR went as high as $5 before suffering a massive retracement bringing its price to as low as $0.90.\n\nOver the past three days, BLUR has plummeted by over 80% and trades below $1 for $0.93. BLUR still ranks #131 on CoinGecko with a market cap above $350 million.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What Are Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nA consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger's state. Generally, it is implemented in a network with many processes and users. Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledgers benefit from their use because the consensus mechanism replaces much slower human verifiers and auditing.\n\nFor instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires computational power to solve an encrypted puzzle, called the hash. After the hash is solved by one miner (or a group working together), Bitcoin's PoW requires that every node on the network verifies the data that has been changed by checking:\n\nThe data structure\n\nThe block header hash\n\nThe block timestamp\n\nThe block size\n\nThe first transaction\n\nIt then completes a long transaction verification checklist. This verification takes much less time than the process of solving the hash, which is called mining, and is orders of magnitude less time-consuming than human verification.\n\nKey Takeaways A consensus mechanism is any method used to achieve agreement, trust, and security across a decentralized computer network.\n\nIn the context of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) are two of the most prevalent consensus mechanisms.\n\nConsensus mechanisms play an essential part of securing information by encrypting it and using automated group verification.\n\nHistory of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhen computers and networks began gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, shared databases were created so that multiple users could access the information they stored. Most had a centralized database with permissions that users accessed from different stations. This setup evolved into centralized networks with administrators who granted user rights and maintained the integrity of the data.\n\nThese shared databases became known as distributed ledgers because they recorded information and were networked for many users in different locations to access. One of the most significant issues that needed addressing was that of preventing data tampering and unauthorized access, whether it was malicious or not. A method to automate distributed database management was required to ensure data was not changed.\n\nThis need led to the creation of distributed autonomous consensus, where programs on a network agreed on a database's state using cryptographic techniques. Agreement was designed to be reached using encryption algorithms to create long strings of alphanumeric numbers\u2014called a hash\u2014which were then verified by programs running on the network. A hash only changes if the information input into the hashing algorithm is changed, so the programs were designed to compare hashes to ensure they matched.\n\nWhen each program running on the network created a matching alphanumeric string, the data was said to be agreed upon by consensus of the network. Thus, consensus mechanisms were made, with credit generally given to Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin creator. However, many people worked on consensus mechanisms for years before Nakamoto released the whitepaper that made Bitcoin famous.\n\nData and computer scientists such as Moni Naor, Cynthia Dwork, Adam Beck, Nick Szabo, and many others worked on and contributed to developing networked consensus mechanisms.\n\nTypes of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nThere are different kinds of consensus mechanism algorithms, each of which works on different principles.\n\nThe proof of work (PoW) is a common consensus algorithm used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin. It requires a participant node to prove that the work done and submitted by them qualifies them to receive the right to add new transactions to the blockchain. However, the bitcoin mining mechanism requires high energy consumption and long processing times.\n\nThe proof of stake (PoS) is another common consensus algorithm that evolved as a low-cost, low-energy consuming alternative to the PoW algorithm. It involves allocating responsibility in maintaining the public ledger to a participant node in proportion to the number of virtual currency tokens held. However, this has the drawback that it incentivizes hoarding instead of spending.\n\nProof of History (PoH) was developed by the Solana Project. It is similar to Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which encodes the passage of time itself cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.\n\nWhile PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms like Proof of Capacity (PoC) which allow sharing of memory space of the contributing nodes on the blockchain network. The more memory or hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger. Proof of Activity (PoA), used on the Decred blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. Proof of Burn (PoB) requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect \"burning\" them out of existence.\n\nFuture of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhile used by all cryptocurrencies, consensus mechanisms are just as important in distributed ledger networks used by enterprises. Platforms have been created for business and government use, allowing each entity to choose from modules created for their needs, backed by consensus mechanisms. Hyperledger Fabric, one of the more well-known distributed ledger platforms, provides different consensus mechanisms. For example, one entity might not need proof-of-work, considered byzantine fault tolerant, whereas another might not need that level of consensus.\n\nCryptocurrency's future may be unknown and volatile, but consensus mechanisms remain an essential part of emerging technology. They ensure data safety and integrity and keep those with nefarious intentions locked out of distributed ledgers.\n\nWhich Consensus Mechanism Is Best? The best consensus mechanism is one that fits the needs of the users. Proof of work is thought to be best for Bitcoin, while proof of stake was adopted by Ethereum and is believed to be best by its community. Other mechanisms might work better for enterprises, businesses, or personal uses.\n\nWhat Is an Example of a Consensus Mechanism? Proof of stake is one example. In this mechanism, users \"stake\" their tokens to be given the privilege of conducting work on the blockchain for rewards like transaction fees.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Consensus Mechanisms? Several have been created, but only a few have been implemented. Some types besides proof of work and proof of stake are delegated proof of stake, proof of importance, proof of elapsed time, proof of authority, and proof of capacity. Each uses different concepts to validate data changes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsensus mechanisms have become an essential aspect of distributed ledgers, databases, and blockchains because much of the world is becoming more digital. Ownership of physical assets is being tokenized on ledgers and blockchains, people without access to financial services have access through blockchains, and businesses need data security more than ever.\n\nConsensus mechanisms verify data inputs and outputs, which translates to automatically auditing the digital transactions that are common today\u2014without human oversight or intervention. They create an environment where you don't need to trust that the other party in a transaction is honest because they ensure the information is unalterable and secure.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

Now, with a new expansion on the horizon, the cryptocurrency is set to make waves again. Volt Inu (VOLT) has recently announced its decision to launch on Polygon, a move that could transform the platform and bring about new possibilities for users and investors alike.\n\nVOLT Inu ($VOLT) is making a splash in the crypto community thanks to two key elements: true deflationary techniques and additional revenue generation. VOLT was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly, it was also launched on the Binance Smart Chain \u201cBSC\u201d, adding more exposure and enabling people who don\u2019t want to pay hefty ETH fees to get involved. This brought overwhelming success; there are twice as many VOLT holders on the BSC than on Ethereum!\n\nFollowing user demand, the team has decided to list VOLT on Polygon. 25% of VOLT\u2019s liquidity will be shifted to Polygon. For users, this will introduce a new alternative for holding VOLT in a decentralized manner with minimal gas fees while targeting a new user base. Polygon is a popular layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers fast, cheap, and efficient transactions. Its significance in the crypto space lies in its ability to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues and improve user experience, making it a promising solution for developers and users.\n\nBridge liquidity burn\n\nIn 2022, attacks and hacks have targeted cross-chain bridges exploiting billions of dollars worth of tokens. Seeing this as a threat, VOLT decided to reduce the liquidity (amount of tokens) locked in their bridge contract to reduce its impact. Not only does this secures the ecosystem, but it also increases the deflationary mechanism by VOLT\u2019s burn addresses.\n\nA total of 44.85 trillion VOLT tokens (worth $74.5M) will be burnt over five days.\n\nThe first burn amounting to $14.9M was completed on Feb 13th. In the third burn, 8.97 trillion VOLT tokens (worth $14.9M) were burned.\n\nIn the 4th burn that concluded today (Feb 17th), another 8.97T #VOLT tokens (worth $14.9M) have been burned.\n\nMoreover, 89 projects added the voltichange widget in their first month, thus making each of them deflationary and also increasing the VOLT burn rate.\n\n89 projects added the #VOLTICHANGE widget to their website in its first month \u26a1\ufe0f Every new project means more burns, more exposure, more adoption \ud83d\udd25#VOLT $VOLT #VOLTINU #VOLTARMY pic.twitter.com/smueRn2Xx3 \u2014 Volt Inu \u26a1\ufe0f (@VoltInuOfficial) February 13, 2023\n\nVolt Inu ($VOLT) is tackling DeFi from multiple angles with its \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 ecosystem, aiming to bring profits back to the native token and supporting its deflationary purpose. Volt Inu offers a permissionless Decentralized Exchange which allows projects to get listed for free alongside an NFT collection with exclusive access to events, meetups and rights within the VOLT ecosystem, such as P2E games."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is classified as property by the IRS. That means crypto income and capital gains are taxable and crypto losses may be tax deductible. Last year, many cryptocurrencies lost more than half their value and major crypto exchanges \u2014 like FTX \u2014 collapsed. The silver lining is you may be able to reduce your 2022 tax burden if you lost money in crypto. CNBC Select talked with Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, a crypto tax software company, about how cryptocurrency is taxed and what you need to know if your crypto exchange declared bankruptcy.\n\nHow cryptocurrency is taxed\n\nMany of cryptocurrency's most passionate advocates emphasize the decentralization of the blockchain, but it's important to remember that the federal government is keeping tabs on who is earning how much when it comes to crypto and taxes. \"The biggest misconception in this space in general is that people think that crypto is invisible to the regulators. But that's not the case,\" says Chandrasekera. There's a permanent record of all your activity on the blockchain and many crypto exchanges report to the IRS. For the most part, the IRS treats crypto as an asset subject to its rules on capital gains and losses, similar to stocks. When you buy cryptocurrency or stocks, the original purchase price of the asset becomes its cost basis. When you sell that asset, you're taxed based on the difference between the cost basis and the sale price. Capital gains and capital losses are based on the net total of all transactions that year. If you sold five different assets for a total gain of $10,000 and three other assets at a total loss of $15,000, then you have $5,000 in capital losses. You can deduct up to $3,000 a year in capital losses from your taxable income and can carry over losses exceeding that annual limit to future years. For example, if you had $5,000 in capital losses in 2022, you can reduce your taxable income by $3,000 in 2022 and apply the remaining $2,000 in losses to 2023. Capital gains are taxed differently based on how long you hold an asset before selling. Short-term capital gains taxes apply to assets you've held for one year or less and long-term capital gains taxes are assessed when you sell an asset after owning it for more than one year. Your exact capital gains rate depends on several factors, but long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains. And you may not have to pay any capital gains tax at all, depending on your filing status and taxable income. If you use digital currency for daily transactions, you may want to enlist the help of a tax professional. For everyone else, tax software offered by companies such as H&R Block, TurboTax, TaxSlayer can help you file your taxes when you have taxable-crypto transactions.\n\nH&R Block Learn More On H&R Block's secure site Cost Costs may vary depending on the plan selected (Free Online, Deluxe, Premium, or Self-Employed) - click \"Learn More\" for details\n\nFree version Yes (for simple returns only)\n\nMobile app Yes\n\nLive support Available with some pricing and filing options Terms apply.\n\nTurboTax Learn More On TurboTax's secure site Cost Costs may vary depending on the plan selected - click \"Learn More\" for details\n\nFree version TurboTax Free Edition. ~37% of taxpayers qualify.

However, there are instances where cryptocurrency is taxed as income, in which case it's subject to a marginal tax rate of up to 37% depending on your income level and filing status. Below we examine how each type of crypto transaction is classified for tax purposes: 1. Selling cryptocurrency (capital gains) Anytime you sell cryptocurrency the gain or loss in value has tax implications. This type of transaction tends to be straightforward, especially if you aren't frequently buying and selling crypto, and is classified under capital gains. 2. Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another (capital gains) A crypto swap is when you directly trade one cryptocurrency for another without exchanging your crypto for cash. Chandrasekera points out that many people mistakenly overlook this type of transaction when it comes to taxes because no cash was realized. But if you exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin or Ethereum for Bitcoin, it's a taxable event. 3. Spending crypto for goods or services (capital gains) Using crypto to buy goods or services has the same tax implications as selling it. \"It could be as little as you're going to Starbucks and spending a fraction of a Bitcoin to buy something and that could result in a taxable gain,\" Chandrasekera says. When you're buying anything with crypto, the taxable gain or loss is based on what you paid for the cryptocurrency and its value at the time of the transaction. 4. When you earn cryptocurrency (income) When you earn cryptocurrency it is considered taxable income based on the value of the coins at the time of receipt. This includes crypto earned from activities such as: Mining cryptocurrencies\n\nCrypto staking income\n\nYields on crypto accounts\n\nCrypto earned as regular pay or bonuses 5. Anytime you receive free coins (income) There are instances where you may receive free crypto and the value of the digital coins you receive is considered income. Two common scenarios where you may receive free crypto are airdrops and hard forks. An airdrop is when cryptocurrencies are given away for free and it's typically used as a marketing tool for new cryptocurrencies. A hard fork is a bit more complicated but to simplify it, it's essentially when a cryptocurrency splits into two types of tokens or coins. When this happens, you'll have your original coin and a new coin, with a separate value. The value of the cryptocurrency you receive from a hard fork is taxable income.\n\nWhat to do if your crypto exchange went bankrupt in 2022\n\nLast year, a crash in the crypto markets led to a string of crypto firms declaring bankruptcy \u2014 most notably FTX, which at its peak was valued at $32 billion. If you had crypto assets tied up in a company that's filed for bankruptcy, unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do for the 2022 tax year. \"When those bankruptcies get finalized in 2023, we will have more clarity on the amount of loss, the type of deduction you can get depending on the findings of the bankruptcies,\" Chandrasekera says. The bankruptcies could be the result of fraud or simply bad business decisions and, \"all those things affect the amount of the deduction, the type of the deduction and even when you can take the deduction,\" Chandrasekera says. It's also possible that you may get (some of) your money back, he says.\n\nSubscribe to the Select Newsletter! Our best selections directly into your inbox.

Any time you sell or exchange crypto, it's a taxable event. This includes using crypto used to pay for goods or services. In most cases, the IRS taxes cryptocurrencies as an asset and subjects them to long-term or short-term capital gains taxes. However, sometimes cryptocurrency is treated as income.

        "content": "A picture of a rock, existing as an NFT on Ethereum, has been sold for 139 ETH, Etherscan data on February 16 shows.\n\nEtherRock NFT Sold For $235,000\n\nAt the time of buying, the 139 ETH used to purchase the NFT translated to around $235,000. For this transaction, the buyer paid 0.003672481899086462 ETH, or approximately $6, at the time.\n\nDescribed as \u201cEtherRock,\u201d the NFT is among the earliest in Ethereum and across the NFT ecosystem. Only 100 of these NFTs were minted, and they have been changing hands since then.\n\nMost importantly, the creator says they were created around the same time the CryptoPunks were minted on Ethereum. There are 10,000 CryptoPunks in circulation. Over the years, CryptoPunks have remained some of the most expensive and coveted NFTs in Ethereum and across the ecosystem.\n\nThe issuer of EtherRock claims that with every new virgin rock being minted, the price of each rock will only become more expensive. As things stand, no \u201cvirgin\u201d rocks will be minted since the last 100 NFTs were all issued. Interested collectors can instead choose to buy \u201cnon-virgin\u201d rocks. All EtherRock NFTs are trustlessly managed via an audited smart contract and are deployed exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNFT Without Any Utility\n\nIt is not immediately clear who the buyer of the NFT is. What\u2019s evident is that EtherRock NFTs don\u2019t have a specific use case. They are created to exist as \u201cpets on the blockchain.\u201d What holders can do, however, is to trade the token. The original owner will profit if a buyer is willing to acquire the NFT at a higher price.\n\nPresently, there are several EtherRock NFTs that can be purchased. Even so, it cannot be immediately determined which NFTs available were acquired from the less than 30 available for purchasing, per EtherRock list.\n\nThere are only two owners of EtherRock on OpenSea. These NFTs have a 0.4 ETH in trading volumes and a floor price of 0.1 ETH.\n\nMeanwhile, on the official EtherRock site, the owner of the first EtherRock is selling the NFT for 10,000 ETH. Many of these NFTs are also not available for sale. Even the cheapest EtherRock available is listed for 235 ETH.\n\nThe purchase of the EtherRock comes at a time when the broader DeFi, crypto, and NFT markets are recovering after last year\u2019s winter saw trading volumes drop by over 90%.\n\nFeature image from nftplazas.com, Chart from TradingView.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's IQ and Other Facts About Ethereum's Creator - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is one of the most recognizable names in the world of crypto. One of the youngest crypto founders, the creator of Ethereum is often described as a \u201ccrypto prodigy\u201d and \u201cyoung genius.\u201d In this article, you\u2019ll find out what Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ is. You\u2019ll also learn more about his childhood, upbringing, academic life, path to creating Ethereum, and current net worth.\n\nHow Old Is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nButerin was born Vitaliy Dmitriyevich Buterin on January 31, 1994, which would make him 28 years old as of late 2022. He is the only child of Dmitry \u201cDima\u201d Buterin, a computer scientist and entrepreneur, and Natalia Ameline, a blockchain literacy activist.\n\nDima and Natalia married very young and had Vitalik when they were both just 21. Their marriage didn\u2019t last long, but they were determined to create a safe and loving environment for Vitalik. Even as they fled their home country, both parents moved to the same city, intent on playing an active role in their son\u2019s upbringing.\n\nWhere Is Vitalik Buterin From?\n\nVitalik was born in Kolomna, a small city near the Russian capital of Moscow, which is where he spent the first six years of his life. His parents then decided to move to Canada, disillusioned with Russia\u2019s political situation and eager to find better employment opportunities.\n\nNatalia was the first to move to Canada \u2014 she chose Edmonton, the capital of the Alberta province. A year later, Dmitry and Vitalik arrived in Toronto and were soon joined by Natalia, who wanted to be near her son. Vitalik would remain in Toronto for the rest of his childhood.\n\nWhat Is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ?\n\nWhile this hasn\u2019t been officially confirmed, numerous sources cite Buterin\u2019s IQ as 257. Any score above 130 on standardized tests constitutes a high IQ, so at nearly twice that number, Buterin\u2019s score is deemed unusually high. What\u2019s more, according to the high-IQ organization Mensa, people who score above 132 are among the top 2% of test takers. This means that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ level ranks him as one of the most intelligent people in the world.\n\nTo those who know Buterin\u2019s life story, the fact that he has an unusually high IQ is by no means a surprise. In third grade, he was placed in a program for gifted students. He was interested in mathematics and programming, developed a knack for economics, and could add large numbers in his head twice as fast as his peers. His hunger for knowledge and reputation for being a math genius followed him into his high school years.\n\nDoes Vitalik Buterin Have a PhD?\n\nLike many of the world\u2019s leading entrepreneurs, Buterin didn\u2019t even graduate from the university. And while this means he didn\u2019t obtain a PhD the traditional way, in 2018, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nAs for his academic journey, Buterin graduated from the Abelard School, one of Toronto\u2019s leading private high schools. After that, he enrolled in the University of Waterloo, where he took some advanced courses. However, by that time, he was already obsessed with blockchain technology and the idea of decentralized services. Soon enough, traveling, writing, and crypto-related research consumed all his time, prompting him to drop out of the university.\n\nWho Created Ethereum with Buterin?\n\nWhile researching various crypto projects around the world, Buterin noticed they weren\u2019t broad enough. His idea was to implement a programming language that would enable computers to solve a wide range of problems with the help of appropriate algorithms. As other existing crypto projects weren\u2019t interested in implementing his idea, there was only one possible solution \u2014 the creation of a brand-new blockchain platform by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nDubbed Ethereum, the blockchain platform built around the cryptocurrency of the same name was first introduced in 2014. Buterin wasn\u2019t alone in this \u2014 Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alise, Joe Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Anthony Di Iorio were all among the founders of Ethereum. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, Ethereum was registered in Switzerland and officially launched. Nowadays, Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin.\n\nHow Much Is Vitalik Buterin Worth?\n\nUnlike most entrepreneurs, Buterin keeps all his assets in cryptocurrencies. According to the latest estimates, he has close to 290,000 Ethereum (ETH) divided across two wallets. With ETH valued at around $1,610, the creator of Ethereum\u2019s net worth is estimated at $466 million.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrency constantly fluctuates, so Buterin\u2019s net worth is also subject to change. During the crypto boom of 2021, his assets were worth $1.5 billion at one point, earning him the title of the youngest crypto billionaire. And while he no longer ranks as a billionaire, he could become one in the future if the value of Ethereum goes up again.\n\nVitalik Buterin IQ: The Takeaway\n\nIf online rumors are anything to go by, the founder of Ethereum has an unusually high IQ of 257. Considering that he was merely 19 when he launched his immensely successful cryptocurrency, the fact that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ makes him a genius isn\u2019t hard to believe. His constant pursuit of innovation has brought him countless recognitions around the globe. He is also among the rare entrepreneurs who keep all their assets in crypto, proving that he truly believes in his mission.\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "title": "SEC vs. Kraken: A one-off or opening salvo in an assault on crypto? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a year of crypto upheavals, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s settlement with crypto exchange Kraken, announced on Feb. 9, set off yet another tremor. Agency chief Gary Gensler took to mainstream media last week to explain the agency\u2019s action, which seemed to be an attack on crypto staking \u2014 part of the validation mechanism used by a number of blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest network.\n\nThe immediate issue, in the agency\u2019s view, was that Kraken had been selling unregistered investment products. Indeed, it was advertising big returns on staking crypto \u2014 up to 21%, Gensler told CNBC.com.\n\n\u201cThe problem was they were not disclosing to the investing public the risks that the investing public were entering into,\u201d Gensler said. Moreover, the SEC's action, which required Kraken to shell out $30 million and shut down its staking operation, could have been easily avoided, he seemed to imply:\n\n\u201cKraken knew how to register, others know how to register. It's just a form on our website. They can come in, talk to our talented people on disclosure review teams. And if they want to offer staking, we're neutral. Come in and register, because investors need that disclosure.\u201d\n\nNot all in the crypto industry were totally satisfied with this response, however. \u201cI find the SEC\u2019s \u2018all crypto projects have to do is come in and register\u2019 line unbelievably insulting,\u201d tweeted Morrison Cohen LLP attorney Jason Gottlieb. \u201cThere is simply no path to registration for many crypto products.\u201d\n\nI find the SEC\u2019s \u201call crypto projects have to do is come in and register\u201d line unbelievably insulting.\n\n\n\nIt assumes there\u2019s this vast quantity of sophisticated securities lawyers advising clients, \u201cnah man, screw the SEC, yolo baby, do whatever you want.\u201d 1/6 \u2014 Jason Gottlieb (@ohaiom) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cThe registration of staking program securities is not as simple as filing a form on the SEC\u2019s website,\u201d Michael Selig, an attorney with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, told Cointelegraph. \u201cPublic offerings of securities are heavily regulated and expensive to conduct.\u201d\n\nOthers view the agency\u2019s decision to charge Kraken as the first salvo in a general assault on crypto by U.S. regulators. \u201cIf approved by a court, the settlement marks a potential turning point for cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC\u2019s broader efforts to bring the industry under its jurisdiction,\u201d reported CNN. \u201cThe move could lead to a wider clampdown,\u201d speculated The New York Times, including possibly banning staking for retail U.S. investors.\n\nBut maybe the industry was over-reacting. That is, staking as practiced by Ethereum and other blockchains as a way to reward network validators may not be on the SEC\u2019s radar screen at all. The agency could be motivated by consumer protection concerns primarily and, in this instance, it wanted to make an example of Kraken, especially in light of FTX\u2019s November collapse and the bankruptcy of assorted crypto lending firms.\n\n\u201cYes, I am sure they [the SEC] wanted to make an example of Kraken, especially because it promoted the opportunity to make returns of up to 21%,\u201d Carol Goforth, university professor and Clayton N. Little professor of law at the University of Arkansas, told Cointelegraph.\n\nRecent: Binance banking problems highlight a divide between crypto firms and banks\n\n\u201cKraken set the returns for amounts staked, not the underlying blockchain protocols. [...] Honestly, the way that Kraken operated its program looks like an investment contract under Howey,\u201d she said. The SEC uses the Howey Test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, which then requires SEC registration.\n\nBill Hughes, senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph, \u201cIt\u2019s a one-off action that is intended to not just resolve Kraken\u2019s offering but, importantly, to send signals across the space about what features of staking-as-a-service the SEC believes are problematic.\u201d If another staking service fails to pay attention to these signals, they too can expect the SEC to take action, said Hughes, adding:\n\n\u201cI think the SEC hopes the market gets the message and adjusts accordingly \u2014 as they\u2019d probably prefer to move on to other issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Kraken case is primarily about sanctioning its [Kraken\u2019s] blatant and non-transparent behavior vis-\u00e0-vis their retail customers, and not for just offering a staking-as-a-service per se,\u201d Markus Hammer, an attorney and principal at the Switzerland-based Hammer Execution consulting firm, told Cointelegraph.\n\nIs Ethereum at risk?\n\nThe market didn\u2019t necessarily see this as a one-off action on the part of the agency, however. Ether (ETH) plummeted around 6.5% on the day of the settlement announcement, its largest one-day decline since mid-December. As widely reported, Ethereum moved last year from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Dubbed \u201cthe Merge,\u201d this technical makeover was hailed by many for radically reducing the network\u2019s prodigious energy usage and carbon footprint. But some, at least, feared Ethereum was now in the sights of U.S. regulators because of its new staking protocols.\n\nEquating Kraken and Ethereum could be a mistake, though. As Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThe SEC's enforcement action against Kraken is not an enforcement action against Ethereum for using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. It was an enforcement action against Kraken for offering a staking service. Those are different things.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Ethereum could continue to function securely as a PoS network even if the SEC were to ban all staking services in the U.S., said Hougan, though he doesn\u2019t expect that to happen. \u201cActivity would simply migrate offshore or be done directly by individuals,\u201d he said. More than enough ETH could still be staked to ensure network integrity. \u201cThe main result would be that U.S. investors would lose out on both the opportunity and the risk of staking. The world, however, would go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe action is not against staking platforms but against staking service providers that organize and operate pools,\u201d Goforth said. \u201cIf the organizer controls the pools and the rates of return\u201d \u2014 as with Kraken \u2014 \u201cthen this action does suggest that the SEC will treat the program as involving the distribution of investment contracts.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, she said, \u201cif the blockchain protocol allows others to set up pools,\u201d as with Ethereum, \u201cthat is not necessarily within the rationale of this order.\u201d\n\nHughes agreed. There is nothing in the SEC\u2019s complaint that implies that staking itself is problematic. \u201cSEC\u2019s action focuses squarely on the Kraken custodial staking program, which promised a specific yield, pool funds and did not disclose risks or fees. It says nothing about ETH staking or any other chain\u2019s consensus mechanism,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum also hosts many use cases that have nothing to do with investing (e.g., elections). Just because the network has moved to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism doesn\u2019t by itself mean that its native coin, Ether, should now automatically be classified as a security. One has to look at \u201cthe nature of the underlying multi-purpose blockchain and respective ecosystem,\u201d said Hammer. Moreover, these will need to be assessed blockchain by blockchain, he added.\n\nAn opening volley?\n\nAll this may be well and true, but could this really be an opening fusillade as part of a broader post-FTX attack on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology \u2014 and not just \u201cinvestment solutions\u201d offered by a few centralized service providers?\n\n\u201cThe SEC tends to act in an incremental way, bringing new enforcement actions that build upon prior enforcement actions,\u201d Selig told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe crypto industry is sensibly concerned that the SEC is focused on custodial staking programs today but will set its sights on staking more broadly in the future.\u201d\n\nHughes tends toward the more limited view, mainly \u201cbecause that is what this complaint is on its face. Whether the SEC gets more aggressive and goes after core blockchain functionality is to be seen.\u201d\n\nBlockdaemon CEO and founder Konstantin Richter appeared to agree. \u201cWith the complaint, staking itself does not appear to be the issue,\u201d Richter told Cointelegraph. \u201cThis indicates that institutional investors that have the ability to stake can continue without using a centralized custodial exchange.\u201d\n\nHougan, for his part, isn\u2019t quite so confident that a clampdown isn\u2019t coming, telling Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cCrypto is facing a coordinated regulatory crackdown in the U.S. You are seeing that crackdown in the SEC's recent statements and actions, and in recent efforts by the FDIC, OCC and Federal Reserve to restrict the crypto industry's access to the traditional banking system.\u201d\n\nThese actions are worrisome but not surprising, continued Hougan. The numerous failures over the past year like FTX, Celsius, Genesis, BlockFi, Voyager and Terra have \u201cpointed to some significant risks in the crypto ecosystem and the need \u2014 in certain cases \u2014 for better regulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is far from the first salvo in a U.S. assault on crypto,\u201d said Goforth. \u201cThe SEC has been relatively hostile to crypto assets for years; this seems to be a continuation of that approach [...] as it continues to devote resources to case-by-case enforcement rather than offering a genuinely helpful roadmap for compliance, such as by drafting exemptions based on tailored disclosures.\u201d\n\n\u2018First inning of a nine inning game\u2019\n\nGensler may have been disingenuous when he invited exchanges like Kraken to just fill out a form on the SEC\u2019s website. SEC registration is an involved undertaking. \u201cIt is an incredibly difficult process, often costing a million dollars or more \u2014 in legal, accounting, and investment advisor fees \u2014 the first time an issuer seeks to register a conventional security,\u201d noted Goforth. It also can take a long time to get approved.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily follow, however, that Gensler will go after Ethereum and other PoS platforms. The agency chief, it might be remembered, once taught a course on blockchain technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he knows a good bit about decentralized networks and their purposes. He probably understands that the technology offers all sorts of non-investment use cases, even PoS platforms with validators that have \u201cskin in the game\u201d as they work to ensure network integrity.\n\nRecent: Multichain DEXs are on the rise with new protocols enabling them\n\nIndeed, the Kraken settlement might have only confirmed that \u201cthat the SEC still is not clear about when consumer protection regulations apply to the crypto world,\u201d Hammer opined. Before the Merge, both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarded Ether as a commodity rather than a security.\n\nOverall, the jury could still be out as to whether the SEC is engaged here in a limited regulatory action or is instead discharging the opening volley in a wider war on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Most favor the former interpretation, but as Hougan concluded:\n\n\u201cWhether the current regulatory crackdown is going to strangle crypto or ultimately unleash its full potential \u2014 I think it's too early to say. The right kind of regulatory progress could be incredibly positive for crypto, but overly restrictive or punitive regulation would be crippling. [...] We're in the first inning of a nine-inning game.\u201d"

        "content": "Have you ever wondered who owns the most Ethereum? As one of the most popular altcoins on the market today, Ethereum has attracted countless investors. However, only a handful of these buyers have spent enough to be considered Ethereum whales.\n\nWhile there are a number of people who have earned a significant amount from their Ethereum investment, some have achieved greater returns than others. Read on to learn more about the biggest Ethereum users.\n\nWho Owns the Most Ethereum?\n\nWith a balance of around 12,940,565 Ether, the Eth2 Deposit contract currently stands as the largest Ethereum wallet. This wallet accounts for a little over 10% of the Ethereum in circulation today and was created as a staking contract for the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Notably, because this is a smart contract, no single address is able to access the funds.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nExploring the Largest Ethereum Holders in 2023\n\nAs demand for Ethereum continues to grow in the cryptocurrency landscape, the number of people investing in it is increasing. Notably, many of the top Ethereum investors you\u2019ll see online today aren\u2019t single individuals but groups or companies like Binance.\n\nThere were 71 million Ethereum addresses in 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, Glassnode Alerts revealed on Twitter that the amount of Ethereum addresses with a confirmed balance hit a new high. There were more than 71.3 million active addresses and Ethereum investors in the market at this time. According to the tracking site, the number of Ethereum holders has been steadily increasing over the years.\n\n(Glassnode)\n\nThere are around 3.9 million active crypto wallets.\n\nThe website also found the total number of active Ethereum wallets hit an all-time high in 2022. While there\u2019s little information about the average wallet size, the report shows around 3.9 million active wallets holding at least 0.1 ETH. This accounts to around $312 in fiat currency. The amount of Ethereum investors has increased by 10% since 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ethereum\u2019s popularity has jumped by around 50% since 2020. The price of Ethereum has also jumped by around 1000% in this time.\n\n(Glassnode)\n\nVitalik Buterin only has around 51.7 ETH in his wallet.\n\nMost people consider the creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, to be one of the biggest Ethereum holders. However, Vitalik released the address of his ETH wallet in 2018, which now holds around 51.7 ETH, equalling over $56,730 in value.\n\nNotably, while Buterin\u2019s wallet might seem small, it\u2019s worth noting he has also moved the majority of his wallet's contents to new addresses. There\u2019s around 142 ETH in Vitalin\u2019s VB 3 wallet and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum located in other wallets.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\n8 out of the 10 biggest investors in Ethereum aren\u2019t individuals.\n\nLooking at the top accounts by ETH balance, we can see that 8 out of 10 of the biggest owners on the Ethereum rich list aren\u2019t individual people. The biggest Ethereum holder by far is the Eth2 Deposit contact, followed by Wrapped Ether, with 4,798,197 Ether.\n\nOther big investors in Ethereum currently include Binance, with the Binance 7 wallet holding 1.9 million Ether and the Binance 8 wallet holding over 678,000. Bitfinex, Kraken, and the Gemini contract also make up some of the top spots.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Investors\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s limited information available to determine the average Ethereum holdings of the everyday person. While estimates suggest the number of investors has increased, there\u2019s nothing to track who exactly owns what amount of ETH.\n\nWhat we do know is that Ethereum investments are continuing to attract attention at a time when more people are exploring cryptocurrencies and altcoins.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "content": "Get your daily, bite-sized digest of cryptoasset and blockchain-related news \u2013 investigating the stories flying under the radar of today\u2019s crypto news.__________Regulation news\n\nThere is \u201ca fundamental clash between traditional banking regulatory approaches and the crypto world,\u201d argued Tobias Adrian, the Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He explained that, while institutions must be able to ensure that what is happening is legal, that is \u201cvery difficult to do in a world where transactions are fundamentally anonymous.\u201d What regulators want and need to do, he opined, is fundamentally at odds with the design of crypto.\n\nEthereum news\n\nMarius VanDerWijden, a core developer on Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s upcoming Shanghai-Capella upgrade, reported on Thursday a bug on the Zhejiang testnet, saying that it was fixed. He wrote: \u201cThe last 4 and a half stressful hours of debugging culminated in this amazing bug fix. We got reports that geth nodes wouldn't sync the Zhejiang devnet correctly. The issue was that if a block body was empty (no tx, no withdrawals) we wouldn't initialize it correctly.\u201d Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko added that \u201ceveryone felt confident they could patch it quickly.\u201d\n\nCBDC news\n\nThe Bank of Japan announced plans to roll out a new pilot for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) program in April. There will not be real transactions taking place among participating users, only \u201csimulated transactions,\u201d Japan's central bank explained. \u201cThe aim of the pilot program is twofold: first, to test the technical feasibility not fully covered by the PoCs [Proof of Concept], and second, to utilize the skills and insights of private businesses in terms of technology and operation for designing a CBDC ecosystem in the possible event of social implementation,\u201d it said.\n\nStablecoin news\n\nUSDT issuer Tether said that \u201cin light of recent regulatory headwinds which have caused issues for BUSD and to a lesser degree USDC, USDT currently represents roughly half of the overall stablecoin market.\u201d The announcement added that Tether settled more value in 2022 than ever before and that total settlement for Tether crossed $18.2 trillion \u201cwhich was more than either Mastercard or Visa,\u201c it claimed. USDT is now backed in excess of 81% by cash and cash equivalents without any exposure to commercial paper, which includes over $39 billion in direct exposure to US Treasuries with the remainder constituted by money market funds, reverse repo agreements, and cash and bank deposits, it said.\n\nDeFi news\n\nEthereum scaling solution zkSync Era announced its Fair Onboarding Alpha, saying that \u201cthe first zkEVM on Ethereum is finally lifting the gates to let registered projects deploy on mainnet.\u201d The team also announced that zkSync Era is now full open source with the freedom to view, modify and fork the code, as well as that zkSync 2.0 has been renamed to zkSync Era, and zkSync 1.0 is now zkSync Lite. The team will be updating the protocol roadmap and publishing an overview of the next milestones soon.\n\nInvestment news\n\nThe Cornell SC Johnson College of Business announced the US-based startup Ripple as the newest sponsor of the Fintech at Cornell initiative. Per the press release, Fintech at Cornell prepares students for the digital age by engaging them with faculty members, thought leaders, entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and policymakers in discussion and debate on the socioeconomic implications and applications of AI, big data, blockchain, digital assets, digitization, and more.\n\nWeb3 security company Stelo announced a $6 million seed round of funding led by a16z crypto with participation by First Round Capital, Opensea Ventures, Chainforest, BoxGroup, Pear, Homebrew, Louis Beryl, Sabrina Hahn, Dylan Field, Dan Romero, Gokul Rajaram, Lenny Rachitsky, and others. Stelo aims to expand the reach of its tools to make transacting on the blockchain simple and safe, it said. Stelo also announced the Stelo v2 extension, the developer API to empower dapps and wallets to use the Stelo Transaction Engine, and approvals.xyz, an approval experience for users to understand their wallet health and keep it safe, it added.\n\nMining news\n\nBitcoin miner CleanSpark announced a purchase of 20,000 brand new Antminer S19j Pro+ units for $43.6 million. After coupons, the company expects to pay $32.3 million, for a discount of 25% or a total price per terrahash of approximately $13.25. The Pro+ is more power-efficient and 22% more productive than the Antminer S19j Pro model and will be shipped in batches, with deliveries starting as early as next month, lasting until the end of May, the company said. CleanSpark plans to deploy the fleet of new machines at its wholly-owned bitcoin mining locations in the USA.\n\nCareer news"

        "title": "4 Low-Risk Cryptocurrencies to Buy Right Now: Big Eyes Coin, Ethereum, Polygon, and Apecoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is known for its high volatility and the risk attached to assets. However, the ultimate nugget for most investors and traders is to often go for low-risk investment, which usually involves assessing the circumstances around the crypto asset. High risk comes with high rewards, but if you can conveniently stay patient with low-risk plays, you\u2019ll find your rhythm. High-risk plays are too dangerous because you burn down your bankroll or capital faster, which is not how you want to navigate the crypto market. You must protect your liquidity, and you give yourself multiple chances to try again and find the right trades or investments. Here are four low-risk cryptocurrencies to buy in the market right now: Apecoin (APE), Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum (ETH), and last but not least, Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nNote that cryptocurrencies are still quite volatile, but this list was made in relative comparison to the larger market.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Safety In Size\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second largest asset in the cryptocurrency market, and with huge market capitalization comes less volatility. Going by this logic, Bitcoin is the least volatile asset in the market, closely followed by Ethereum. Ethereum is also the most valuable network in the landscape owing to the massive value built on top of the chain. The network is a huge contributor to the growth of the landscape, so it\u2019s one of the low-risk ways to invest in the crypto market. Ethereum has undergone several upgrades in the past few days to ensure that it becomes fully scalable. The upcoming Shanghai launch will enable the ETH tokens staked by validators to become withdrawable, with other intricacies.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Layer-2 Ethereum Solution\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is a layer-2 Ethereum solution or side chain, as some prefer to call it. The network was created to improve, connect, and grow Ethereum and other Ethereum-compatible networks. Polygon is a highly-efficient network with impressive scalability; the network processes several transactions at a very low cost. This network has proven helpful in reducing DeFi and NFT landscape costs. NFT transactions on Polygon cost zero gas. Polygon has been impressive in the past weeks and has secured partnerships with top web2 corporations like Reddit, Starbucks, Meta, etc. What makes it relatively low-risk is its prospect for the future of blockchain and its contribution to blockchain adoption so far.\n\nApecoin (APE): Gaming Fun Meets Cryptocurrency\n\nApecoin (APE) is a gaming token created by Yuga Labs and is purported to power a game announced to launch in a few months. Yuga Labs is a mother brand to some of the most valuable NFT collections in the market. This value translates to their influence on the market, which contributed to the success of Apecoin when it launched. Apecoin launched as an airdrop to core community members and had an impressive start in 2022. Moreso, what makes this particular crypto asset relatively low-risk is the mid-term prospects it has to help holders make money.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG): New Cat On The Ethereum Block\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new meme coin project launching on the Ethereum blockchain and has enormous prospects of being one the largest meme coin projects. The cat-themed meme coin is on presale and offers an opportunity for early investors to get some tokens at a below-market price. The meme coin project aims to help its investors create wealth with innovative DeFi features, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. The project will be looking to push community events, campaigns, contests, etc., in a bid to grow the community and promote a culture that would help the project become bigger. Big Eyes (BIG) presale has already raised over $27 million and could potentially be big enough to help investors make a profit. Join the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) presale here now. And when doing so, make sure to use code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to get a 200% bonus on any BIG purchase!\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to buy and sell NFTs on Polygon - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While cryptocurrencies have been quite the rage over the past couple of years, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have risen as an alternate asset class within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This ecosystem is revolutionizing the world of art and gaming, among a host of other industries.\n\nServing as a digital certificate that proves a collectible\u2019s authenticity, NFTs also provide investors with proof of ownership and utmost security, aspects that have been instrumental in their proliferation as the future of representing real-world objects in the virtual world.\n\nAs a result, NFTs are gaining increasing popularity among crypto investors looking to invest in metaverse platforms, with many purchasing these unique digital assets on blockchain protocols like Polygon using cryptocurrencies. A layer-2 Ethereum protocol, Polygon has emerged as the preferred platform for many NFT marketplaces that offer investors the opportunity to create, buy and sell NFTs.\n\nUnderstanding the Polygon blockchain\n\nDesigned to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns, the Polygon network acts as a parallel blockchain or sidechain that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain and uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to validate on-chain transactions.\n\nApart from providing the security, interoperability and smart contract features of the Ethereum blockchain, Polygon boasts significantly lower transaction fees, or gas, and offers developers a much higher degree of flexibility and scalability than that provided by Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, Polygon has come to be known as a multichain network of Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This is largely due to its ability to deploy other blockchain networks and enable communication among them, making it most suitable for developing decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nWith its Finity Design System and Polygon Bridge, developers can not only build cross-platform DApps but also connect them to other compatible blockchain networks to transfer assets such as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs to the Polygon sidechain. Consequently, developers prefer Polygon to create NFT projects that have a high frequency of low-value transactions. They also use it to set up NFT marketplaces that enable users to list NFTs for a small fee.\n\nHow to create free NFTs on Polygon\n\nTo facilitate artists and content creators in jumping onto the NFT bandwagon, a number of platforms using the Polygon blockchain to host nonfungible tokens offer their users the ability to mint NFTs for free. Polygon NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible provide the option of \u201clazy minting,\u201d a functionality by which nonfungible token creators can monetize their content with no upfront cost involved.\n\nIt is because the NFT in question is actually minted when a user buys it. As a result, not only does this reduce the number of transactions that get relayed onto Ethereum but it also ensures that the buyer pays for the applicable gas rather than the NFT creator.\n\nIn terms of the steps to follow, an NFT creator needs to first select or create a digital file that will be converted into a bespoke nonfungible token. This file could be an image, video, GIF or even a song that will be used to create an immutable version of it on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nEven in the case of \u201clazy minting,\u201d it is necessary for the NFT creator to have a crypto wallet with sufficient amounts of Polygon\u2019s MATIC or Ether (ETH) tokens available to cover any fees that may be applicable at a later stage.\n\nOnce both of these requirements are fulfilled, a nonfungible token creator needs to choose from the different NFT marketplaces available on Polygon and connect their crypto wallet to sign in. After completing this step, the digital file needs to be uploaded onto the marketplace.\n\nTo do so, click on the \u201cFree Minting\u201d option and sign the minting authorizations that need to be provided to the marketplace. Upon completing this final step, the NFT will be put up for sale on the marketplace and will be available for purchase by other users.\n\nThe NFT remains listed on the respective marketplace, while all its related data is stored on the InterPlanetary File System, a distributed file storage protocol that permits anyone with a computer to store and share files as part of its giant peer-to-peer network.\n\nBy linking their crypto wallets with the marketplace and receiving minting permissions, NFT creators are assured that their NFT is minted as soon as the funds are deposited by the buyer and the same are then credited to their crypto wallet, without any additional hassles.\n\nIn the event that the NFT\u2019s creator wants to delist or \u201cburn\u201d an NFT that has been minted via this option, they\u2019ll have to pay an applicable gas fee before taking down the NFT from the marketplace.\n\nHow to purchase NFTs on Polygon\n\nFor investors and NFT enthusiasts who are inquisitive about how to buy NFTs on Polygon, their journey would have to begin with any of the NFT aggregators or marketplaces on the blockchain network. They may choose from Polygon NFT marketplaces such as Floor, TixHive, NFTrade, Candy Shop and Hodl My Moon in addition to OpenSea and Rarible marketplaces.\n\nWhile Hodl My Moon and TixHive are aggregators that exclusively work with the Polygon network, the others are examples of multichain marketplaces that facilitate transactions across blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana and BNB Smart Chain among others.\n\nUsers will have to link their Polygon NFT wallet with the chosen marketplace and then proceed to browse through NFT collections available on Polygon. Depending on whether it is a fixed-price sale or an auction, the process of purchasing NFTs differs slightly for platforms such as OpenSea. For fixed-price NFTs, users can add one or more of such NFTs to their cart and pay for them in one single purchase flow.\n\nAfter clicking \u201cAdd to Cart,\u201d the user needs to navigate to the cart and finish the buying process by clicking on the \u201cComplete Purchase\u201d option. Upon doing this, the user will be redirected to the wallet window where the signature request has to be accepted after switching the wallet\u2019s network to that of Polygon.\n\nFor fixed-price NFT sales, the type of token depends on the preference set by the seller and, therefore, the buyer will have to comply with the price. For Polygon NFTs, the most common preference is that of Polygon ETH or MATIC tokens, with the former being bridged to the Polygon network.\n\nBy bridging ETH tokens to the Polygon network, users can save on the high and volatile gas or transaction fees requested by the Ethereum network, thereby bringing down the cost of acquisition.\n\nTo make an offer for an NFT or to place a bid for an auctioned NFT, users will need to lock ETH in a Wrapped Ether (wETH) smart contract to place pre-authorized bids, without the need for any additional input from the buyer.\n\nThe wETH smart contract mines an equivalent amount of wETH tokens when ETH funds are held in it, with the wETH tokens appearing in the user\u2019s wallet until it is used in a bid.\n\nHow to sell NFTs on Polygon\n\nAfter minting an NFT, the digital collectible will be visible in the \u201cMy Collections\u201d tab on the OpenSea marketplace and can be subsequently put up for sale by the NFT\u2019s owner. Here are the steps to sell NFTs on Polygon:\n\nHow to find Polygon NFTs on OpenSea\n\nAlthough the OpenSea NFT marketplace runs on the Ethereum blockchain, it allows users to buy, sell or trade NFTs from various other blockchain platforms, namely Solana, Klaytn and Polygon.\n\nOn such multichain NFT platforms, Polygon NFTs will have a Polygon logo in the upper-left corner of the representative image used to denote the item. Alternatively, one could filter Polygon from the list of blockchains that the platform supports to see only those NFTs that are hosted on the Polygon network.\n\nWith more than 43 million OpenSea Polygon NFTs already listed across categories such as art, collectibles, music, photography, sports, trading cards, utility and domain names, users could also use the range of filters available on the OpenSea platform to narrow down their eventual purchase.\n\nBy giving users the choice to browse popular NFT collections or even selecting NFTs that are priced within a defined budget range, the OpenSea marketplace offers an intuitive experience for those looking to buy their first NFT or add to their existing collection."

        "title": "How Much Crypto Does Ashton Kutcher Have? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "In addition to his already successful career in Hollywood, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s investments make up a large chunk of his overall earnings. Although some aspects of his digital assets are undisclosed, we take a dive into Ashton Kutcher\u2019s connection with cryptocurrency.\n\nHow much crypto does Ashton Kutcher have today?\n\nPrecisely how much crypto Kutcher has is debatable. Eventually, he might become transparent about it, but for now, we can only speculate. What we do know about his capital and finances are his startup investments, his affiliation with the company MoonPay, and his own company A-Grade Investments.\n\nFacts About Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Investments\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s net worth is $26 million.\n\nApart from being a well-established actor Ashton Kutcher is maybe less known for his investing savvy and enthusiasm for the world of tech, crypto, and investing. He has done pretty well for himself and plans on diving even deeper. According to Forbes, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s business farsightedness has earned him a net worth of $26 million.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nHe invested in Uber and Airbnb early on.\n\nThe A-list celebrity has a knack for spotting business success stories early on as he was an investor in companies like Uber and Airbnb when they were still up and coming. Be that as it may, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s net worth at Uber and Airbnb is still unknown.\n\n(People)\n\nAshton Kutcher is an investor in the fintech company MoonPay.\n\nHe is one of the investors in MoonPay which is a fintech startup recently valued at $3.4 billion. The company allows people to buy cryptocurrency via traditional payment methods such as bank transfer, cards, Apple pay, etc.\n\n(CNBC)\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s crypto portfolio is still unknown.\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s crypto collection has not been revealed. He is not the only celebrity to have made this choice. Nevertheless, one thing that seems to be common for stock markets everywhere is the ongoing inflation and that there has been a significant post-pandemic plummet in stocks. This might be the reason why famous people choose to keep their digital assets on the down low.\n\n(NBC News)\n\nHe co-founded a company called A-Grade Investments.\n\nKutcher co-founded the company in 2010 with Guy Oseary and billionaire Ron Burkle. Though Ashton Kutcher\u2019s crypto portfolio remains undisclosed, we know that A-Grade Investments has an impressive investment portfolio including investments in Uber, Skype, Spotify, Shazam, Airbnb, Pinterest, and so on.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nKutcher regularly invests in promising startups.\n\nKutcher has an astute business sense and often invests in promising new startups. He invested in ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and Neighborly early on. Is Ashton Kutcher a billionaire? Well, officially not yet, but it seems like he is paving the way toward becoming one.\n\n(Variety)\n\nHis wife Mila Kunis has put out 10,420 NFTs.\n\nHis celebrity wife, the famous actress Mila Kunis, has also dipped her toes in the waters of digital assets. By co-founding a company named 3050 Gang, she has established one of the few all-female crews that work with crypto. She recently put out 10,420 NFTs that are connected to her animated series called Stoner Cats.\n\n(People)\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving digital assets has always been dubbed risky business. However, Kutcher seems to be a natural at it. Ashton Kutcher\u2019s cryptocurrency trajectory is ever-changing, however, it looks like this is slowly becoming his area of expertise.\n\nSources:"

        "content": "Who are the biggest crypto whales in the market today, and what kind of impact do they have on the investment landscape? In the cryptocurrency space, \u201cwhale\u201d is the term given to an investor who holds a huge amount of coins or tokens of a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto whales are important to the cryptocurrency investment space because they can create a ripple effect in the market, generating changes in token valuation.\n\nIf you know where the whales are swimming, you can often gain a better idea of how the markets they\u2019re involved in might be influenced going forward.\n\nWho Are the Biggest Cryptocurrency Whales Right Now?\n\nDefining the biggest whales in crypto can be difficult. While some of the biggest investors in cryptocurrency are very open about how many tokens they hold, others are less straightforward. Cryptocurrency can be a highly anonymized area, so it\u2019s difficult to know for certain which big wallets belong to which people.\n\nSome of the biggest cryptocurrency whales are actually major companies responsible for trading or managing large amounts of tokens.\n\nHowever, this list focuses on individuals known to us by name (or pseudonym), and these are some of the biggest crypto whales we\u2019re aware of right now based on estimates by experts.\n\n1. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest cryptocurrency whale in the world, Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the inventor of Bitcoin. We\u2019re not sure for certain whether this is a person or a group of people, but we do know they continue to hold ownership of around 1 million BTC.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, 1 million BTC equates to around 19.2 billion US dollars. If Nakamoto is a single person, this would make them the biggest crypto whale of all time.\n\n2. Brian Armstrong\n\nBrian Armstrong is the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges on the market. The website handles billions of trades every day, and Brian has a significant amount of crypto contributing to his own net worth.\n\nEstimates suggest the CEO has a crypto fortune worth of around $6.5 billion. However, it\u2019s difficult to know what kind of crypto whale Armstrong is and which currencies he holds.\n\n3. Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor is an American entrepreneur and businessman, as well as one of the biggest Bitcoin whales of all time. Experts even believe he might have been responsible for some major movements in the Bitcoin landscape, and he currently owns more than 17,732 bitcoins, worth over $1.14 billion.\n\nSaylor\u2019s company, MicroStrategy, also began accumulating bitcoins in 2020. While we don\u2019t know exactly how many Bitcoins Michael holds today, some experts say the BTC bank for the company is worth billions.\n\n4. Chris Larsen\n\nOne of the co-founders of the credit lending company Eloan, and peer-to-peer lending site Prosper, Chris Larsen helped to launch the Ripple cryptocurrency in 2012. Ripple is a blockchain network that has grown popular in the crypto whales list over the years.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no direct information on how much crypto Larsen holds overall, Larsen does have at least 5.19 billion XRP, creating a net holding worth of around $37.3 billion.\n\n5. Changpeng Zhao\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is considered to be one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the market, though he hasn\u2019t released a lot of information about his holdings. Unsurprisingly, Zhao\u2019s crypto holdings fall into both Binance coin and Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports, Zhao\u2019s net worth is around $96 billion, but this doesn\u2019t take into account his cryptocurrency holdings, which he says he plans on donating to charity.\n\n6. Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is considered to be one of the biggest Ethereum whales on the market, though his holdings in ETH remain unknown at this time. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin was once said to hold around 355,000 Ethereum, as well as various whale-sized quantities of other coins, like SHIB, Akita, and Dogecoin.\n\nIn 2022, Vitalik announced he was no longer a crypto whale following the collapse of various coin investments. However, we don\u2019t know for certain how much he holds today.\n\n7. Tim Draper\n\nWell-known venture capitalist, tech billionaire, and entrepreneur Tim Draper is considered to be one of the biggest players on the Bitcoin whales list after he purchased 30,000 bitcoins for a bargain price when they were seized by Silk Road.\n\nThough Draper won\u2019t reveal how many bitcoins he currently owns today, he also has wallets in various other cryptocurrencies, such as Aragon\u2019s \u201cANT\u201d tokens. The tech expert is expected to be worth a little over $1 billion.\n\n8. The Winklevoss Twins\n\nThe Winklevoss twins are perhaps best known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for a social network. In a 2012 settlement, they won around $65 million in court and invested it in a stack of Bitcoin. At the time, the twins were said to purchase about 1% of all the BTC in existence.\n\nThe twins are still considered to be some of the biggest Bitcoin whales around, with around 70,000 bitcoins in their portfolio, as well as a variety of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n9. Barry Silbert\n\nBarry Silbert acquired Digital Currency Group with funds from the sale of Second-Market, an equity trading platform acquired by Nasdaq in 2015.\n\nThis conglomerate consists of five companies, one of which is Grayscale, a digital asset management company.\n\nGrayscale manages a portfolio of assets worth over $28 billion (\u00a320.6 billion), including Bitcoin and Ether. It was the first application approved to trade securities backed by Bitcoin and raised about \u00a3434 million annually.\n\n10. Jed McCaleb\n\nJed McCaleb was one of the co-founders of Ripple and is, therefore, one of the biggest XRP whales in the market today. Although McCaleb left the company following a disagreement with his other founders, he\u2019s still said to own around 3.4 billion XRP.\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, this gives McCaleb\u2019s wallet a net worth of around $1.6 billion, which makes up a significant portion of his overall wealth. Apparently, Jed also has investments in other crypto markets, though he hasn\u2019t revealed the details of his portfolio.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Whales Today\n\nCrypto whales\u2019 fortunes can be difficult to estimate because not everyone is open about their cryptocurrency holdings. The information we have about the current crypto whales is based on the news reports issued by major crypto purchases over the years. However, the volatility of the crypto market means many new whales could emerge in the future.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho are the biggest crypto whales? The biggest crypto whales are people with the largest numbers of tokens in a specific cryptocurrency. For instance, one of the top crypto whales in Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, the individual responsible for initially creating BTC. How many crypto whales are there? While we do have some information about the largest crypto whales to hit the market throughout the years, many of these people and entities remain anonymous. As such, it\u2019s difficult to determine how many crypto whales there really are. How much money do you need to be a crypto whale? Being a crypto whale isn\u2019t about the amount of money you have as much as it is about the number of tokens or coins you own in a specific currency. Crypto whales usually have around at least $10 million worth of a specific coin.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"

        "content": "A list of the biggest crypto losers of the year so far offers an insight into some of the cryptocurrencies experiencing the biggest issues this year. Overall, 2023 has been far from a lucrative year for cryptocurrencies, with some major names approaching the \u201ctop losers\u201d status.\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) lost over 50% of its value by the time June arrived and dropped beneath its $20,000 support level. Other major currencies such as Ethereum (ETH) lost approximately 70% of its value during 2023.\n\nWhile many companies experienced significant losses in the last year, some have fared worse than most. Here\u2019s your guide to the biggest losers in cryptocurrency in 2023 so far.\n\nThe Top Crypto Losers in 2023 (So Far)\n\nA significant number of the top cryptocurrency losses this year have been linked to Exchange Traded Funds. The $63 million Global X blockchain lost around 64% of its value by the close of August 2023, and many other vendors are also struggling.\n\nThough crypto-linked ETFs have gained popularity in recent years, experts believe unrest in the market has led to a number of losses. Even cryptocurrency exchange platforms like Coinbase have seen drops of around 79.6% in market value over the year.\n\nAccording to Coincodex, a tracker of some of the trending gainers and losers in crypto, 61% of cryptocurrencies are experiencing negative movement as of October 2023.\n\nThe worst performing crypto losers of the year to date include:\n\n10. SUSHI (-88.51% reduction)\n\nSUSHI is the governance token of a DeFi protocol forked from Uniswap for SushiSwap. It\u2019s also one of the top losers today. At the beginning of the year, the token was valued at $9.17, whereas as of October 2023, it\u2019s now worth around $1.10336. It\u2019s value is also more than 95% lower than its all-time high trading price.\n\n9. CVX (-88.54% reduction)\n\nCreated by Convex Value, the CVX coin allows liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim CRV boosts without locking CRV themselves. The coin previously outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but has lost over 88% of its value this year. The coin started the year with a value of $54.23 and has since dropped to $5.19.\n\n8. KDA (-89.08% reduction)\n\nOtherwise known as Kadena, the KDA token is among the top loser coin options listed this year. This coin belongs to a blockchain with a braided, high-throughput Proof of Work system, running Chainweb. In January 2023, the coin was worth $12.24, and its value as of October 2023 has dipped to $1.407247.\n\n7. FTM (-86.91% reduction)\n\nFantom, or FTM is a token belonging to a next-generation blockchain solution. The company behind the technology claims it\u2019s the world\u2019s first DAG based smart contract system. At the start of the year, FTM tokens were trading at $2.44 each. The price rose slightly throughout January to $3.36, before dropping to only $0.228661 as of October 2023.\n\n6. AMP (-89.98% reduction)\n\nAMP has emerged as one of the biggest crypto losers 2023 has created so far. This digital collateral token exists on the Ethereum blockchain, and is used to facilitate value transfers. In January 2023, the token reached a value of $0.55503, before dropping to approximately $0.004964 by October.\n\n5. GALA (-91.21% reduction)\n\nGALA is a coin designed for the new age of gaming, and powers the Gala Games ecosystem. Despite a strong background in decentralized gaming, and a low inflation rate, the GALA coin has emerged as one of the major loser coins in 2023. At the beginning of the year, it was trading at around $0.462875, and is now trading at $0.041096.\n\n4. ONE (-91.41% reduction)\n\nKnown as the \u201cHarmony\u201d coin by collectors, ONE, is the token of the Harmony protocol, which aims to scale blockchain transactions for lower latency and increased speed. In January 2023 the coin had a value of 0.37809, and is now trading at $0.019988.\n\n3. GLMR (-95.79% reduction)\n\nOtherwise known as Moonbeam, the GLMR coin is one of the major market losers in cryptocurrency right now. Moonbeam leverages Ethereum and Polkadot technology as part of the Polkadot network. At the beginning of January 2023, it was trading at a value of $15.35.

At the start of the year, it was trading at a value of $1 and has since dropped to $0.031066.\n\n1. LUNC (-100% reduction)\n\nThe Terra Classic coin, LUNC, belongs to the blockchain platform launched in 2019, for the development of algorithmic stablecoins. The system has since come under extreme market pressure, preventing stablecoins from maintaining their intended value. The token has dropped from a value of $1 at the start of the year to $0.000311 today.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTerra Classic or LUNC has emerged as the biggest loser coin in the crypto landscape this year, due to the extreme market pressure placed on stablecoins in 2023. However, various other well-known coins have experienced massive losses including the SAND coin for sandbox (-85.77%), the NFT coin (-81.32%), and even SOL (Solana) (-80.58%).\n\nAt this time, with so many cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, the issues facing major crypto innovators are likely to continue.\n\nCrypto Losers FAQ\n\nWhich cryptocurrency has lost the most? Terra Classic or LUNC is the cryptocurrency which has lost the most value in 2023, with nearly 100% of its value disappearing over the course of the year. Who are the losers in cryptocurrency?

Many coins have faced significant issues during 2023. In 2023, Bitcoin was the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world again for a time, but is now trading at less than 70% of its all-time high value.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"

        "content": "Interest in Non-Fungible Tokens, or \u201cNFTs,\u201d has been growing drastically over the last couple of years. Today, experts even predict the market value of NFTs will increase to more than $13 billion by 2030. But how many people have their own NFT? Read on to learn more about the number of NFT owners in 2023.\n\nHow Many People Own NFTs?\n\nAccording to a study that concluded at the end of 2021, there were approximately 360,000 NFT owners. These individuals accounted for a shared collection of more than 2.7 million NFTs at the time. Of these NFT investors, approximately 9% (equalling around 32,400 wallets) held 80% of the market\u2019s value.\n\n(Financial Times)\n\nNFT Owners in 2023\n\nThe demand for NFTs is rising as investors look for new ways to expand their portfolios with a wide range of unique products. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the current NFT market.\n\n3.3% of the UK population plans on owning an NFT, yet 78.8% say they don\u2019t know what an NFT is.\n\nNFT popularity is increasing worldwide. Around 3.3% of the UK population plans on owning an NFT in the future. At the same time, 78.8% of the population say they don\u2019t know what an NFT is.\n\nThe UK ranks second last out of all countries, with investors planning on owning NFTs in the future. The United States was fourth to last, with 3.9% planning on buying NFTs. The number one country on the list was Nigeria, with 21.7% of people saying they wanted to purchase their own NFTs.\n\n(Finder)\n\nIn 2021, trade volume for NFTs was measured at $24.9 billion.\n\nThe rising NFT sales in 2021 offered an insight into the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens. As of 2021, the trade volume in this industry was valued at $24.9 billion. This is a huge increase from the $95 million trade volume in 2020.\n\nAccording to available reports, by the end of 2021, there were also 2.7 million unique active NFT wallets trading in the marketplace. However, 49% of those wallets were connected to NFT games.\n\n(DappRadar, Fool.com)\n\n29% of US adults are interested in buying NFTs.\n\nNearly a third of surveyed US adults said they were interested in NFTs, with around 9% claiming their NFT interest was particularly high. Notably, Millennials and men were deemed the most likely to get involved with NFT collecting in the future.\n\nAround 15% of men said they already collect NFTs, and 23% of Millennials said the same. Baby Boomers were the least likely to be interested in the marketplace, with only 2% saying they would collect NFTs.\n\n(Morning Consult)\n\nApproximately 12,000 NFT sales take place every day.\n\nThe biggest NFT owners purchase hundreds of non-fungible tokens per day, according to market trackers. Around 12,000 sales are conducted in the marketplace each day, with an average value of $2000.\n\nIt\u2019s also revealed that there are around 10,000 active wallets interacting with NFTs on any given day, and around 6,000 unique buyers. This indicates a significant number of purchases are made for more than one NFT per day.\n\n(NonFungible)\n\nAxie Infinity produces the most popular NFTs.\n\nThough the number of available NFTs on the market is constantly changing, some are more popular than others. According to an NFT popularity chart by NonFungible, Axie Infinity is currently responsible for the highest number of NFT sales, with around 22,788,129 transactions.\n\nThese purchases account for over $4 billion in value. The second most popular NFT creator in terms of sales is Cryptokitties, with 2,871,438 recorded sales, followed by Ethereum Name Service, with 1,725,810 sales.\n\n(NonFungible)\n\nGary Vee is the celebrity with the most NFTs.\n\nThough it\u2019s difficult to estimate the top NFT owners around the world, some celebrities have bigger collections than others. Gary Vee currently holds around 2,961 NFTs, giving him the most significant portfolio among celebrities. He\u2019s followed by Logan Paul with 2,497 NFTs, and Snoop Dog with 1,424 NFTs in their collections.\n\nNotably, though Gary Vee has the most NFT, he isn\u2019t the richest NFT owner among celebrities. Mark Cuban\u2019s NFT portfolio is almost five times the value of the one owned by Gary Vee, at $502,610,000.\n\n(City A.M.)\n\nExploring the Popularity of NFTs\n\nA lack of tracking tools for NFT collectors makes it difficult to know for certain how many people own NFTs. However, the statistics show interest in this area has been growing at a significant rate. We\u2019re likely to see a lot of people joining famous NFT owners in the years ahead.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More NFT Guides"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is kept in crypto\u2014almost entirely in Ether. Even as crypto undergoes a bear market, the Ethereum platform continues to develop moving on to proof of stake. It also provides the framework for the most interesting developments in crypto such as DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins. So the co-founder keeps his money in the project he believes in. But how much money is that? Read on and find out.\n\nWhat Is Vitalik Buterin's Net Worth?\n\nVitalik Buterin is worth $320 million at the time of writing and Ether being valued at $1,286. This estimation of Buterin\u2019s net worth is based on his public crypto wallet in which he keeps the majority of his funds.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nDetails about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Crypto Holdings, Donations, and More\n\nWith cryptocurrencies fluctuating in response to economic and technological changes, the net worth of crypto holders changes as well. So while $320 million is the easy answer, it is important to take a look at the history of the Ethereum founder\u2019s net worth to get the whole picture.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum holdings are currently at 250,001 ETH.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin has several wallets, his main wallet contains by far the highest number of Ether. While he doesn\u2019t move funds frequently, on November 24, 2022, he moved 40,000 ETH to another address, bringing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in late 2022 to 250,001 ETH or $320 million.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nButerin used to be a billionaire, but he is currently not.\n\nVitalik\u2019s net worth exceeded $1 billion in early May 2021 for the first time. It has been fluctuating with the value of ether since, peaking at $1.5 billion on November 13, 2021 when ether was at $4,645 and he had 325,000 ETH in his crypto wallet.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nVitalik Buterin has other crypto holdings, however, much lower in value.\n\nIn the two known wallets, the mathematics prodigy owns other tokens besides Ether, including KNC, OMG, 0xBTC, and DAI. Also, in an AMA Reddit post several years ago, he revealed he had other crypto holdings including BTC. He also disclosed owning shares of Clearmatics, a blockchain company where he also serves as an advisor, and Starkware, a company specializing in cryptography. He did not specify how many shares he had in each.\n\n(Etherscan, Reddit)\n\nShiba Inu creators sent Buterin 50% of all the SHIB tokens.\n\nButerin\u2019s crypto holdings have also included memecoins that he did not actually want or ask for. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Shiba burn became famous as he destroyed 90% of the coins sent to him (worth about $8 billion at the time) and donated the rest. At the coin\u2019s peak value, the burned coins would have been worth $32.5 billion. However, Buterin burned the coins quickly saying he did not want to be a locus of that kind of power.\n\n(Business Insider)\n\nButerin donated over 50 trillion SHIB to CryptoRelief to help solve the covid crisis in India.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Shiba donation would have exceeded $1 billion at the time, however, its staggering amount could not be in the same way as fiat donations, due to regulations and price fluctuations. The donation started a conversation about crypto philanthropy and regulations.\n\n(Business Insider)\n\nVitalik owns 0.20742967% of Ether, having the 26th largest Ether account.\n\nDespite being a co-founder of the platform, for the Ethereum creator, net worth increase is not the main driver. He has been more focused on what the technology can bring beyond monetary value, including banking the unbanked and enabling smart contracts. The richest Ethereum holders are mostly exchanges and some other accounts.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nTo sum up, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is almost completely in crypto, meaning that its value fluctuates quite significantly. The current value of Buterin\u2019s 250,001 ETH is $320 million, with other crypto holdings being drastically less valuable.\n\nSources:"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked crypto by market capitalization, has recorded enormous gains in recent years both from a price level and development activity. The decentralized nature of the ecosystem has seen a section of the market align Ethereum with flipping Bitcoin (BTC) in the future.\n\nWith the asset also viewed as an investment vehicle, proponents have placed several growth targets that can be achieved as the crypto space matures. Indeed, one of Ethereum\u2019s most monitored metrics is the price action that has corrected over the last year in line with the overall crypto market downturn. One of the most watched price positions is the $10,000 spot.\n\nIs $10k possible for Ethereum?\n\nThere is no doubt that the price of Ethereum may touch $10,000, but the main question remains when? It is worth pointing out that several factors have influenced Ethereum\u2019s past price rallies. In the current state, cryptocurrency sector dynamics differ from what was observed during the decentralized finance (DeFi) token\u2019s previous skyrocketing periods.\n\nHowever, there are necessary conditions for Ethereum to reach a value of $10,000. One crucial factor would be the continued restoration of investors\u2019 trust in the crypto market, which needs to be widespread to establish a conducive atmosphere for Ethereum\u2019s substantial and sustained growth.\n\nEthereum has rallied in 2023, aiming to exit the bear market from last year. In this case, the market rally is led by assets like Bitcoin. Historically, when Bitcoin records gains, it tends to pull the rest of the market along, with Ethereum in line to benefit.\n\nImpact of network development activity\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing blockchain upgrades that peaked with the shift to the proof-of-stake (PoS) will remain influential in the asset\u2019s prospects. Analysts have also opined that the impact of the Merge upgrade will be felt in the future, with the asset reducing energy consumption while attempting to entice institutional investors.\n\nBased on this aspect, market participants believe that once investors start accessing their staked Ethereum, it might have a bullish sentiment for ETH. Notably, accessing staked ETH is slated for 2023 Q1 after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nRegarding network upgrades, the asset might also benefit from sharding, which is set to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. However, delays in the estimated 2023-2024 upgrade could hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress, while an on-time upgrade could be a significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum competition\n\nElsewhere, Ethereum also faces the threat of not realizing its full operation, considering the number of competitors joining the market. Networks such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are also emerging as possible \u2018Ethereum killers.\u2019\n\nEthereum is, however, commanding the lead mainly due to the size of the network, as evidenced by the number of active smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and support for non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nAdditionally, investors need to keep an eye on the regulatory aspect of how Ethereum might be impacted in the future. In this line, the United States regulator has recently launched a crackdown on staking, factors that could affect Ethereum.\n\nOverall, the ability to hit $10,000 is backed by several projections. For instance, the text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT stated that Ethereum will likely trade in the $5,000 \u2013 $20,000 by 2030.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nTo hit $10,000, Ethereum still has several price levels to clear, with $5,000 as a critical resistance position considering ETH had hit a record high of about $4,800 over a year ago.\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum has been attempting to hold above $1,600 as the asset targets reclaiming $1,800. By press time, Ethereum was trading at 1,666.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, ETH\u2019s one-day gauges on TradingView are dominated by mixed signals. A summary is for neutrality at 8, while moving averages recommend buying at 8. Oscillators are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 2.\n\nEthereum technical analysis.

        "title": "Price analysis of Ethereum (ETH/USD) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies\u2019 price, including Ethereum (ETH/USD) and Bitcoin, were affected by macro data released by the United States.\n\nThe middle week of February brought with it important news for traditional financial markets.\n\nIn particular, the release of US macro data, including the consumer price index (CPI) and producer prices (PPI), was much higher than expected.\n\nThis could have a significant impact on the program of the Fed, the US central bank, which may be forced to change its monetary policy again.\n\nSome bankers on the Fed board have become hawkish again, that is, in favor of raising interest rates. Specifically, there is talk of a 50 basis point increase during the upcoming March and June meetings, rather than the 25 basis points as was thought until a few days ago. This would bring the range of rates between 5% and 5.25 % over the course of the year.\n\nThe nervous reaction of the markets, as predicted in the article earlier this week, was not long in coming, with bond indices falling followed by equity indices. The Standard&Poor 500 is set to close its second consecutive week below par.\n\nHowever, digital assets have fared decidedly differently. Cryptocurrency prices rallied again, recording new highs since the beginning of the year. In particular, Bitcoin was up 10% on a weekly basis, followed by Ethereum and all other major cryptocurrencies, with weekly rises close to double digits.\n\nAmong the big names, the token of Polygon (MATIC) firmly held its place on the top step of the podium of rises since the beginning of the year (+90% YTD), continuing to reap rises week after week and heading to close its sixth consecutive week up, with a streak that has never happened in its history.\n\nIn recent hours, MATIC\u2019s price has surpassed $12.7 per token, recovering its highest level in 12 months. Should Sunday night\u2019s closing week confirm current prices, or higher, it would end the week with a gain greater than 18% for the third time since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market held other surprises, with some digital assets posting double-digit weekly gains. Among the 50 largest capitalized ones, Filecoin (FIL) and Internet Computer (ICP) stand out.\n\nFilecoin, the governance token of the first decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) data storage network, has hit a 40% rise from last Friday\u2019s levels, pushing above $6.5 per token for the first time since last August. It currently ranks 27th with a market capitalization of $924 million.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) has also seen significant growth in its weekly price, rising 30% and pushing above $6.6 for the first time since September. ICP\u2019s Blockchain was developed in 2016 by the Zurich, Switzerland-based Dfinity Foundation with the goal of enabling developers to create decentralized firewall-protected systems and services managed by smart contracts, as well as tokenized cloud computing apps and services.\n\nBoth projects are based on blockchain technology and offer innovative solutions for data management and storage. In particular, Filecoin (FIL) is designed to offer a decentralized storage solution that allows data to be securely and reliably saved without relying on a single central server.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP), on the other hand, aims to revolutionize the way cloud services are delivered by offering a platform that can manage applications more efficiently and securely. Using blockchain technology, data is protected from cyber attacks and provides greater privacy and security.\n\nFollowing the rally in recent weeks of other artificial intelligence-related projects, the positive performance of Filecoin and Internet Computer shows that the artificial intelligence-related cryptocurrency sector is attracting the interest of savvy users and the possibility of seeing innovative and reliable projects emerge by gaining adoption by enterprising investors.\n\nPrice analysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe strong performance at the beginning of the week (+9.2%) confirms the restart of the new monthly cycle, as hypothesized in the last update written on these pages at the beginning of the week.\n\nIn fact, the lows recorded between Friday and Monday of last week confirmed the market\u2019s rebound, taking prices above the highs of the previous cycle, with the $24,000 being exceeded.\n\nDespite the upward jump on Wednesday 15 February, which recorded the second best performance in the past 3 months, the red close of the next daily candle yesterday, Thursday 16 February, with prices at the lowest levels of the day that recorded the highest highs of the past six months, drew a dangerous \u2018shooting star\u2019 on the chart.\n\nIn addition, yesterday\u2019s day recorded the highest trading volume in the last quarter, raising fears of a massive prevalence of profit-taking concomitant with the break of medium-term resistance.\n\nFor this reason, it becomes important to follow the market\u2019s trend in the coming days, monitoring daily closes above $23,750, which represents daily resistance from the beginning of the month, or below $23,520, the closing level of yesterday\u2019s candle that becomes crucial support of the fledgling monthly cycle.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin\u2018s positive trend suffered a setback yesterday, but the situation remains positive, also confirmed by the Fear & Greed Index at its highest levels since November 2021.\n\nPrice analysis of Ethereum (ETH/USD)\n\nThe technical structure of Ethereum is similar to that of Bitcoin.\n\nIn the week just passed, the price rise took Ethereum above $1,720, touching a height not seen since early September last year.\n\nHowever, yesterday\u2019s bearish \u2018shooting star\u2019 candle on Thursday, 16 February, slowed the celebration of new annual highs, warning investors against new buying.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, today\u2019s close, as well as that of the next two days of the weekend, should not record closes below $1,635, a level that coincides with yesterday\u2019s lows and close, so as not to jeopardize the start of the new monthly cycle that ignited the uptrend of the past few days.\n\nIn addition, holding support at $1,635 will be a good clue to propel prices into the $1,800 area in the coming days, which is September\u2019s resistance.\n\nOtherwise, the break of support would announce a change of trend in the early part of the cycle increasing the chances of seeing $1,480 again soon."

        "title": "How To Send Ethereum Anonymously [The Simple Guide] - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Following the wake of the crypto trials that saw many people taken to court over illicit Bitcoin transactions that they assumed were anonymous, the issue of anonymity when making cryptocurrency transactions became a hot topic amongst the crypto community, especially amongst those using the native token of Ethereum, Ether.\n\nPut simply, Ether transactions are effectively classed as pseudo-anonymous because you need to conduct intense chain analysis and mine a lot of data to properly trace the identification of a person who owns an Ethereum wallet or who has recently received funds.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is completely open and transparent; this means that all transaction data that takes place upon it is publicly accessible. It\u2019s exceptionally straightforward for someone to use a tool like Etherscan to trace and track the movement of funds. They only need to know the exact Ethereum wallet address or the ID of the transaction in question.\n\nSounds easy? Well, hold your horses! If you want to join the dots and connect an ETH wallet with the real person using it, you\u2019ll need more than that. You\u2019ll need to conduct a complex chain analysis to discover where the Ether was originally bought.\n\nMost Ethereum is bought on popular exchanges and platforms, but the crypto scam platforms are lurking around the corner as well. To set aside these two types of platforms is crucial for the future of your crypto adventure. Having said that, Immediate Bitmasters is an exemplary platform that is verified and an actual trader heaven in terms of interface and tools. Because many of these platforms require users to buy crypto with a bank transfer, Paypal payment, or bank card, it\u2019s possible to find out the owner\u2019s identity that way. Plus, even those extra craft buyers who avoid exchanges and brokerages to buy crypto can still be traced through their IP address.\n\nAlongside a user\u2019s IP address, online sleuths can use methods like social engineering and triangulation to identify a person\u2019s identity behind a particular wallet.\n\nHow Do You Send Ethereum Anonymously?\n\nOk, at this point, you\u2019re probably wondering how to send Ethereum anonymously. Fear not! That\u2019s where I come in.\n\nSending ETH anonymously is actually pretty straightforward once you know what you\u2019re doing. In this section, I will show you the most straightforward way of sending Ethereum anonymously. And don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not the most tech-savvy person; this is very beginner-friendly.\n\nCreate and utilise a crypto wallet\n\nHide your IP address\n\nUse a reputable exchange or platform to send ETH anonymously\n\nHow to Hide Your IP Address\n\nYou need to hide your IP address in order to lay the foundations of solid online security. Sadly, many people are blissfully unaware of how vital it is to mask your IP online, not just for sending ETH! (But it certainly does help for that, too!)\n\nPut simply; if someone wants to find you online, they don\u2019t have to look far if you\u2019re making no effort to hide your IP address. Thankfully, you don\u2019t need to be a computer genius to do so, either. It\u2019s actually very simple and can be done in several ways, such as:\n\nA VPN\n\na proxy server\n\nTor browser\n\nPersonally, my go-to choice for masking my IP address is to use a good ol\u2019 VPN. A VPN connection serves to reroute and anonymise all traffic you send over a network you\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s your home internet router or public wifi. With a decent VPN, you\u2019ll be amazed at the level of features available to anonymise yourself.\n\nIn contrast to a VPN, a proxy server can only redirect web requests.\n\nA TOR browser is a more hardcore version of a VPN and is best reserved for those who are more well-versed in cyber security. The downside? It can be laggy and slow for a lot of users.\n\nThere is a huge demand for well-made VPNs, but all of them generally work in the same format, so I\u2019ll provide a general guide on how to set one up so you can complete the most important step; making an anonymous ETH transaction!\n\nHow to Set Up a VPN\n\nWhatever VPN you decide upon, most must be installed on your browser for it to work properly. Install the proper software through the verified VPN site, then click on it to sign up. The best VPNs naturally require payment, and you really get what you pay for here.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve signed up for a VPN and installed it, it\u2019s time to get it moving! A good VPN will give you a decent selection of countries for you to switch your IP address, simply connect, and you\u2019re good to go!\n\nAll of the traffic on your network is now being masked. Congratulations!\n\nA solid tip for using a VPN is to turn on the auto-connect feature because you can easily forget to switch it on and leave your traffic exposed.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAnd so, to sum up, this guide to making Ethereum transactions anonymously has shown that Ethereum transactions are traceable, but only if you let it be like that. There are a few tried-and-tested ways to carry out Ethereum transactions anonymously successfully.\n\nAfter all, it should be a human right to keep your financial history as personal and private as possible. However, you need to play a part and be responsible if you truly wish to retain your anonymity online and offline.\n\nAs we round off, I just want to remind you to always remember to turn on your VPN whenever you\u2019re online and, when dealing with cryptocurrencies like ETH, always ensure you use beginner-friendly and straightforward platforms like Bitcoin 360, eToro, or Binance.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Shiba Inu has dropped 4% in value during the past 24 hours, but Ethereum whales have shown signs that they are buying this dip.\n\nLarge Ethereum Whales Are Currently Scooping Up Shiba Inu\n\nAfter building up some upwards momentum during the preceding couple of days, SHIB, much like the wider cryptocurrency market, has seen some pullback in the past day.\n\nAt the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001315, down 4% in the last 24 hours. The below chart shows the trend in the price of the meme coin over the past week.\n\nLooks like the value of the asset has gone down during the last day or so | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, while Shiba Inu has seen some decline during the last day, the coin is still in the green for the past week. At its about 7% gains in this period, the asset edges out the rival coin Dogecoin\u2018s 5% profits.\n\nOver the past month as well, SHIB is still in very comfortable gains of about 24%, a performance that also happens to be much better than DOGE\u2019s as the original meme coin only managed a 6% uplift in this period.\n\nDespite the drawdown today, it looks like the Ethereum whales are still unfazed, as data from the whale tracker service WhaleStats shows 500 of the largest investors in the market have rather been buying more of the cryptocurrency in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis suggests that these humongous holders see the current dip as a buying opportunity, showing that they continue to hold bullish convictions about the meme coin.\n\nThough, it\u2019s also true that the degree of their purchases hasn\u2019t been too strong today, as SHIB is only in their top 10 purchased coins right now. Nonetheless, the sign should still be positive for the investors of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs per data from the same tracker released yesterday, Shiba Inu is also still by far the largest holding of the 2,000 largest Ethereum whales, further showing how optimistic the big players are about the coin\u2019s future right now.\n\nSHIB Gets Flipped By Litecoin (LTC) In Market Cap\n\nAs a result of the price drop observed today, Shiba Inu has conceded its place as the 13th largest coin in the sector to Litecoin. Here is a table that shows where SHIB stands among the wider cryptocurrency market in terms of the market cap right now:\n\nSHIB seems to have a market cap of about $7.2 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nShiba Inu may have dropped to 14th on the market cap list, but the gap between LTC and the meme coin is still minuscule. This means that unless one of these assets shows significant strength relative to the other, the change may not be permanent and they are likely to continue to flip each other in the coming days.\n\nFeatured image from R\u00e9mi Boudousqui\u00e9 on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Last week\u2019s sell-off signaled a correction for ETH and dragged the price to a low of $1470 earlier this week. Surprisingly, this low held as solid support for a fresh bullish wave. This rebound came earlier than expected!\n\nThings have changed so quickly, as Ethereum witnessed a fast recovery over the last 24 hours of trading. It took many by surprise with the current surge in volatility across the crypto space.\n\nThis volatility inflow was led by the sudden upswing in Bitcoin\u2019s price, which puts the second-largest crypto by market cap above $200 billion.\n\nA daily 7.3% recovery has bought ETH back to around its previous multi-month resistance level. It trades at $1,666 and is now on the verge of breaking out. Undoubtedly, it is important to note that the bulls are back at full speed.\n\nMeanwhile, the expected correction level was the $1350 \u2013 $1400 price range, where the diagonal support line is drawn. But unexpectedly, Ethereum found solid support nearby and rebounded far above those price ranges.\n\nThe newly initiated leg-up is expected to hit $2k with a big price movement in the coming days. However, it may face some hurdles around the $1.7k level before soaring higher.\n\nAs of now, buy orders are getting filled faster than sell. If ETH continues to experience a high bid, more volumes will keep the price rising in the near term.\n\nEthereum Key Level To Watch\n\nThe price is currently facing a resistance level of $1,678. If it flips this holding resistance, the next stop would be $1,788 and $1,950. The resistance to watch above the $2k lies at $2,170 and $2350.\n\nEthereum has left some crucial support untested. But if the asset attempts a pullback, the level to consider for support is $1,473, followed by $1,403. There\u2019s also support at $1,350, which remains a key untested level.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $1,678, $1,788, $1,950\n\nKey Support Levels: $1,560, $1,473, $1,403\n\nSpot Price: $1,666\n\nTrend: Bullish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Los Angeles, California, 14th February, 2023, Chainwire\n\nDeSo, the layer-1 blockchain that raised $200M from top funds, including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinbase-Ventures, announces the launch of DeSo Chat Protocol (DCP) \u2014 an on-chain, end-to-end encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol for web3.\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol (DCP) is a secure, censorship-resistant messaging platform for web3 communities. It is built with cross-chain interoperability in mind, so it can easily integrate with any blockchain. With its ability to sustain 40,000 messages per second, it can scale to millions of users, cross-chain, with little to no gas fees. Ethereum is the first integration for DCP, but there are plans to partner with other chains like Solana and Near in the future. When an Ethereum user logs in using MetaMask, they are instantly airdropped enough $DESO to send up to 10,000 messages.\n\nFounder of DeSo, Nader Al-Naji, explains, \u201cWith its built-in interoperability, DeSo Chat Protocol is positioned to become the universal communicator for the entire web3 ecosystem. For the first time ever, NFT marketplaces like Opensea, MagicEden, and Rarible can integrate DCP to provide a safe, secure way for founders, builders, or creators to communicate regardless of the blockchain they use.\u201d\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol is a powerful communication tool that can be added to any app on any blockchain. Additionally, developers can create new, never before seen social experiences 100% on-chain. Furthermore, it provides white-labeling options so that web3 apps can launch with group chat and community-building capabilities without having to set up everything from scratch. DeSo is currently in talks with apps and NFT marketplaces to integrate DeSo Chat Protocol in the near future. That means communities on platforms like Opensea, Rarible, and MagicEden can communicate with each other no matter which app or blockchain they\u2019re on.\n\nAl-Naji continues, \u201cThat means that a user on Opensea can send a message to someone on Rarible, and a user on Rarible can send a message to someone on MagicEden without having to worry about gas fees making it easier than ever for web3 communities to scale and monetize on-chain with heightened safety and security to prevent hacks.\u201d\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol offers a wide range of features that popular messaging apps like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp have, such as group chat management, message edits, end-to-end encryption, and emoji reactions. Additionally, thanks to the money-native features that come with the DeSo blockchain, DCP can be customized to build novel messaging experiences that integrate NFTs, Social Tokens, Gated Messaging, and much more!\n\nCrypto communities have been clamoring for their own web3 native chat application for the last several years, especially after the high-profile Bored Ape Yacht Club hacks on Discord. Most web3 communities are fragmented and forced to use archaic web2 messaging protocols, leaving them susceptible to hacks, attacks, and stolen assets.\n\nInternet scams are expected to increase due to the explosion in popularity of AI, where deep fakes are difficult to discern from reality; blockchain-based identity and reputation could be the only way to verify whether someone is real, mitigating scams along the way.\n\nAdditionally, the DeSo Chat Protocol is positioned to become a major player in the global Blockchain Messaging Apps Market, which is expected to grow from USD 42.23 million in 2022 to USD 628.72 million by 2030 (an increase of 1389%). It stands out among other options because it\u2019s built on the DeSo blockchain, specifically designed with scalability in mind, allowing decentralized social networks to reach billions of users while offering unmatched trust and transparency thanks to everything being stored 100% on-chain.\n\nThis is yet another step towards DeSo\u2019s mission of becoming The Social Layer of Web3, a creator-led and user-owned internet powering the future of social media. With the recent launch of Openfund and MegaSwap , DeSo now boasts a full set of tools for founders and builders to launch apps that attract millions of users while creators can monetize in ways never before possible.\n\nAbout Deso\n\nDeSo is a new layer-1 blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize social media and scale storage-heavy applications to billions of users. It raised $200 million and is backed by Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, Social Capital, Polychain Capital, Winklevoss Capital, Pantera, and other blue chip funds.\n\nCheck out the full roadmap and claim your username.\n\nContact\n\nGrowth Marketing Lead\n\nAsh\n\nash@deso.org\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Presale Hits $27 Million Amid Slide In Crypto Market Cap: Ethereum & Binance Show Recovery - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The global cryptocurrency market seems to be back in the green zone after a week of bearish market sentiment that saw the global crypto market cap decline from $1.09 trillion down to $997 billion following the US Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s charges against Kraken for allegedly offering its staking as a service program as an unregistered security and immediately prompting concerns of a wider regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the time of writing, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization had risen by 1.26% to $1.01 trillion. The scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry rippled across the board leaving many cryptocurrencies to trade in the red. However, with indications of the beginning of the next bull cycle, top cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have seen slight recoveries in prices while Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has made steady gains in its Initial Coin Offer (ICO).\n\nEthereum, Setting Up For The Bull Run\n\nAfter being within striking distance of hitting the $1700 mark last week, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price slumped to $1471.68 but later overcame the $1500 resistance to trade at $1508.97, a rise of 1.43% from the previous day.\n\nAs indicators are pointing at a bull cycle ahead, experts suggest that a clear move for Ethereum above the $1,600 and $1,610 resistance levels may rejuvenate a move to the $1,700 mark. The analysis indicates that an even higher gain could raise Ethereum\u2019s potential of sending its price toward the $1,780 resistance zone or even $1,840 not too far from now.\n\nBinance Coin, A Longer Wait For the Bull Run?\n\nBinance Coin (BNB), an exchange token that lets holders enjoy reduced trading fees and perks for exchange users, saw its price crumble from $334.44 down to $283.7 caused by the crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Department of Financial Services, before marginally recovering a day later to trade at $292.37.\n\nDespite BNB\u2019s recovery, its price continues to remain highly volatile with experts suggesting that it may bounce back and achieve $380 or may plummet further to $260 before eventually making a bull run.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Setting the Benchmark in Crypto Presale\n\nA community-owned cat-based meme token, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has now become the most successful presale in cryptocurrency in recent times as it has now raised over $27 million in presale tokens. And as a mark of celebration, Big Eyes Coin is giving away five PlayStation5s to its community.\n\nNow in its 11th stage and with 4 more left to go, Big Eyes Coin plans to reach its $50 million presale target before going live, and in a remarkable move that would offer higher returns to the buyer, Big Eyes Coin has extended its promotion code LAUNCHBIGEYES200, but this time it will surely expire on 20th February. Investors now have less than 7 days to make their BIG purchase using the LAUNCHBIGEYES200 bonus code that would give a 200% return on the purchase of a BIG token when the currency goes live.\n\nIn another development as far as the promotion code is concerned, investors buying a BIG in stage 11 can now use the LAUNCHBIGEYES200 bonus code and make a 300% ROI at the launch price. Big Eyes Coin can be purchased using Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (TRC20), Dogecoin (DOGE), TRON (TRX), and Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Ordinals Project: Chainspace NFT Portal linking Bitcoin, Ethereum - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Chainspace has emerged to be an exciting new avenue.\n\nOrdinals project acts like Snapchat filters.\n\nNew creativity is sparked among the Web3 builders with the smashing rise of Bitcoin NFTs by the Ordinals project. On Tuesday, its inscriptions crossed 100,000, proving that the project could bring digital assets native to various Bitcoin blockchains to keep intriguing the crypto space.\n\nSource: Ordinals Inscription; Dune\n\nThe Chainspace Emergence\n\nChainspace emerged as an exciting example, with an experimental art project connecting Bitcoin and Ethereum via a lo-fi video rendering app, binding both coins. The project expands to a total of 800 on-chain apps, each with a unique portal. On which its pseudonymous creator duo, el-ranye and Timshel, describe it as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d\n\nSimplifying the puzzle, it can be said that every app on Ordinals inscription is like a Snapchat filter, manipulating images coming from either computer or camera. It takes detailed images or footage and renders them like old-school ASCII art. This uses symbols and letters to depict real-time video viewing in an abstract and stylized manner. Every Chainspace portal offers different effects.\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project\n\n\n\n\u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf\n\n\n\n\ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e\n\n\n\ninscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi\n\n\n\nwill be minting via @ourzora\n\n\n\nmega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nAs the Ordinals can hold more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, this provides a unique experience that is not available elsewhere. All the web app are totally inscribed as digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Every portal has its unique inscription, ready to be shared among owners. The Ordinals\u2019 innovative idea is to inscribe upto 4MB of content on a single Satoshi in Bitcoin.\n\nConnecting Bitcoin & Ethereum\n\nSmart contracts connect Ethereum NFT to the Bitcoin-based Ondinal chain, holding the codes powering dApps and NFT projects. Visible Ethereum NFT artwork on the market is basically a screenshot of the Ordinal inscription. However, both are paired for an NFT buyer wishing to trade in the Ethereum version and take the Bitcoin Ordinal into custody. Currently, it\u2019s done via manual process, but efforts to automate it are ongoing.\n\nHowever, the swap of Ethereum NFT for Bitcoin Ordinal custody is a one-way process, and swapping back or holding both versions simultaneously is not allowed. The public accessibility of Chainspace portals underpins the idea that NFT owners are not interested in buying exclusive access passes.\n\n620 NFTs will be on sale on Thursday with certain active Discord users; individuals who have already shared their Chainspace creations and screenshots will be able to mint at 0.33 ETH ($550). Additional 100 NFTs would be airdropped to Web3 builders, while 60 NFTs are for the team.\n\nWhy the Buzz?\n\nAll these are readily and publicly available, which raises the question of why to bother owning something if its exclusivity is ambiguous. Also, there are no prior hints that this would happen in the future. Timsel referred to the growing buzz surrounding Ordinals and on-chain inscriptions to answer this. Betting that people are excited about the on-chain media and Web3 experimentations and love to own a portal.\n\nLiking the scenario with the public art installations, although they are open for public viewing but are owned by someone.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane.\n\n\n\nExperimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 \u2013 in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself [\u2026] They want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal here is to explore new avenues in the experimental on-chain art tools and provide each user with a unique experience."

        "content": "So, what exactly is GAS? Think of it as the fuel that powers the NEO network. Every time a transaction is processed on the blockchain, a small fee is paid in GAS. This fee is then distributed to those who hold NEO in their wallets. The more NEO you hold, the more GAS you earn. But that's not all. NEO also offers a number of other features that make it an attractive investment opportunity. For one, the project has a strong development team and a well-established ecosystem of developers who are constantly working to improve the platform. This means that NEO will likely remain relevant and useful for years."

        "content": "This article will analyze Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics through current developments of the network, performing technical analysis, and price action to determine whether it is a good time to invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and has established itself as a leading player in the crypto space. It was created in 2015 with the aim of becoming a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, Ethereum provides a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy a wide range of decentralized applications.\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has seen significant growth in terms of both its technology and its ecosystem, attracting a large developer community, partnerships with major corporations, and a growing number of decentralized applications. These factors have contributed to Ethereum\u2019s status as the second largest cryptocurrency and have solidified its position as a key player in the crypto space.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is fast approaching\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork that is scheduled to occur in March 2023. Since the Merge in September 2022, validators have been extremely important to the Ethereum blockchain because they were required to lock away their ETH as well as any incentives they had earned until a later chain upgrade.\n\nValidators will be able to recover all of the ETH that they have staked as a result of the Shanghai hard fork, and they will potentially be able to get in line to retrieve their staked tokens and remove them from the system. Almost 14% of the ETH supply will be unlocked.\n\nA withdrawal queue has been created by Ethereum developers to avoid any selling pressure in the markets. Only six validators, each worth 32 ETH, are permitted to leave the network throughout each epoch. Therefore, a total of 1,350 validators are permitted to withdraw each day.\n\nIndicators\n\nDisclaimer: The information and publications are not intended to be and do not constitute financial advice, investment advice, trading advice or any other advice or recommendation of any sort offered or endorsed by Blockzeit. You should consider seeking a financial advisor to check how the website information relates to your unique circumstances.\n\nEthereum has successfully broken through the 200-day moving average resistance, and it is now hovering above it, indicating that traders have a bullish sentiment for the second biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nIn order for the bullish case for Ethereum to continue, it is necessary for the price to maintain its position above higher time frames. The longer a certain cryptocurrency\u2019s support has been maintained, the stronger the support is expected to be.\n\nShould you buy now or wait?\n\nOn a non-logarithmic scale, and by using the line chart to avoid wicks, Ethereum on the weekly can still retest the trendline as support of the falling wedge.\n\nEthereum will be making big moves in 2024 once the price has tested the line as support. The best course of action is to wait and make sure to set your buy orders in advance to catch massive dips in Q3-Q4 of 2023.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBecause of Ethereum\u2019s robust developer community, creative usage of smart contracts, and position as a pioneer in the quickly expanding decentralized finance area, it is a fantastic investment opportunity independent of its price movement. With its capacity to run sophisticated decentralized apps, Ethereum has a large amount of room for expansion. Ethereum is a tempting investment opportunity for anyone wishing to enter the blockchain industry because of its distinctive characteristics and capabilities, which positions it well for long-term success as the blockchain ecosystem continues to develop and mature."

        "title": "10 Best Forex Brokers Accepting Ethereum (ETH) Deposits - SMN Weekly",
        "content": "RECOMMENDED FOREX BROKERS\n\nDo not invest more money than you can afford to lose.\n\nBroker Minimum Deposit Processing time FPMarkets $100 1 hour HFM $30 10 minutes OctaFX 0.03 ETH 30 minutes eToro $10 n/a Fusion Markets $1 n/a DukasCopy $100 n/a FxChoice $100 3 days Blueberry Markets $100 1 minute IronFX $100 n/a Evolve Markets 0.01 ETH n/a\n\nStop us if you\u2019ve heard this: cryptocurrencies are experiencing an unprecedented boom, and have become a convenient replacement for conventional cash. But did you know that ETH, one of the biggest crypto assets in circulation, is far more interesting that you though, and it might be a good idea to learn more about this digital coin, because by the looks of it Ethereum is just beginning to blossom.\n\nSo what is Ethereum? Technically, Ethereum is not the name of the cryptocurrency but namesake of the distribution software platform that is based on blockchain tech. ETH, or ether, is the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, which is bought and sold within the blockchain\u2019s matrix, and even though ETH is the supporting asset of the Ethereum network (it services the apps built within Ethereum ), many other digital coins can be used within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. Interactions within the network of Ethereum are called \u201ctransactions\u201d\n\nA defining feature of Ethereum is its limitless supply brough about by its inherent nature: it is a serviceable token designed as a practical assets as well as one that can bring in profit, without the risk of inflation decreasing or increasing its value.\n\nThe Ethereum platform is spread on computers all around the world, in what is consider a \u201cdecentralized\u201d network \u2013 otherwise referred to as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2013 , in which users are active life supporters, or \u201cnodes\u201d, essentially enabling the network to become immune to any sort of disruptive attacks or otherwise. The case can be summed up with the maxim \u201cthe whole is better than the one\u201d; as one computer shuts down due to benevolent actors, the Ethereum network remains virtually unscathed as thousands of other machines keep all systems up.\n\nEthereum came to be after Vitalik Buterin, of Russian-Canadian descent, started to notice flaws in Bitcoin\u2019s operations. More like shortcoming, Vitalik decided to build upon the Bitcoin ideal by expanding on its capabilities but at the same time focusing on his own project that would later become Ethereum.\n\nInitially in 2013 Vitalik came up with the idea of smart contracts \u2013 a programing method based on the fundamental axiom of \u201cif x, then y \u201c- that completely revolutionized decentralized operations by allowing just about anyone with a capable machine and computational knowledge to develop decentralized application within the Ethereum 1.0 network.\n\nWhile decentralized apps, or DApps, already existed, Buterin aimed to unify them under the same banner, that of Ethereum. A DApp is a program that runs on blockchain ware or a peer-to-peer network completely open-source under no one\u2019s jurisdiction, making is, essentially, decentralized. DApps can be any number of applications, from standards games to social media outlets, to utilizing and storing NFTs, and everything in between. Of course, the main usage of Ethereum\u2019s platform is to act as a payment mediator between transaction parties.\n\nIn Ethereum 1.0 there are no rules as there is no hierarchy of power to enforce inside regulations and control. Instead, all those individual \u201cnodes\u201d hold the power, shifting the governance system within Ethereum 1.0 into one of a pure democracy. Ether is the backbone of these operations, the currency that allows all processes to function within a certain consensus-based framework.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest use is to create the so-called \u201csmart contracts\u2019. It\u2019s what separates this crypto asset\u2019s environment from others, and is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d 0f the ETH network. Smart contracts are standardized systems within Ethereum that enable various processes to function and run smoothly. It\u2019s essentially an automated agreement that runs of four foundational pillars:\n\nA cryptographic voucher system enabling the creation of various systems and assets to be built on pre-existing blockchains.\n\nPeer-to-peer capabilities that form the matrix of ETH system-running computers, scratching the need for a central server. Most cryptocurrencies run on P2P networks.\n\nConsensus algorithms acting as decision making apparatus for the ETH blockchain, with every 15 seconds marking the endorsement of a new consent, generally one having to do with the addition of new blocks to be added to the blockchain tech.\n\nThe Turing virtual machine allows for complex and demanding processes to be smoothly performed on the ETH network, in turn increasing Ethereum\u2019s ability to handle \u201cheavier\u201d programs.\n\nEthereum is arguably the most advantageous of all crypto assets, with millions of users relying on it as a means of digital transfers. With Ethereum 2.0 coming (pilot phases have already been launched), this massively successful crypto system has deserved its spot as Bitcoin\u2019s main competition. ETH adoption has spread like wild fire, and many want in on the action. That\u2019s why big brokerage companies have rallied their engineers, their system administrators, and payment operators, all in the effort to make Ether a payment method. Here we have some of the best brokers offering ETH-based deposit and withdrawal methods.\n\nFPMARKETS\n\nFP Market might be one of the best brokers in the world today, and that is saying something when you consider how competitive things have gotten. This entity has it all, and one should look only at the ASIC and CySEC licenses to know for a fact that the firm is not only safe but abundant in options and features; there is a lot to do here. Moreover, the broker has a base of operation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines which allows it to offer its services to markets in Kenya, Malaysia, and South Africa. On top of everything, the firm has a stable Canadian presence.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time up to 1 hour Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 1 day\n\nIt was not a surprise that ETH payments were available as well, considering the sheer amount of options. Here the minimum deposit is $100 using ETH, and the only fees are those applicable by the blockchain system. Deposits using ETH take up to 1 hour to process. Withdrawals can take up to a 1 day to process, and withdrawal system fees apply there where need. Please note that the European branches of FP Markets don\u2019t allow for ETH payments.\n\nHFM\n\nThis is a major broker and one of the main global players in the FX market industry. It has been around for a while, which is a testament to its ability to endure and adapt to the ever changing market trends, not all of which are positive. And it has done so by sticking to a principle: to offer its services in a user friendly way, but also be a broker chuck full of things to do and see. HFM goes a long way, and one way to make sure of this is to consider its regulatory power. The broker holds a license from the UK\u2019s FCA, from CySEC, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the Financial Sector Conduct Authority of South Africa (FSCA), the Financial Services Authority of Seychelles (FSA), and the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya (CMA).\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $30 Ether Minimum Withdrawal $10 Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time 1o minutes Ether Withdraw Process Time 24 hours\n\nHowever, we are here for the Ethereum-based payments. The minimum ETH deposit requirement is just $30, with no fees attached to the transaction which take sup to 10 minutes to process.\n\nFor ETH withdrawals, the minimum to request is $10, and while there are no fees issued by the broker, there can potentially be system fees. It takes around 24 hours for a withdrawal request to get processed.\n\nOctaFX\n\nOctaFX is a great broker, an alterative to the huge brokerages that at times can seem quite intimidating both in scope and in sheer quantity of services, many of which can be neglected by users wishing to follow a simple path. OctaFX is here for you, but this entity is far from being simple. One thing that stands out here is the way it organizes its interface; and don\u2019t get us wrong, there is a lot to unravel here. The broker is fully regulated by CySEC, and has an offshore branch registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadine through which OctaFX offers its services to developing trading communities in Nigeria, Malesia, and India.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit 0.03 ETH Ether Minimum Withdrawal 0.005 ETH Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time 3 to 30 minutes Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 3 hours\n\nObviously OctaFX strives for a more progressive approach, evidences also by its inclusion of ETH-based payments. Here the minimum ETH deposit requirement is 0.03 ETH with applicable system fees. The deposit process takes some 3 to 30 minutes.\n\nThe minimum withdrawal is 0.005 ETH, and there are no fees, unless you count the system ones that differ from person to person based on jurisdiction. A withdrawal request can take up to 3 hours to process.\n\neToro\n\nOver the last couple of years eToro has really expanded, and has morphed into an impressive broker rivaling the bigger names of the industry. In part due to its savvy marketing campaign, and in part due to the broker\u2019s services themselves, eToro\u2019s current state is that of a massive and reputable FX broker that is reaching for the stars. With licenses from CySEC, the FCA, ASIC, and the Financial Services Authority Seychelles, it\u2019s obvious that this one eToro does not want to stop until it reaches the furthest edges of the world.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $10 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees conversion fees Ether Withdrawal Fees conversion fees, $5 per transaction Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nEthereum payments are part of its plan, and here the conditions are sublime. The minimum ETH deposit is just $10.\n\nThere is a withdrawal fee of $5 for each ETH transaction, and there are also conversion fees depending on the user\u2019s base currency.\n\nFusion Markets\n\nFusion Markets is a superb blend of new school broker aesthetic and a certain king of simplicity that not many brokers realize is a trend of value. Toped with some great trading services, and a double regulatory combo from both ASIC and the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC), results in a broker that is definitely worth your time.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $1 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nFusion Markets has said yes to ETH payments, and allows for both ETH-based deposits and withdrawals. There are no fees for wither withdrawals and deposits using Ether, if you don\u2019t count the ones applied by the payment systems. There is no minimum deposit requirement; it\u2019s only $1.\n\nDukasCopy\n\nDukasCopy is a Swiss broker, and that should be enough to convey the seriousness and severity of its operations, as Switzerland is the top European FX destination, and perhaps only second to the US on the global scale. DukasCopy is heavily regulated by the pedantic Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), but is also approved by the Financial and Capital Market Commission of Latvia for offering service to Europeans, as well as a Financial Services Agency of Japan (JFSA) regulation for for Japanese users.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nIt is a serious broker. And part of its operations are the availability of various crypto-based payment methods, including ETH. The minimum deposit requirement is $100, and the only fees here are those issued by the payment systems themselves.\n\nFXChoice\n\nFXChoice is another sublime broker that pretty much covers all the basic necessities and then some. It is particularly useful to users wishing to experience a more docile FX trading environment, as the broker has made sure to simplify everything and arrange it in an accessible manner. However, unlike others, FXChoice has not sacrificed practicality and abundance for accessibility; the broker is filled with opportunities for both novice and pro users. It holds a license from the Financial Services Commission of Belize (FSC), but is registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees 0.5% per transaction Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 3 days\n\nAll ETH deposits are charged a 0.5% deposit fee, where the minimum amount to invest is $100. Withdrawals take up to 3 days to process, and there are payment fees issued by the systems not by FXChoice.\n\nBlueberryMarkets\n\nAs one of Australia\u2019s most popular, and definitely more unique, FX brands, BlueberryMarkets is like that friend that never ceases to amaze with his radiant positivity and charm. This one might have moved on, but BlueberryMarkets stays with you for good. We have known BlueberryMarkets for a long time, and each time is seems to have evolved for the better. This broker has everything you have being looking for, like ETH-based payments. And it is all kept stable with its ASIC and Securities Commission of the Bahamas regulations.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal $50 Ether Deposit Fees no fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time instant Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nThe minimum deposit using ETH is $100, it is processed instantly and there are no payment fees. The minimum withdrawal amount is $50, with attached system fees.\n\nIronFX\n\nSometimes it\u2019s good to be an accessible broker.
