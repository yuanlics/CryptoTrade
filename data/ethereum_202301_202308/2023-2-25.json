        "title": "Along came Polygon: The blockchain doing serious business with big names including Starbucks and Mastercard - Fortune",
        "content": "It\u2019s been a brutal 12 months for crypto, with prices plummeting, companies collapsing, and one-time industry leaders heading to prison. But amid the negative noise, blockchain firm Polygon has quietly thrived and persuaded some of the biggest names in business to take up its technology.\n\nThose include Mastercard, which is using Polygon to help fledgling music artists mint their own NFTs, and Starbucks, which is running a rewards program on the platform. The company also cut partnership deals with Meta, Disney, and the NFL. Meanwhile over 6 million Redditors have used Polygon to create custom blockchain avatars.\n\nOne of several blockchains built to complement Ethereum by bringing it to scale, Polygon is a success story as it bucks the brutal forces of Crypto Winter. Yet even with millions in the bank and a major upgrade set for March, it must overcome doubts about its security and break free from a well-funded pack of competitors.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nThe first thing to understand about Polygon is that it doesn\u2019t work on its own\u2014it needs Ethereum.\n\nThat\u2019s fine, because Ethereum doesn\u2019t really work on its own either, at least not when demand is high. The Ethereum blockchain, built to be a decentralized global computer quickly, can get bogged down at times of high demand. It slows to a crawl and so-called gas fees soar if the network is flooded by transactions from NFT owners, gamers, DeFi traders, and others.\n\nHence the need for services like Polygon, which acts as a sidechain that relieves congestion by connecting to Ethereum and letting users process transactions on it. Just as subways and buses increase the number of people who can travel through a city at once, scaling solutions such as Polygon allow more transactions on Ethereum\u2014and they\u2019re faster and cheaper.\n\nScaling Ethereum has become its own industry. Polygon alone raked in a staggering $450 million in funding in February 2022 at a valuation of $20 billion. Meanwhile, competitors Optimism and Matter Labs (makers of zkSync), both of which count Andreessen Horowitz as a lead investor, last year raised $150 million and $200 million, respectively.\n\nPolygon competes with so-called layer-2 blockchains that sit atop Ethereum. These layer-2s use different rollup approaches to scaling\u2014putting transactions in batches and then processing them on their own chain before stamping a summary of those transactions on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOne such approach, known as zero-knowledge or zk-rollups, is employed by the likes of Starknet and zkSync. This approach relies on a cryptographic proof that is super lightweight in data terms but not especially fast.\n\nThe other main approach is known as Optimistic rollups. Used by outfits like Optimism and Arbitrum, this approach is cheap and speedy because it assumes transactions are valid unless proven otherwise.\n\nDespite their differences, these layer-2s all inherit the stringent security standards of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s sidechain doesn\u2019t; it has prioritized onboarding users while maintaining its own, lower security standards\u2014though that\u2019s set to change.\n\nAll the deals\n\nOut of all the scaling solutions on the market, Polygon, founded in 2017, is the one consistently attracting big-name partners with in-built customer bases. The first reason for that is being among the first to the game.\n\n\u201cWe have been in Ethereum scaling research since, I would say, day one,\u201d says Polygon cofounder Mihailo Bjelic. Polygon\u2019s first-mover status and early decision to create its own token gave the project momentum. As of publication, the market cap of its MATIC token is $11.2 billion, the eighth-highest of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPolygon is also stimulating demand for decentralized computing by building on its own network projects in gaming, NFTs, and the metaverse. That creates a natural landing space for Web2 businesses looking to move into Web3. That effort is helmed by Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt, who last year was poached from his role as YouTube gaming head.\n\nWyatt credits a hiring strategy that has targeted traditional tech veterans like himself to round out Polygon\u2019s team of Web3 natives and speak directly to Fortune 500 execs.\n\n\u201cWe knew from the Big Tech side what these companies like a Starbucks or Nike or Meta are looking for, from the point of first outreach and conversation all the way through the tech integration, authentically landing it in the space, implementation, [and] go-to-market.\u201d\n\nSome companies, he says, have a \u201ccrystal clear vision\u201d of how they want to use Web3, pointing to Starbucks\u2019s NFT-based membership rewards program. Polygon Labs works with other companies to flesh out ideas and push them beyond simple use cases, such as the NFT profile pictures that spread like a virus across social media during the pandemic.\n\nStill other companies have started using the chain without any involvement from Polygon Labs. \u201cI think last week I saw Doritos launched on Polygon doing something,\u201d says Wyatt. (It was a giveaway for digital wearables in the Decentraland metaverse.) \u201cWe never even worked with them. They come right in, they know how to use the protocol, they know how to deploy [and] build off of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still early\n\nThe business partnerships double as marketing and onboarding campaigns. While they cost Polygon nothing in dollar terms, they nonetheless represent a massive investment in building up the ecosystem\u2014though one that has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAccording to data from Messari, the company brought in $4.2 million in revenue in Q3, its lowest total since Q3 2021. Messari told Fortune that figure in Q4 slipped below $4 million. Nick Garcia, a Messari research analyst, said that fr Polygon to take the next step, \u201cThey\u2019ve got to see some adoption. That\u2019s kind of the crux of it.\u201d\n\nDespite the users onboarded via Reddit and other partnerships, Polygon remains in a battle with other scaling platforms. According to analytics site DeFi Llama, there\u2019s more value (in dollar terms) floating around on the Arbitrum network than on Polygon, and Optimism is nipping at its heels.\n\nThis lack of a profitable business strategy has also led Polygon to join other big crypto names in tightening its belt. It announced this week it was laying off 100 employees, about 20% of its workforce, as part of a plan to consolidate business units.\n\nBut Polygon has the funding and temperament to win the war, with a company representative telling Fortune that it has \u201chundreds of millions of dollars on hand after last year\u2019s fundraise and over $1 billion in treasury.\u201d The latter figure is in MATIC tokens but Bjelic says that even if the token went to near $0\u2014implausible but not outside the realm of possibility in crypto\u2014its dollar holdings would be enough to handle company operations \u201cfor several years.\u201d Polygon declined to provide specifics about its burn rate or operational budget.\n\nSecurity and centralization\n\nPolygon\u2019s ample fundraising rounds from venture capital will help it ride out the current crypto winter. But that funding, along with the company\u2019s operational structure, have fueled a long-running critique of the network: that it\u2019s overly centralized.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin stated in 2021 that, as part of the tradeoff for faster, cheaper transactions, Polygon remains centralized compared to Ethereum. Messari\u2019s Garcia, though he\u2019s very bullish on Polygon, admits its sidechain is \u201cvery centralized.\u201d According to him, you\u2019d only need to take over four validators\u2014the computers that run the blockchain and process transactions\u2014to take over the entire network, at which point you could theoretically drain it of value. Such concerns were heightened this week after hiccups with some of Polygon\u2019s validators led to unfounded reports on Twitter that the network had collapsed or vanished.\n\nBjelic downplays those concerns, noting that the economics render it impractical. \u201cIt only makes sense if you can do some huge exploit,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think, as we know, nowadays it\u2019s practically impossible to cash out that amount of stolen tokens.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Polygon is taking security threats seriously. During the pandemic, it dipped into its massive treasury to buy a rollup project and fund efforts that would make Polygon more secure.\n\nThe result is the Polygon zkEVM, which it recently announced will be released in beta in March. This \u201czero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine\u201d replicates much of Ethereum\u2019s current setup for executing transactions but makes it even more hospitable for zk-rollups. Bjelic even suggests that it could be integrated directly with the Polygon sidechain, providing instant gains to security without much friction for users.\n\nEven with zkEVM on the horizon, it won\u2019t be easy to hold a lead on the technology side given how competitive the rollup space is. \u201cThe zkEVM is going to be behind the eight ball,\u201d says Garcia.\n\nNonetheless, Bjelic believes there\u2019s plenty of room for everyone. \u201cThe cake is so big, and what we are aiming to disrupt is so big, that just fighting over the current cake doesn\u2019t really make too much sense. We have this grand vision and we\u2019re working toward it.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum: A Buy Opportunity Is Underway! - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Broad markets and cryptocurrencies are preparing for more volatility, as explained in Leading Indicators Confirming A Pullback Is Underway. The intensity will not be like June nor September of last year, it will be closer to the December pullback. That said, we can clearly see that the next wave of selling will come with a buy opportunity in Ethereum (ETH). This is consistent with our crypto predictions for 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, we predicted that leading indicator Bitcoin was unable to move higher. As explained in Bitcoin: Resolution Comes After Chart Tension Is Cleared:\n\nThat said, what do we see on the Bitcoin chart currently? First, BTC did hit resistance, strong resistance. Any market that is unable to clear resistance will move back to support before it can re-attack resistance. Second, several trendlines coincide in the 19-22k area in the period February & March. This is the \u2018tension\u2019 we were talking about in our introduction. As seen, as of April, there is only one trendline above 22k which suggests that IF Bitcoin is able to get back to 23k in April/May it should be able to clear that resistance level.\n\nWhen both time and price meet resistance, when there is tension on the chart in that time/price combination, there is simply no way that a market can move higher.\n\nIt\u2019s a very simple principle that most investors nor analysts are able to \u2018see\u2019 although it\u2019s there, on the chart, visible, for anyone with an open mind.\n\nThat said, the Ethereum chart is also pretty clear. What we observe is straightforward:\n\nThe 1549-1658 area has lots of resistance. It\u2019s the 3d attempt of Ethereum to clear this area since last summer. We suspect that the 4th attempt will come with a breakout, but only in 4 to 6 weeks from now. Everything will depend on how low ETH will fall. If support at 1336 will hold, in March, we are convinced that ETH will clear 1658 not later than April of this year.\n\nOverall, what we do like most about the Ethereum chart, other than the \u2018details\u2019 outlined above, is that tension is disappearing. The candles are getting smoother, the candles are smaller, the volatility is disappearing. Needless to say, if volatility will pick up (which we expect to happen in the next few weeks) the picture might change but you can clearly see how this current period is getting smoother, certainly when compared to last summer and fall.\n\nIn our crypto research service, we will be tracking relative strength in our watchlist of 30 tokens. We also do expect to hit at least one unicorn (a multi-bagger) before the start of the summer.\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has become one of the most talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency world due to its explosive growth and numerous high-profile partnerships. The project has gained traction and made significant progress in the scaling and adoption of blockchain technology in recent years. Its success has led many to wonder if MATIC can outpace Ether as the go-to blockchain for corporations and the mainstream audience.\n\nBitboy Crypto, the popular YouTube channel run by Ben Armstrong, recently highlighted Polygon\u2019s massive momentum and wind underneath its wings, leading to speculation that it could outpace Ethereum in the near future.\n\nExplosive Growth on the Horizon\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, Polygon has settled on March 27 as the launch date for its much-anticipated ZK EVM mainnet beta network. ZK EVM is a groundbreaking technology that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their cost.\n\nIt generates cryptographic proofs to process transactions faster before those transactions are sent back to layer 1 networks, in this case, Ethereum. This technology is similar to that used by Polygon\u2019s rivals, Solana and XRP, which have faster transaction speeds and unparalleled centralization. The adoption of ZK EVM by Polygon could help it to overtake Ethereum in the near future.\n\nPartnerships Galore\n\nPolygon has already signed partnerships with Dolce and Gabbana, Disney, and Stripe, among other major corporations. Instagram\u2019s recent announcement that it would be using Polygon for its upcoming in-app NFT minting feature is another major endorsement.\n\nInstagram has over two billion monthly users, which means lots of potential traffic for the Polygon network. Nike has also joined the bandwagon, with its Web3 Studio kicking off with Polygon NFTs. DraftKings and the PGA Tour have also jumped on the Polygon train, with their NFT player cards being built on the platform.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Stellar Performance\n\nPolygon has been performing exceptionally well, with its daily active addresses recently surpassing those of Ethereum. Daily active users on Polygon have surpassed those on Ethereum, with the blockchain coming in second behind BNB Chain, which is known for being set up for a bunch of rug pulls. Polygon\u2019s NFT sales on Open Sea have also beaten Ethereum for the second straight month. These low-cost assets are popular with investors and traders alike.\n\nMATIC Price\n\nThe price of MATIC has risen dramatically over the previous two days, reaching the $1.25 threshold. Speed was gained, and MATIC is now clearly above the $1.30 resistance area. The price surged beyond the $1.50 barrier, an increase of roughly 25%.\n\nA peak was set close to $1.568, and a subsequent downward correction has begun, mirroring that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a break from the $1.40 and $1.42 support levels, indicating more weakness in the market."

Furthermore, the ETH price\u2019s recent reversal from the rising trendline triggered a near-bear cycle /correction phase, which could tumble its price below the $1500 support. Here\u2019s how you may trade this pattern.\n\nKey Points:\n\nA megaphone pattern prolongs a sideways trend in Ethereum price.\n\nUnder the influence of the Megaphone pattern, the Eth price could witness a 9-10 % downfall.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.4 billion, indicating a 10% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmid the increasing bearishness in the crypto market, the Ethereum price lost 6.75% in six days and tumbled to the current price of $1605. This ongoing bear cycle within the megaphone pattern is likely to cause a downfall below the $1500 support to reach the lower support trendline.\n\nHowever, the lower price rejection candles showcased in the recent price drop indicate that buyers are trying to reclaim the trend control. Thus, if the selling pressure in the market persists, the coin price will rise slightly higher to retest the 20-day EMA or $1660 before continuing the ongoing correction phase.\n\nAlso Read: What Do You Need To Know About Top NFT Discord Servers?\n\nHowever, for the Ethereum price to escape a sideways trend, it must breach the trendlines of the megaphone pattern.\n\nAs the prior trend before the ongoing consolidation was bullish, the Ethereum price is more likely to break the overhead trendline and resume that rally.\n\nThis potential breakout may push the coin price to the $2000 mark.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBollinger Band: The falling Ethereum price plunged below the indicator\u2019s midline, reflecting an additional confirmation for potential downfall.\n\nMACD: a slow but gradual spread between the MACD(Blue) and the signal(orange) line indicates the increasing bearish momentum in the market.\n\nEthereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-\n\nSpot rate: $1600\n\nTrend: Slightly Bullish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nResistance level- $1680 and $1788\n\nSupport level- $1500 and $1420"

Historically, in cases where some do not fall into the fray, others still join those with the most sales volume and transactions.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBut on 23 February, BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club [MAYC], Otherdeed, and Azuki recorded massive declines as attention moved to other collections. According to CryptoSlam, MAYC still led the volume ranking, but it was only because of the NFT\u2019s high floor prices.\n\nAt press time, the MAYC sales volume was $14.88 million \u2014 8.41% down from the previous 24 hours. Transactions were also down to 564, with reduced involvement of buyers and sellers. In BAYC\u2019s case, it went down to the fifth position. However, it suffered a more tremendous decline than its Yuga Labs\u2019 counterpart.\n\nFrom the image above, BAYC dumped 52.31% in volume, with double-digit decreases in transactions, buyers, and sellers. So, which collection has outperformed the usual suspects?\n\nPenguins, Valhalla, and KILLABEARS NFTs\n\nIn a surprising move, the Pudgy Penguins collection broke into the top 10. Launched in 2021, Pudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based collection comprising 8,888 penguin NFTs. The project was also an instant hit during the season when profile picture projects (PFP) were the center of attraction.\n\nAt press time, Pudgy Penguins\u2019 sales volume was $2.43 million in the last 24 hours. This represented a 41% increase within the said timeframe. However, data from the NFT aggregator revealed that an incredible increase in buyer and seller participation was vital to the landmark. All in all, 297 transactions led to the rise.\n\nHowever, Pudgy Penguins was only one of many Ethereum NFTs with such a performance. KILLABEARS registered $1.128 million in sales despite being the 16th. However, the most notable surge out of the lots was the Valhalla collection.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe collection, which is a crypto-native brand for gamers, increased 483%, thereby making its 24-hour sales volume $2.43 million.\n\nDespite the giant strides recorded by these collections, sales of the Ethereum NFT ecosystem were still down. At the time of writing, the overall sales volume was $82.12 million \u2014 a 28.53% decline. Nonetheless, the decline in the blue-chip collections volume might only last a while."

        "title": "Arbitrum Scaling Solution: Everything You Need to Know - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Arbitrum is a layer 2 (L2) chain built on Ethereum that helps solve the congestion problem on the Ethereum main net. The network was developed by a New-York based company called Offchain labs.\n\nThe Arbitrum chain is a scaling solution used to confirm transactions on the main Ethereum network. The chain does this by recording Ethereum transactions and then relaying them to the Ethereum main chain at a later point. By doing this, it solves the congestion problem on the main net.\n\nHistory of Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum was founded by Offchain Labs in 2018. Offchain Labs itself was founded in 2018 by Ed Felten, Harry Kalodner, and Steven Goldfeder.\n\nFelten was a Computer Science and Public Relations professor at Princeton before he started building Offchain Labs. He also served as the Deputy Chief Technology officer of the White House between 2015 and 2017. After leaving his position at the White House, Felten went on to found Offchain Labs.\n\nAccording to Felten, the idea behind Offchain Labs came to him while he was an academic at Princeton. He says that he\u2019d started working on it back then, and only started doing it full-time after leaving his White House position.\n\nSince Felten started Offchain Labs, the company has received a lot of support. It has gotten investment from crypto juggernauts such as Coinbase Ventures, Panthera, and Blocknation since its inception.\n\nBut what is Arbitrium, and how does it work?\n\nHow Does Arbitrum Work?\n\nA big problem of the Ethereum blockchain is speed. The blockchain can only facilitate a certain number of transactions at a time, and when this number is exceeded, other transactions form a queue. This could lead to some inconvenient situations.\n\nFor example, some dApps, such as Farmers World require transactions to be completed in real-time. If these transactions aren\u2019t completed in real-time (or a close approximation), they could render the dApp worthless. The congestion on Ethereum means that these transactions could be delayed by a considerable period of time.\n\nSuch dApps now have to endure that delay because of Ethereum\u2019s popularity. There are more dApps on Ethereum now, and transaction delays have only grown. That means more transactions are being loaded into the chain, and it\u2019s taking even more time for these transactions to be completed.\n\nThere are two proposed solutions for this congestion problem on the Ethereum chain. The first solution to this problem is to embrace sharding. That is, the Ethereum chain will be split into multiple shards, which should theoretically increase the capacity of the chain to complete transactions.\n\nHowever, sharding the Ethereum network is a long and complicated process. While it already exists right now, it\u2019s not yet at a scale where it will necessarily impact transaction time. This means that dApps that want faster transaction time need to look for another immediate solution.\n\nThe second solution for this decongestion is off-chain data confirmation. This means relaying the smart contracts to an off-chain solution that confirms it and then adds it to the Ethereum chain at a later date.\n\nThis method of confirming transactions is called roll-up. According to Ethereum, rollup solutions perform transactions outside the Ethereum blockchain and then post the data to the chain where consensus is reached.\n\nThis means that certain transactions can be confirmed in real-time, while consensus over the transaction will be reached on the Ethereum main chain at a later point. Since the transaction data is included in the layer 1 blocks, the transactions retain an equal level of safety as directly confirmed transactions.\n\nThese rollups are performed by layer 2 chains, and Arbitrum is one such chain.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge and Gas Fees\n\nIn late 2022, Ethereum took a huge step towards sharding by completing the Ethereum merge. This merge was theoretically supposed to reduce congestion on the Ethereum chain and make it easier to confirm transactions through it. However, Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem has remained despite the merge. This means that Arbitrum and layers like it will probably become even more popular.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t just solve the decongestion problem on Ethereum, it also solves the gas fees problem too. The bigger the congestion on the ETH network, the higher the gas fee one has to pay for quick transactions. However, Arbitrum solves that problem because contracts are now validated in batches.\n\nThe Optimistic Arbitrum\n\nThere are two types of transaction rollup chains, and they differ because of their security models.\n\nThe first is the zero-knowledge rollups. The zero-knowledge rollups perform the computation of transactions off-chain and then submit it to the layer 1 chain through a validity proof. The summary data submitted to the chain from the rollup only defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and cryptographic proof that those changes are correct and valid.\n\nOptimistic rollups, on the other hand, submits the data assuming it is correct by default. Hence, the validity of the data is only double-checked if there\u2019s someone challenges it. To ascertain the validity of the transaction, a fraud-proof is automatically run on the changed data.\n\nArbitrum is an optimistic rollup chain, which means that data is submitted with the assumption that it is valid by default. Because of Arbitrum\u2019s optimistic data outlook, it has important advantages over zero-knowledge layer 2 chains.\n\nFor one, optimistic rollups are cheaper than zero-knowledge solutions. The gas fees are often lower per transaction batch, and the network also has lower off-chain computation costs.\n\nSecondly, optimistic rollups are directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that even layer 1 applications can easily connect to Arbitrum and enjoy faster confirmation times.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coin?\n\nLayer 2 solutions usually have native coins that are used to compensate validators. However, Arbitrum doesn\u2019t have a native coin. According to Ed Felten, the co-founder of Offchain labs, there is no plan to launch a separate Arbitrum token.\n\nThis means there is no direct way to invest in Arbitrum. However, there\u2019s been a few changes to the position of Offchain Labs when it comes to minting an Arbitrum Coin. In April 2022, a cofounder of Offchain labs, Steven Goldfeder, posted a tweet that insinuated that an \u201cArbi\u201d coin is in the works. This tweet was most likely a response to Arbitrum\u2019s competitor, Optimism, releasing an OP token.\n\nHowever, it may not be advisable for Arbitrum to drop a token right now. The bear market is still ravaging the crypto ecosystem despite Bitcoin\u2019s recent recovery, and things are still a bit uncertain. While no one can say what Offchain Labs will do for sure, it\u2019s likely that they hold off any potential token drop until the market recovers.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nVitalik Buterin has argued that layer 2 chains may be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problems, rather than a stopgap.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t have a token. This means that it\u2019s impossible for small retail investors to invest in it.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nLayer 2 chains like Arbitrum are one of the most exciting developments in crypto in recent times. This is because they could be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem. Since Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem is a big stumbling block to crypto adoption, solving it could be big news for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Could Make You A Millionaire, Just Like Bitcoin And Ethereum Did Some Years Ago - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "If you had invested in Bitcoin (BTC) when it launched in 2009, your returns could be in the millions or billions even though your initial capital was $0 because that was the cost of the coin at the time. If you got in a bit later, like when it was 10 cents in late 2010, and invested only $10, you would have been able to buy about 100 bitcoins.\n\nEven at its current low, those 100 bitcoins would be worth more than $2.4 million. Imagine if you had bought more back then.\n\nWe can do a similar calculation with Ethereum (ETH). When it launched in 2015, it first traded at $2.77 but quickly fell in value to $0.81 within 24 hours. Let\u2019s play the \u201cimagine\u201d game again.\n\nSo, if you had spent a mere $100 on day one, you\u2019d have about 36 ETH tokens, or if you bought on day two, you\u2019d have about 123 tokens. At this moment, ETH is valued at $1664.8 per token. Do the math.\n\nWhile the possibility of repeating the success of Bitcoin millionaires is slim, it is not impossible if investors get in early with their investments. Hence, Big Eyes Coin is attracting a lot of interest from smart investors who see the potential for another millionaire-making move.\n\nBig Eyes is already worth over 390%\n\nWe have seen time and again that the earlier investors buy into a cryptocurrency, the greater the profit. For most coins, there is no earlier entry point than their presale journey.\n\nRight now, Big Eyes is making huge waves as a result of how successful its presale has been, which is an indicator of how well the coin can potentially perform when it is launched to the public.\n\nFor a cat-themed meme, BIG has managed to raise $30 million in its 12th stage of the presale and can be bought for a tiny amount of $0.00049. That is still a 390 percent increase from its price of $0.0001 at the first stage. This means that those who bought it at stage 1 will profit by more than 390% of those who buy at stage 12.\n\nThere is still time to take advantage of the opportunity that BIG presents, and getting in now will still be a huge advantage for investors seeing that the presale is typically the lowest amount any coin would be bought for.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 From Zero to thousands\n\nSince its launch in January 2009, the price of bitcoin has been on a roller coaster, but the long-term trajectory has been \u201cup and to the right,\u201d as they say. The advent of Bitcoin marked the beginning of the cryptocurrency era, but it took some time before the general public became aware of it.\n\nNonetheless, it appears that cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has emerged as the most intriguing trading opportunity in more than a decade.\n\nThe coin\u2019s value has risen from $0 to $0.40, then to $1 after a few months, and then in 2011, it went to $8 before reaching $30 in the same year. At the time, this was exciting for investors, but even the most optimistic investor had no clue just how big things were going to get. Through a few ups and downs, in April 2013, the coin surpassed $100, and barely eight days later, it was trading at $230.\n\nOver the next few years, BTC flirted with different figures, and by December 2020, BTC was closing the year at $28,949. 2021 was probably the most successful year for Bitcoin investors as the coin rose to an all-time high of $68,789 before the great crash that saw the coin lose value and end at its current price.\n\nEthereum \u2013 another crypto fairytale\n\nAfter Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. It was introduced in July 2015 and went on sale for $2.77 on August 7. The coin was worth $0.81 the following day. The price stayed below $1 until January 2016.\n\nRemember that the past few years have seen a tremendous increase in the price of digital currencies. In 2021, between January and April, the price of Ethereum increased by about 300%, and the coin surpassed $3000. Yet, even without that jump, you would still be doing well if you had purchased Ethereum at $2.77.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "3 Underdog Cryptos to Buy to Win Big in 2023 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "To paraphrase a famous Mark Twain quote, reports of the death of cryptocurrencies have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, crypto has been on a red-hot run so far in 2023, outperforming most other asset classes, including stocks. In 2023, the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 40%. At the start of December, following the spectacular $8 billion implosion of FTX, a crypto exchange, Bitcoin was trading under $16,000; now it\u2019s changing hands for just over $23,000. Other digital coins and tokens have also had strong rallies since the start of January. While some market observers attempt to dismiss the current bull run, others say it is a clear sign that investors\u2019 appetite for risk has returned and that cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. In fact, many analysts see the rebound of digital coins and tokens as a clear sign of their resiliency in the wake of an industry shakeout during the second half of 2022. Whatever the reason, there\u2019s no denying that cryptocurrencies are once again marching higher. Here are three underdog cryptos to buy to win big in 2023.\n\nETH Ethereum $1,617 ADA Cardano 35.9 cents TRX Tron 6.9 cents\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nA concept image of mining an Ethereum (ETH) token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is typically thought of as the other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin. The second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum often plays second fiddle to the larger BTC, which tends to serve as a bellwether for the entire market of digital coins and tokens. Yet many crypto bulls claim that Ethereum has a brighter future than Bitcoin and that it is ETH that will prove to be the long-term winner when it comes to the future of the sector.\n\nMany crypto purists favor Ethereum because, they say, it helps to facilitate decentralized financial (DeFi) transactions and has more utility than Bitcoin. They also point to the fact that ETH is now more environmentally friendly than BTC after it underwent a transformation last September to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol. Today mining for Ethereum takes a fraction of the energy consumed when mining for Bitcoin and other cryptos. This, say Ethereum fans, will make all the difference moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore upgrades and enhancements to Ethereum are scheduled for this year. And those enhancements could serve as a catalyst for ETH. Over the past year, Ethereum\u2019s price has declined 43%. However, the crypto has been on a run so far in 2023, rising over 30%.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nA concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother crypto that has been ripping higher this year is Cardano (ADA-USD). Through almost two months of the year, ADA has gained 46%. While the current price is far below Cardano\u2019s market peak of $2.85 reached in August 2021, its recovery so far this year has been cheered by investors and analysts, many of whom see Cardano as a dark horse in the race for crypto supremacy.\n\nCardano competes head-to-head against Ethereum in the realm of DeFi and smart contracts. Cardano\u2019s underlying blockchain technology was given a boost in late 2021 when it completed the Alonzo hard fork. Fans say that the hard-fork upgrade puts Cardano on equal footing with Ethereum, though investors can purchase ADA for a fraction of the cost of a single ETH token. Proponents of Cardano recently cheered news that the crypto had surpassed 60 million blockchain transactions.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nDigital data flow on road with motion blur to create vision of fast speed transfer. Concept of future digital transformation, disruptive innovation and agile business methodology. LTRX stock\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose looking for a cryptocurrency that continues to float largely under the radar should consider TRON (TRX-USD). Founded in 2014 by Justin Sun, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who was born in China, Tron contains many of the best attributes of both ETH and ADA.\n\nLike those cryptos, TRX has smart contract functionality and operates on an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake protocol. However, Tron also runs on a decentralized, open-source blockchain operating system.\n\nTron is viewed as a favorite among smaller, lesser-known cryptocurrencies. TRX has risen 25% in 2023. It\u2019s also one of the few digital coins or tokens whose price is up over the past 12 months.\n\nIn the last year, Tron has gained 17%. Its steady, consistent gain is unusual among cryptocurrencies given the market volatility of the past few years, and it makes Tron a crypto to buy to win big in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the largest digital assets based on market capitalization and are known to dictate the trajectory of the entire market. However, the distribution of these cryptocurrencies is vastly different, with Ethereum having a significantly higher percentage of its supply held by whales compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn particular, as of February 26, 2023, around 39% of the total supply of Ethereum is concentrated among large addresses, data by crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Bitcoin, where large addresses hold only 11% of the total supply.\n\nBitcoin concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIndeed, contraction by holders metric aggregates the share of circulating supply held by whale addresses, accounting for over 1% of the supply and investors or addresses holding between 0.1%-1%. The combination of the two metrics equates to the total concentration by large holders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s onchain activity\n\nEthereum\u2019s large address concentration coincides with the network\u2019s increased development activity. The staking feature remains the main highlight for the decentralized finance ecosystem following the historical Merge upgrade.\n\nAfter months of testing, investors are set to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nAlthough the high concentration of Ethereum whales has different implications, it could hint at the investors\u2019 future price outlook for the asset. It is worth noting that as Ethereum undergoes significant developments, proponents still bet the asset might flip Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, it can be argued that Ethereum is relatively cheap compared to Bitcoin, making it affordable to amass in large amounts.\n\nImplication of whale addresses\n\nThe concentration of crypto wealth in the hands of a few large holders is a controversial topic in digital asset circles. Some argue that it is a natural outcome of the market and that wealthy individuals should be allowed to hold large amounts of digital assets.\n\nOthers, however, argue that this concentration of wealth goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and could lead to market manipulation.\n\nRegardless of varied opinions on the matter, the fact remains that Ethereum\u2019s supply is significantly more concentrated in the hands of a few large holders compared to Bitcoin. This could have important implications for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem and its price.\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,645 with daily gains of over 4%, while Bitcoin is trading at $23,657.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Solana (SOL) vs Ethereum (ETH); Which is the Best Altcoin? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) has boomed over the past years picking up an exponential growth since the mid 2020. As it gears up to take on the centralized banking and finance sector, two of the largest blockchains for decentralized activity and non-fungible tokens (NFT) \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) vs Solana (SOL) are at loggerheads to grab the trophy for the best altcoin.\n\nBoth the digital tokens have racked up a substantial valuation among the top cryptocurrencies with several upgrades lined up on their respective roadmaps. While Ethereum has been one of the oldest and most used blockchain platforms, it is the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), Solana has been touted as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d, providing faster and better transactions for the users.\n\nLet us delve in a little further to find out if Solana is better than Ethereum or the other way around.\n\nMain differences between Solana and Ethereum\n\nAmidst a constant conflict for the title of the best altcoin, it is becoming increasingly common to hear investors and developers weighing in their options between Solana vs Ethereum. Although both Ethereum and Solana are powerful blockchains, each platform has some major advantages as well as disadvantages that help the platform to stand out. In order to compare Solana vs Ethereum, let us segregate both the platforms under some basic features.\n\nDecentralization\n\nSolana is a high-performance decentralized blockchain built with the goal to enable the scalability of decentralized applications (dApps). It is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the world, with thousands of projects including DeFi, NFTs and Web3.\n\nOn the other hand Ethereum has been a major leader in terms of blockchain platforms powering thousands of decentralized transactions. Ethereum is more popular in the category of decentralization with over 2,900 dApps running on its platform whereas Solana has about 350.\n\nProcessing speed\n\nEthereum can process approximately 13-15 transactions per second. However, there are several Ethereum scaling platforms such as Polygon that helps to increase the number of nodes in the network, enhancing the transaction load.\n\nOn the contrary, Solana, does not need Layer-2 solutions to speed up its transactions. It uses a Turbine block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller fragments which in turn, makes data transfer across the network an easy task. The entire mechanism helps the blockchain perform at a whopping 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nTransaction time\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s key advantages compared to Ethereum is that it doesn\u2019t have a waiting period between processing a transaction and confirming it on the blockchain. While Solana transactions are capable of being accepted almost instantly, Ethereum has a waiting period spanning around four to five minutes.\n\nBecause transactions require less time to process, Solana is a more eco-friendly solution in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s gas-hungry blockchain, making the efficiency of SOL even more attractive. The Solana blockchain has a block time of 0.4 seconds and a block size of 20,000 transactions, compared to Ethereum\u2019s block time of 13 seconds and block size of only 70 transactions.\n\nTransaction fees\n\nEthereum is infamous for its notoriously high gas fees compared to Solana. The ETH transaction fees are quite high with users have to pay $2-$6 for just 1 transaction, depending on network traffic.\n\nConversely, one of the key advantages of Solana is its pricing offering a transaction fee of just $0.00025 per transaction. Solana is also the most inexpensive chain to drop NFTs. For comparison, the cost of deploying smart contracts on Ethereum is around $5,000+, whereas it is a meagre $30 on Solana.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity has been a major concern when it comes to cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s an important consideration when comparing Solana and Ethereum. With the recent software upgrade \u201cMerge\u201d, Ethereum shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus that will be a financial incentive against the temptation to validate fraudulent transactions.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, uses a Proof of History consensus mechanism. While this mechanism allows for considerably faster processing speeds, those speeds come at a cost. Unfortunately, Proof of History doesn\u2019t provide the same level of security.\n\nStaking: Solana vs Ethereum. Which is more profitable?\n\nCrypto staking is a process that involves \u201clocking up\u201d a portion of a user\u2019s cryptocurrency for a period of time as a way of contributing to the blockchain network. In exchange, the stakers can earn rewards, typically in the form of additional coins or tokens. In a nutshell, it is a way of earning passive income.\n\nEthereum (ETH) takes the trophy for the most staked crypto asset following the successful Merge of the Beacon Chain consensus layer with the Ethereum execution layer in 2022. On-chain ETH staking yields are currently around 4% APY.Hot on heels is Solana (SOL) with the second-highest staking transaction market cap of $12.7 billion.\n\nAs per analytics firm Nansen, most of the ETH currently staked is not profitable at current Ethereum prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) offers delegated proof of stake where tokens are delegated to validators running nodes. The Ethereum Killer staking has historically yielded around 5.5% annual percentage yield (APY). More than 16.5 million ether, worth $27.7 billion, has been staked since Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, of which 31% or 5.115 million ETH are in profit while the rest, 11.385 million ETH, are in loss.\n\nWhich Ecosystem is better for DeFi, Solana or Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is unquestionably the reigning champion in this category, as its ecosystem has been expanding and maturing for years. With a large developer community, robust development tools, and frameworks, Ethereum provides developers with a vast array of options for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is home to some of the most innovative and successful Blockchain projects, including Uniswap, Compound, and MakerDAO.\n\nAt the same time, Solana, has focused on enticing programmers who wish to create high-throughput and high-speed applications, such as DeFi and NFTs. It has already established partnerships with a number of decentralized projects, including Serum, Mango Markets, and Degenerate Ape Academy, which are attracting developers and users to its platform. Developers are beginning to take notice of Solana\u2019s unique features, such as its lightning-fast transaction speed and scalability.\n\nIn the NFT sector, Ethereum has continued to dominate, with OpenSea and Rarible being two of the most prominent NFT marketplaces. This platform has seen the rise of Axie Infinity and Gods Unchained. Uniswap and SushiSwap are two popular DEXs that use Ethereum. Because of its smart contract capabilities and established ecosystem, it has become the platform of choice for the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEX).\n\nAlternatively, Solana has been gaining impressive traction as a platform for NFT marketplaces and games. It has collaborated with a number of NFT initiatives, such as Degenerate Ape Academy, and gaming projects, such as Star Atlas, to provide consumers with unique gaming experiences. Solana is also quickly gaining popularity as a DEX platform, with Serum being one of the most promising regimens.\n\nSOL vs ETH: Which Cryptocurrency Should I Invest In?\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana can be excellent investment opportunities. However, it difficult to compare the two cryptocurrencies or two platforms and definitively say that one is better than the other. It\u2019s clear both Ethereum and Solana have major selling points.\n\nEthereum boasts long-term stability and security, along with its robust smart contract capabilities. It also has a higher trading price and more proven success as an investment. The Ethereum network is also gearing up for the next big upgrade dubbed Shanghai which aims to add new functionality. The software upgrade will separate code and data, helping Layer 2s handle smart contract code easier and quicker. This in turn will boost new smart contract functionality lowering gas fees even further.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has the edge when it comes to speed and scalability. Solana Mobile will soon make available the cutting-edge new phone from Solana, called Saga and would come pre-installed with a dApp store. The dApp store was intended to serve as a single hub through which users could access all of the decentralized applications available on the Solana network. The recent SOL rally came after Helium Network announced its migration to Solana. Solana also intends to upgrade its network by introducing new features, such as Solana Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge, and by allowing more developers and projects to utilize its platform.\n\nThe Helium network is migrating from its current L1 to Solana at the end of March, bringing with nearly 1 million hotspots worldwide across the LoRa and 5G networks \ud83d\udd25https://t.co/Bn847ghLik \u2014 Solana (@solana) February 20, 2023\n\nWhile, Ethereum has been around longer and has experienced explosive growth, Solana is not far behind prices jumping over the past few days. Which cryptocurreny to invest in right now? It depends on the individual investment style. Investors looking for less risk may feel more comfortable choosing market leader Ethereum. But for those willing to take on a bit more risk, Solana might be the best bet.\n\nRecap: Comparative Table Ethereum vs Solana\n\nEthereum (ETH) Solana (SOL) Launch Date 30 July 2015 16 March 2020 Max. Token Supply Infinite Infinite Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-History / Delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) $0.00025 per transaction Transactions Per Second 15 65,000 Programming Language Solidity The primary Solana programming language is Rust, but C, C++, and even Python are supported. Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://solana.com/\n\nConclusion\n\nIt can be concluded that Ethereum has a stronghold over the DeFi and NFT market with developers still preferring Ethereum.
