        "content": "Crypto-focused early-stage VC firm Electric Capital has found that while Ethereum has the most developers in total, a majority of monthly active developers are working on other ecosystems.\n\nDespite a bear crypto market in 2022, developers continued to create and progress towards mass adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). The crypto industry added 5% more developers in 2022 year-on-year, despite a 70% plunge in cryptoasset prices, the report released on Tuesday showed.\n\nThe year was a rocky one for cryptoassets, given the tightening monetary policy and a string of bankruptcies, stirring fears of liquidity due to contagion. Yet, the industry captured over 61,000 first-time developers \u2014 an all-time high. Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, there are now more than 23,000 developers in the industry.\n\nTotal monthly active developers based on crypto ecosystems GitHub; Source: Electric Capital\n\nCore blockchain developers focus on designing the front-end and back-end of a proposed blockchain network, which will then be used as a foundation by others. Even after a blockchain is built, they continue to develop new features and technology to improvise or activate upgrades for better functionality.\n\nElectric Capital found that developer activity in 2022 was far busier than the previous crypto winter of 2018, when bitcoin plunged 65%\n\nSince 2018, the number of monthly active developers rose nearly 300% for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, developer count quintupled from 1,084 to 5,819 in that time period.\n\nSome devs opt for emerging blockchains\n\nThe year of the Merge was significant for Ethereum, and its share of new developers for the stands at 16%.\n\nBut developers working on the Solana, NEAR and Polygon protocols rose 40% year-on-year, and added more than 500 total monthly active developers combined.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSui, Aptos, Starknet, Mina, Osmosis, Hedera, Optimism and Arbitrum were other blockchains that absorbed developer activity.\n\nThose working on software for non-fungible tokens saw a 300% jump since 2021.\n\nDeveloper engagement is an \u201cearly and leading indicator of value creation,\u201d according to the VC firm. \u201cDevelopers build killer applications that deliver value to end users, which attracts more customers, which then draws more developers,\u201d it added.\n\nAnd what about Bitcoin, recently?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022 increased interest in staking across a number of parties \u2014 including institutions.\n\nThe success of the Merge propelled Ethereum from \u201ca smart contract platform lagging behind\u201d into \u201csomething that was doing things right,\u201d Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank last valued over $3 billion, said to TechCrunch. \u201cInterest from investors grew and the appetite changed dramatically.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true: Institutional interest in ETH staking increased after the Merge, Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, said to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, by holding Ethereum, you went from holding a bet on smart contract platform to holding a bet that holds yield,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\n\nStaking is a way of earning rewards for holding a certain token (in this instance, ETH) for a certain amount of time. In return for staking, people are paid out yield or additional rewards in exchange for holding their coins to secure the network.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s like having cash in your wallet or parking your cash in a bank CD, Hougan said. \u201cYou lock your money up in the CD and the bank pays you interest. In this example, you lock your ETH up in a staking pool and earn interest.\u201d\n\nThe total reward rate for staking ETH is about 4% currently, according to Staking Rewards data. Prior to the Merge, about 287 ETH were staked per day on average. After the Merge, about 623 ETH were staked per day on average, a 117% increase in about five months, a report by Anchorage Digital stated.\n\nToday, most people participating in staking are either retail investors or crypto-native hedge funds or institutions. But as the market matures, the range of investors participating \u201cwill grow substantially,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nThere\u2019s about 15.8 million staked ETH, up from 8.8 million in January 2022, according to the CoinGecko 2022 Annual Crypto Report. As new Ethereum network upgrades are anticipated in the near future, institutional investors will become increasingly interested in the space, both Hougan and M\u00f3nica said.\n\n\u201cThere was a big jump in interest [post-Merge], but there\u2019s still a latent appetite,\u201d M\u00f3nica said. \u201cPeople are looking for the March date.\u201d\n\nIn March, Ethereum network is supposed to launch its Shanghai upgrade, which will allow people who stake ETH to withdraw it at any time.\n\n\u201cTo this point, people who have staked ETH were locking it up indefinitely,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade will allow you to withdraw staked ETH. Our view is that this will substantially grow the size of the staking market, as more investors will be willing to stake now that withdrawals are enabled.\u201d\n\nThe success of the Merge removed some uncertainty around whether and when stakers would be able to withdraw ETH, Hougan said. \u201cThat said, staking remains a largely crypto-native market; most traditional investors are still wary of risks in the market.\u201d\n\nM\u00f3nica shared that a \u201clarge majority\u201d of Anchorage Digital\u2019s clients are staking ETH. While it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d to pinpoint who, very few clients have ETH unstaked \u2014 and those who do usually just want to sell it, he added.\n\n\u201cAnybody that is crypto-native or funds or investments that are long-term are doing ETH staking to basically juice up their returns. A lot of corporations that are using the ETH Network aren\u2019t staking it yet,\u201d M\u00f3nica said, \u201ceither because they haven\u2019t figured it out from a tax perspective or they don\u2019t care enough about the 4% yield. Then there\u2019s another category of players that are holding on to ETH and are not super sophisticated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that staking isn\u2019t riskless, and many of the service providers in the space are new, Hougan said. \u201cThe market will get better and safer over time.\u201d\n\nInstitutions and other investors alike are waiting for the next stage of updates to the Ethereum network. \u201cThey\u2019re on the sidelines ready to jump in,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\n\n\u201cStaking is an interesting emerging opportunity for long-term crypto investors,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cWe expect the space to grow, not just over the next few weeks but over the next few years. For now, it is likely to be dominated by crypto-native providers and investors who can tolerate significant risk, but over time it will be mainstreamed.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), could grow by 35% versus Bitcoin (BTC) this year to hit 0.1 BTC for the first time since 2018 as it forms a classic bullish continuation pattern.\n\nEthereum price must first break key resistance\n\nDubbed an ascending triangle, the pattern forms when the price fluctuates inside a range defined by rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the ETH/BTC pair has been painting an ascending pattern since May 2021. The Ethereum token eyes a breakout above the pattern's horizontal trendline resistance near 0.0776 BTC. Breaking this level could then see the price rally by as much as the triangle's maximum height.\n\nIn other words, the ETH/BTC pair could reach the next big resistance level at 0.1 BTC in 2023, or 35% from the current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNonetheless, it is important to mention that ETH/BTC has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021. The attempts included two major breakouts in November 2021 and September 2022, which saw the pair rallying 14% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBoth rallies fizzled out inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC area, followed by extreme price corrections that took ETH/BTC back inside the triangle range. Given this multi-year hurdle, the pair could face stiff resistance inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC range, even if it breaks above the triangle.\n\nSuch a move would risk crashing ETH toward the triangle support, which coincides with its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA), represented by the red line in the chart above, near 0.070 BTC, down nearly 6% from the current price levels.\n\nETH \"deflation\" narrative\n\nEther\u2019s bullish setup versus Bitcoin appears as ETH dominance has doubled versus other crypto assets in the past few years.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s market capitalization has risen to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023, from about 10% in December 2020, when the Ethereum network started its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the launch of a dedicated staking smart contract.\n\nETH.D weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBecoming a PoS blockchain has brought two key changes to Ethereum\u2019s economy. First, users temporarily lock away a portion of their Ether holdings into Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract to earn yield. And second, the Ethereum network has started burning some transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018shark\u2019 accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play\n\nBoth changes have had a deflationary impact on overall supply. As a result, the Ethereum network now regularly produces fewer Ether tokens than are taken out of circulation, which theoretically makes ETH a \u201cdeflationary\u201d asset.\n\nETH supply change since the Ethereum PoS upgrade in September 2022. Source: UltraSound.Money\n\nThe ETH/BTC price has grown nearly 250% since December 2020 despite still being down roughly 50% from its all-time highs witnessed in 2017.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "ConsenSys, an Ethereum-focused software company best known for its flagship MetaMask wallet, is the latest crypto company to trim its payroll. On Wednesday, founder Joseph Lubin published a blog post announcing 97 layoffs\u201411% of the firm\u2019s staff.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Lubin said the cuts did not target any product staff but were instead aimed at people employed in supporting functions whose workloads have diminished during the industry downturn. (Coindesk reported rumors of the layoffs last week.)\n\nLubin declined to disclose any details about ConsenSys\u2019s financials other than saying that, like the rest of the industry, revenue has declined. But he said the firm\u2019s balance sheet was \u201cvery solid,\u201d and attributed the cuts to what he described as a temporary necessity in response to a \u201chorrible macroeconomic situation.\u201d\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic factors like inflation and supply chain issues, Lubin said the crypto industry\u2019s struggles are the result of the end of a hype cycle and, in particular, so-called \u201cCeFi\u201d (centralized finance) companies\u2014firms that drape themselves in the mantle of crypto but lack the decentralized ethos and operations of what Lubin and others view as true crypto.\n\nAccording to Lubin, some of these firms\u2014including entities like Voyager and Celsius that have gone bankrupt\u2014pursued profits in reckless fashion, often burning their clients in the process.\n\n\u201cThe downturn would have happened anyways without CeFi shenanigans but was wickedly exacerbated by CeFi. Whether they were consciously exploiting customers or just doing stupid things was hard to tell,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nIn coming months, Lubin says ConsenSys\u2014which began as a Brooklyn incubator backing dozens of Ethereum startups\u2014will further sharpen its focus to build out the most promising elements of its business.\n\nThis includes MetaMask, which has over 30 million users, and has recently added the ability for users to stake their tokens\u2014the crypto version of depositing funds to earn interest\u2014and access more third-party services. ConsenSys will also continue to build out its other flagship product, Infura, which provides crypto infrastructure services to companies in sectors like tech and banking.\n\nLubin said ConsenSys will also focus its attention on two newer services: decentralized identity and support services for elements of Web3 commerce that include NFTs.\n\n\u201cWhat lies ahead is massive potential for Web3, a multi-year journey that we are excited to embark on,\u201d said Lubin in the blog post."

Nightfall is an Optimistic Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Roll-Up that helps enable private transactions on the public Ethereum blockchain. Using Nightfall, enterprises can orchestrate private transactions efficiently on the Ethereum mainnet without compromising the transparency, data immutability and security that Ethereum provides.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:\n\n\u201cThis update marks the readiness of Nightfall to enable development of enterprise solutions. With more than six months of testnet operations, we consider this a \u2018production beta\u2019, ready for enabling client supply chain and business operations.\u201d\n\nEY first contributed Nightfall to the public domain in 2019 as a set of protocols for enabling private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In September 2021, EY teamed up with Polygon to create a beta version of Nightfall that can mitigate network congestion and high transaction prices resulting from increased usage and wider adoption of Ethereum. EY core software and service offerings in the global blockchain market \u2013 EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer \u2013 use Nightfall, and both are delivered through EY Blockchain\u2019s SaaS platform, Blockchain.ey.com.\n\nThis version of Nightfall introduces two important changes over prior versions: First, to prevent control by an organization or group, the code can be deployed on a fully decentralized basis. Second, to prevent anonymous usage while retaining an open and permissionless network model, users are required to have an enterprise-class X.509 identification certificate to deposit or withdraw. X.509 certificates are a widely adopted open standard for identification used on the internet and are available through many different certificate authorities.\n\nNightfall will remain in the public domain to facilitate the adoption of privacy-focused enterprise solutions among companies seeking to enter Ethereum and conduct meaningful business on the network.\n\nAntoni Martin, Polygon Co-founder responsible for Nightfall says:\n\n\u201cThe move to update Nightfall in the public domain is a major milestone in scaling the Ethereum ecosystem and will open up new use cases for enterprises in Web3.\u201d\n\nThe source code for Nightfall (renamed Nightfall D3) and supporting tools are in the public domain and are available on Github.\n\n-ends-\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout EY\n\nEY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people and society and build trust in the capital markets.\n\nEnabled by data and technology, diverse EY teams in over 150 countries provide trust through assurance and help clients grow, transform and operate.\n\nWorking across assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax and transactions, EY teams ask better questions to find new answers for the complex issues facing our world today.\n\nEY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity.

In the coming days, the rise continued and finally, the price was able to break out of the resistance at $1,400.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price in the last 15 days, source: gocharting.com\n\nIn the last week in particular, the price has seen massive increases. After breaking above $1,400, another rally continued. In response to the Bitcoin price surge above the $20,000 mark, the Ethereum price surged above $1,500, above where the Ethereum price was at the merge.\n\nWhy could the Ethereum price rise?\n\nThe Ethereum price has followed the rise in the Bitcoin price in the last few days. This rise came as part of a general rise in many assets in the world markets. Above all, falling inflation in the USA ensured that prices were able to rise more strongly again in the last few days.\n\nWith the increase in the Bitcoin price, the altcoins followed with strong increases. Bitcoin\u2019s break through the $17,000 resistance has been anticipated for some time. The Ethereum price was ultimately able to break through its resistance at $1,400. In the last few weeks, the price has repeatedly fluctuated between 1,200 and 1,400 dollars.\n\nHow high can the price rise in the next few weeks?\n\nAfter rising above $1,500, the Ethereum price seemed to stabilize in the short term. But recently there was an increase again and the Ethereum price was even able to rise towards $ 1,600. The price increase seems to trigger a momentum that could also cause the price to rise sharply in the coming weeks.\n\nShould the positive market developments continue, the current price increase could actually be sustainable. Especially if the monetary policy of the central banks loosens again and the interest rate hikes stop, the crypto market and thus the Ethereum price could continue to rise in the coming months.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Reach $5,000 in 2023?\n\nThe Ethereum price could therefore continue to rise sharply in the coming weeks. But is the Ethereum price increase so great that the price could even reach the $5,000 mark and thus a new all-time high in 2023?\n\nThe year 2023 could bring a strong rally just in the next 3 to 6 months. This is shown by the year 2019, when the Bitcoin price tripled and the Ethereum price even increased by a factor of 4. If this development is repeated, the Ethereum course could actually reach this mark.\n\nFurthermore, it is not impossible that inflation in Europe and the US will recover very well in the coming weeks. This would be a very good signal for the major markets in the short term. The crypto market could benefit in particular, with strong increases in Bitcoin and also in the Ethereum price.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Buy?\n\nAt the moment we are seeing strong buying in the Ether token. Although you should be careful not to buy from FOMO when prices are too high, it could still be a worthwhile investment at this point. The direction of the price is straight up in the short-term and we could see a further increase in the next few weeks.\n\nBut in the coming months, the Ethereum price could also rise sustainably if the 2019 scenario is repeated. Although a sustainable increase is not guaranteed, the chances for the next few months may be good.\n\nOffer from CryptoTicker\n\nAre you looking for a chart analysis tool that doesn\u2019t distract you with community messages and other noise?

        "content": "New data from crypto analytics firm Santiment suggests that traders may believe the top two leading digital assets by market cap are about to find their local tops.\n\nAccording to Santiment, crypto traders are taking profits on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the highest levels seen since 2021.\n\n\u201cAre crypto markets seeing a top? Traders are behaving like they believe so, taking this opportunity to profit take while given the chance. Bitcoin is seeing its highest profit ratio since Feb 2021. For Ethereum, it\u2019s the highest since Oct 2021.\u201d\n\nCrypto analytics firm Glassnode also notes that the king crypto has seen a greater volume of profits realized on-chain compared to losses for the first time since June.\n\n\u201cDuring bear cycles, this tends to act as a psychological level where investors sell at, or near break-even, creating resistance.\u201d\n\nGlassnode further says Bitcoin is in the process of retesting a value of 1.0 on the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR), which reflects the ratio between selling and purchase prices.\n\nIt would mark the first retest of that line, which has thus far served as the key resistance level throughout the current bear market, since the collapse of FTX, according to the analytics firm.\n\n\u201cA convincing break above 1.0 for realized [profit/loss] ratio, or aSOPR has historically signaled a cycle regime shift is underway. A successful retest and bounce of aSOPR from 1.0 is often observed near cycle turning points.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading at $21,374 at time of writing and is up 0.39% in the past 24 hours while ETH is changing hands for $1,592 and is up 0.22%.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Here\u2019s what Bitcoin, Ethereum prices need for an explosive rally following US PPI release - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum prices rallied after US CPI data fell below expectations MoM, on January 12.\n\nEasing inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rate hikes, weighing on the US Dollar and helping cryptocurrencies.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Producer Price Index release could have a similar impact if data shows a drop in \u2018factory gate\u2019 prices.\n\nThe release of the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which measures factory gate price inflation, could significantly impact Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies when it is released at 13:30 GMT on Wednesday, January 18. The econometric is seen as a forewarner of more general consumer price inflation since it measures the cost of goods after production, or the \u2018wholesale\u2019 price.\n\nWill US Producer Price Index follow US CPI course?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices witnessed a recovery after the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on January 12 showed an unexpected -0.1% fall in December on a month-over-month (MoM) basis. The data prompted a decline in the US Dollar and a rally in risk assets including many leading cryptocurrencies. This canceled out losses from the FTX exchange collapse and the DCG-Gemini scandal that have dogged the sector since November.\n\nThe question is, will the same thing happen when US PPI is released later today? And what exactly are the implications for cryptocurrencies from the data?\n\nAlso read: Will US CPI release whipsaw Bitcoin price to $16,500?\n\nUS PPI and CPI over the years\n\nEffect of PPI on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies\n\nUS Producer Price Index is expected to come out at 6.8% on a yearly basis and -0.1% on a monthly basis for December, based on surveys of economists.\n\nThe greatest impact on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies will result from an unexpected rise in PPI. This is because market expectations are tilted towards expecting lower inflation, especially after December Consumer Price Index showed an unexpected decline during the same month, therefore a rise would take the market by surprise.\n\nImportant US economic data releases expected on Wednesday\n\nIf the US Producer Price Index reading is significantly higher than the consensus (more than 0.1% MoM or 0.2% YoY) then this could result in a substantial rally in the US Dollar and a fall in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. This is because it will mean the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may have to continue to implement aggressive interest rate hikes to curb inflation and this will support the US Dollar which is inversely correlated to cryptocurrencies (because they are priced in US Dollars).\n\nIf the PPI data meets consensus expectations, asset prices will probably remain largely unaffected, though there may be a slightly positive impact on the US Dollar and a negative impact on cryptocurrencies since the official survey expectations are now a bit out-of-date and do not factor in recent data, such as the below-expected CPI data released six days ago, on January 12.\n\nA below-expectations result, especially if it is greater than the 0.1% divergence seen in the CPI release, would likely result in a fall in the value of the US Dollar and a rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other altcoin prices.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin chart saying before the release?\n\nBitcoin price has risen sharply in January 2023, after plummeting to new lows following the FTX crisis last November. The leading crypto has rallied from $15,479 on November 21 to a new high of $21,594 on Tuesday, January 17 (yesterday).\n\n\n\nThere are indications the short-to-medium trend has changed for Bitcoin, after the break above the critical November 5 high $21,473, the last lower high before BTC bottomed, achieved this week. This break is a major sign the broader downtrend could be reversing.\n\nBTC/USD price chart\n\nOn its way up in January, Bitcoin price has broken above all the key moving averages: the 50, 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and this is a further sign it could be reversing its longer-term downtrend.\n\nBTC is overbought, however, according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is currently well above 70 on the daily chart. RSI can remain in overbought states for some time before the market starts pulling back and, according to Welles Wilder, the market technician who designed the indicator, it is not until it has exited overbought and re-entered neutral territory, below 70, that a firm signal to sell can be inferred. Whilst it is in overbought, however, Wilder advised traders not to add to their longs. On the 4-hour chart above, however, the RSI has already fallen below 70, providing traders with a sell signal, and suggesting the possibility of a pullback on that timeframe.\n\nA lower-than-anticipated or same-as-expected PPI, therefore, would certainly fall into line with the bullish narrative reflected in the charts, however, given the asset is already overbought, it could also have no effect or even a slightly bearish impact if the data continues to show lingering inflation. Prices rarely rise in a straight line and BTC price is certainly overdue a little correction."

        "title": "Ethereum price rally under question after ETH slams into resistance at $1.6K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price is struggling to overcome resistance at $1,600 and this is the altcoin\u2019s third attempt since September. Some would say the 33% year-to-date rally could be interpreted as a failed opportunity to breach the $200 billion market capitalization mark.\n\nEther/USD price index, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nIf Ether\u2019s price were to break above $1,600, it would return the No. 2 cryptocurrency to a top-60 global tradable asset, surpassing giant multinational companies like Nike (NKE), Novartis (NVS), Cisco (CSCO) and Toyota (TM).\n\nUnfortunately, at least for bullish traders, derivatives markets are not hinting that Ether will finally break the $1,600 resistance \u2014 at least, not until the U.S. Federal Reserve reverses its course of tightening the economy.\n\nBulls\u2019 frustrations can partially be explained by Silvergate Bank\u2019s $1 billion net loss in the latest quarter. The crypto-friendly bank laid off roughly 40% of its workforce on Jan. 5 and it now faces a class-action lawsuit over its dealings with FTX and Alameda Research. The suit alleges that Silvergate aided and abetted FTX\u2019s fraudulent activities and the exchange\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty.\n\nThe negative newsflow continued on Jan. 17, as the deputy director-general of Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency\u2019s Strategy Development and Management Bureau, Mamoru Yanase, argued that the crypto sector should face the same regulation as traditional banks and brokerages.\n\nThe fact that Ether continues to trade above $1,500 is a positive, but the most recent price pump closely followed an 8% gain by the Russell 2000 index. In addition, investors fear that data showing a reduction in inflation was the main driver behind the cryptocurrency market recovery, so any retreat in the stock market could trigger another wave of selling.\n\nConsequently, investors believe that Ether could retrace its recent gains if the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates. Let\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the surprise pump positively impacted investor sentiment.\n\nEther\u2019s 33% rally was not enough to instill confidence\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe two-month futures annualized premium should trade between +4% to +8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders remain in \"fear mode\" because the Ether futures premium is below the 4% threshold. This data indicates the absence of leverage buyers\u2019 demand, although it does not signal that traders expect further adverse price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand whether investors are pricing higher odds of surprise adverse price movements.\n\nOptions markets are neutral, adding strength to the $1.6K resistance\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew improved considerably since Jan. 14, declining from a neutral-to-bearish positive 10% to a neutral options pricing. The movement signaled that options traders became more comfortable with downside risks since the 60-day delta skew stands at negative 2%.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and Ethereum correct as Bitzlato take down, tech layoffs and economic worries dominate headlines\n\nWhales and market makers are yet to become optimistic according to options markets, but the absence of fear after a 33% rally is encouraging. Both options and futures markets point to pro traders fearing that the $1,600 resistance will continue to exert a negative impact on price.\n\nIn essence, a more effective measure from the Fed is likely needed before crypto investors flip bullish \u2014 either signaling its campaign of interest rate hikes is close to an end, or a shift on the strategy to curb inflation.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 networks have gone through an explosive growth phase over the past couple of months, a trend that is set to continue in 2023.\n\nAccording to recent data, the leading layer-2 networks have seen an increase in daily active users thathas translated into a growth in fees for the respective ecosystems.\n\nAccording to analytics provider Token Terminal, Polygon leads the pack with 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, a metric that spiked to over 600,000 daily active users earlier in January.\n\nThat\u2019s a 30% increase in activity since the beginning of October, resulting in nearly $55,000 worth of daily fees for Polygon.\n\nOptimism has seen even faster growth, with a 190% gain in daily active users over the past three months. This resulted in daily network fees of $119,475, a gain of almost 140% since the beginning of the year.\n\nArbitrum One currently has 41,694 daily active users, an increase of around 40% over the past three months. Daily fees on the network are just over $40,000, according to the data.\n\nMeanwhile, L2 ecosystem analytics platform L2beat states that Arbitrum has a market share of 52% in terms of total value locked (TVL), which is currently at $2.55 billion. Aribtrum has seen a 9% increase in TVL over the past week.\n\nOptimism, the second-largest L2 network, has a TVL of $1.46 billion, giving it a market share of 30%. Its collateral locked has surged by 15% over the past seven days.\n\nThe two together account for more than 80% of all the collateral locked in layer-2 platforms.\n\nRelated: Optimism and Arbitrum flip Ethereum in combined transaction volume\n\nThere has been an increase of almost 10% in TVL for all L2s over the past week, pushing the total TVL up to $4.89 billion. However, that figure is still down 34% since its peak in April.\n\nNevertheless, this decline is less than half of the retreat DeFi TVL has made since its all-time high. DeFi collateral has declined by 75% since December 2021, according to DeFiLlama, suggesting that there is greater demand and momentum for layer-2 networks at the moment."

        "content": "A new annual report from early-stage venture firm Electric Capital shows massive developer activity growth on four blockchain projects, including two Ethereum (ETH) rivals.\n\nAccording to the firm, active developers on the Polygon (MATIC) and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains along with ETH rivals Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) shot up in 2022 by more than 400% from five years ago.\n\nSays Maria Shen, an investor at Electric Capital,\n\n\u201cWhile prices are at 2018 levels, developer ecosystems are multiples bigger.\u201d\n\nThese four blockchain projects each saw less than 200 monthly developers in 2018, but that increased to more than 1,000 in 2012.\n\nAccording to the report, Polygon has just over 1,000 monthly active developers, Cosmos just under 2,000, Polkadot about 2,000 and Solana about 2,250.\n\nIn the crypto space as a whole, developer activity started off at 1,000 monthly active developers writing code in the first seven years of the nascent technology. Now, as of December 2022, there were 23,343 monthly active developers, a 5% growth compared to December 2021, the report says.\n\nDevelopment activity on a blockchain is one indicator that a crypto project will experience a price increase.\n\nSays the report,\n\n\u201cDevelopers are a leading indicator of value creation. Developers build apps that deliver value to users. Killer apps attract customers, and those customers bring more developers.\u201d\n\nShen says the firm\u2019s development activity tally is likely an undercount since it solely tracks open-source code.\n\n\u201cWe focus on open source code, so we undercount total developers in crypto and do not count designers, community mods, PMs [project managers], etc. We focus on unique code and do not count forked code.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy and Hold Forever - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the crypto market has been hit hard over the past year, and the recent FTX scandal has certainly not helped.\n\nHowever, there's still reason to be optimistic about the sector's future. Crypto as a whole is still relatively new, and downturns -- even severe ones -- are not necessarily uncommon. By riding out the storm and waiting until the recovery period, you could potentially see lucrative returns.\n\nIt's critical, though, to choose the right investments. Many cryptocurrencies may not survive this slump, and investing in the wrong places could be costly. While there are never any guarantees in crypto, there are two cryptocurrencies I'm buying and holding forever.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.59%) is the oldest cryptocurrency, which means it also has the longest history of recovering from downturns. It's faced some nasty slumps in the past, too -- some of which make this crash seem mild.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is down close to 70% from its high in late 2021. Back in 2018, though, it fell by more than 80% over the course of the year. Between July 2014 and January 2015, it dropped by 72%. Along the way, it's also experienced many smaller drops of \"only\" 30% to 40% from its peak.\n\nWhile past performance doesn't predict future returns, it is promising that Bitcoin has been able to recover from so many crashes. And despite all of this extreme volatility, it's still up more than 30,000% since 2013. No other asset has even come close to these types of returns, especially over just one decade.\n\nTo be fair, it will be tough for Bitcoin to experience these same returns over the next 10 years. But many experts have big expectations for the crypto, with some predicting it could reach $100,000 per token or more in the coming years. Whether that will actually happen is unclear right now, but if Bitcoin's past is any indication, it's far too early to count it out just yet.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.12%) has fallen by around 68% from its high, but it has plenty of long-term potential.\n\nPerhaps Ethereum's biggest advantage is its diversity. It's more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a smart-contract network that hosts a wide variety of applications.\n\nNot only is Ethereum the largest platform for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, but it's also the most popular blockchain for metaverse applications. It can also host other cryptocurrencies (Shiba Inu, for instance, is built on Ethereum), and because it's an open-source blockchain, developers can build new applications on the network, too.\n\nIf any of these areas thrive -- whether it's NFTs, the metaverse, another crypto, or some other application that hasn't been developed yet -- Ethereum will benefit. By investing in Ethereum, then, you're essentially diversifying into multiple areas of the crypto sector.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is the go-to blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps). Many experts predict that dApps will be a game-changer in the crypto space, and if that's true, Ethereum could be poised for serious growth.\n\nIs now the right time to invest in crypto?\n\nDespite all its potential, cryptocurrency is still inherently risky. All crypto is speculative at the moment, and nobody can say for certain how it will fare over the coming years. There's still a chance that the entire sector could fail, and even the strongest investments may not survive.\n\nBefore you buy, then, make sure you're willing to tolerate a higher level of risk. Don't invest any money you're not prepared to potentially lose, and double-check that the rest of your portfolio is well-diversified to limit as much risk as possible.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum won't be the right investments for everyone, and there are no guarantees that they'll succeed. But they have some of the most potential of any cryptocurrencies right now, so there's still reason to be optimistic about their futures."

        "content": "San Francisco, California, January 18th \u2013 Today, Coinbase has listed Kava and will launch a massive Learning Rewards Campaign to educate its user base about how Kava is leading the world to Web3.\n\nKava is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. Kava has spent the last year building a deep integration with Coinbase that optimizes the process for Cosmos SDK chains to integrate with Coinbase helping to drive new liquidity to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nUnlocking Cosmos liquidity\n\nCoinbase's native integration with Kava allows for easy listing of Kava ecosystem projects, KAVA staking on Coinbase, and unlocks DeFi usage for Coinbase users on Kava. Additionally, Kava worked with the Coinbase team to make it significantly easier for Cosmos chains to list on the exchange, unlocking access to liquidity for Cosmos projects and further driving the adoption and growth of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. The entire process whittles the timeline for integrating Cosmos SDK chains to Coinbase from 12-18 months to a single month. Cosmos chains can now be integrated as easily as ERC-20 tokens. A major step forward to increasing liquidity within the Cosmos Ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see Kava listed on the largest US-regulated exchange. Coinbase sets the standard as the most important on-ramp for new users and capital into the blockchain ecosystem. I look forward to growing Kava\u2019s exposure to new users, which will have downstream effects for all protocols in the Kava Rise program and the Cosmos ecosystem.\u201d \u2014 Scott Stuart, CEO of Kava Labs\n\nFueling protocol growth with Kava Rise\n\nKava was built from the ground up to optimize its resources for protocol growth, strengthened by its Cosmos-EVM technology that enables maximum scalability, speed, security, and developer support. In 2022, Kava combined on-chain and off-chain growth mechanisms into a single developer incentive program called Kava Rise.\n\nKava Rise aims to set a new standard for enabling growth and demand for thousands of Web3 protocols. Builders earn a share of Kava Rise's $750M developer incentive fund via the program's blockchain-based distribution method, designed to reward the top protocols every month based on usage. More than 50 protocols like Curve Finance, Sushi, and Beefy Finance have collectively brought more than $15M TVL into the ecosystem, showcasing the program\u2019s ability to enable protocols to grow and thrive regardless of market conditions.\n\nAbout Kava\n\nKava charges Web3 growth with the best on-chain incentives and Cosmos-EVM sidechain tech.

What is Happening? we identified the ETH Flag Pattern that was currently forming in the 4-hour timeframe and warned our readers that Ethereum might be setting up for a massive move soon!\n\nThis Flag pattern is very unique because the price can either break to the upside or downside. And right now, we are seeing what looks like a breakdown to the downside for the Altcoin price.\n\nIn this Ethereum analysis, we will be taking a closer look at this breakdown and trying to understand if this might be a fake-out.

Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nThe most important level for the Flag Pattern right now is the $1,503 key support level. This is the level the Ethereum bears need to push the price below for us to confirm the start of a possible move lower for the Altcoin.\n\nBut right now, we have seen Ethereum deep below this $1,503 key support level in the 4-hour timeframe and bounce from it! This price bounce shows that the bulls are still fighting to hold on to this uptrend and if this level continues to get respected, we might see Ethereum find support and begin to rally from this region in the coming days.\n\nWarning! Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nSo for now it is important to stand aside and wait for the $1,503 key support to be broken before jumping to any bearish conclusion (this is the best way to avoid getting faked out in this move).\n\nWhat Happens If Ethereum Continues To Sell Off?\n\nIf the Ethereum bears can manage to push the ETH price below the $1,503 key support, there is a very high probability that we might see more bearish follow-through happen in the coming days.\n\nThis bearish follow-through would likely push the Altcoin price back down to the Descending Channel Pattern we broke out of early this year.\n\nWarning! Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nFinal Verdict!\n\nRight now, we are watching the $1,503 key support in the 4-hour timeframe to see if the bears can successfully push the Altcoin price below this key level in the coming days.\n\nIf this happens, there is a very high probability that we might see more sell-off in Ethereum for the rest of the week. However, if this $1,503 support holds, this initial sell-off might just be a bearish fakeout to catch traders off guard.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEasy Steps From Beginner To Pro Crypto Trader\n\nYou can speed up your learning journey by reading our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

The FKWME NFT passes will be released to the public on February 1, with a price of 0.19 ETH\u2014about $290 each at present.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, NYX Global Brand President Yann Joffredo said GORJS was created to shine a light on \u201c3D creators\u201d and give them \u201ca path to success within the Web3 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nJoffredo sees digital \u201cmakeup\u201d designs as being radically different from what's possible with physical cosmetics, because creators can go above and beyond with surreal elements that defy the laws of physics.\n\n\u201cFrom extraterrestrial glass skin to morphing elemental lashes, makeup and digital fantasy are entwined in an aspirational, accessible way,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt via email. \u201cIn one instance, eyelashes might be stacked in a multi-tier beauty application norm; in Web3, they could dramatically flare into lifelike flames that dare the viewer to dream.\u201d\n\nNYX\u2019s DAO, then, is a move beyond physical cosmetics sold at drug stores\u2014an exploration of what makeup means in the digital age of avatars and pseudonymity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that a new generation of Web3 creators will help redefine beauty,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt.\n\nThis Web3 push also appears to be a move away from NYX\u2019s traditional diet of beauty influencer content, which typically consists of smartphone footage of creators applying makeup shared to Web2 social media platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nWhen asked how NYX\u2019s DAO and NFTs align with the brand\u2019s demographic, Joffredo said that NYX has always been a \u201cpioneer in the digital and aspiring artistry space.\u201d Joffredo also said NYX has a history of supporting \u201crising makeup creators\u201d and \u201cyoung creators\u201d in the beauty industry.\n\nDespite the decline of the NFT market over the past several months, Joffredo believes GORJS will still be able to deliver on its ambitious vision.\n\nThe Ethereum DAO\u2019s members will use non-transferable GORJS governance tokens\u2014capped at a total supply of 100 million\u2014as voting chips for various DAO proposals and projects. A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a group of crypto enthusiasts who attempt collective governance over pooled resources using tokens for community voting.\n\nIn an ideal DAO structure, there is no single entity that holds all the power, and the community is able to execute on a common goal or mission\u2014whether it's supporting a protocol, collecting valuable assets, etc.\u2014using a more egalitarian power structure instead of a top-down one.\n\nImage: GORGJS DAO.\n\nDAO members can earn the \u201csoulbound\u201d GORJS tokens in a variety of ways, including by purchasing a FKWME Pass NFT (pronounced \u201cfuck with me\u201d). If a token is \u201csoulbound,\u201d it means it\u2019s non-transferable and cannot be moved from the holder\u2019s wallet.\n\nJoffredo told Decrypt the FKWME name was chosen because it\u2019s \u201ca casual phrase used when you want others to share the same vision as you: to join you, connect with you, and vibe with you on a social level.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NFT automatically grants the holder a daily yield of GORJS tokens, and also allowlists the holder for future NFT airdrops and exclusive future sales. The DAO will also offer an NFT minting tool, allowing members to mint their art through its site.\n\nSomething new in beauty just dropped\ud83d\udc40\n\nINTRODUCING GORJS \u2728 Want to find out what we mean?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/WApCVh5CTZ #TheFutureIsGORJS #LFG pic.twitter.com/hyNSwkA1u9 \u2014 NYX Pro Makeup US (@NYXCosmetics) January 10, 2023\n\nGORJS founding members include NYX\u2019s Joffredo, NYX Global VP of Digital and Ecommerce Matthieu Guerin, and three other NYX executives. Each NYX executive will hold 2% of the total token supply at launch.\n\nThe DAO also has a number of Web3-focused executives on its advisory team, including The Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget, Ready Player Me founder Timmu Toke, Polygon Labs Metaverse Lead Brian Trunzo, and Amber Ward, CEO of creative agency Invisible North.\n\n\u201cI decided to join as [an] advisor because they are genuinely purpose-driven,\u201d Borget told Decrypt in a message. \u201cI believe they have designed a DAO system which truly benefits the digital talent, creators, and artists.\u201d\n\nWard told Decrypt that NYX isn\u2019t necessarily trying to target its retail customer base with its Web3 efforts.\n\n\u201cThe primary demographic for GORJS is creators and digital artists who are native to Web3,\u201d Ward said in a message. \u201cThis is a niche, long-term play.\u201d\n\nThe DAO\u2019s litepaper suggests it may lean heavily into \u201cartist referrals\u201d to grow its community, rewarding those who successfully bring their creative friends into the DAO with GORJS tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile this could be interpreted as a type of multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, that\u2019s apparently not the case here because GORJS tokens cannot be converted into real funds. More referrals won\u2019t give members money directly, but it could lead to more individual power in the DAO.\n\nThe litepaper also explicitly states that GORJS tokens are not an \u201cinvestment\u201d and \u201cunder no circumstances are tokens able to be exchanged for any L\u2019Oreal equities, securities, or currency.\u201d\n\nBorget told Decrypt that the soulbound nature of the GORJS token solves what otherwise could lead to governance token speculation, which crypto founders like Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin have disparaged in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe governance is truly meant to be a recommendation engine through relying on [soulbound tokens] that cannot be sold, and hence does not risk becoming a financial instrument,\u201d Borget said.\n\nNYX\u2019s dive into Web3 aligns with parent company L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s fascination with crypto. L'Or\u00e9al is already involved in the metaverse and digital community-building space, having invested in metaverse startup Digital Village through its VC arm, Bold. It\u2019s also no surprise that NYX has entered Web3, considering L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s 17 trademark applications filed last year for NFTs and blockchain uses for its brands including NYX, Kiehl\u2019s, and Urban Decay.\n\nAs NYX moves forward with its Web3 plans, it remains unclear whether the average NYX customer is interested in crypto\u2014or whether NYX\u2019s Web3 world will garner a new demographic of users entirely.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct the list of project advisors following a last-minute change to the announcement materials."

        "content": "As the crypto developer ecosystem expands, major ecosystems outside of the top two cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 are growing, according to a new report.\n\nAbout 72% of monthly active developers (devs) are working on blockchains that are not part of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, according to the 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report, which trawled code commits across open source repositories.\n\nSolana saw the highest number of new developers contributing to the ecosystem, with its developer count rising by 83%, the fastest of any major blockchain. Compared to that, Polygon saw a 40% rise in developer count, Cosmos saw 25% and Polkadot saw 2%, the report showed.\n\n\u201cDevelopers will build where they see technology advantages, and Solana delivers faster transactions and lower costs than alternatives,\u201d Solana co-founder Raj Gokal told TechCrunch. \u201cBut they will also build where they see other kinds of advantages, such as an active community.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the developer ecosystem on Solana can be attributed to a mix of education efforts and resources, community engagement, technical advantages and business opportunities, Gokal said.\n\nEven with around 2,000 total developers as of December 2022, Solana is still about 3,500 developers short of Ethereum\u2019s count, which had a total of about 5,700 developers. It\u2019s important to note, though, that Ethereum launched in 2013 and Solana launched in 2018, so the former has enjoyed a five-year head start.\n\nThese Solana developers are working on \u201ca range of use cases,\u201d from evolving the NFT and DeFi spaces to getting retailers to experiment with decentralized payment rails like Solana Pay, Gokal said. \u201cRight now, game devs on Solana are very active and innovating heavily to create games that are both fun to play and rewarding for players to participate.\u201d\n\nSeparately, The Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phone are attracting attention from developers interested in creating mobile web3 apps, Gokal added. \u201cThe mobile opportunities on Solana will only get better as Saga and SMS get exposed to more people.\u201d\n\nSolana, which is approaching its fifth birthday, has the highest number of developers since it was launched compared to other blockchains, according to a chart (shown below) from Electric Capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s total developer count spiked in November 2022 during its Breakpoint conference and hackathon event. In comparison, Polygon has roughly half the developers but has existed for around the same time.\n\n\u201cThe creation of new technologies at different times naturally brings about different use cases and opportunities,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cSolana is a high-performance blockchain where transactions are inexpensive and fast to settle. There will continue to be use cases for other networks, but speed, efficiency and low costs usually always attract the most activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Solana Beach data, Solana\u2019s network can currently execute 3,531 transactions per second (TPS). The TPS measures a network\u2019s speed and scalability while showing the maximum number of transactions the blockchain can carry out \u2014 if needed. In comparison, Ethereum averages about 15 TPS.\n\nGokal said Solana Foundation will continue to host hackathons and hacker houses to help get more devs get involved. But this year might be different.\n\n\u201c2023 might just be the year when other devs already building on Solana collectively lead the direction of the network. We\u2019ve already seen that with a community-led hackathon happening right now and more devs are stepping forward to contribute to the core Solana network,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier last year, there was more hope in the crypto community that it was in a temporary downturn, but sentiments have changed.\n\n\u201cI think people fully understand the extent to which macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated across all aspects of the economy and that there are bigger issues at play, such as inflation,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cPeople now seem mentally prepared for an extended bearish period, which is the best time to experiment and find product-market fit.\u201d\n\nAfter crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November, there was a lot of uncertainty across the space, Gokal noted. \u201c[It] quickly gave way to an understanding that the ecosystem is bigger than any one individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all that in mind, as well as the Solana network performing better than ever, the time is now for devs to really dream up new use cases and build them,\u201d Gokal added."

Using Nightfall, enterprises can orchestrate private transactions efficiently on the Ethereum mainnet without compromising the transparency, data immutability and security that Ethereum provides.\n\nEY first contributed Nightfall to the public domain in 2019 as a set of protocols to enable private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In September 2021, EY teamed up with Polygon to create a beta version of Nightfall that can mitigate network congestion and high transaction prices resulting from increased usage and wider adoption of Ethereum.\n\nEY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer both use Nightfall, and both solutions are delivered through EY Blockchain\u2019s SaaS platform, Blockchain.ey.com.\n\nThis version of Nightfall introduces two important changes over prior versions: First, to prevent control by an organization or group, the code can be deployed on a fully decentralized basis. Second, to prevent anonymous usage while retaining an open and permissionless network model, users are required to have an enterprise-class X.509 identification certificate to deposit or withdraw.\n\nNightfall will remain in the public domain to facilitate the adoption of privacy-focused enterprise solutions among companies seeking to enter Ethereum and conduct business on the network.\n\nPaul Brody, EY global blockchain leader, said: \u201cThis update marks the readiness of Nightfall to enable development of enterprise solutions. With more than six months of testnet operations, we consider this a \u2018production beta\u2019, ready for enabling client supply chain and business operations.\u201d\n\nAntoni Martin, Polygon co-founder responsible for Nightfall, said: \u201cThe move to update Nightfall in the public domain is a major milestone in scaling the Ethereum ecosystem and will open up new use cases for enterprises in Web3.\u201d"

        "content": "Matic, the Polygon blockchain network's native token, jumped 17% in the week after the blockchain executed a so-called hard fork to radically upgrade its infrastructure, although the move also drew criticism about whether it's actually a decentralized network because it was approved by just 13 validators.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Polygon executed a hard fork on January 17 at 10:45 UTC with the help of only 15 validators.\n\nThe crypto community is casting doubt on the decentralized nature of Polygon, as 13 of 15 validators voted in favor of the change.\n\nThe hard fork will reduce spikes in gas fees during periods of high activity and chain reorganizations by reducing the time taken to complete a data block.\n\n\n\nOnly 15 Validators Overhauled the Network\n\nPolygon, which enhances the performance of Ethereum, overhauled its network on Jan. 17., aiming to boost the performance of the blockchain by reducing gas fees and the time taken to complete the transactions.\n\nInitially discussed in December 2022, the fork was supposed to be voted on by 100 validators and infrastructure providers to upgrade the network.However, in the voting process, only 15 validator teams participated, and 13 of them voted in favor of the proposal, which is extremely low as the hard fork needs a supermajority to conduct any change.\n\n\n\nHow Decentralized is DeFi?\n\nThe hard fork is hailed as a technological advancement. However, the way Polygon did it raised questions about the network's decentralization stance and its organizational structure. There has already been some debate in the Polygon community about whether the hard fork was necessary. On Twitter, the crypto community criticized Polygon, calling it a centralized network and asking questions\u2013 how decentralized is decentralized finance, DeFi?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt's not the first time a decentralized network has come under fire for its centralized nature. In 2021, Uniswap, the popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, was criticized for delisting tokens without voting or consulting its members, raising questions about how much control creators can have in crypto.\n\n"

        "content": "SSV DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization behind the decentralized staking protocol SSV.network, is starting a $50 million ecosystem fund to help mature Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) infrastructure.\n\nDVT refers to a technology development that would allow an Ethereum proof-of-stake validator to be run on more than one node simultaneously. The technology is a key component in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum road map for decentralization.\n\nBecause of the high cost of entry to run a validator node, critics say that the Ethereum protocol is uncomfortably centralized across only a handful of major actors. While there are just over 500,000 validators, the majority are concentrated in a handful of pools: Lido has just over 25% of the validators in its pool, Coinbase (COIN) has 11.7%, Kraken has 7%, and Binance has 5.4%.\n\nThe fund is being led by SSV and Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.\n\nIn July, SSV launched a $10 million pool to distribute grants to build DVT projects using the SSV protocol. So far, it has granted $2 million, and high-performing grant recipients will be shortlisted for this new ecosystem fund. Grantees included Blockscape, ANKR, Stader and Moonshake.\n\n\"It\u2019s important because DVT is becoming a major focus for Ethereum,\u201d Alon Muroch, technical lead, SSV Network, said to CoinDesk in a note. \u201cMore funds, companies, DAOs are getting involved. It\u2019s going to be as widespread as layer 2s, and Maximal Extractable Value after the tech hits the Ethereum mainnet in 2023. The funds involved are at the ground level supporting this change.\"\n\nEarlier this month blockchain startup Obol Labs raised $12.5 million in a round co-led by Pantera and Archetype to build out a DVT platform for Ethereum."

        "content": "The National Australia Bank has developed a stablecoin for carbon trading and overseas payments.\n\nAUDN will launch on Ethereum and Algorand.\n\nThe National Australia Bank (NAB) has become the second major Australian bank to create a stablecoin, titled the AUDN. The stablecoin would allow its business customers to settle transactions on blockchain technology using Australian dollars in real-time.\n\nStablecoin launched on Ethereum and Algorand\n\nAccording to a report by AFR, AUDN will launch on the Ethereum [ETH] and Algorand [ALGO] blockchains. NAB\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer, Howard Silby, stated that AUDN could also serve other purposes, such as carbon credit trading and repurchase agreements.\n\nNAB\u2019s stablecoin is fully backed, one-for-one, with Australian fiat money held in trust by the bank. This currency comes nine months after the Melbourne-based rival ANZ created their own stablecoin, known as A$DC.\n\nThis move highlighted the growing role of banks in driving innovation in the digital economy. NAB plans to launch the stablecoin by the middle of 2023 if everything goes well.\n\nThe creation of stablecoins by individual banks has emerged after the big four banks of Australia attempted to create an industry-wide Australian dollar stablecoin early last year, but the effort failed due to competition concerns and banks being at different stages in their crypto strategy.\n\nAustralia\u2019s crypto policy\n\nAustralia\u2019s government was still mulling over stablecoin regulation at press time. Notably, stablecoin regulation was part of a private member\u2019s bill that Australian Senator Andrew Bragg drafted in September 2022.\n\nTo strengthen safety around crypto, the Australian government has promised to establish a framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers in 2023. Additionally, the country\u2019s central bank has started a pilot test to explore potential use cases for Australia\u2019s own central bank digital currency. The creation of CBDCs will likely be completed by mid-2023 as well."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service governance proposal aims to create an extra runway for the project should the crypto market suffer another downturn.\n\n10,000 ETH would be sold for Circle\u2019s USDC via a Gnosis auction, Wednesday\u2019s proposal suggested.\n\nENS DAO held around $2.4 million in stablecoin and some 40,000 Ether in its treasury at press time.\n\nA member of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO submitted a governance proposal aimed at diversifying the protocol\u2019s treasury and hedging against further downturns in the crypto market. The details of the draft proposed offloading 10,000 Ether (ETH) worth around $13 million at today\u2019s prices.\n\nThe ENS treasury held over 40,000 ETH and almost $3 million in Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC), crypto\u2019s second largest stablecoin by market cap. According to the member\u2019s proposal, swapping 10,000 ETH for 13 million in USDC will allow the project to hold enough liquidity to offset operating costs for the next 24 months, regardless of crypto asset prices.\n\nIndeed, the broader digital asset and financial markets suffered huge downturns in 2022 following harsh macro conditions and a series of industry implosions like Terra. When Ethereum Name Service fully launched its service and token in November 2021, Ether peaked at over $4,000 and set an all-time high.\n\nETH\u2019s price has since dipped over 60% in over a year and currently trades around $1,500. The ENS community member argued that securing liquidity is essential since the project\u2019s primary revenue is in Ether.\n\nThe DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.\n\n2.8 Million Ethereum Name Service Domains Registered in 2022\n\nEthereum Name Service enjoyed massive user activity in 2022 despite crypto prices taking a beating. Dune Analytics data showed over 2.8 million domains registered and over 600,000 unique wallets created.\n\nENS runs atop the Ethereum blockchain and was initially a part of the Ethereum Foundation in 2017. However, the service broke off as a standalone entity a year later in 2018, and is managed by True Names Limited.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service protocol allows users to attach a simple name like \u201cxyz.eth\u201d to their ETH wallets. ENS was built as a solution to make crypto wallets more accessible, meaning that users do not have to memorize complicated long-form addresses.\n\nIndeed, the service is similar to web2 domain registrations where users link a dot-com name to their numeric internet protocol addresses."

        "content": "Several countries have been planning to explore stablecoins despite the initial reluctance and more recent implosion of Terra. The latest one to jump on the bandwagon is one of Australia\u2019s four largest financial institutions \u2013 National Australia Bank (NAB).\n\nThe new Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin created by NAB, dubbed AUDN, is set to be launched on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchain networks. It is expected to be completed by mid-2023.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Second Stablecoin Initiative\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review (AFR) report, the AUDN will enable users to settle transactions on blockchain technology in real-time with the help of Australian dollars. The NAB also said the stablecoin is designed to serve multiple purposes, such as carbon credit trading, cross-border money transfers, and repurchase agreements. Furthermore, the bank will be in charge of holding the Australian fiat-backed stablecoin.\n\nIn a statement, NAB Chief Innovation officer Howard Silby was quoted saying,\n\n\u201cWe certainly believe there are elements of blockchain technology that will form part of the future of finance [\u2026] From our point of view, we see [blockchain] has the potential to deliver instantaneous, transparent, inclusive, financial outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe current infrastructure for overseas transactions is dominated by the SWIFT network, which is undoubtedly a legacy system. However, AUDN\u2019s launch could provide an effective alternative for many users.\n\nThe development comes four months after Australian Senator Andrew Bragg drafted a bill aiming to put the domestic cryptocurrency sector under strict supervision. The bill required digital asset exchanges and stablecoin issuers to reveal their operations to authorities. It also targeted Chinese banks dealing with digital yuan in the country.\n\nOther Countries Dabbling in Stablecoins\n\nWith the creation of AUDN, NAB has become the second major bank in the country to launch an Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Last year, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) minted a stablecoin pegged to the Australian fiat in collaboration with crypto custodian Fireblocks.\n\nThis week, Russia and Iran were reportedly engaged in talks over launching a new cryptocurrency backed by gold. Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of the Crypto Industry and Blockchain, asserted that the token would be developed as a stablecoin."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy in Any Bear Market - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In 2022, investors watched in dismay as the value of cryptocurrencies crashed back down to earth. By the end of the year, the entire market cap of the crypto market was less than $1 trillion, meaning that more than $2 trillion was wiped out during the year. Even worse, these losses were across the board, as nearly every cryptocurrency finished the year in the red.\n\nThat said, there are a handful of cryptocurrencies that could make for interesting investments during a bear market. Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%), Ethereum (ETH 0.09%), and Cardano (ADA -0.60%) are at the top of the list.\n\nBitcoin\n\nAs the top crypto by market capitalization, Bitcoin has become the favorite crypto asset to buy for both retail and institutional investors. In part, this is due to its truly staggering investment returns. During the 10-year period from 2011-2021, Bitcoin was the top-performing asset in the world, and it wasn't even close.\n\nWhile past performance is no guarantee of future results, it's hard to argue with this type of success over a long period of time. The hope, quite frankly, is that last year was just a temporary setback.\n\nAfter all, Bitcoin has demonstrated a strong track record of bouncing back from previous market declines. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has undergone a handful of different bear market crashes, and has emerged healthier each time. Moreover, Bitcoin has had two other years -- 2014 and 2018 -- that were just as bad as the year investors just experienced, so there's plenty to like about Bitcoin's resilience. In 2014, Bitcoin fell by 58%, and in 2018, Bitcoin fell by 73%.\n\nOne other factor in Bitcoin's favor involves the accelerating pace of its global adoption. This helps provide important diversification. The U.S. market might be tanking, for example, but other markets around the world could be surging. Ever since El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender back in 2021, nations around the world have explored how Bitcoin adoption might spur future growth. For example, in December 2022, Brazil announced sweeping new Bitcoin legislation that clearly delineates how this crypto can be used for both online payments and investments.\n\nEthereum\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Ethereum has also bounced back from market declines ever since its launch back in 2015. Ethereum is the world's second-leading crypto by market capitalization, and its blockchain is increasingly being integrated into the tech stacks of major companies around the world, from Wall Street to Main Street. Banks on Wall Street are exploring new products and services based on Ethereum, while consumer brands are using Ethereum for new marketing promotions that involve non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nNow that Ethereum has pulled off The Merge and upgraded to a proof-of-stake blockchain, it is faster and more efficient. This important new upgrade will continue to support the growth of the world's most vibrant crypto ecosystem, which includes decentralized applications, smart contracts, and tokens.\n\nEthereum is the market leader in important blockchain niches such as NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. This provides an important diversification benefit, since Ethereum -- unlike many other cryptos -- is not a one-trick pony. When arriving at a valuation for Ethereum, investors need to take into account the value of this broader ecosystem.\n\nCardano\n\nFinally, there's Cardano, which remains firmly entrenched as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Similar to Ethereum, Cardano is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. As a result, the same type of diversified ecosystem that exists for Ethereum also exists for Cardano, albeit on a smaller scale. This might not be too surprising, given that Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, is the founder of Cardano.\n\nIn 2022, Cardano ranked as the top blockchain in terms of development activity, and has one of the largest developer communities in the world. It also has a peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development, which ensures that any changes or upgrades to the blockchain have been rigorously tested and reviewed. While this sometimes slows the introduction of new offerings, it does protect Cardano from the typical pitfalls experienced by other blockchains that are trying to grow fast.\n\nGiven this strong base, Cardano is precisely the type of crypto that will continue to build during a bear market. Cardano's vision is to become the top blockchain in the world for the unbanked, and the blockchain stands out for the work it is doing to power growth in developing markets such as Africa.\n\nBear-proof your crypto portfolio\n\nOf course, it is impossible to bear-proof your crypto portfolio. As investors saw in 2022, a widespread market decline will take down all cryptos, even market stalwarts. But if you are looking for relatively safe, stable cryptos that you can hold for the long term and buy even during bear markets, then Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano should be at the top of your list."

The company has recently come under fire for its role in censoring Ethereum transactions.\n\n$1 Billion Valuation\n\nFlashbots is changing its business model.\n\nAccording to a report from The Block, crypto\u2019s leading MEV organization is looking to raise between $30 million and $50 million at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nInterestingly, Flashbots is reportedly conducting a reverse-pitching process: instead of pitching prospective investors, the organization is inviting investors to make their own pitches\u2014meaning that they need to convince the company to accept their funds. Crypto investment fund Paradigm is reportedly leading the investment round; the firm was Flashbots\u2019 lead investor in its seed-stage fundraise in 2020.\n\nMEV stands for \u201cMaximal Extractable Value.\u201d The term refers to arbitraging on-chain trading opportunities by reordering transactions within a block while it is being produced. Flashbots provides an off-chain block-building marketplace for on-chain traders and validators, with the stated aim of streamlining MEV and mitigating its negative impacts on users. According to Flashbots data, MEV has extracted more than $687 million from blockchain users since January 2020.\n\nFlashbots, which has marketed itself as an Ethereum public good in the past, has recently come under controversy over its willingness to censor Tornado Cash-related transactions on Ethereum in order to comply with OFAC sanctions. According to MEV Watch, at the time of writing 66% of Ethereum blocks are being produced by MEV-Boost relays that have expressed their intention of censoring such transactions; Flashbots is responsible for producing over 65% of these censorious blocks. In a sense, the organization\u2019s fundraising efforts mean that investors may be financially rewarded for censoring Ethereum transactions.\n\nDisclaimer: At the time of writing, the author of this piece owned BTC, ETH, and several other crypto assets."

This crypto lending subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group has been attempting to raise funds to maintain liquidity ever since FTX\u2019s collapse caused it to halt withdrawals in November 2022.\n\nGenesis in confidential negotiations with creditors\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, Genesis Global Capital has engaged multiple creditor groups in negotiations amid liquidity issues that have spilled over to parent firm Digital Currency Group.

As per a report by The Block, creditors of Genesis are actively involved in negotiating the terms of a possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Sources revealed that creditors may agree to a forbearance period between 1-2 years under a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in exchange for cash payments and equity in the Digital Currency Group.\n\nDCG\u2019s founder and CEO Barry Silbert has been involved in a public feud with Gemini\u2019s co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss.

        "title": "Lido's Total Value Locked Spiked 33% In Past Month, Becoming Largest DeFi Protocol by TVL, Says DeFiLlama - Yahoo Lifestyle Australia",
        "content": "The forerunner of the liquid staking derivatives market, Lido became the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) app by total value locked (TVL) earlier this month, surpassing MakerDAO.\n\nLido\u2019s claim to the throne comes after a period of steady growth for the staking-as-a-service provider. In just the last month its TVL has spiked 33% at press time, according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nUsers have locked $7.8 billion on Lido. The vast majority of that sum comes from Ethereum, with smaller amounts from other blockchains, including Solana.\n\nInterest in liquid staking protocols has swelled in 2023 as governance tokens for these protocols have surged in price. For example, since Dec. 31 to now, the price of LDO has jumped 108% to $2.01, while its average 24-hour volume rose 802%, per CoinGecko. Holders of LDO have a say in how the protocol is managed, from setting fees to assigning node operators.\n\nThe present attention and popularity of liquid staking protocols has prompted a narrative in the crypto community marked by users\u2019 excitement and elevated willingness to learn about these liquid staking protocols. Lido has been able to gain momentum for its TVL, a popular indicator of the health and interest of the app.\n\nLido\u2019s TVL dropped from $20.4 billion in April 2022 to as low as $4.2 billion two months later following the collapse of Terra, but its TVL has grown rapidly in 2023. Lido\u2019s TVL increased in the past seven days and month by 20.02% and 33.13%, respectively, allowing Lido to claim the top rank in DeFi protocols by TVL for the first time.\n\n(CoinDesk Research and CoinGecko)\n\nLido\u2019s recent climb comes ahead of the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, the first hard fork since the Merge in September. Set for March, Shanghai will notably allow ETH stakers to withdraw their tokens, which are currently locked on the Ethereum network.\n\nWith 20 active developers per Token Terminal, Lido has become the most popular liquid staking protocol, commanding a 29% share of the total ETH staked on Ethereum, according to data from Etherscan.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\u2019s current proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism doesn\u2019t rely on miners to write and authenticate transactions, but validators who stake ETH for a chance to validate transactions to Ethereum\u2019s ledger. Lido, as a staking-as-a-service provider, allows users to deposit any number of ETH to earn staking rewards. Lido\u2019s APR currently stands at 5.2% on Ethereum.\n\nstETH Token\n\nIn return for staking ETH via Lido, Lido issues stETH, a derivative token that represents the combined value of the user\u2019s initial deposit plus accrued interest. According to Nansen, more than 86,000 unique addresses hold stETH.\n\nCurrently, 90.12% of total stETH tokens have been sitting in wallets for at least 90 days. More recently, a total of $54.97 million worth of stETH has been transferred to over 2,600 fresh wallets, addresses created in the last 15 days, Nansen data shows.\n\nLido stakers can hold their stETH, sell it on the open market or use their stETH in various DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms.\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, of the circulating supply of stETH, some 931,000, or 20%, sits in crypto lending platform Aave\u2019s aSTETH Token contract, while roughly 411,000 or 8.75% resides in decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve\u2019s stETH-ETH Swap contract, demonstrating the token\u2019s wide integration into DeFi protocols.\n\nLido didn\u2019t return a request for comment by press time."

        "title": "Creating a Decentralized App (Dapp) on Ethereum: A Step-by-Step Guide - The Enlightened Mindset",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe world of blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, with new projects and applications being developed every day. One of the most popular and influential blockchain networks is Ethereum, which is an open-source, public platform for building decentralized applications (dapps). In this article, we will explore what Ethereum and dapps are, outline the necessary steps for creating a dapp on Ethereum, discuss the benefits of developing a dapp on the Ethereum network, give an overview of the tools needed to create a dapp, provide examples of existing dapps on Ethereum, and discuss best practices for security and maintenance of a dapp.\n\nExplaining the Basics of Ethereum and Dapps\n\nBefore diving into the details of creating a dapp on Ethereum, it is important to understand the basics of the Ethereum platform and what dapps are. Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform that supports smart contract functionality. It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, and has since become one of the most popular platforms for decentralized applications.\n\nA dapp is a type of application that runs on a decentralized network, such as the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional applications, which are typically centralized, a dapp is not controlled by any single entity or person. Instead, it is managed by a network of computers, which ensures that the data is secure and tamper-proof. Dapps can be used for a variety of purposes, from digital asset management to online voting.\n\nOutlining the Necessary Steps for Building a Dapp on Ethereum\n\nOutlining the Necessary Steps for Building a Dapp on Ethereum\n\nNow that you have a basic understanding of what Ethereum and dapps are, let\u2019s take a look at the steps involved in creating a dapp on Ethereum. The following are the necessary steps for building a dapp on Ethereum:\n\nChoose a Language\n\nThe first step in creating a dapp on Ethereum is to choose a programming language. There are several languages that can be used to develop a dapp on Ethereum, including Solidity, JavaScript, Python, and Go. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to use a different language for the development of your dapp.\n\nCreate a Smart Contract\n\nThe next step is to create a smart contract. A smart contract is an immutable piece of code that is stored on the Ethereum blockchain and contains the terms of a transaction or agreement between two or more parties. When the conditions of the contract are met, the code is executed and the transaction is completed. Smart contracts are essential for developing dapps, as they are responsible for executing the logic of the dapp and ensure that all users abide by the same rules.\n\nDevelop the Front-End\n\nOnce the smart contract is written, the next step is to develop the front-end of the dapp. This involves designing the user interface, writing HTML and CSS code, and connecting the dapp to the Ethereum blockchain. This step requires some knowledge of web development, as well as experience working with Ethereum.\n\nDeploy the Dapp\n\nOnce the front-end has been developed, the next step is to deploy the dapp. This involves deploying the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain and ensuring that the dapp is connected to the blockchain. This step requires an understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the various tools available for deploying dapps to the blockchain.\n\nDescribing the Benefits of Building a Dapp on Ethereum\n\nDescribing the Benefits of Building a Dapp on Ethereum\n\nBuilding a dapp on Ethereum comes with several advantages over traditional applications. The following are some of the key benefits of developing a dapp on Ethereum:\n\nSecurity\n\nOne of the major benefits of developing a dapp on Ethereum is the enhanced security it provides. Since the dapp is running on a decentralized network, it is much less vulnerable to hacking and malicious attacks than a traditional application. Additionally, smart contracts help to ensure that all transactions are secure and tamper-proof.\n\nTransparency\n\nAnother benefit of developing a dapp on Ethereum is the increased transparency it offers. All transactions and data stored on the Ethereum blockchain are visible to anyone, which helps to ensure that all users are abiding by the same rules and that no one is taking advantage of the system.\n\nCost Efficiency\n\nFinally, building a dapp on Ethereum can be significantly more cost-efficient than using a traditional application. Since there is no need for server infrastructure or hosting fees, the overall cost of developing and maintaining a dapp on Ethereum is much lower than it would be with a traditional application.\n\nGiving an Overview of the Tools Needed to Develop a Dapp\n\nIn order to develop a dapp on Ethereum, there are certain tools and technologies that are required. The following are some of the most common tools and technologies needed for developing a dapp on Ethereum:\n\nDevelopment Platforms\n\nThe first tool needed for developing a dapp on Ethereum is a development platform. Development platforms provide a suite of tools and services that make it easier to develop, test, and deploy a dapp. Popular development platforms for Ethereum include Truffle, Embark, and DappHero.\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nThe second tool needed for developing a dapp on Ethereum is a programming language. As mentioned earlier, there are several languages that can be used to develop a dapp on Ethereum, including Solidity, JavaScript, Python, and Go. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to use a different language for the development of your dapp.\n\nTesting Tools\n\nFinally, testing tools are essential for ensuring that your dapp is functioning properly before it is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. Popular testing tools for Ethereum include Ganache and Remix. These tools allow developers to test their dapp locally, without having to deploy it to the main Ethereum network.\n\nProviding Examples of Existing Dapps on Ethereum\n\nNow that you know the basics of developing a dapp on Ethereum, let\u2019s take a look at some examples of existing dapps on the Ethereum network. The following are three popular dapps on Ethereum:\n\nCryptoKitties\n\nCryptoKitties is a game that allows players to buy, sell, and breed digital cats. The game was launched in 2017 and quickly became one of the most popular dapps on Ethereum. CryptoKitties is a great example of how dapps can be used for gaming and entertainment purposes.\n\nAugur\n\nAugur is a prediction market platform that allows users to place bets on the outcome of events. The platform uses a decentralized network of nodes to ensure that the results of the predictions are accurate and tamper-proof. Augur is a great example of how dapps can be used for financial applications.\n\nMaker\n\nMaker is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Maker is responsible for issuing the Dai stablecoin, which is backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies and is designed to maintain a stable value. Maker is a great example of how dapps can be used for financial applications.\n\nDiscussing Best Practices for Security and Maintenance of a Dapp\n\nDiscussing Best Practices for Security and Maintenance of a Dapp\n\nOnce you have developed and deployed your dapp on Ethereum, it is important to follow best practices for security and maintenance. The following are some tips for ensuring the security and maintenance of your dapp:\n\nUtilize Security Audits\n\nIt is important to regularly conduct security audits of your dapp to ensure that it is secure and functioning properly. Security audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your dapp, which can then be addressed before they become major problems.\n\nMonitor Transactions\n\nIt is also important to monitor all transactions on your dapp to ensure that no one is taking advantage of the system. By monitoring transactions, you can detect suspicious activity and address it before it becomes a major issue.\n\nImplement Upgrades Regularly\n\nFinally, it is important to regularly implement upgrades to your dapp. This will ensure that your dapp is always up-to-date with the latest features and security protocols, and will help to prevent any potential issues from arising.\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a dapp on Ethereum is a complex process, but it can be incredibly rewarding. By understanding the basics of Ethereum, learning the necessary steps for creating a dapp, exploring the benefits of developing a dapp on Ethereum, understanding the tools needed for development, and following best practices for security and maintenance, you can create a successful dapp on Ethereum.\n\n(Note: Is this article not meeting your expectations?
