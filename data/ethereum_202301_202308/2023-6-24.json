        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s on-chain movements indicate bullish pressure building around Ether as its exchange balances reached an all-time low and staking deposits keep surging.\n\nEther\u2019s (ETH) technical charts suggest that the asset can reclaim $3,000 if buyers are able to push above the resistance between $1,900 and $2,000.\n\nETH held on exchanges hits an all-time low\n\nExchange balances for ETH reached a new low of 12.6%, dropping sharply in the last 30 days, according to Glassnode data. Reduced supply on exchanges is usually a bullish sign, as it means fewer tokens are readily available for selling.\n\nPercentage of ETH\u2019s supply on crypto exchanges.

Currently, over 23 million ETH is deposited in staking contracts, representing 19.1% of its total supply.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data shows that nearly 30% of ETH\u2019s supply is locked in smart contracts, including decentralized finance and staking contracts, up from 25.5% at the start of 2023.\n\nIncreased withdrawals from exchanges and deposits in smart contracts are positive for ETH's price, as it reduces its liquid supply.\n\nETH/USD price analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price broke above the 50-day moving average at $1,823.09, staging a bullish breakout.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair is currently facing resistance around the horizontal level of $1,906. The pair has recorded higher lows since November 2022, with the $1,900-$2,000 level acting as technical and psychological resistance levels, according to the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout above $2,000 could quickly propel ETH toward the 2022 breakdown levels of around $3,000. The targets of the bullish ascending channel pattern also coincide around these levels.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe recovery that began last week\u2014after U.S. inflation appeared to cool\u2014hit its stride this week as markets continued to reverberate from the bombshell of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing an application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nDozens of companies apply for ETFs, and dozens have been rejected. To date, not a single Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the crypto-skeptic SEC, despite the fact that Canadian regulators have approved many of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are high: a spot ETF would offer investors the chance to buy into Bitcoin and either ride the gravy train or go to hell in a hand basket, but if the latter, they\u2019ll be safe in the knowledge that their investment is protected, unlike those who purchase and store crypto directly.\n\nIf anybody has a chance of getting an ETF approved, it\u2019s BlackRock. The firm boasts an incredible $9 trillion in assets under management and has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting an ETF approved by the SEC.\n\nThe news inspired two more U.S. asset managers, WisdomTree and Invesco, which have both previously applied for their own ETFs\u2014to file fresh ETF applications this week. Valkyrie followed suit shortly after.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC) both surged this week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency shot up 18% to its current price of $30,687, while the biggest runner up rallied 12.7% to trade at $1,893 at the start of the weekend.\n\nInvestors flooded into other cryptocurrencies this week as well. In fact, most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market cap shot up by double-digit percentages. There were no losses among the major unbacked coins.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ballooned a staggering 80.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $192.90.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulation and expansion\n\nWhile all eyes were on the SEC and big asset managers this week, there were a couple of other stories that indicated the steady adoption of crypto is continuing around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial project backed by the Bank of England published its findings, concluding that a centrally-issued sterling-pegged digital currency could \u201cenable a robust ecosystem to foster innovation, and to help meet the future needs of a more digitalised society.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2014dubbed Project Rosalind\u2014emphasized the programmability of crypto through smart contracts, which facilitate automatic payments and enable new kinds of online transactions.\n\nOn Monday, British parliamentarians in the House of Lords (upper chamber) voted through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, a piece of legislation that proposes regulation for stablecoins, crypto and crypto promotion.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House of Commons and has made it through to the final stages: the Consideration of Amendments, where both chambers debate the proposals and tighten the screws until they both agree. The final stage requires a signature from King Charlie himself.\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that Germany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, applied for a digital asset custody platform license with the German finance regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nDuring a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC) on Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should play a \u201crobust federal role\u201d in crypto regulation and added that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power\u201d while implying the same about stablecoins.\n\nFinally, XRP progenitor Ripple was granted an in-principle payments license in Singapore. Ripple has long felt heat from U.S. regulators. A lawsuit against it by the SEC has been ongoing since 2020 and, like Coinbase, the company is now hedging its bets through global expansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "ERC 6551 Ethereum Standard Changes Game in Ethereum NFTs: Guide - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe launch of ERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts (TBAs) is arguably the most impressive addition to Ethereum's (ETH) open-source stack in the segment of NFTs since the onset of ERC-721, a mainstream digital collectible standard.\n\nOnce it reaches massive adoption, it can change the narrative in the usage, economics and functionality of NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and EVM ecosystem blockchains.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: Highlights\n\nERC 6551, dubbed \"Non-fungible Token Bound Accounts. An interface and registry for smart contract accounts owned by ERC 721 tokens,\" was launched on May 7, 2023.\n\nERC 6551 is a standard of Ethereum (ETH) non-fungible tokens that can act as noncustodial wallets of Ethereum (ETH) accounts;\n\nERC 6551 allows every ERC 721 token to achieve all the functionalities of a cryptocurrency wallet: sending/receiving transactions, storing its own NFTs, participating in airdrops and so on;\n\nERC 6551 standard is backward-compatible: it can equip every existing non-fungible token with advanced functionality;\n\nNew standard is authored by CryptoKitties co-creator Jayden Windle and Benny Giang of Future Primitive;\n\nERC 6551-enabled NFTs can be used in decentralized gaming, reputation management, on-chain messaging, analytics, trading and so on.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the standard has been developed in an open-source manner. However, its authors stressed that some Web3 companies are already working on instruments designed to make the \"upgrading\" of NFTs easier.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent the type of cryptocurrency token with some unique features. While basically all cryptocurrency tokens (just like fiat currencies) are fungible \u2014 e.g. you can always replace 1 USDT with 1 USDT, 1 BTC with 1 BTC \u2014 every NFT is a unique token.\n\nUnder the hood, NFTs should be considered as contracts regarding ownership of some content. Should we check out the code of the majority of NFTs, we can find that they are tokenized agreements: \"This is to certify that Ethereum account 0xabcd\u2026owns the file Azuki4771.jpg starting from the block 123456.\" As such, most NFTs can be interpreted as tokenized digital property rights.\n\nUsers typically mint NFTs associated with digital content: images, texts, songs, videos, characters and in-game assets.\n\nWhat is ERC 721?\n\nEthereum Request for Comments 721, or ERC 721, is a standard on the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., the standardized design of non-fungible tokens. Introduced in December 2017, this format paved the way for standard NFTs: developers are able to launch them in a streamlined manner.\n\nOn the other hand, ERC 721 is a sample of a smart contract, i.e., a code template that describes basic NFT functionality. All mainstream NFT collections \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, RTFKT \u2014 include ERC 721 tokens. Also, it is a backbone element of the tooling of all of the top NFT marketplaces: OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur and so on.\n\nHow to create NFTs?\n\nBasically, there are two ways to create non-fungible tokens yourself. First, you can try using no-code instruments like Mintable. With them, users can just upload their content, pay gas fees and get their NFTs minted. On some L2 chains, NFTs can even be minted in a gasless manner.\n\nThen, NFTs can be created with OpenZeppelin code templates. To create a token this way, the user needs to set up a MetaMask wallet, pay fees (or claim testnet tokens from the faucet), take the ERC 721 code template, compile it and deploy it to the network \u2014 either Ethereum or Polygon.\n\nWhat are Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nWhile, typically, NFTs are associated with programmable blockchains (that support smart contracts), in 2023, the hype around \"Bitcoin NFTs\" \u2014 also known as \"Inscriptions\" or \"Ordinals\" \u2014 gained steam.\n\nOrdinals is a technology that allows attaching data to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. As satoshis in Bitcoin (BTC) can be modified, users can equip them with content, from .jpeg files to JSON data.\n\nHowever, this standard cannot go mainstream as it is technically sophisticated: to create Ordinals, you need to run a full Bitcoin (BTC) node. Also, the activity of Ordinals creators made the Bitcoin (BTC) network almost unusable.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount Abstraction, or ERC 4337, is a technology that allows Ethereum (ETH) wallets to act like decentralized banks. It blurs the line between wallets and smart contracts and paves the way for a new type of entity in Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains, i.e., \"smart wallets.\"\n\nAccount Abstraction was introduced in early 2023 and is usually described as the \"next big thing\" in Ethereum (ETH) functionality.\n\nVitalik Buterin described this concept as one of the three pillars of Ethereum's (ETH) progress in its transition toward a mature tech stack.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: First comprehensive guide\n\nERC 6551 is a novel mechanism in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It allows NFTs to be equipped with an additional layer of wallet functionality.\n\nERC 6551: Basics\n\nERC 6551 is a protocol that makes \"regular\" NFTs on Ethereum (ETH) and other EVM blockchains act like \"smart contract wallets,\" i.e., to perform all actions that are normal for noncustodial crypto wallets. That said, it allows ERC 721 NFTs to receive and send transactions, to store their own NFTs, to swap ERC 20 tokens and so on. ERC 6551-enabled tokens are called \"token-bound accounts,\" or TBAs.\n\nImage by TokenBound\n\nERC 6551 was proposed in early 2023 by Ethereum (ETH) veterans Benny Giang, co-author of ERC 721 standard and co-creator of CryptoKitties, and Jayden Windle, lead software developer at Future Primitive. In February 2023, it was published as an EIP on Ethereum Foundation forum while, on May 7, 2023, it was activated in mainnet.\n\nThe standard is fully open source and is subject to active discussion in the Ethereum (ETH) community. ERC 6551 is backward compatible; every existing NFT can be turned into TBA. Support for ERC 6551-enabled tokens has already been researched by OpenSea and a number of other blue-chip NFT institutions.\n\nERC 6551: Tech design\n\nTechnically, ERC 6551 is an adjustment to ERC 721, the most common standard for Ethereum's NFTs. \"Regular\" ERC 721/ERC 1155 NFTs contain just three types of entries, including the address of the NFT owner, the address of the person who can transfer the NFT and the characteristics of the associated metadata (content).\n\nImage by Ethereum Foundation\n\nAs such, the functions of NFTs are limited: they only can be transferred among Ethereum (ETH) addresses. However, should we use \"registries\" and \"proxies\" (other types of smart contracts), we can map a certain NFT to a standard Ethereum smart contract address (say, BAYC 1234 to 0xabcd..).\n\nNFT researcher and contributor to ERC721A standard 0xCygaar highlights that ERC 6551-enabled NFTs can control an unlimited number of crypto wallets:\n\nA single NFT may control more than one contract account, however, each contract account only belongs to a single NFT.\n\nOnce this mapping happens, NFT-bound wallets become smart contracts. Not unlike multi-sigs, the owner of a smart contract can authorize a transaction by the executeCall command on the wallet.\n\nERC 6551: Possible implementations\n\nAs ERC 6551 NFTs become regular crypto wallets \u2014 but without losing their NFT-specific features \u2014 they have a lot of use cases in Web3 and classic economics.\n\nFor instance, thanks to impressive composability opportunities, all NFTs can be mapped to a single ERC 6551 NFT with his avatar. In a similar manner, a Web3 gamer can collect his/her in-game assets to streamline their display and usage. The entire procedure becomes user friendly and transparent. Everyone is able to track the true history of this or that NFT, which removes the possibility for cheating and selling stolen NFTs.\n\nThen, ERC 6551 NFTs can interact with DeFis, trading bots and marketplaces without revealing the identity and core wallet of their holders. This significantly increases the anonymity and security of the NFT experience.\n\nEven more impressive opportunities are unlocked in the \"real-world\" economic context. For instance, here's how NFTs of new standards can be used in the tourism segment to create a holistic travel experience.\n\nTravel experiences thanks to NFT technology pic.twitter.com/q3R9hYM18Z \u2014 Andrei (@andreiponi) May 31, 2023\n\nHere's how ERC 6551 tokens can be used even by customers with no previous cryptocurrency experience.\n\nERC 6551: How can you benefit?\n\nAs an average user of cryptocurrency, you can benefit from starting to work with ERC 6551 tokens in multiple ways:\n\nFor gamers: With the new standard, you can create a collection of your in-game assets and map it to a single NFT somehow associated with your profile (with an avatar, personal name and so on); this will make your reputation and status more visible;\n\nFor NFT collectors: With ERC 6551, you can apply the \"don't trust, verify\" rule to your experience with buying NFTs as you can see the history of their ownership. Also, you can map your entire collection to a single NFT and exhibit it as such;\n\nFor metaverse enthusiasts: With ERC 6551, you are able to equip your character in this or that metaverse with a more advanced toolkit of \"personal\" features.\n\nAs such, the activation of ERC 6551 paves the way for more immersive, transparent and feature-rich experiences in plenty of Web3 segments for new and existing NFT enthusiasts. It can actually do for NFTs what ERC 4337 or Account Abstraction does for Ethereum (ETH) as a whole.\n\nWrapping up\n\nERC 6551 is an impressive innovation in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It enriches the tooling of non-fungible tokens with the functions of a regular crypto wallet. Everyone can turn his/her NFTs into \"Token Bound Accounts\" via a newbie-friendly dashboard.\n\nWith ERC 6551, NFTs become as functional as \"smart crypto wallets,\" a new form of cryptocurrency wallet unlocked by the Account Abstraction mechanism. Starting from 2023, the line between NFTs, crypto wallets and smart contracts is blurred."

        "content": "ETH price hovered around $1,890, inching closer to the $1,900 price zone.\n\nETH supply on exchanges continued to decline, reaching a record low.\n\nEthereum [ETH] trended sideways for weeks and eventually slid. However, it has embarked on an upward trajectory, breathing new life into the market. Nevertheless, amidst this surge, the available supply of Ethereum on exchanges has been steadily dwindling, adding an intriguing twist to the unfolding narrative.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023- 24\n\nEthereum maintains a bull trend\n\nLooking at the daily timeframe chart of Ethereum revealed an intriguing journey that began around 15 June when it initiated its upward surge. Since then, it has accumulated growth of over 16% in value.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum hovered around the $1,890 mark, exhibiting a slight dip in value.\n\nHowever, on 23 June, it concluded the trading session with a noteworthy addition of 1.10%. While it has yet to reclaim the $2,000 price range, an exciting development unfolded as it successfully shattered the resistance posed by its short Moving Average (yellow line) around the $1,820 price zone.\n\nThis breakthrough indicated a positive shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nThe press time price trajectory has also propelled Ethereum into a bull run, as evidenced by its Relative Strength Index (RSI). As of this writing, the RSI line stood above 60, signifying a strong bullish trend.\n\nEthereum on exchanges declines\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s valiant efforts toward recovery, a fascinating phenomenon persists\u2014the dwindling supply of ETH on exchanges. Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the supply on exchanges, as a percentage of the total supply, had reached an all-time low.\n\nAs of this writing, this supply had declined to approximately 9.1%, marking its lowest level since Ethereum\u2019s inception.\n\nThe decline in supply commenced back in January, but it was during May that a sharp downturn became apparent. This downward trajectory has persisted until now, further deepening the scarcity of Ethereum available on exchanges.\n\nETH profitability for long-term holders\n\nExamining the profitability of Ethereum for long-term holders revealed that, despite the recent uptrends, they have yet to translate into profitability for these holders.\n\nAs of this writing, the two-year Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) had dipped below zero, standing at -10% at press time. This indicated that individuals who have held onto ETH during this specific held at a loss.\n\nHowever, there remained a glimmer of hope. A sustained increase in value could potentially propel these holders into a more profitable zone, alleviating their loss position at press time.\n\nFurthermore, traders, as per data provided by CoinGlass, held optimistic expectations for an impending price surge. As of this writing, the funding rate on CoinGlass stood in positive territory.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis was a significant indicator of positive sentiment among traders actively taking long positions.\n\nIt is worth noting that a price rise could further enhance the positivity of the funding rate, potentially attracting more traders to take long positions. Conversely, a price decline would cause a substantial number of positions to be liquidated."

        "title": "ETH Bulls Aim at $2K But is a Retest of $1.8K Coming First? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price recently received support at the 200-day moving average and subsequently embarked on a strong bullish rally, breaking above the 100-day MA. This could be a positive indicator for Ethereum\u2019s mid-term prospects, but it also carries the risk of being a bull trap.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of correction and a significant downtrend, the price reached the $1.6K level, which coincided with the 200-day moving average and found support. The significant buying pressure at this level triggered a rapid reversal and an upward trend toward the critical resistance zone around $2K.\n\nAdditionally, the price surpassed the 100-day moving average at $1.8K, suggesting a bullish bias for Ethereum in the mid-term. However, to confirm the presence of a bull market in 2023 and restore sufficient demand to the market, Ethereum\u2019s price still needs to overcome the substantial resistance at the $2K region and consolidate above.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn general, the Fibonacci retracement tool is helpful for identifying potential reversal points and correction targets during impulsive trends. As previously mentioned, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a mid-term correction phase after reaching the yearly high of $2.1K through an impulsive uptrend.\n\nExamining the chart reveals that the bearish correction leg found support and reversed at the 61.8% retracement level, a commonly observed target for correction phases. The prevailing buying pressure within this critical range resulted in a robust bullish trend towards the $2K region.\n\nIf the price successfully surpasses the significant resistance around $2K, it will pave the way for a mid-term bullish trend, as this level holds psychological significance. However, it is worth considering the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, which suggests the possibility of a slight rejection and short-term consolidation before Ethereum makes its next move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has been consolidating below the $2K level for the past few months after being rejected from that level. The uncertainty seen on the price chart is also reflected in the futures market sentiment.\n\nThis chart displays the Funding Rates metric, which indicates whether the futures market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Recently, after a period of correction in the market, which coincided with a downtrend in the funding rates metric, the price found support and began a strong rally.\n\nHowever, the metric has started to show a slight uptrend during this bullish rally, suggesting increased buying pressure and a greater tendency among participants to take long positions rather than short positions.\n\nWhile this could be seen as a bullish sign for the market, traders should exercise caution as it may actually be a bull trap, potentially leading to a long-squeeze event."

        "title": "All about Ethscriptions: the Ethereum protocol rivaling Bitcoin ordinals - OKX",
        "content": "Bitcoin ordinals took the Web3 world by storm following their introduction in January 2023. The adoption of ordinals has been massive, with millions of inscriptions being created in the few months since launch.\n\nBy June 2023, Ethereum wanted to join the party and participate in this phenomenon. That led to the development of Ethscriptions, a recently launched protocol that's gained rapid acceptance.\n\nThis protocol empowers users to generate and exchange digital entities on the Ethereum blockchain if they fall within the 96-kilobyte limit.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deeper into Ethscriptions, exploring how to create one and what's next as the protocol continues to evolve.\n\nWhat are Ethscriptions?\n\nImagine a world where you can inscribe your digital creations onto the Ethereum blockchain, preserving them forever. Well, Tom Lehman, the co-founder of Genius.com, has made that a reality with Ethscriptions, a fusion of Ethereum and Inscriptions.\n\nThis innovative protocol, inspired by the ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, has captivated the imaginations of enthusiasts and developers alike.\n\nWithin 18 hours of launch, nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions have been created, demonstrating the immense enthusiasm surrounding this protocol. Ethscriptions empower users to inscribe their arbitrary data onto the Ethereum blockchain, opening up a world of creative expression and data storage possibilities.\n\nLeveraging calldata\n\nWhat makes Ethscriptions unique is its ingenious use of Ethereum 'calldata' \u2014 all of the data that's passed on when a transaction is made on the network. By harnessing the power of calldata, Ethscriptions offer a cheaper and more decentralized alternative to traditional contract storage methods. This approach makes sure the distinctiveness, integrity, and immutability of every valid Ethscription.\n\nIn a world where layer 2 scaling solutions dominate the conversation, Ethscriptions could steal the limelight as it evolves.\n\nEthereum Punks\n\nWhat sets Ethscriptions apart is the Ethereum community's unmatched embrace of innovation and experimentation. The community has become a playground for developers wanting to push the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve.\n\nTo make an indelible mark and ignite interest, Lehman rallied the Ethereum community to ethscribe 'Ethereum Punks' inspired by the world-famous NFT collection, Crypto Punks.\n\nThe response was nothing short of a frenzy, as copies of all 10,000 Ethereum Punk images were inscribed within a matter of hours. This massive excitement demonstrated the immense potential and demand for Ethscriptions in the NFT space.\n\nLimitations\n\nAs of June 2023, the protocol is limited to images. However, there are plans to expand its capabilities to include different file types, promising even more exciting opportunities for digital creators.\n\nOf course, every protocol has its challenges. Ethscriptions faced intermittent downtime due to the overwhelming surge of new users. And, critics argue that similar technologies have existed for years, with some artists already adopting them in their work.\n\nHowever, it's through recent widespread awareness and adoption that the true potential of Ethscriptions is being recognized.\n\nHow to create an Ethscription\n\nEthscriptions.com launched a tool to create your own Ethscription, and also an easy step-by-step guide that claims you can create your Ethscription in 60 seconds! (Don't worry, we won't time you).\n\nConvert an image (max size: 96KB) to a Base 64-encoded data URI (data:image/png;base64,...) using a service like base64-image.de. The Ethscriptions protocol supports all data URIs but images work best. Convert the data URI to hex using an online tool like hexhero Send a 0 eth transaction to the person you want to own the Ethscription with the hex data from (2) in the 'Hex data' field After a few moments, it should appear on this page, provided someone hasn\u2019t already ethscribed the same data. Duplicate content is ignored.\n\nWhat are Ethscription Improvement Proposals?\n\nEthscription Improvement Proposals (ESIP) are proposed enhancements to the Ethscriptions protocol. Each ESIP addresses specific protocol aspects to improve its functionality and usability. Here are some key ESIPs and their objectives:\n\nESIP-1: smart contract Ethscription transfers: This ESIP allows smart contracts to transfer Ethscriptions. It introduced a new smart contract event, \"ethscriptions_protocol_TransferEthscription\" enabling contracts to transfer Ethscriptions they own. This enhancement was aimed at supporting the creation of protocol-native apps like marketplaces, addressing limitations in smart contract interactions with Ethscriptions.\n\nESIP-2: safe trustless smart contract Ethscription escrow: This proposal introduced a mechanism for smart contracts to safely and trustlessly escrow Ethscriptions. It added a new event, \"ethscriptions_protocol_TransferEthscriptionForPreviousOwner,\" which enables conditional Ethscription transfers, thereby overcoming challenges in identifying the depositor of an Ethscription in escrow situations. This is particularly useful for marketplace scenarios, where Ethscriptions need to be transferred to a marketplace contract for listing.\n\nESIP-3: smart contract Ethscription creations: This proposal allows smart contracts to create Ethscriptions using Ethereum events. It introduced an event, \"ethscriptions_protocol_CreateEthscription,\" enabling contracts to register valid Ethscription creation attempts. This expansion was significant in making sure that contracts have similar capabilities to Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) regarding Ethscription creation.\n\nThe ESIPs are part of the ongoing development and enhancement of the Ethscriptions protocol, reflecting efforts to address limitations and expand the protocol's capabilities. Each ESIP goes through a discussion and review process before being accepted and implemented.\n\nThe Ethscription zone\n\nTo enhance your Ethscription experience, the OKX Web3 wallet has various tools to help you out. These tools \u2014 introduced below \u2014 can be found on the 'discover' section of the Web3 wallet on the web or mobile app.\n\nEtch market: the first platform for launching and indexing Ethscriptions, driven by a community.\n\nEthscriptions: this is the protocol itself, a new way of creating and sharing digital artifacts on Ethereum using transaction call data.\n\nEthsmarket: built on Ethscriptions, the initial trading platform and distribution protocol.\n\nEthscriber: an easy-to-use tool to inscribe text Ethscriptions by zacque.eth.\n\nEths check: an Ethscriptipons query platform.\n\nNFTSniper: Examine the amount of Ethscription tokens contained in the address.\n\nThe final word\n\nMany in the crypto space are excited by the potential to expand Ethscriptions beyond images, as developers continue to experiment and push the boundaries of blockchain technology.\n\nThe impact of Ethscriptions on digital objects and data inscription is set to evolve and expand. Ethscriptions currently only work with images, but as we've seen with Ethereum Punks, it hasn't limited creators and developers.\n\nThe fate of Ethscriptions now lies in the hands of the community, and like with any protocol, it's essential to do your research before you participate."

        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) Could Experience a Bigger Growth Than Top Players Like Ethereum (ETH) According to Crypto Whales\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a top player in the crypto scene. Investors are constantly on the lookout for the next utility project with the potential to match or surpass its growth.\n\nWhile numerous tokens have failed to meet this expectation, InQubeta (QUBE) has been predicted to have all it takes to experience bigger growth than Ethereum.\n\nTo learn more about this project poised to skyrocket and why you should invest in it, continue reading.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The New AI Token to Skyrocket\n\nAI usage and popularity are currently on the rise, with InQubeta emerging as the new focus. InQubeta is the world\u2019s first blockchain-based crypto crowdfunding platform.\n\nThrough the platform, AI entrepreneurs can seamlessly conduct fundraising for their projects. InQubeta has hit the ground running by recording instant presale success.\n\nAnalysts believe the project\u2019s protocol is well on its way to adoption and its deflationary token is bound to skyrocket.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s novel concept is centered around crowdfunding for AI startups and investment for members.\n\nThrough its innovative platform, startups will be able to seamlessly raise much-needed funds for their projects, while members will be able to browse and invest in promising projects.\n\nIts marketplace will form an important part of its ecosystem as projects will be able to mint investment opportunities which token holders can fractionally invest in.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s fractional investment model will allow members to partially invest in the next big AI projects, which will in turn produce significant returns.\n\nThe deflationary nature of the InQubeta (QUBE) token means its supply will reduce over time and drive its price uptrend.\n\nThe benefits of holding InQubeta (QUBE) tokens include staking rewards and voting rights, making it a utility token and bullish.\n\nThe presale is currently in its stage 1 and costs $0.00875 per token. Over $500,000 has been raised in just a few weeks, which is proof of its popularity and growth potential.\n\nAccording to experts, the gains from InQubeta (QUBE) will be significant and have the potential to soar 40x when it launches.\n\nWith its smart contract audited by Hacken, KYC audit by Block Audit and tokens to be vested for 12 weeks, investors can be confident about their investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a Top Crypto and a Blue-Chip Token\n\nEthereum (ETH) is undoubtedly a blue-chip token, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC) in the crypto market.\n\nThe open-source blockchain and its native token, Ether (ETH), have witnessed massive adoption and growth since its launch.\n\nBy investing early in Ethereum, investors would have enjoyed over 61,000% returns on investment if purchased at its launch or earliest price.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is trading in an uptrend from its opening price in January, which indicates that it is a great investment.\n\nThe bear cycle has seen Ethereum experience a price decline. In addition, considering its recorded growth, there are fears that Ethereum might not be able to replicate its past success.\n\nThis has led investors to InQubeta (QUBE), a new token with strong fundamentals that experts have predicted could have bigger growth than Ethereum (ETH).\n\nConclusion\n\nIt won\u2019t be an easy feat to surpass Ethereum\u2019s growth, but if any token could, it would be InQubeta\u2019s QUBE.\n\nThe increasing adoption and acceptance of AI and blockchain will play a great part in InQubeta\u2019s growth.\n\nAccording to experts, investors should be poised for a bullish ride with InQubeta as it is likely to surpass that of Ethereum.\n\nTo be a part of this success, you should participate in its presale and enjoy significant profits during its presale and after launch."

        "content": "In a recent fiery debate that has captivated the crypto space, the XRP community clashed with Max Keiser, advisor to the president of El Salvador and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist. The topic that ignited the heated discussion was the contentious issue of cryptocurrency regulation, specifically concerning the fate of XRP and Ethereum (ETH) in the face of mounting pressure from the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser unequivocally stated that the regulatory overreach would inevitably lead to the demise of XRP and every other cryptocurrency, except for Bitcoin, which he deemed \"untouchable.\"\n\nOf course the SEC is 'overreaching' but that won't stop them from killing off XRP and every other shitcoin.

Bukele \ud83c\udf0b\ud83e\udde2 (@maxkeiser) June 23, 2023\n\nJohn Deaton, a pro-crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders, challenged Keiser's apocalyptic prediction. He countered by highlighting the SEC's prior labeling of Bitcoin as a security. While conceding that the commission could inflict damage on XRP, Deaton believed that the influence of its current transient regulator, Gary Gensler, would be short-lived.\n\nHe further argued that software code itself should not be classified as a security, emphasizing the need for a level playing field where the best technologies could thrive.\n\nUnswayed by Deaton's arguments, Keiser remained steadfast in his belief that both ETH and XRP would suffer the same fate. Dismissing chatter about Bitcoin as inconsequential, he declared that Gensler, the current SEC chairman, would pursue Ethereum and XRP as unregistered securities.\n\nKeiser went on to assert that the regulator functioned as a protection racket for the banking cartel, ready to employ national security and the Patriot Act if necessary to eliminate these projects."

        "content": "Ben Wung talks to CoinGeek TV on migrating from Ethereum to BSV and the future of livestreaming\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\n\u201cIt only works on BSV,\u201d Ben Wung tells CoinGeek TV on the sidelines of the London Blockchain Conference. In his interview, he talked about migrating his livestreaming platform from Ethereum to BSV blockchain and what the Bitcoin ecosystem needs to leap ahead of its rivals.\n\nWung knew years ago that blockchain would disrupt livestreaming, and he set out to build Haura, a platform he believed would do just that. He first deployed it on Ethereum, but the scaling bottlenecks soon caught up with him. He then explored Layer 2 networks like Polygon, and while they worked for some time, the same limitations came up again.\n\nOn Layer 2 networks, he says that when it comes to execution, \u201cthey fail. They get really congested, and a lot of transactions don\u2019t go through.\u201d\n\nHe then discovered BSV blockchain and has been building on the massively scaling network since.\n\nWung noted that the BSV blockchain ecosystem had grown significantly over the past few years. In the past, developers chose to build on other networks as they had easy-to-use tools that enabled these developers to deploy apps in days. However, BSV blockchain now has its own set of tools for every other need.\n\n\u201cOne example would be HandCash: their documentation is so good that our team was able to build something within a day.\u201d\n\nThis ease of use must be reflected in the apps as well. This, Wung says, is the only way we can attract millions of users. ChatGPT was able to bring in 100 million users in record time because it didn\u2019t require a learning curve to use it, he noted.\n\nWung built Haura to solve some of the pain points of the livestreaming industry. Aside from allowing users to tip content creators through BSV micropayments, viewers can also mint moments on livestreams as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which gain value depending on the context.\n\nThe NFTs are minted on 1Sat Ordinals, a protocol that has gained a massive following since it launched a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThe vision behind it [1Sat Ordinals] resonates with us. They believe in an open protocol rather than having an environment where we all compete against each other. We\u2019re better off just working together.\u201d\n\nWatch: London Blockchain Conference 2023 is not just utility, it\u2019s also about love\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

At the time of publication, the total amount locked accounted for 16.7% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply, as per a Nansen dashboard.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply on exchanges, i.e. liquid supply, has steadily dropped in the same time period. As per the information provided in the aforementioned tweet, the exchange supply fell to 23.5 million from about 28 million at the start of April.\n\nThis equated to 19% of the ETH\u2019s total circulating supply of 120.2 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe convergence underlined that people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yields. And even though staking rewards have progressively reduced over the past two years, people have preferred utilizing ETH as a savings option, as per a recent report by CoinShares.\n\nETH slips below $1900 after rally\n\nETH failed to hold its gains as it slipped below $1900 to trade at $1,885.59 at the time of writing, according to data from Santiment. It remained to be seen how sustainable the rally of 21 June would prove to be.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHowever, the spike boosted the overall profitability of the network. The 30-Day MVRV Ratio stormed into the positive territory after a gap of two weeks, suggesting that ETH holders, on average, would make profits if they were to sell their holdings.\n\nAnd while the long-term holders reacted to the price rise as indicated by the hike in the Age Consumed metric on 21 June, the subsequent decline dampened their enthusiasm."

        "title": "InQubeta (QUBE) Price To Increase 20x As Binance Coin (BNB) And Ethereum (ETH) Battles The Bear Market - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving crypto space, new projects are rising up every day. However, only a few have lived up to their promises and InQubeta (QUBE) is one of them. Experts believe that InQubeta (QUBE) has the potential to rival the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) in the coming months. Let us look at some features that InQubeta has to offer and why you should invest in it.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The First Crypto Crowdfunding Platform To Embrace Blockchain Technology\n\nInQubeta is now a major attraction in the crypto space attracting investors from all over the crypto ecosystem. It is the first crypto crowdfunding platform and has introduced the deflationary QUBE token which experts believe will soar 20x when it launches.\n\nThe project\u2019s primary objective is to revolutionize AI startup fundraising and community engagement using blockchain technology. The platform has developed a fractional investment system that allows investors to acquire partial ownership of promising AI startups from anywhere in the world. Through NFTs and fractionalization, individuals can invest with little capital.\n\nThis approach democratizes the investment landscape, empowering both low and high-income individuals to invest in AI startup funding. The platform has an NFT marketplace where AI startups can mint investment opportunities, list them for other QUBE token holders to invest in, and earn rewards as they flourish.\n\nAdditionally, the QUBE token has several benefits like voting rights and staking rewards. InQubeta\u2019s presale phase has attracted a wide audience, raising over $500,000 in just a few weeks and selling approximately 45% of the allocated QUBE tokens during its stage 1 for $0.00875 per QUBE. Binance Coin (BNB) Losses Continue\n\nRecently, the price of Binance Coin has dropped significantly from its position above $280. The lawsuit filed by the SEC against Binance has affected the token\u2019s price and has also exerted bearish pressure on top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter soaring to $352 a few weeks ago, the price of Binance Coin underwent a sharp correction breaching the crucial support levels at $280 and $250 and eventually testing the significant support zone at $220. Over the last few weeks, BNB has been trading below the 100-day simple moving average around the $220 \u2013 $250 zone.\n\nDespite recording marginal price increase since the second week of June, Binance Coin (BNB) has failed to break out of the $220 \u2013 $250 trading zone, and fails to surpass the resistance at $250, there is a possibility of further downward movement. The initial support level to watch out for on the downside is around $220.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Fails To Surpass $1,780 Resistance\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been bullish since the start of 2023, but suffered a sharp decline in June after being caught in regulatory webs. The decline saw Ethereum (ETH) trade under $1,700 for the first time since March, but the number one altcoin has since recovered.\n\nDespite the rally, Ethereum has failed to break above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels despite multiple attempts. The altcoin is currently having difficulties surpassing the $1,800 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe lack of momentum has kept ETH trading between the $1,600 and $1,800 range for weeks now. If Ethereum fails to overcome the immediate resistance at $1,755 in the coming weeks, crypto analysts expect more price decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Binance Coin and Ethereum have garnered attention in the crypto space for a long time, newcomers like InQubeta are taking things a step further using nascent technologies. Analysts have even forecasted a potential 20x surge as the QUBE token continues to gain traction and widespread adoption, propelled by its innovative approach and robust technology. Early investors can capitalize on the potential 20x rise by investing in InQubeta today.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

However, a bounce back did not happen, which means that bulls are still controlling the situation on the market. If sellers do not seize the initiative, the blast may lead to a test of the $32,000 zone next week.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $30,682 at press time.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum (ETH) has followed the rise of Bitcoin (BTC), rising by 1.30%.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nFrom the technical point of view, Ethereum (ETH) is not looking as bullish as Bitcoin (BTC) as the rate has once again failed to fix above the $1,935 level. In this case, if the bar closes below the $1,900 zone, sellers might locally seize the initiative, which can lead to a correction to the $1,860 mark.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,895 at press time.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nXRP has gained the least value, going up by 0.78% since yesterday.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nOn the daily time frame, the price of XRP is neither bullish nor bearish as the rate is in the middle of the wide channel. The nearest mark that traders should focus on is $0.50. If the price fixes above it, it might be a prerequisite for a test of the resistance at $0.5270.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.4918 at press time."

        "content": "JP Morgan introduces euro-based denominated transactions in addition to the existing dollar-based payment.\n\nSince its inception, JPM Coin has processed over $300 billion in transactions compared to the JPM overall businesses that have processed almost $10 trillion daily.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is fast expanding as traditional financial systems explore possibilities to integrate blockchain technology and digital assets. JP Morgan Chase & Co is reportedly introducing a euro-based payment in addition to the already existing dollar-based payment for its corporate clients with the JPM coin. On Wednesday, Basak Toprak, JPMorgan\u2019s head of Coin Systems for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, announced that the Euro payment has gone live with the Germany-based industrial manufacturing giant Siemens AG performing the first transaction.\n\nThis is a huge step for the JPM coin, having processed over $300 billion in transactions since its inception in 2019. On a daily basis, the overall JPM businesses have recorded about $10 trillion in processed payments. The JPM coin is said to be very popular among large multinational companies that usually transfer funds between their J.P. Morgan accounts as well as other banks.\n\nWhen announcing its dollar-denominated assets, the bank explained that the JPM coin is not necessarily money.\n\nIt is a digital coin, representing United States dollars, held in designated accounts at J.P. Morgan Chase N.A. In short, a JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar. When one client sends money to another over the blockchain, JPM Coins are transferred and instantaneously redeemed for the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, reducing the typical settlement time.\n\nJP Morgan Fast-Expanding in the Blockchain Industry\n\nAs the first bank to introduce its digital token for real-world use, JPM boasts its initiative operates around the clock and also executes payment instantly compared to traditional banks. The bank had disclosed earlier that it would use blockchain to send money across borders in addition to using digital coins to settle payments among corporate clients. Last year, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) announced its decision to leverage the JPM Coin system to initiate real-time payment for Aluminium Bahrain (ALBA) to benefit its counterparties in the United States.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, Rasheed Al Maraj commented:\n\nWe at the Central Bank of Bahrain are extremely pleased to announce the success of this test which aligns with our vision and strategy to continually develop and enrich the capabilities extended to the stakeholders within our financial services sector in the Kingdom using advanced and leading emerging technologies. Through our work with ALBA, Bank ABC and Onyx by JP Morgan, we aspire to address and eliminate the inefficiencies and pain-points which exist today in the traditional cross-border payments arena.\n\nJust recently, it partnered with six Indian banks to come up with a blockchain-based platform for interbank dollar transactions. The banks include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, and IndusInd Bank.\n\nKaustubh Kulkarni, the senior country officer at JP Morgan explains that transactions take up to several hours under the current interbank settlement system in addition to its unavailability on Saturdays, and Sundays in public holidays. Interestingly, its platform enables banks to settle payments 24/7.\n\nThe Onyx blockchain-based platform was launched in 2020 and seeks to improve wholesale payment transactions.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Optimism, the Layer 2 network known for enhancing Ethereum applications through Optimistic Rollups, has significantly rebranded. The project has officially changed its name to OP Mainnet, symbolizing its ambitious goal of creating a \u201csuperchain\u201d network comprised of multiple Layer 2 blockchains. The decision to adopt the new name was announced by the Optimism Foundation, which emphasized the need to differentiate the OP Mainnet blockchain from the broader concept and values represented by \u201cOptimism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s official: the chain formerly known as Optimism is now OP Mainnet!\n\n\n\nThis distinction makes clear the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that \u201cOptimism\u201d encompasses. \u2014 Optimism (\u2728\ud83d\udd34_\ud83d\udd34\u2728) (@optimismFND) June 23, 2023\n\nAs the foundational layer of the envisioned superchain network, OP Mainnet currently boasts an impressive total value locked (TVL) surpassing $1.3 billion. By leveraging Optimistic Rollups technology, OP Mainnet introduces faster and more cost-effective transaction processing, effectively addressing the mounting scalability concerns within the Ethereum network. This transition holds immense promise for the future growth and utility of Ethereum as a blockchain platform.\n\nOperated by OP Labs, the developer behind OP Mainnet, the OP Stack serves as a comprehensive development software stack. This powerful tool empowers developers to effortlessly launch their own Layer 2 blockchains, further expanding the possibilities and applications of the Ethereum ecosystem. Notably, cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase has embraced the OP Stack to develop its own blockchain called Base, underscoring the significance and influence of OP Mainnet\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe race for Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 dominance intensifies as Optimism competes with Arbitrum\n\nThe rebranding of Optimism to OP Mainnet stems from the project\u2019s aspiration to establish a \u201cSuperchain\u201d that facilitates seamless communication and interoperability with other blockchain networks. Among the chains in consideration for integration, Coinbase\u2019s open-source Ethereum L2 Base holds a prominent position. Such integration would foster enhanced collaboration and resource-sharing among these Layer 2 solutions, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem.\n\nWhile Optimism has maintained its status as one of the top two Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions, fierce competition has emerged in the form of Arbitrum, which has been rapidly gaining traction. Arbitrum\u2019s implementation of multi-round fraud proofs has propelled its growth and operational efficiency, outpacing Optimism in terms of transaction volume and daily active addresses. Currently, Arbitrum boasts an impressive count of 161,830 daily active addresses, surpassing Optimism\u2019s figure of 88,560.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by Arbitrum, Optimism maintains an advantage in terms of development activity, with a higher count of public GitHub repositories compared to its competitor. The level of development activity serves as a measure of innovation and progress within a project; in this regard, OP registers a value of 29.29, while Arbitrum stands at 17.12. This observation suggests that Optimism continues to attract greater attention and contributions from the developer community, despite Arbitrum\u2019s technological advantages."
