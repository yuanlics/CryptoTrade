        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Maximalism: Silly And Self-Defeating - Blockworks",
        "content": "Maximalism is one of the least attractive philosophies in crypto.\n\nIt\u2019s the belief that any given blockchain is fit for all purposes, and that other blockchains are therefore inherently useless and of no value.\n\nThis is as dumb as it sounds.\n\nThe original maximalists were Bitcoiners, many of whom predate the era of smart contracts.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin maxis, the Bitcoin blockchain is capable of almost any functionality that later chains have added; or they assert, bizarrely, that any functionality not supported by the Bitcoin blockchain is not useful, and is therefore unnecessary.\n\nNever mind that Bitcoin is often slow, and somewhat expensive for everyday transactions.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty big fan of Bitcoin. It has many strengths, not least the fact that it\u2019s decentralized, secure, an excellent way to store value, and pretty much censorship-resistant. This makes it useful for all manner of things; some anticipated and desirable, some less so.\n\nI\u2019m also a major admirer of Ethereum. It is also highly decentralized, and it has a fantastic community of developers and builders who have created thousands of useful and utterly new applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s also a little expensive, scaling it has involved a lot of compromises and a confusing array of solutions, its governance is tricky, and the manner of its launch made a few people who probably deserved it very rich (as well as a couple of folks who were just lucky enough to be in the room at the time).\n\nAnd I\u2019m excited about lots of other foundational blockchains, some of which have features they don\u2019t really share with Ethereum or Bitcoin, some of which are optimized for transaction cost, or volume, or some other metric.\n\nI try to imagine what it must be like to assert, contrary to logical analysis, that MY blockchain is the ONLY blockchain.\n\nAnd I guess it must be the equivalent of having just one tool in your garage, a drill, and wanting to use that drill for every home improvement project.\n\nHanging some drywall? Drill it! Repairing the stucco? Drill it! Fixing the plumbing? Drill it!\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t necessarily have exactly the right tool for every single situation. Your car, for example, may be a compromise car.\n\nMaybe you own a Toyota Camry. It\u2019s not designed to go extremely fast around corners. It wouldn\u2019t be much good off-road. It doesn\u2019t haul half a ton of lumber.\n\nEssentially the Camry is the Ethereum of cars. It does a bit of everything, which makes it a great solution for people who need their car to do a bit of everything.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you need your blockchain to be very, very good at one thing.\n\nFor instance, you are designing for the billion or so gamers out there.\n\nGamers don\u2019t want to pay little fees every time they mint an NFT achievement like clearing a level in record time, or collect an item they might use in a sequel.\n\nSo maybe you need a blockchain that has no fees.\n\nThat takes some pretty specialist design. Ethereum can\u2019t, by its very nature, support that precise need.\n\nMaybe you need your blockchain to be more private, or more secure, or much faster, or infinitely scalable, or to support some novel quantum-resistant cryptography. There are lots of reasons you might be prepared to trade all the usefulness of Ethereum for something very, very specific to your needs.\n\nIn which case, maximalism is exposed as a fraud.\n\nSure, clever folks have figured out lots of workarounds to make Ethereum more useful. In much the same way that Toyota figured out a nicer set of features to appeal to the customer who orders the loaded Camry \u2013 a better stereo, a more powerful engine, quad exhaust tips (don\u2019t get me started).\n\nBut a very nicely-equipped Camry is still not a Mercedes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ethereum is a general use blockchain suitable for most general uses.\n\nIt is not the answer to every single real-life use case.\n\nWhich is why maximalism, in all its forms, no matter what blockchain the maximalist is maximizing, is an indication of a minimalist level of intellectual curiosity and honesty.\n\nNot to mention: We\u2019re ostensibly all in this together, right? We all want roughly the same thing: A better way of doing things, for the betterment of our experience on this planet?\n\nWe get there by collaborating, cooperating, working to find the right tool for the right job. Not by screaming at each other for daring to suggest that a general-purpose blockchain may not fit every use case.\n\nEthereum is a great innovation, it has a wonderful community and almost endless uses. Bitcoin is a remarkable and world-changing accomplishment, one that has opened countless minds to new possibilities.\n\nNeither of them is perfect. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

        "title": "Into The Next Chapter: Ethereum's Proto-Danksharding - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Following the successful Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade, Ethereum developers are moving to the next stage. The coming milestone Cancun-Deneb is part of Etherem\u2019s sharding roadmap and is focused on one of the most anticipated network issues \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s gas fee.\n\nDuring the latest bi-weekly call, all-core devs highlighted that the key focus was now EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, a feature essential to the network\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap. Proto-danksharding introduces a new transaction type to reduce user transaction costs on layer-2 rollups.\n\nA New Level of Ethereum\n\nProto-darksharding, also known as the Surge, targets a minimum of 100,000 transactions per second or more. This upgrade to EIP-4844 (Danksharding) is said to make layer-2 more efficient by reducing costs and scaling.\n\nThereby, the upgrade will boost the speed of the network higher. It is expected to take place in 2023.\n\nCancun also aims to deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to make way for statelessness. The EIP-1153 proposal, which proposes new, cost-effective ways to temporarily store data in Ethereum smart contracts, was previously excluded from Shapella but is now being considered.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), originally part of Shanghai, was also discussed but was deemed a poor match for the Cancun plan. However, it was agreed that EOF should be the focus of the next major upgrade, called Prague.\n\nDespite all the hype surrounding Shanghai, the upgrade will not necessarily affect the network\u2019s performance. Shanghai expectedly had a significant impact on those with ETH staked on Ethereum.\n\nUndoubtedly, after the aforementioned update, a first wave of withdrawals was observed. Remarkably, on the following day, there were already 44,150 withdrawals made. It is worth mentioning, though, that most of these transactions are aimed at reclaiming the accrued rewards.\n\nSubsequently, around April 20, a second wave of withdrawals occurred, resulting in over 100,000 ETH being withdrawn. These withdrawals were regarded as \u201cmajor\u201d by Nansen since they impacted the amount of ETH required to operate a validating node.\n\nLastly, between April 24 and 25, a third wave of withdrawals was identified, resulting in 240,000 ETH being withdrawn. However, during this period, approximately 80,000 ETH were also deposited.\n\nDespite the withdrawals, new ETH continued to be deposited into staking, and as a result, more than 18 million ETH are still deposited in staking on Ethereum.\n\nMore Ether Staked\n\nAccording to the latest data, unlocking staked ETH encourages more individuals to participate in Ethereum staking. Shanghai has stimulated institutional staking on Ethereum, resulting in significant inflows of ETH for institutional staking providers.\n\nThe total amount of ETH over the last month reached 224,000 ETH, deposited by staking service providers, including Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us, and Stakefishs. Institutional investors are also drawn to the attractive rewards of staking Ether while speculating on higher prices in the future.\n\nLido has shown remarkable growth since its inception. In February, the protocol recorded a deposit of 150,000 ETH in a single day. It has nearly 5.9 million ETH deposited in staking, making it the king of staking on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Lido has not yet updated its protocol to support withdrawals, and the opening of withdrawals is expected to be a significant event for Ethereum staking.\n\nExperts in the cryptocurrency industry have expressed divergent views about the upgrade\u2019s potential impact on Ether\u2019s price.\n\nBut Ethereum hasn\u2019t seen any significant price movements since Shanghai was implemented. The second largest cryptocurrency trades at approximately $1,914, almost the same level as before the upgrade.\n\nWhile some analysts anticipate that the increased supply could result in a selling frenzy, others believe it might become a psychological battle where market whales punish traders for overselling. However, it remains to be seen how the upgrade will affect the price of Ether in the coming weeks."

        "title": "More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Layer-2 blockchain protocols have been in the spotlight in 2023, bringing major performance improvements to a variety of platforms and services operating in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nZero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been key in the roll-out of a variety of layer 2s, with the technology pioneered by the decentralized scaling network Starknet. StarkWare, the technology firm behind the scaling platform, has outlined plans to further improve its layer-2 network to meet an expected increase in users and developers through the rest of the year.\n\nCointelegraph caught up with Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of StarkWare, to unpack key points set out in a 2023 roadmap for Starknet. Chief among a list of to-dos is performance improvements that are centered around higher throughput and reduced latency of Starknet\u2019s network.\n\nBen-Sasson highlighted the focus on performance upgrades that are expected to deliver significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) than on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at lower gas costs:\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for builders and developers to have high throughput so that they can really build. Starknet is about increasing the computational abilities of Ethereum and we just want to provide this raw power to the hands of developers.\u201d\n\nStarknet v0.12.0 is expected to be released in the next month and is the culmination of a six-month sprint that involves transitioning Starknet\u2019s development stack to a Rust-based Sequencer as well as an open-source project that has built a Rust-Cairo virtual machine.\n\nStarkWare open-sourced its programming language compiler Cairo early in 2023, with the language aimed at driving the development of ZK-rollup and validity-proof-powered decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nRelated: Privacy, scaling drives use cases for zero-knowledge technology\n\nBen-Sasson added that Starknet continues to chase an ambitious target of processing at least 10 times the throughput of Ethereum at a tenth of the cost. He highlighted StarkEx\u2019s ability to deliver significant TPS on the decentralized exchange dYdX. StarkEx is another layer-2 scaling engine developed by StarkWare.\n\nAt times, dYdX processes up to 54 transactions per second, while the average TPS of Ethereum is around 10\u201312. Ben-Sasson also noted that these dYdX transactions are roughly four to five times larger than those on Ethereum, which bodes well for the improved scaling capabilities of Starknet in the near future:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often experiencing practical TPS or gas usage that is orders of magnitude greater than what Ethereum can deal with. I\u2019m very confident that this will also be replicated on Starknet.\u201d\n\nPerformance improvements have been prioritized as a result of developer and user feedback highlighting delays in transaction processing on Starknet. The next port of call is the reduction of transaction costs, which will be addressed by targeting the cost of storing data on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to roll out Volition, which allows users to opt as to whether they want their data on or off-chain and this will be part of the base layer of the Starknet system.\u201d\n\nBen-Sasson said the release of off-chain data availability will complement Ethereum\u2019s in-development improvement proposal \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will introduce a new type of transaction that carries binary large objects or \u201cblobs.\u201d The EIP fundamentally aims to provide cheaper transactions.\n\nStarknet is also aiming to deliver faster finality further down the 2023 roadmap, which will produce shorter and fixed interval block times on the network. This will be carried out with the introduction of a fee market to prioritize Starknet\u2019s network resources on users\u2019 willingness to pay for transactions, inspired by conventional market systems:\n\n\u201cMarket mechanisms are a very good way to solve this. Blockchain didn\u2019t invent this \u2014 blockchains adopted this from just the conventional world. That\u2019s how you prioritize resources and allow users to signal this.\u201d\n\nA number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols have begun rolling out ZK-rollups to further improve efforts to provide faster and cheaper transactions to the smart contract blockchain network. This includes the likes of Polygon and ConsenSys.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels, similar to Bitcoin at $29,500.\n\nA high was formed near $1,939 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nA low is formed near $1,825 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,850 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) Co-founder Clashes with Cardano Founder Over His Work at Ethereum.\n\nThe founder of the LUKSO network had insinuated that Cardano founder Hoskinson did not contribute to Ethereum.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, recently had a clash of words with Fabian Vogelsteller, another Ethereum co-founder and founder of the LUKSO blockchain. Vogelsteller had recently indicated that Hoskinson made no meaningful contributions to Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, three of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders, Hoskinson, Vogelsteller, and Gavin Wood, left Ethereum and launched their respective networks. Responding to a two-year-old tweet that compared the progress of these networks, Vogelsteller noted that the comparison is only between LUKSO, the chain he founded, and Gavin Wood\u2019s Polkadot network.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn\u2019t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging\u2026 https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR \u2014 Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nHe stressed that Hoskinson cannot be regarded as an Ethereum co-founder because \u201cHe built literally nothing for Ethereum that I am aware of.\u201d According to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson was only fortunate to be at the right place at the right time \u201changing out.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo buttress his point, Vogelsteller argued that he had been involved in Ethereum long before the network was formed and is fully aware of who made valuable contributions to the launch. He mentioned that the primary work that birthed the network was done before 2014, when most of the \u201cco-founders\u201d were onboard.\n\nHoskinson Responds\n\nResponding to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson employed his usual tactic of sarcasm, expressing gratitude to Vogelsteller for his comments. \u201c[\u2026] given my profound incompetence, I\u2019d love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self-manifest,\u201d Hoskinson sarcastically remarked.\n\n\u201cI suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nIt bears mentioning that Hoskinson is regarded as one of the biggest contributors to Ethereum, helping to launch the Ethereum Foundation and the ICO in June 2014, which raised 31,000 BTC.\n\nHoskinson registered the Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO briefly before leaving to form IOHK in 2015 and Cardano in 2017. Hoskinson left due to disagreement on whether Ethereum should be for-profit or non-profit. He had argued that the project should be for-profit, while Vitalik Buterin disagreed. While there are reports that Hoskinson left willingly, others claim Buterin fired him.\n\nThe recent incident with Vogelsteller is not the first public disagreement between two Ethereum co-founders, as Hoskinson and Buterin had also thrown subtle jabs at each other in the past. Last December, as The Crypto Basic reported, Hoskinson sarcastically swiped at Buterin over his comments on Elon Musk\u2019s search for a new Twitter CEO."

        "title": "What is layer 3, and why is it key to blockchain\u2019s future - Forkast News",
        "content": "In stark contrast to the last two years, 2023 has the opportunity to lay a new foundation for the evolution of blockchain. That\u2019s because this year will be defined by the application layer of the blockchain that will open a whole host of new scaling solutions. At this layer, the Web3 community has an opportunity to focus on refining both the underlying technology that powers the blockchain and the way it approaches much-needed solutions to some of the most insidious problems that the crypto industry faces. In this way, layer 3s are set to help drive new innovation and mass adoption.\n\nWhat exactly are layer 3s?\n\nLayer 1s are characterized as the foundational blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have their own native cryptocurrency used to reward those who work to secure the network itself. L2s are protocols built on top of L1s designed to increase transaction speed and mitigate scaling difficulties of layer 1s while leveraging the security of the base chain. For example, Arbitrum is an L2 created to improve Ethereum\u2019s speed of processing transactions as well as overall flexibility and scalability, and it has given birth to a broad range of DeFi protocols. Layer 3s, on the other hand, offer even higher levels of customizability. At this layer, developers can carry out customized designs that L2s cannot easily achieve, especially for lower-cost execution and privacy-preserving functionalities.\n\nHow L3s can lower cost and improve scalability\n\nWhile L2s are currently being used for general-purpose scaling, L3s enable customized scaling and realize important functionalities \u2014 such as privacy \u2014 that L2s can\u2019t effortlessly achieve on their own. L3s increase computation speeds and scalability of single applications by not having to share ZK-circuits with other applications on a single chain.\n\nThe Ethereum multi-layer architecture was first proposed by the StarkWare team in Ethereum multi-layer architecture. The current L2 serves as a general-purpose scaling, while L3 accomplishes customized scaling. For example, an L3, which adopts customized circuits depending on the demand of a specific decentralized application, can achieve better performance. Another example is Validium as L3. This design provides higher levels of throughput at a relatively low cost for decentralized apps by avoiding pushing compressed data to the L1 and utilizing validators to secure the digital asset. L3s can be employed as low-cost and high-performance scaling solutions that allow projects to have more choices for potential solutions, depending on their particular use cases.\n\nCurrent barriers to L3 adoption\n\nLayer 3s are just now emerging, and as such there are several issues and barriers that need to be overcome to bring them to the next level. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardized infrastructure for L3s. Since L3s are built on top of L2s, they require a standard infrastructure to operate efficiently. Without this standardization, L3s may not be able to achieve their full potential, making it harder for developers to build applications on top of them.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for more development in ZK-rollup technology, which is the underlying technology for L3s. ZK-rollups have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of L3s, but more work needs to be done to optimize this technology and make it more accessible to developers.\n\nThe Web3 ecosystem is actively working on developing new and improved zero-knowledge technologies and infrastructure for layer 3s. By standardizing infrastructure and continuing to innovate in ZK technology, we can overcome these small challenges facing L3s and bring them to the forefront of blockchain scaling solutions, driving innovation and widespread adoption across every industry.\n\nWhat does the future of L3s look like?\n\nWhile L2s offer a general-purpose scaling platform today and function as the most cost-effective solution for now, the future belongs to a multi-layered network \u2014 one that can provide even more cost optimization and efficiency across the board.\n\nToday, L3s are still in their very early stages. As we know, the underlying technologies of L3s are closely tied to ZK-rollups. Therefore, exploring ZK technology will be essential to the development of L3s. That means that, as the Web3 ecosystem continues to focus on building out new and improved ZK technologies, more refined and elegant L3s will come to the fore.\n\nThese new solutions are uniquely poised to make scaling easier and more cost-effective than they have ever been, while simultaneously offering more customized functionalities than ever before. As a result, L3s will enable the whole industry to drive innovation forward \u2014 something that will help imbue blockchain with more use cases across every industry, leading to an inevitable increase in widespread adoption."

        "content": "Ethereum staking and deposit contracts soar to new ATHs.\n\nETH struggles to regain bullish momentum as whales sell pressure prevails.\n\nNow is a good time to assess Ethereum and its native coin\u2019s performance as April comes to its conclusion. ETH managed to push to a new YTD high during mid-month but investors\u2019 confidence has dwindled since.\n\nHowever, there is one aspect of the network that may rejuvenate investors\u2019 interest.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAlthough ETH\u2019s price action has been affected by shifting market dynamics, there is one area in which Ethereum has maintained a more pleasing performance.\n\nAccording to a recent Glassnode report, ETH 2.0 deposit contracts have been experiencing robust growth and recently reached a new all-time high.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 18,868,062 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/B9sqXP3t8s \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 30, 2023\n\nBut what does it mean for the network? Well, the higher deposit contracts reflect more confidence in the network.\n\nIt also reflects the growing amount of ETH staked. The total value of ETH staked stood at slightly over 19 million ETH and was at a new all-time high (ATH), at the time of writing.\n\nUnderstanding the lack of price correlation\n\nAlthough ETH staked and deposit contracts have reached new highs, ETH\u2019s price action has not necessarily reaped the benefits. This is largely because the cryptocurrency has experienced outflows since the second week of April.\n\nAs a result, its price tanked by a significant margin. ETH\u2019s $1918 press time price represented a 10.8% discount from its current 2023 high.\n\nSo why is ETH still holding back? Well, part of the reason is that whales have been trimming their balances. Addresses holding over 1000 ETH have contributed to selling pressure since the second week of April.\n\nPrecisely, the selling pressure from whales continued especially in the second half of April. As a result, bullish expectations were curtailed, and sell pressure was fueled by leveraged long liquidations. This brings us to the question of- What to expect in the first half of May.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s Ethereum market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nWe observed a slight recovery in open interest in the last five days, as well as an increase in demand for leverage.\n\nThe recovery suggests that the market condition is improving gradually, but it also indicates low demand. As noted earlier, ETH whales are still selling. This means the bulls may still not show off their strength until the whales cease selling and contribute to bullish volumes."

        "content": "Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently unveiled plans underway to introduce an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain platform called \u2018Base.\u2019\n\nThe chain is currently in its testnet phase and doesn\u2019t have a specific launch date for mainnet, but Coinbase expects this to happen in Q2 2023.\n\nWe recently launched the @BuildonBase testnet, a new L2 blockchain incubated by Coinbase that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way to build decentralized apps, or \u2018dapps\u2019. So, how are things going so far? \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/G878AkMCwP \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@coinbase) March 16, 2023\n\nAccording to Jesse Pollak, Lead for Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, Base is seen as a means of expanding into the developer space and making it easier for developers to build dApps. Additionally, the platform aims to provide easy access for users to these dApps through Coinbase products with the ultimate goal of bringing a billion users into the cryptocurrency economy as part of Coinbase\u2019s fourth phase of its master plan.\n\nThe L2 is said to be a secure and cost-effective chain that aims to provide a developer-friendly environment for creating dApps on the blockchain, as per the company\u2019s statement. Base is developed on the OP Stack, licensed by MIT, and in collaboration with Optimism, a layer-2 blockchain also focused on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nA number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have reportedly already committed to build on Base. These include:\n\nBlockDaemon\n\nChainlink\n\nEtherScan\n\nQuicknode\n\nAave\n\nAnimoca Brands\n\nDune\n\nNansen\n\nMagic Eden\n\nPyth\n\nRainbow Wallet\n\nRibbon Finance\n\nThe Graph\n\nWormHole\n\nGelato\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made an effort to go out to everyone and bring them into this open ecosystem,\u201d Pollak said.\n\n\u201cWhat will be required of us to make this successful is to continue to double down on those values of decentralization, open source and having this be for everyone and a bridge that connects our users into the crypto economy and brings them to places they can go that aren\u2019t controlled by Coinbase but can offer them valuable experiences.\u201d\n\nCoinbase also plans to integrate the L2 chain across its exchange, wallet, NFT marketplace, and developer products, with the intention of making it interoperable with other blockchains in the ecosystem beyond Ethereum, according to Pollak. In this regard, Base has already held discussions with teams working on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and other blockchains.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s goal with Base is to also provide the foundation for developers and users to enable folks coming in, Pollak said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to require us making Base as cheap as possible, as secure as possible and as decentralized as possible because that decentralization is a key aspect to enable the openness of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBase is also said to be launching an ecosystem fund in partnership with Coinbase Ventures to make mainly pre-seed investments in builders developing on Base across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "content": "Following several gains earlier this month, Ethereum flipped a four-month channel and marked a new high in a year. Failed to sustain momentum and rolled back inside the channel. What happened?\n\nEthereum has been mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s pattern for some weeks now. The correlating price actions made the second-largest crypto by market cap reach a new milestone in the past week.\n\nLooking back to what happened earlier this month, when the price surged through $1.9k to $2k in two days with a series of gains, ETH tested $2,150 as a ten-month high and fell off after it entered an oversold area.\n\nIt sits above $1,790 and traded in the channel for a week. A sudden spike occurred yesterday and the price retested the $1,950 level around the upper boundary of the channel as resistance. A second retest around that price level led to a rejection earlier today.\n\nThe bulls are trying to return but the bears are creating a strong wall around the crucial $2,000 level. If this level continues to pose a threat to buying pressure, ETH may face a serious hurdle to overcome it. That could trigger selling pressure if it finds the crucial level difficult to reclaim.\n\nIn this case, the lower boundary of the channel would be the next selling target before the price can pick up again. ETH will need to surpass the previous resistance level to claim more highs. It lost 3% over the past 24 hours.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nThe immediate $1,948 and $2,030 resistance levels are important areas of interest for the buyers in the next leg up. Reclaiming them should skyrocket the price to $2,160 and $2,304 in the future.\n\nAs ETH pinned weekly support at $1,788.4, a breakdown from there could sink the price to $1,722.9 in the coming weeks. The $1.678.9 and $1,590.5 levels are the next to watch for more decrease.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $1,948, $2,030, $2,160\n\nKey Support Levels: $1,788.4, $1,722.9, $1,678.9\n\nSpot Price: $1,894\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: Moderate\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), one of the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, thanks to numerous factors, experienced value growth in the last few weeks. The latest information shows us that ETH has managed to reach a value of around $1917, so investors are wondering if now is a good time to invest in this crypto, or if some other cryptos are a better choice than ETH.\n\nThe opinions of crypto experts on this topic vary, some are convinced of the further progress of this crypto, while others believe that ETH could experience losses in the future, so they prefer to suggest other cryptos over ETH. That\u2019s why we looked for additional help on this topic and asked ChatGPT for advice!\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, at the moment, there are 5 better investment options than Ethereum, and these are:\n\nBut before we start discussing these 5 cryptos, let\u2019s see what ChatGPT says about the future of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to tell you something about Ethereum, you will get the answer that although ETH is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, its further development can\u2019t be predicted with absolute certainty.\n\nWhat ChatGPT has to offer is a price prediction that shows possible maximum, average, and minimum values for this crypto:\n\nYEAR MINIMUM PRICE AVERAGE PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE 2023 $1,522.72 $1,913.50 $2,304.28 2024 $2,106.91 $2,522.97 $2,939.04 2025 $2,789.54 $3,703.15 $4,617.71 2026 $4,210.58 $5,410.66 $6,610.75 2027 $6,589.96 $7,647.70 $8,705.44 2028 $8,265.39 $11,403.27 $14,541.15 2029 $13,266.21 $17,630.26 $21,994.32 2030 $20,647.23 $23,611.22 $26,575.21\n\nAccording to the information that ChatGPT gave us, ETH may reach a value of over $2000 by the end of the year, but there is a possibility that its value will fall to around $1522. ChatGPT therefore, like most crypto experts, does not have a crystal clear picture of the further future of Ethereum, but says that there are some fantastic alternatives to ETH. There are several other crypto projects that require smaller investment, and at the same time, show much greater chances for great success and huge gains already this year!\n\nAiDoge (Ai)\n\nThe newly launched AiDoge (Ai) is one of the cryptos that ChatGPT recommends over ETH, considering that this crypto project managed to raise more than $200,000 in just a few days! AiDoge (Ai) presale is on fire, there are more and more early investors who want to take the opportunity to invest in Ai token for only $0.000026. Of course, the good price of Ai tokens is only one of the reasons for such great interest from investors.\n\nWhat makes AiDoge a good choice is that this revolutionary platform, using AI technology, provides the best AI-driven meme generation experience! Using AI, AiDoge makes creating memes fast, simple and unique. Your only task is to provide text prompts, and after that, AiDoge will deliver relevant and engaging memes!\n\n>>>Buy AiDoge Now<<<\n\nAfter they are created, the memes will be seen on the Public Wall, where other users can upvote or downvote them, and depending on the ranking of your meme, you can be additionally rewarded.\n\nWith the native Ai token, you will have the opportunity to purchase credits that you can later spend on generating memes, the opportunity for staking (which will bring you daily credit rewards with a bunch of other benefits), and also the chance to vote. AiDoge makes memes accessible to all, rewards top memes with Ai tokens, and gives you a chance to get a big return on your investment, judging by the excellent predictions this crypto has for the future. So listen to ChatGPT and invest in Ai token rather than ETH.\n\n>>>Buy AiDoge Now<<<\n\nDeeLance (DLANCE)\n\nDeeLance, with its DLANCE token, is a platform that provides the lowest fees for freelancers and employers, does not charge withdrawal costs, and provides complete ownership. Judging by ChatGPT, DeeLance is one of the best crypto projects at the moment!\n\nDeeLance has so far raised more than an incredible $500,000, and ChatGPT assures us that the number of DLANCE investors will continue to grow, because the number of freelancers and those looking for workers online is increasing, and therefore, huge gains are predicted for this crypto. Invest in DLANCE before the next price increase, because it shows a higher chance of progress than ETH.\n\n>>>Buy DeeLance Now<<<\n\nMetropoly (METRO)\n\nWhen it comes to investing, what ChatGPT recommends is a combination of real estate and crypto, and the Metropoly platform makes that possible. By owning its native METRO token, you will get the opportunity to invest in real estate with only $100, you will be freed from complicated bureaucratic processes, and even more importantly: you will get a chance for a great return on your investment.\n\nMETRO has much more positive predictions than ETH, so invest in it ASAP, while its price is only $0.09!\n\n>>>Buy Metropoly Now<<<\n\nEcoterra (ECOTERRA)\n\nChatGPT suggests that all eco-conscious investors should join the Ecoterra (ECOTERRA) presale and invest in the most promising green crypto at a price of only $0.007! Ecoterra gives users the chance to earn ECOTERRA tokens by recycling, but also to profit from early investment, considering that ECOTERRA could pump in price up to 30X! Certainly, ECOTERRA will give you much more than ETH!\n\n>>>Buy Ecoterra Now<<<\n\nRobotEra (TARO)\n\nThe last crypto that ChatGPT recommends over ETH is the best metaverse crypto: RobotEra (TARO). RobotEra provides much more than the simple P2E experience that we are used to because it provides the possibility for selling NFTs, mining, staking TARO coins, and many other earning options. The first presale stage is ending soon, so hurry up and buy TARO for only 0.020 USDT.\n\n>>>Buy RobotEra Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nETH is gaining in value, but according to information provided by ChatGPT, 5 other cryptos are set for bigger gains in the next period. So, listen to this \u201cAI crypto expert\u201d, and grab Ai, DLANCE, METRO, ECOTERRA, and TARO, before their prices explode!\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe NFT-backed loan market is gaining steam, with total loan value to date recently topping $1 billion across various protocols\u2014and now the current largest Ethereum NFT marketplace by trading volume is getting in on the action, too.\n\nToday, NFT marketplace Blur announced the creation of Blend, a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol based around NFT assets. Short for \u201cBlur Lending,\u201d Blend lets NFT collectors take loans out on their existing assets, and also lets liquidity providers earn interest by loaning out ETH with the NFT serving as collateral.\n\nUnlike some lending protocols, Blend does not have set timeframes for loans to be repaid. Instead, they\u2019re perpetual, which means that they continue to accrue interest until repaid, or until the lender triggers a refinancing auction. This allows another lender to take over the loan, if desired, otherwise a liquidation auction can be triggered for the NFT collateral.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFurthermore, the loans do not rely on oracles, or external, off-chain data sources. That means that a loan on Blend will not look at NFT pricing data across marketplaces, which is used by some lending protocols (like BendDAO) to determine liquidation criteria.\n\nIn a tweet thread, Blur wrote that Blend \"enables 10x higher yield opportunities than current DeFi protocols and unlocks greater liquidity for NFTs.\" Blend currently has no fees for borrowers or lenders, but BLUR token holders can vote to enable fees after 180 days.\n\nBlur teased in a tweet thread that it will launch two \u201chuge new products\u201d today built around Blend. Full details on how the protocol works are listed in the official white paper.\n\n1/ Introducing Blend: the Peer-to-Peer Perpetual Lending Protocol for NFTs. Built in collaboration with @danrobinson and @transmissions11 at @paradigm, Blend enables 10x higher yield opportunities than current DeFi protocols and unlocks greater liquidity for NFTs. Here\u2019s how \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/uOFC6i3LSq \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) May 1, 2023\n\nThe protocol was built in collaboration with Dan Robinson and the pseudonymous Transmissions11 from crypto venture capital firm, Paradigm, which led Blur\u2019s own $11 million seed funding round back in March 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur launched last fall as an upstart rival to the then-leading NFT marketplace OpenSea, with plans to offer token rewards to incentivize traders. The platform took the lead in the NFT space in terms of total trading volume this February after Blur\u2019s initial token airdrop, as high-volume traders rapidly flipped assets to earn BLUR token allotments.\n\nWhile the trading hype has fallen since February, Blur remains on top in terms of trading volume.\n\nOver the past week, Blur has commanded about 58% of NFT trading volume across marketplaces, per data from Dune, racking up about $98.5 million worth of trades. However, OpenSea still leads in terms of total trades, with about 47% share via nearly 80,000 trades.\n\nThe NFT lending market recently topped the $1 billion mark and continues to grow, with lending protocol NFTfi leading the charge with over $406 million worth of loans to date. BendDAO is second with about $308 million worth, per data from Dune."

        "content": "What is Immutable, and why is it important for blockchain gaming? Immutable is a game development platform that simplifies building Web3 games on the Ethereum blockchain. Headquartered in Sydney and co-founded in 2018 by James Ferguson, Robbie Ferguson and Alex Connolly, this leading Web3 gaming platform is focused on a mission to bring digital ownership to players by making it easy to build Web3 games for mainstream adoption. Immutable is funded and backed by prominent crypto VC funds and transformational tech investors like Bitkraft Ventures, King River Capital, AirTree, Temasek, Coinbase and more. The Immutable platform empowers gaming studios and developers with a powerful suite of products, delivering clear solutions that amplify their capabilities and transform the way they create, launch and distribute games. Its pre-built solutions designed for ease of use enable developers to launch their games faster without compromising on either security or the gaming experience, thereby solving two major blockchain gaming industry-wide issues. Additionally, builders receive Web3 guidance, live support for their communities and access to Immutable\u2019s extensive gaming ecosystem. Immutable has also been at the forefront of enabling zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solutions for Ethereum and offers multiple ZK-based scaling options, including Immutable X, a rollup based on StarkWare technology, and Immutable zkEVM, powered by Polygon. Immutable Games, its own gaming studio, is a global player in Web3 game development and pioneered the world\u2019s first blockbuster nonfungible token (NFT) trading-card game Gods Unchained. It is currently building the highly anticipated mobile role-playing game (RPG) Guild of Guardians while also partnering with third-party game developers on games such as MetalCore, Infinite Victory and Shardbound. Related: A beginner\u2019s guide on blockchain layer-2 scaling solutions\n\nHow does Immutable work, and what problem does it solve? Immutable is a complete end-to-end development platform for building and scaling Web3 games on Ethereum, with industry-leading security and frictionless developer and gaming experiences. Immutable use zero-knowledge Rollups (ZK-rollups) to achieve layer-2 scalability. ZK-rollups fuse an array of hundreds of transactions off-chain and then send them to Ethereum as a single transaction, allowing faster validation of transactions and thereby ensuring gas fees are kept to a minimum. In March 2023, Immutable announced its second scaling solution, Immutable zkEVM, for games alongside the existing Immutable X, a ZK-rollup powered by StarkWare. Set to fully launch later in 2023, this new EVM-compatible ZK-rollup will be powered by Polygon technology with full Immutable platform support to help make Web3 games faster, straightforward to develop and less risky from development to launch. The partnership between Immutable and Polygon, along with the creation of Immutable zkEVM, solves many problems for Web3 game development. Here\u2019s how: One-stop gaming solution: Immutable\u2019s platform with zkEVM tech offers Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, low cost, massive scale and Ethereum security all while providing direct integration into Immutable\u2019s full-stack gaming platform. This provides developers with a suite of solutions needed to succeed.\n\nNetwork effects: Developers can access the combined network of Immutable and Polygon to get access to gamers, tools and funding.\n\nReduced development costs: For existing games, the opportunity to migrate existing smart contracts to the Immutable zkEVM environment is provided via Immutable\u2019s smart contract templates.\n\nEnhanced gameplay mechanics: From staking and crafting to advanced functionalities, including dynamic NFTs that equip other NFTs are possible with Immutable zkEVM.\n\nSeamless interoperability: With Immutable zkEVM, game developers can create games that are seamlessly interoperable with other games or platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling broader access and economies of scale.\n\nSecure gaming environment: Immutable\u2019s quality control measures are designed to protect gaming studios and users from malicious activity, poorly designed contracts or validators, and conserve the chain\u2019s bandwidth for gaming-specific activities.\n\nWhat are the key features of Immutable? Immutable aims to provide a fast, secure and cost-effective solution for decentralized applications (DApps) while solving numerous issues around scalability and gaming. The key features and technologies of the Immutable platform include: Enterprise-grade security with massive scalability The integration of zero-knowledge proofs into the Immutable platform allows for a substantial decrease in transaction costs and an increase in the number of transactions per second (TPS) compared to traditional Ethereum platforms. At the same time, the technology guarantees the confidentiality of sensitive information while permitting the verification of statements. The largest ecosystem in Web3 gaming Immutable offers access to a growing ecosystem of over 1 million players and $2 billion in investor funding for games building on Immutable, along with over 150 well-known titles that have selected Immutable as their gaming platform. Frictionless user experiences The full suite of Immutable products and vetted smart contract templates have been created specifically to reduce onboarding complexities, generate native gameplay experiences, and empower game studios with the tools they need to provide delightful Web3 experiences to their communities. Game-centric development platform Immutable has five years of experience building and scaling some of the promising Web3 games, such as Illuvium, Gods Unchained and Guild of Guardians. Drawing from this, it has used that expertise to ensure game developers have a one-stop-shop platform containing everything they need to achieve mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat are IMX and Immutable Marketplace? Immutable uses a decentralized governance system via IMX as the native utility token on the Immutable platform. The IMX token is an ERC-20 token with a total token supply of 2 billion. Incentives among traders, creators and markets are balanced by the IMX token, ensuring rewards go to pro-network activities on Immutable. The Immutable white paper describes three core uses of IMX: fees, staking and governance. Immutable has its own marketplace as the default home for trading NFTs on the protocol. The Immutable Marketplace supports Ethereum wallets without the need to switch networks. NFTs are free to mint for users on the Immutable Marketplace, and since there is only a 2% sell-on fee, it is a low-cost avenue for launching new collections with near-zero gas fees. Apart from its own marketplace, Immutable\u2019s Orderbook and Marketplace Network facilitates partnerships with 10 leading NFT marketplaces, such as GameStop, Token Trove, OKK, etc. Thanks to the power of the orderbook, games and marketplaces building on the Immutable platform experience doubled liquidity as evidenced by the fact that half of all trades on Immutable are filled on non-origin marketplaces. In November 2022, Immutable partnered with GameStop, the leading global video game retailer, to integrate its global orderbook into the GameStop NFT marketplace. This will bring current and upcoming projects on Immutable to GameStop, including Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Ember Sword, Playco, GreenPark Sports, Illuvium and many others."

        "title": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) vs Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The directed acyclic graph (DAG) vs. blockchain debate brings new life to the cryptocurrency industry. Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has exploded in popularity. Many crypto enthusiasts don\u2019t know blockchain systems aren\u2019t the only decentralized network.\n\nWhile they have plenty of similarities, DAG-based networks like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and IOTA (MIOTA) work slightly differently from traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat is a directed acyclic graph? Are DAG networks truly better equipped to handle real-world use cases?\n\nThis article will explore the basics of DAG technology and how it stacks up against blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)?\n\nA directed acyclic graph, or DAG, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions and stores cryptocurrency. Like a Layer 1 blockchain, some DAG networks support smart contracts and host innovative dApps and DeFi products.\n\nTo the untrained eye, using a DAG isn\u2019t very different from using a traditional blockchain. However, looking under the hood, you\u2019ll find that DAG-based networks use a slightly different data structure.\n\nHow Do Directed Acyclic Graphs Work?\n\nIn a blockchain, new blocks are validated by nodes or miners and added to the network. Nodes validate new transactions by confirming their data against the recorded history of previous transactions in the last block.\n\nIf a blockchain resembles a chain of blocks, a DAG looks more like a tree with unclosed vertices and edges. Every node in a DAG-based model can have more than one parent root, meaning multiple new transactions can be validated simultaneously. Instead of referencing only the last block, DAG nodes reference previous transactions from any node in the network.\n\nIn a directed acyclic graph, interconnected nodes build off each other and reference multiple transactions. This theoretically makes them more expansive and eases network congestion.\n\nLike traditional blockchains, nodes achieve network validation by \u2018agreeing\u2019 on the network state through consensus algorithms. Generally speaking, DAG networks use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism due to its low energy consumption.\n\nWhich Crypto Projects Use DAG Technology?\n\nDespite being a relatively new DLT system, DAG-based networks are proving popular within the crypto market. Crypto projects like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom (FTM) are built using DAG technology to great effect. They are supporting thousands of users within their thriving ecosystems.\n\nOther projects include IOTA, a directed acyclic graph designed to support Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and Nano, a decentralized payment network.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Compared: DAG vs. Blockchain\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to understand how directed acyclic graphs work, most people are more interested in results. How does DAG technology fare against traditional blockchain standards?\n\nScalability\n\nDAG networks were invented to solve some of the scalability issues faced by legacy Proof-of-Work blockchains, including high transaction fees and low throughput.\n\nSpeed\n\nOn paper, a directed acyclic graph can reach consensus and process transactions faster than blockchain networks. Why? Blockchains are only able to create one new block at a time, and cannot begin producing a new block until the previous one has been completed.\n\nIn contrast, nodes in DAG-based networks can reference multiple other operators simultaneously. In Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s Gossip protocol (pictured below), nodes share information with each exponentially, meaning large amounts of data flow freely across the network quickly, helping nodes reach validation quickly.\n\nWhile this sounds great in theory, DAG-based networks like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom still can\u2019t achieve the same transaction speeds that we see in top PoS chains like Solana (SOL) or Aptos (APT).\n\nCosts\n\nCompared with legacy traditional blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche, DAG-based networks are more affordable. Transaction fees on Hadera Hashgraph cost as little as a fraction of a penny, while a similar transaction on Ethereum might set you back a few dollars.\n\nThe competition gets a bit tighter between Fantom and Avalanche, with both networks demanding only a few cents to process transactions. It\u2019s also important to mention that network demand plays an important role here. While Ethereum, Avalanche, and Fantom have all witnessed spikes in gas prices due to congestion, Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s scalability hasn\u2019t been truly tested yet.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nIf there is an area where DAGs shine, it is their sustainability. Directed acyclic graphs typically boast low energy consumption rates, making them an ideal candidate for global adoption.\n\nTo give you an idea, the Fantom network uses between 0.000024-0.000028 kWh to process a single transaction. While it has made huge strides in reducing its environmental impact by moving to a PoS consensus, it still uses 0.03 kWh to execute a transaction.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDue to slow adoption rates, decentralization is a weakness for DAG networks. For example, the Hedera Hashgraph is governed by the Hedera Council, a central committee of 39 node operators. Compared to Ethereum, which has over 500,000 validators, you can see how easy it would be to convince a majority of validators to take over the network.\n\nAdditionally, DAG networks are less secure than their blockchain counterparts. Blockchains benefit from a \u2018global state\u2019 or a universally agreed-upon condition of the network with the creation of each new block. In a DAG, this global state is altered every time a new transaction is processed.\n\nIf communication between nodes isn\u2019t fast enough to ensure every node is referencing correct information, there are increased chances of vulnerabilities or inaccuracies.\n\nDAG Technology & The Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nDespite the architectural differences behind the scenes, most users won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between using a DAG or a blockchain. This is due mainly to the simplicity and practicality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nTop DAG-based networks like Fantom and Hedera are both EVM-compatible. Their smart contracts are generally written in Solidity and compatible with EVM wallets like Metamask. Thanks to the EVM, developers can easily \u2018copy and paste\u2019 Ethereum-based applications directly onto Fantom and Hedera.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are fast and affordable networks far more scalable than legacy blockchains like Bitcoin or pre-merge Ethereum. However, they still face some decentralization and security issues that might discourage some users.\n\nMoreover, modern Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Solana and Aptos are theoretically more scalable than the leading DAG networks, meaning DAGs still have some work to do to compete with top Layer-1s.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology has been in development for much longer than DAG networks. With time and resources, DAG-based networks might still overcome their current limitations and push new boundaries in distributed ledger technology.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, it\u2019s almost impossible to tell whether you\u2019re using a directed acyclic graph or a blockchain. The average person doesn\u2019t care about the underlying infrastructure as long as the final product is functional and serves its purpose.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are a creative method of building a distributed ledger. Just because blockchain is the most common and best-understood kind of DLT network, that doesn\u2019t mean that innovative new systems can\u2019t emerge and improve the industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Is Dogetti Destined to Reach Ethereum and Polygon's Level of Success? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The new meme coin, Dogetti (DETI), has already made its mark on the crypto world, with its upcoming launch date creating a frenzy among investors. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind DETI\u2019s fast-rising popularity and compare the token with two other successful altcoins, Ethereum and Polygon. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is, will Dogetti follow in the footsteps of these altcoins and achieve the same level of success?\n\nDogetti\u2019s Announces Launch Date!\n\nDogetti (DETI) has officially secured a launch date, on the 20th of June. The good news has pushed investors to amass large amounts of DETI tokens before the token\u2019s value skyrockets.\n\nDogetti is quickly earning its place among crypto top meme coins, but why are we comparing it to altcoins like Ethereum and Polygon? Since the beginning of Dogetti\u2019s presale, the token has stood out compared to other popular meme coins. While Dogecoin still stands on top, it has no real-world utility.\n\nDogetti offers everything that a meme coin should such as community values and funny mascots. Still, they also plan to bring utility to the industry through a site swap, DogettiSwap, and an NFT. The team has successfully raised over $941,223 in presale funds, and with all the hype and FOMO leading up to the launch date, DETI\u2019s value is likely to show massive returns upon its launch!\n\nEthereum\u2019s Incredible ICO!\n\nWhat do Ethereum (ETH) and Dogetti have in common? Well aside from bestowing the industry with amazing utility, both of these assets are known for their successful presale. ETH\u2019s presale took place from July to September 2014, during which ETH was exchanged for Bitcoin. Within the first day of the sale, more than $2.2 million worth of ETH was sold!\n\nInvestors who exchanged their Bitcoin for ETH at a ratio of 2,000 ETH to 1 BTC made a profit of over $60 million, with the value of ETH rising to 1,337 ETH per BTC by the end of the sale. The ICO raised a total of $18.30 million, with ETH priced at $0.03 per token, and a total of 72 million tokens were launched.\n\nAnother Admirable Presale!\n\nPolygon\u2019s (MATIC) is another great example of a coin that had a huge presale success. The token sale was one of the first to take place at Binance Launchpad back in April 2019. The project sold 1.9 billion MATIC tokens, which was 19% of the coin\u2019s total supply. They were able to reach their target, which was $5M! During the sale, 1 MATIC was priced at roughly $0.00263, and it was denominated in BNB. Since then, Polygon has been performing incredibly well, achieving the best ROIs of all tokens introduced through Binance Launchpad! It\u2019s impressive to see the success of the project and the hard work that went into making it a success.\n\nAll in all, DETI has quickly become a popular meme coin due to its upcoming launch date and utility through DogettiSwap and NFTs. When compared to successful altcoins such as Ethereum and Polygon, Dogetti shares similarities in terms of their successful presales and potential for utility in the industry. While it is difficult to predict the future success of Dogetti with 100% accuracy, the hype and FOMO leading up to its launch suggest that it will likely follow in the footsteps of these altcoins and achieve great levels of success!\n\nInterested in joining the Dogetti Family?

        "title": "Gary Gensler Faces Backlash As Old MIT Video Surfaces - Crypto Times",
        "content": "The skeletons in SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s closet are back to haunt him. A clip dated to the fall of 2018 recorded by a student of the \u201cBlockchain and Money\u201d course whose professor was none other than our own Chairman Gensler is trending because of Gary\u2019s point of view on crypto in 2018.\n\nIn all the notes and videos of the blockchain course, Gensler can be heard saying Ethereum is \u201cNot a security\u201d at MIT as a professor, which resurfaced online again. He is seen talking with students that Ethereum is sufficiently decentralized that will not consider it as a security.\n\nAnd another one\u2026 \u2013 The below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called \"Blockchain and Money\"\n\n\n\nGary Gensler \u2013 the current President of the SEC, was the professor.\n\n\n\nOnce again, I will let the below video speak for itself.\n\n\n\nLecture 6: Smart Contracts and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/hsTvJ82XmM \u2014 zk-\ud83e\udd88 (@ZK_shark) April 28, 2023\n\nAfter this video surfaced, the cryptocurrency community was outraged, believing that the chairman had abused his power and authority by using it to suppress crypto speculation. As a result, many individuals began calling for his resignation from the chairman position and started seeing him as a butcher of crypto innovations.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Representative Warren Davidson introduced legislation to terminate Gary Gensler and restructure the SEC by citing the \u201clong series of abuses\u201d, including inappropriately providing a short comment period to crypto companies, unlawful ESG disclosure mandates on the market, and so on. Such an unlawful and anti-crypto stance has led many crypto firms to deport from outside the country.\n\nIn another event, Gary Gensler was slammed by Representative McHenry for not answering whether Ethereum, $ETH, is a commodity or a security. While two different federal agencies, CFTC and SEC, are juggling to implement securities laws on all crypto assets, bursting during Congress hearing clearly shows that they have no concrete evidence to support their arguments.\n\nFrom the beginning, the SEC has been dubious about cryptocurrencies, repeatedly calling them securities. However, their habit of regulation by enforcement has been exposed with time. Before everything falls apart, the U.S. regulatory authority and government should leave their biased opinions and people like Gary Gensler behind to embrace crypto space.\n\nFurthermore, XRP token holders may benefit from the revelations of Gensler\u2019s past in the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple after his fumble at the Congress Committee Hearing. In 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered XRP \u201csecurities\u201d.\n\nAlso Read: SEC and Ripple Both File Motions for Summary Judgment\n\nWhile there is no doubt that some level of regulation is necessary for the crypto industry, the methods employed by Gary Gensler and the SEC can be seen as nothing short of butchering the space. Their approach has caused significant harm to crypto investors and industries alike, with many feeling that their actions are overly aggressive and unnecessary. If the SEC continues down this path, it could have dire consequences for the future of crypto."

        "content": "This article lists the top 5 blockchain programming languages for smart contracts\n\nSmart contracts are the foundation of all Web3 apps, so learning how to write them is a requirement if you want to work as a Web3 developer. Briefly stated, smart contracts are computer programs installed and run on a blockchain network, providing deterministic assurances that permit multiple parties to reach an accepted tamper-proof outcome. A smart contract platform is a blockchain that provides programming and testing services for smart contracts. It serves as a framework for dApp development. On blockchain networks, smart contracts can be created using a variety of programming languages. The top five blockchain programming languages for smart contracts are listed below:\n\n1. Solidity: Solidity is the most widely used Blockchain programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a high-level language that is similar to JavaScript and is specifically designed for creating smart contracts. Solidity has a large developer community and offers many features for secure, decentralized programming.\n\n2. Vyper: Vyper is a newer blockchain programming language that was created specifically for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It is similar to Solidity but with a focus on simplicity and security. Vyper is designed to be more secure than Solidity by limiting the number of features available to developers.\n\n3. Rust: Rust is a general-purpose programming language growing in popularity for blockchain development. It is known for its security and performance features and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including Polkadot and Solana.\n\n4. C++: C++ is a popular programming language for creating blockchain applications, including smart contracts. It is known for its speed and efficiency and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including EOS and NEO.\n\n5. JavaScript: JavaScript is a widely used programming language for web development, but it can also be used to create smart contracts on some blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum. It is easy to learn and has a large developer community, making it a popular choice for blockchain developers.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
