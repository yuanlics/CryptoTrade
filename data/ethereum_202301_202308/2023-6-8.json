        "title": "Ethereum Staking: What Is It? - Built In",
        "content": "Ethereum staking refers to the process of transaction validation on the Ethereum blockchain network. This method sees users lock in, or \u201cstake,\u201d the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), to qualify for validator privileges in order to help secure the network and earn rewards.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Staking? Ethereum staking refers to participation in Ethereum\u2019s transaction validation process following its move to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. When staking, users lock in, or \u201cstake,\u201d tokens on the blockchain in order to earn validator opportunities that secure the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a major transition known as the Merge, when its consensus mechanism switched from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nTo stake Ether means becoming a validator, one of the pillars of proof-of-stake protocols. A validator is an entity who participates directly in Ethereum network consensus by authenticating transactions, creating new blocks on the chain and monitoring for malicious activity. Validators support the Ethereum protocol first-hand, and get subsequent rewards for doing so.\n\nProof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake: Requires crypto staking to operate; uses validators to create new blocks and build out network.\n\nProof-of-Work: Requires crypto mining to operate; uses winners of complex, competitive puzzles to create new blocks and build out network.\n\nStaking is quite different from more familiar concepts like investing, Arie Trouw, software engineer and co-founder at XYO Network, explained: While investing in Ethereum is as simple as buying Ether and letting it sit in a wallet as the price fluctuates, staking, on the other hand, allows a user to earn tokens with interest, participate in liquidity pools, lending, yield farming and derivatives.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Staking Work?\n\nIn short, kicking off Ethereum 2.0 staking and the validator process means a user must stake 32 ETH, then acquire validator privileges and program their staking node accordingly.\n\nIn particular, there\u2019s a few core technologies that make Ethereum staking work and are important components of the validator process: Validator keys and epochs.\n\nValidator Keys\n\nValidator keys are the key pair associated with each validator that\u2019s established, and are used to verify validators and associated blocks on the Ethereum chain. Validator keys consist of one public key and one private key, and are each represented as a separate string of random characters. The validator public key is used by the network to identify the validator and deal with reward collection, and is attached to the transaction data when ETH is deposited for the staking deposit contract. The validator private key is used to sign any on-chain actions as a validator, like block proposals and attestations.\n\nEpochs\n\nOnce keys and a node are set up, a validator must then wait to be selected to authenticate a transaction in part of the block production process. These are completed in time slots \u2014 a fixed time interval of 12 seconds during which a block is formed.\n\nAs time slots accumulate, they accrue into epochs, which are groups of 32 separate time slots that are each respectively 12 seconds. This totals 384 seconds, or 6.4 minutes, to form one epoch\n\nThe first block of an epoch is known as a checkpoint, which is followed by 31 regular blocks. This process is important to understand algorithmically, since the hash encoding the regular blocks from 2 to 32 refer to the first checkpoint block as its key base, creating a single chain that holds the epoch together.\n\nTo complete the validator process, each block within a time slot is voted for by one committee of validators, each having a minimum of 128 members. The maximum number of members is 2,048, however, anything more than that is considered redundant. These 128 (or more) members are automatically and randomly elected to the committee from the general pool of Ethereum validators, fixed for the epoch duration.\n\nFurthermore, each committee is distributed over one time slot, forming 32 committees per each epoch. While one of the committee members validates a block, the remaining members can vote for this initiative. This kind of voting is called block attestation, Eugene Zomchak, product owner at CoinLoan, a crypto marketplace and lending platform, said. If approved, the block will become part of the main chain. At the end of an epoch, validators from the common pool are shuffled to form new committees for the next epoch. In total, there are at least 4,096 members per committee across 32 committees, equaling 131,072 Ether per epoch, Zomchak estimated.\n\nThe process rinses and repeats in entirety, ranging from a few seconds to several hours depending on network congestion.\n\nFind out who's hiring.

To solo stake, you must run and maintain an internet-connected Ethereum node using your own hardware and software, in addition to depositing 32 ETH. Being a validator means having machinery and internet strong enough to keep a node online at all times, otherwise the validator\u2019s ETH will be penalized.\n\nWhile solo staking is a significant responsibility, successful solo stakers earn rewards directly from the protocol instead of through third parties. They also have full control over the keys used to collect funds from ETH deposits and staking rewards.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nStaking as a service, or \u201cSaaS\u201d in the Ethereum community, describes third-party services that run and maintain validator nodes on users\u2019 behalfs. Users will still have to deposit 32 ETH to activate a validator, but delegate node operations to SaaS providers, usually for a cut of reward earnings. Staking as a service is often best for those who want to stake Ethereum but don\u2019t have the necessary hardware or knowledge to be a validator on their own.\n\nStaking as a service requires users to share their validator keys with their SaaS provider, leaving only partial control over node operations and fund access. However, this also means having a fully-maintained validator client to earn staking rewards from.\n\nPooled Staking\n\nPooled staking, or staking pools, involves multiple users contributing ETH together to reach the required 32 ETH deposit and activate one set of validator keys. Similar to staking as a service, pooled staking delegates validator node operations to a third-party, but can be done so with a low amount of ETH. In many staking pools, users are given a liquidity token that acts as a receipt of staked amounts, which can be used as collateral on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nPooled staking is the cheapest way to begin Ethereum staking, as many pools accept any amount of ETH to stake and reap rewards. Using a staking pool also doesn\u2019t require users to generate validator keys. Due to having several participants involved under a single validator, though, rewards are split and are usually smaller in value than other staking methods.\n\nMore on Cryptocurrency List of Cryptocurrencies You Need to Know\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum\n\nFor solo staking or using staking as a service methods, the first step is holding a balance of 32 ETH. This ETH will be used for the deposit in the staking deposit contract to become a validator. Since 32 ETH is required for one validator, any more purchased will each need the same ETH amount.\n\nFor pooled staking, users must hold enough ETH to join a collective staking pool of their choice, where they\u2019ll stake only a portion of ETH and receive rewards respective to their contribution.\n\nAny of these deposits for the validator process go onto the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake chain part of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cAny extra funds [beyond 32 Ether] will not give you any profit,\u201d Zomchak said. \u201cSo it makes sense to leave them to form another validator.\u201d\n\nDepending on your way of staking, here\u2019s how to jump into it from here:\n\nFor Solo Stakers\n\n1. Begin Validator Process on Ethereum.org\n\nSolo stakers begin the validator process at Ethereum\u2019s Staking Launchpad page, which walks through the requirements to become a validator. This process starts solo stakers on the Goerli testnet, so they can test their node setup before placing it on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\n2. Prepare Ethereum Node\n\nRunning a node requires hardware devices that can operate 24/7 and have more than 900 terabytes in memory to spare. One of the simplest options for running a personal node is using preconfigured plug-and-play solutions like Dappnode or Avado.\n\nSolo stakers must also download software on their devices that enables transaction validation, known as an execution layer (EL) client and consensus layer (CL) client. These clients work to verify data and secure the network, and are what help the node run. Client options are available to choose from on the Launchpad page.\n\n3. Generate Validator Keys\n\nThrough the Launchpad page, users can choose how to generate their validator keys, whether that be building from a source or by downloading a key generator like Wagyu Key Gen. After creating and configuring the keys, deposit data attached in the keys\u2019 files will be needed for upload on the Launchpad page to continue.\n\n4. Connect Wallet and Deposit 32 ETH\n\nOn the final step of the Launchpad page, this is where users must connect a crypto wallet and send their deposit of 32 ETH to the designated staking deposit contract address. From here, users will have to wait for their deposit to be processed and validator to be activated on the Beacon Chain, which can be monitored by using their validator public key on sites like beaconcha.in or BeaconScan.\n\n5. Maintain Node and Practice Being a Validator\n\nAfter testing node setup and skills on the Goerli testnet, users who are comfortable enough can begin solo staking using the same steps on the Mainnet Launchpad page.\n\nFor Staking as a Service (SaaS)\n\n1. Find and Download or Sign Up for a SaaS Provider\n\nStaking as a service isn\u2019t natively supported on the Ethereum network, so users will have to seek out a SaaS provider based on their preferences. As a starter, some staking as a service providers include Blox Staking and Abyss Finance.\n\n2. Follow Instructions to Generate Validator Keys and Set Up a Validator\n\nMany SaaS providers will have guided instructions and a built-in system to help stakers generate their validator keys and set up as a validator. Users going this route will not have to use an outside software to get their keys or configure a node, as the provider will already have these procedures arranged within their application.\n\n3. Connect Wallet and Deposit 32 ETH\n\nSimilarly with solo staking, users will have to deposit 32 ETH to the attached staking deposit contract address in-app to secure their validator status.\n\nFor Pooled Staking\n\n1. Find and Deposit Into a Staking Pool\n\nPooled staking also calls for third-party solutions in order to stake, but there are several to choose from based on how much ETH users have available. Many staking pools will take any amount of ETH for users to join, with a few only requiring deposits as little as 0.0001 ETH. Some popular crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, even offer staking options through their platforms that use pooling.\n\n2. Earn and Use Liquidity Tokens\n\nAfter depositing, users tend to receive rewards from staked ETH in the form of liquidity tokens, as mentioned. These tokens can be converted back for ETH, traded on crypto exchanges or held in users\u2019 wallets to gain interest.\n\nWhy to Stake Ethereum\n\nMonetary Rewards\n\nThose who stake Ethereum and become validators \u201care providing a public good for the network and getting paid for it,\u201d said Habeeb Syed, a senior associate attorney at Vicente Sederberg LLP.\n\nStaking Ether is also \u201ca low-risk way to put your tokens to work,\u201d Syed added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of setting up your own validator, you can always use a centralized exchange or other platform which offer easier alternatives.\u201d\n\nThe reward for validating blocks is no longer fixed, as rewards once were under Ethereum\u2019s prior proof-of-work consensus mechanism. A block\u2019s value now depends on the number of active validators in a network and the total amount of staked funds paid into Ethereum\u2019s protocol.\n\nDecentralized application, or dApp, developers may \u201ctip\u201d validators as an incentive to speed up transaction processing and prioritize their operations in the queue by including them in the next available block. Another method, known as maximum extractable value, is a way validators gain additional revenue by reorganizing the order of transactions on standby from the common memory pool before they are included in a new block.\n\nExactly how much you can make from staking ethereum depends on multiple factors, including how much ETH is staked, the way a user stakes, the amount of validators on-network and the market value of ETH upon reward processing. Ethereum uses a specific formula to take these factors into account and delegate rewards. As of April 2023, users can expect around four percent annual percentage yield on their staked ETH, according to MilkRoad.\n\nSustainability and Accessibility\n\nSustainability and accessibility are reasons why users flock to Ethereum, according to Syed.\n\n\u201cUltimately, proof of stake does allow more people to participate in a more meaningful way on the network, and it makes usage of Ethereum more palatable without the energy waste controversy,\u201d Syed said. \u201cBut it does not in and of itself make Ethereum more accessible for users.\u201d\n\nThe biggest barriers to accessibility that remain are gas fees and transaction speeds. A common misconception of Ethereum 2.0 is that the network would be faster and cheaper. Syed said that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cPeople purchasing Ether or transacting on the network for the first time may be confused by having to pay several dollars for a simple transaction,\u201d Syed said, in a post-Merge market. While proof of stake significantly reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy usage, gas fees have generally stayed the same. Though historic, the Merge upgrade has left room for improvement, potentially to be seen with additional upgrades down the line.\n\nHow Many Validators Are on the Ethereum Network?\n\nEthereum has over 606,000 validators on its network as of June 2023. To maintain network stability, Ethereum implements a queue of eight validator activations or exits per epoch, preventing any mass validator joins or leaves.\n\nHow Long Is Ethereum Staked For?\n\nAfter staking, how long users have to wait to \u201cunlock\u201d or move out tokens depends on network conditions, varying from a few days to a few weeks. The standard bonding period of ETH stands at 14 days before it goes into the exit queue, according to Bitbuy.\n\n\u201cOnce tokens are staked, they\u2019re on hold for an extended period to provide liquidity [respective to the amount of] staked Ether,\u201d said Trouw.\n\nRisks of Staking Ethereum\n\nSlashing and Validator Penalties\n\nWhen a validator operates maliciously or makes an incorrect on-chain attestation, this will result in slashed, or lost, earnings. This \u2018\u201cslashing insurance\u201d is there to keep validators accountable, and is utilized to punish validators for inactivity or malicious actions.\n\nSome violations that cause slashing include proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot or attesting to change the history of a block. If slashed, staked ETH will gradually be taken from the validator and they will be removed from the network.\n\nThird-Party Vulnerabilities\n\nIf using a staking as a service provider or staking pool, staked ETH is held by a third party and not kept privately by the staker. This makes earnings more susceptible to system theft, hacking or government intervention if the third party violates the law.\n\nMarket Volatility\n\nStaking any cryptocurrency comes with the possible change in token value as the market shifts. This can result in quick increases in reward earnings, but also quick decreases, so it\u2019s best to consider budget and willingness for investment risk before staking."

Post-merge, the APY is hovering at around 5% for Ethereum validators.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that ETH staking APY is highest for those running their own validator nodes, while those staking Ethereum through a centralized exchange or an ETH staking pool will likely earn a bit less due to the validator fees they will pay. The exception to this is when centralized exchanges boost reward APYs higher than on-chain rates as a marketing effort to attract staking market share.\n\nLearn more about earning crypto interest with our complete guide.\n\nETH 2.0 Staking\n\nAs of 9/15/22, the Ethereum blockchain now uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Previously, the network ran using proof-of-work for many years, with the ultimate goal of getting to POS.\n\nFollowing the rollout of ETH staking (ETH 2.0), ETH could not be unstaked. Good news: This restriction has since been lifted with the recent Shanghai upgrade. But in some cases, stakers may still find delays in unstaking because each validator node must have 32 staked ETH.\n\nCrypto always finds a way. To provide access to the value locked in staked ETH, several protocols now offer \u201cliquid staking\u201d covered below.\n\nLido: stETH liquid staking token\n\nstETH liquid staking token Coinbase: cbETH liquid staking token\n\ncbETH liquid staking token Rocketpool: rETH liquid staking token\n\nThis form of ETH staking issues a liquid \u201cstaked token\u201d that can be spent, traded, or used as collateral \u2014 just like regular ETH. The collateral option is particularly attractive to many ETH holders who want to borrow against their ETH without losing their ETH staking rewards.\n\nHow To Stake Ethereum\n\nEach validator on the Ethereum blockchain is required to have 32 ETH staked in order to become a validator. Fortunately, not everyone looking to earn staking rewards has to first save up 32 ETH.\n\nValidators allow smaller ETH holders to delegate their tokens to them and thus earn a part of their Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nBelow we cover how to stake ETH using three common methods, ranging from the easiest to the most difficult:\n\nStaking via a centralized exchange : Exchanges such as Gemini provide support for ETH staking.

Lido offers a liquid staking pool, as does Coinbase. Running your own network validator: This is the most direct but also the most challenging way to stake ETH. Running your own validator node requires a 32 ETH stake and a machine that\u2019s on and connected to the internet 24/7.\n\nStaking ETH Via A Centralized Exchange [Easy] Centralized crypto exchanges offer the ability to stake your ETH tokens and earn staking rewards. These rewards vary across exchanges but are usually in the 3% \u2013 7% APY range. Additionally, most exchanges will own the keys to your wallet, which means that your funds will be entrusted to a counterparty. How To Pick A Centralized Exchange Entrusting your crypto to a corporation can be stressful and should only be done when you are sure of the integrity of the company you are working with. Big names like Coinbase are solid options with long-standing reputations in the crypto space. Besides security, the other big consideration when picking a centralized exchange to stake on is the rewards rates that are offered. While Ethereum has an official staking reward rate that applies to all stakers, some platforms provide bigger rewards in an attempt to earn market share. However, be careful of unknown platforms offering APY rates that sound too good to be true \u2014 they often are. Pros And Cons Of Staking ETH With A Centralized Exchange Pros Staking through a centralized exchange is very simple and takes just a few clicks.\n\nSometimes you can get very high APY rates when platforms run specials.\n\nCentralized exchanges provide simple, easy-to-understand tax reporting. Cons Exchanges will store your crypto in their proprietary wallets \u2013 you no longer directly control your crypto.\n\nIf the company experiences a hack or goes out of business, your crypto may be at risk.\n\nStaking through a centralized exchange is generally antithetical to the decentralized ethos.

Most crypto holders do not have that large of a balance, so innovative solutions for staking with a smaller balance have evolved. While one of these solutions is staking through a large centralized exchange, as covered above, another way is to use an Ethereum staking pool. A staking pool is simply a group of ETH holders getting together and pooling their ETH to reach the 32 token threshold necessary to stake. They then split staking rewards proportionally based on contributions. Staking pools have become a buzzing industry by themselves, with entire crypto platforms being established just to provide staking pools as a service. Not all staking pools, however, are the same. The primary difference is whether a staking pool is liquid or non-liquid: Non-liquid staking pools : Traditional, non-liquid staking pools just allow ETH holders to pool their tokens and take advantage of staking rewards. They do not issue a derivative liquid token that can be traded the way liquid staking pools do.\n\n: Traditional, non-liquid staking pools just allow ETH holders to pool their tokens and take advantage of staking rewards. They do not issue a derivative liquid token that can be traded the way liquid staking pools do. Liquid staking pools: A liquid staking pool will not only pool ETH tokens together, but it will also provide stakers with a derivative token that can be actively traded and used. This option lets stakers earn staking rewards while not losing out on liquidity in the process. Liquid staking pools Non-liquid staking pools Issue Liquid Derivative Token Yes No Potentially Taxable Event Yes No Reward Earning Potential Higher Lower Staking ETH Via a Non-Liquid ETH Staking Pool Non-liquid staking pools are a way for ETH holders to earn staking rewards without having the 32 ETH required to self-stake. Unlike liquid staking pools, non-liquid staking pools do not offer a derivative token that can be traded while your ETH is locked up. An important benefit of non-liquid staking pools compared to liquid staking pools is that non-liquid staking does not create a taxable event. In liquid staking, you get a liquid token (such as stETH) back when you stake your ETH. This token swap, however, is treated like any other token swap and is considered a taxable event by the IRS. Non-liquid staking does not issue a new token, therefore does not incur this tax. Note that the actual staking rewards earned through staking APYs are still considered taxable in both liquid staking and non-liquid staking scenarios. Staking rewards for non-liquid staking pools are usually around 4%-6% APY. While these rewards are not as high as liquid staking pools, they are still a great way to put idle ETH to use and staking pools don\u2019t require a balance threshold of 32 ETH.

Our picks for non-liquid staking pools: Everstake Chorus One Bitcoin Suisse Current APY 4.05% 3.64% 5.30% Staking ETH Via a Liquid Staking Pool Liquid staking pools generally provide the highest earning opportunity when staking your ETH. Not only do these pools benefit from the official ETH staking rewards, but the liquid tokens they issue can also be lent out or leveraged across DeFi for increased yield. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that since liquid staking providers issue a new token that represents your staked ETH, liquid staking may be a taxable event, as you are swapping one crypto token for another. This is in contrast to non-liquid staking pools, which do not provide a derivative token and thus do not provide additional return potential nor the taxable event when you swap. While the traditional ETH staking rewards are around 5%, using liquidity staking paired with lending or liquidity mining, stakers can achieve APY rewards upwards of 10%. Editor\u2019s Pick: Lido Besides Lido, some other liquid staking providers include: Token Ticker Token Market Cap Current Token APY Rocket Pool rETH $148,447,361 5.26% Stakewise sETH2 $84,916,544 5.92% Ankr aETHc $35,428,861 4.36% How to Pick a Staking Pool Several factors should be considered when picking a staking pool: Fees : Staking pools normally provide lower staking returns than directly staking ETH by running your own validator. This is because they are providing you an intermediary service in setting up the pools that allow your ETH to be staked. Each platform has different fees, and since, for many, the primary goal of ETH staking is to earn as much return as possible, it\u2019s important to compare these fees.\n\n: Staking pools normally provide lower staking returns than directly staking ETH by running your own validator.

Validators : Staking pools delegate their staked funds to validators who perform the function of securing the Ethereum blockchain. The idea behind a blockchain is that power is as decentralized as possible, so picking a staking pool that uses a wide variety of validators or one that\u2019s not as popular as the top staking pools is a good idea for anyone focused on decentralization.\n\n: Staking pools delegate their staked funds to validators who perform the function of securing the Ethereum blockchain.

Security: Liquid staking providers issue their own liquid tokens that are associated with their platforms. The integrity (and price) of this token depends in large part on the security of the underlying platform. The major staking pool platforms, such as Lido, are solid choices in this regard, though smaller platforms generally also have good security. Besides Lido, some other liquid staking providers include: Marinade Finance\n\nSocean\n\nParrot Pros Liquid staking provides the best returns on staked ETH, especially when paired with other strategies such as lending.\n\nAllows for simple staking without needing 32 ETH\n\nSome staking pools require as little as 0.01 ETH to stake. Cons Liquid staking is often a taxable event as you are swapping tokens.\n\nTakes some know-how of the DeFi ecosystem to get the biggest returns with liquid staking.\n\nSome popular staking pool providers only use a handful of validators, thus contributing to the centralization of Ethereum. How to Stake Ethereum Using a Staking Pool It\u2019s best to use staking pools through a trusted third party. The instructions below will walk you through liquid staking your Ethereum with Lido Finance. We will be using the MetaMask wallet in this example which can be downloaded here. Please note: While the price of Lido\u2019s stETH token is normally pegged 1:1 to the price of ETH, market volatility and other extraneous events may sometimes lower stETH\u2019s price when compared to ETH. This means that you may be able to buy stETH for less than ETH and get access to Lido\u2019s yield rewards without having to stake your ETH. Check the current stETH price before staking to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal. Step 1: Navigate to the Ethereum staking part of Lido\u2019s website and click \u201cStake Ethereum\u201d to get started. Step 2: On the next page, click \u201cConnect Wallet.\u201d Step 3: Select the \u201cMetaMask\u201d option. Step 4: You will then receive a prompt in your wallet that asks you to connect to the Lido website. Click \u201cNext\u201d and then \u201cConnect\u201d on the next screen. Step 5: Your wallet will now be connected to the Lido website. Step 6: Next, enter the amount of ETH that you would like to stake and click the \u201cSubmit\u201d button. Step 7: You will be asked to confirm the transaction in your wallet. Click the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button in order to initiate the transaction. Step 8: Back on the Lido website, you will see a short waiting screen while the platform confirms your transaction. Step 9: Once the transaction goes through, you will see a new balance of \u201cstETH\u201d in your wallet and in the Lido UI. This is Lido\u2019s liquid token that you have received in exchange for your staked ETH.\n\nBoost Ethereum Staking Rewards With stETH\n\nLiquid tokens can be used to earn additional rewards on top of Ethereum\u2019s staking rewards.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten your stETH tokens by following the above instructions, you can boost your ETH staking rewards by depositing your stETH to Yearn Finance\u2019s Curve stETH vault. This staking method combines the base ETH staking yield with the yield from staking stETH through Curve as well as Yearn\u2019s vault yields.\n\nAn Example\n\nFor example, if you are earning 4% ETH staking APY on Lido through your staked ETH, and then you take your earned stETH tokens and stake them through Yearn\u2019s stETH pool which provides another 4.81% APY, you will be earning a total of 8.81% APY on your ETH after the Lido and Yearn.finance staking.\n\nThese rewards are not paid out in ETH, however. When staking through Lido, you earn ETH staking rewards in Lido\u2019s stETH token. After you take your stETH tokens from Lido and stake them on Yearn.finance, (using the instructions below) your Yearn rewards will be paid out in the Curve stETH token. Both stETH and Curve stETH can be swapped back to ETH at any time using an exchange.\n\nThe below table illustrates our example\u2019s combined APY.\n\nStaking APY Earn Rewards In Staking With Lido 4% stETH tokens Staking With Yearn.finance 4.81% Curve stETH tokens Combined Return 8.81%\n\nStaking stETH Through Yearn.finance Step 1: Navigate to Yearn.finance\u2019s Curve stETH vault and connect your wallet by using the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in the top right corner. Note: You can view the current APY of the Yearn vault under the \u201cAPY\u201d section. Step 2: Under the \u201cFrom Wallet\u201d section on the right, click on the Curve stETH icon and select \u201cstETH\u201d as the currency you are depositing from your wallet. Step 3: Enter the amount of stETH that you would like to deposit and click \u201cApprove\u201d. Confirm the transaction through your wallet. Step 4: Once you have approved the transaction, the \u201cDeposit\u201d button will become available. Click \u201cDeposit\u201d to deposit your stETH and start earning Curve stETH APY. Note on fees: Yearn takes a 2% man agement fee on all vault deposits. They also take a 20% performance fee on all yield earned. The instructions above use a Yearn feature called \u201cZap\u201d which also adds a 0.3% fee to the transaction. Find out more about Yearn fees on their website. Running Your Own ETH Validator [Hard] Network validators are responsible for validating Ethereum transactions and creating Ethereum blocks. Validators are individuals who have at least 32 ETH staked and have the equipment necessary to perform their duties. Getting started as a network validator certainly takes some technical savvy. While not every validator has to have a massive computing rig at their home, and some can use off-site machines in data centers, validators must still be prepared to handle issues that arise and must understand the intricacies of the Ethereum blockchain. After staking the 32 ETH necessary to become a validator and getting set up, you can expect to earn the full non-diluted staking APY on your ETH (around 5%). What You Need to Run Your Own Network Validator First and foremost, network validators need to have a balance of 32 ETH in order to begin the process. In terms of direct necessities, a physical computer with a 24/7 connection to the internet is required. Software in the form of an execution layer client and a consensus layer client, as well as validator-specific Ethereum keys, will also be necessary. Hardware Requirements The hardware requirements to run a network validator node are not nearly as demanding as those for proof-of-work mining. Most of today\u2019s consumer-grade machines are powerful enough for the task. Please note that you will need a machine with an SSD and cannot use an HDD for validating. It is also strongly recommended that a 64-bit Linux system is used with a cable internet connection (not WiFi). Minimum System Requirements Recommended System Requirements Operating System 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Arm64 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Arm64 Processor Intel Core i5\u2013760 or AMD FX-8100 or better Intel Core i7\u20134770 or AMD FX-8310 or better RAM 4GB RAM 8GB RAM Storage 20GB available space SSD (you cannot use a hard disk drive) 100GB available space SSD (you cannot use a hard disk drive) Internet Broadband connection Broadband connection through ethernet cable Find out more about these requirements from the Ethereum.org website. Cloud Providers It\u2019s not necessary to use a personal machine in order to run a validator node. In fact, many validators opt for using a cloud service that allots them space on a remote machine which they can use to run their node. Here are some of the most popular cloud providers: Allnodes : As one of the biggest cloud hosting providers, Allnodes hosts over 33,000 nodes with an aggregate value of over $1.5 billion dollars. Getting started on Allnodes is simple and the service starts at just $5/month.\n\nBlox : Blox staking takes pride in their fully non-custodial solution which allows users to retain full control of their private validator keys. What\u2019s more is that signing up for the service and getting started is currently free.\n\nBlockdaemon : A favorite cloud provider for institutional stakers. Blockdaemon supports over 60 blockchains and counts some of the largest crypto players among its clients. Their cloud node is touted as a \u201cWhite Label Validator\u201d service and can be accessed here.\n\nPros And Cons Of Running An Ethereum Pros Get the best staking rewards available, with no middleman.\n\nParticipate directly in operating the Ethereum chain.\n\nNo reliance on third-party platforms, so your staked funds are not exposed to potential hacks or site downtime. Cons ETH cannot be unstaked until a future upgrade of the Ethereum network.\n\nRequires technical know-how.\n\nMistakes made in the process may reduce your rewards or even get you ejected from the network\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum With Your Own Network Validator Step 1: Acquire 32 ETH + the necessary hardware and software for becoming a validator. (More info) Step 2: Generate your validator keys and deposit your 32 ETH. (More info) Step 3: Practice on a testnet, complete the validator checklist and wait to get activated. (More info) The Merge And Ethereum Staking Ethereum has traditionally been a blockchain secured through the proof-of-work mechanism. On September 15th, 2022, however, the network seamlessly transitioned over to a proof-of-stake mechanism by merging the main Ethereum chain with the Beacon chain \u2014 which had itself been running through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism since 2020. The price of ETH did not experience major moves in response to The Merge, and the network experienced no downtime or disturbances. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake mechanism now allows the blockchain to run at full capacity with a much smaller environmental impact, significantly lower transaction fees, and a higher throughput of transactions per second. The Merge, however, is not the last planned Ethereum upgrade. Over the coming months and years, the network is slated to undergo a series of changes that make Ethereum a much cheaper and faster blockchain. Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has lyrically labeled the planned updates as the surge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. The Surge : This planned upgrade is the addition of sharding which will allow Ethereum to process over 100,000 transactions per second. The Surge is expected to be deployed to the Ethereum network at some point in 2023.\n\nThe Verge : This upgrade will reduce the amount of data that network validators are required to keep on their hard drives when helping to run the protocol, thereby making the validating process more efficient.\n\nThe Purge : The Purge is meant to reduce the hard drive space that storing ETH takes up, as well as not requiring nodes to store history \u2014 thereby increasing the efficiency of the network.\n\nThe Splurge : According to Vitalik, the Splurge is a catch-all term for \u201call of the other [upcoming] fun stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nEthereum staking provides holders with the opportunity to validate the Ethereum network while simultaneously earning Ethereum straking rewards (paid in ETH).\n\nIt\u2019s also important to choose wisely when deciding where to stake ETH. While the network requires a 32 ETH balance to directly stake, service providers such as staking pools and centralized exchanges allow staking with much smaller balances.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Much ETH Do You Need To Stake? Normally, it\u2019s 32 ETH. However, this only applies to validators directly staking to the Ethereum blockchain. Service providers such as staking pools and centralized exchanges act as middlemen between validators and ETH holders and allow staking with a much lower ETH stake. Can You Compound Your ETH Staking? Ethereum staking rewards automatically compound in most cases, giving you an annual percentage yield (APY) higher than the annual percentage rate (APR) for your ETH stake. Many ETH staking platforms compound ETH staking rewards every few days. Using liquid staking, ETH stakers can earn both ETH staking rewards and additional yield through activities like lending and liquidity mining. Are ETH Staking Pools Profitable? Non-liquid staking pools generally provide staking rewards close to the official Ethereum staking APY (normally around 4%) Liquid staking pools also provide these staking rewards, but they issue a liquid token that can be leveraged to earn even more. What Is ETH Staking Yield? Since validators with staked ETH are necessary to keep the Ethereum blockchain running, they are compensated by the chain for having their ETH staked. This reward is referred to as \u201cstaking yield\u201d and is currently around 5% annual percentage yield (APY). What Are The Best ETH Staking Validators? The best staking validators often have a long history of validating the Ethereum blockchain with few or no failed blocks, as well as 24/7 uptime and low commissions. What Are The Best ETH Staking Pools? Our pick for the best Ethereum staking pool is Lido.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "As one of the largest blockchain ecosystems continues to grow, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin notes that it will be necessary to adopt the \u201cthree transitions\u201d for Ethereum to be sustainable in the long term.\n\nThese transitions, as Buterin explains in his latest blog post are: layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just features of the protocol that need to improve; in some cases, the way that we interact with Ethereum needs to change pretty fundamentally, requiring deep changes from applications and wallets,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nButerin explains that it will be necessary to build cross-chain solutions of layer-2 blockchains, drawing on examples of how it is difficult now for users to have only one address with the multiple different scaling solutions that exist on top of Ethereum today.\n\n\u201cIn an L2 scaling world, users are going to exist on lots of L2s. Are you a member of ExampleDAO, which lives on Optimism? Then you have an account on Optimism! Are you holding a CDP in a stablecoin system on ZkSync? Then you have an account on ZkSync\u2026 The days of a user having only one address will be gone,\u201d he said.\n\nThis must be achieved at the same time as the further development of smart contract wallets and privacy.\n\nBlockchain solutions are beginning to look more alike\n\nThese three transitions are not completely new to the blockchain ecosystem at large, and definitely not unique to Etheruem.\n\nCross-chain solutions that can help different networks communicate with one another, for example, has been explored in depth by the Cosmos ecosystem \u2014 a network of individual layer-1 app chains.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Dougie DeLuca, an investor at Figment Capital, noted that rollup ecosystems are beginning to resemble Cosmos in a lot of ways.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s conversations right now about how blockchain design is just going to be commoditized, and they\u2019re going to look kind of similar. This is honestly the earliest sign of this that I\u2019ve seen, where the Cosmos has proliferated the idea of app chains. And rollups right now are moving more and more towards app specific rollups, which is similar to an app chain,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nCosmos layer-1 blockchains, for example, communicate with each other through an inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). A more Ethereum-native solution to resolving the interoperability between layer-2s would be Connext, a team building out chain abstraction.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSimilarly, with smart contract wallets, Etheruem is designing account abstraction solutions that will enable users to have self custody over their own wallets. In Cosmos, this is currently being explored by Authz.\n\nAlthough fundamentally different, the end goal is similar.\n\n\u201cI think it would be great for the Cosmos and rollup teams to work closely together\u2026Ethereum has been focusing on one set of problems for a long time, and Cosmos another set. If we combine our knowledge, I think we actually have a pretty great solution that we can work towards,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Triple Halving? How ETH Became Deflationary - CoinCodex",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve been around crypto for a while, you\u2019ve probably heard of the Bitcoin halving, which is a highly anticipated event that happens every four years. But did you know about the Ethereum triple halving?\n\n\u201cEthereum triple halving\u201d is a term used to describe three factors that are providing deflationary pressure to the ETH supply. The term is inspired by the Bitcoin halving, which is a mechanism implemented in the Bitcoin protocol that cuts the issuance of new BTC coins by half roughly every four years.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain the Ethereum triple halving and how it can effect the prospects of ETH as a long-term investment.\n\nBefore we continue, we should make it clear that the name \u201cEthereum triple halving\u201d is a bit deceiving\u2014we\u2019ll explain why in the next section of the article. Regardless, the name has been adopted by the crypto community, and the concept it describes is very important if you\u2019re considering investing in ETH.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum triple halving?\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that unlike the Bitcoin halving, the Ethereum triple halving is not an actual event built into the Ethereum protocol. Instead, it\u2019s a term that the Ethereum community came up with to describe how new mechanisms implemented in the Ethereum protocol are helping reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nThe concept of the Ethereum triple halving consists of three main parts:\n\nReduced ETH issuance under Proof-of-Stake consensus\n\nETH burning via the EIP-1559 upgrade\n\nEthereum staking lowers the amount of ETH that is effectively in circulation\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore how each of these factors is impacting the ETH supply and how they could help Ethereum recover from the crypto bear market.\n\nThe migration to Proof-of-Stake has led to reduced ETH issuance\n\nEthereum\u2019s migration from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake has had a very significant impact on the ETH supply. The reason for this is quite simple\u2014the Ethereum blockchain has to issue much fewer ETH to reward stakers than the amount of ETH it had to issue to reward miners.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive process that requires a significant upfront investment in mining hardware. Meanwhile, staking requires much less energy and is cheaper to get started with. Therefore, the network needs to issue a smaller amount of ETH to reward stakers adequately compared to the amount of ETH it had to issue to incentivize miners.\n\nMore specifically, the Ethereum protocol was issuing around 13,000 ETH per day to reward miners under the Proof-of-Work model. Under the new Proof-of-Stake model, the Ethereum protocol only has to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to reward stakers. This is a reduction of about 87.7%.\n\nAccording to ETH supply tracker ultrasound.money, the Ethereum supply has decreased by 281,627 ETH from September 15, 2022 to June 9, 2023. According to the aggregator\u2019s estimates, the supply would have instead increased by 2.8 million ETH in the same time period if Ethereum still used Proof-of-Work.\n\nIn the following chart, you can see how the supply of ETH has changed since the transition to Proof-of-Stake (September 15, 2022). For comparison, the chart also includes the change in Bitcoin\u2019s supply and the change in ETH supply if it still used Proof-of-Work (simulated).\n\nAs we can see, ETH has been slightly deflationary since the transition over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. If this trend continues, it favors long-term ETH holders since ETH will become increasingly scarce, providing positive pressure to the coin\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no guarantee that the ETH supply will continue to be deflationary forever, as we\u2019ll explain in the following section.\n\nEIP-1559 and transaction fee burning\n\nSo, we learned that the ETH issuance rate has dropped to about 1,600 ETH per day since the Merge. But if 1,600 new ETH is being created every day, how has the supply of ETH decreased?\n\nThe answer lies in the EIP-1559 upgrade, which was activated through the London hard fork in August 2021. The upgrade reworked Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee structure with a mechanism in which the base ETH gas fee paid for transactions is burned. It also gave Ethereum users the option to add a \u201ctip\u201d for validators to have their transaction prioritized.\n\nComparing the Ethereum transaction fee mechanisms before and after EIP-1559. Image source: ConsenSys\n\nEIP-1559 is the reason why the ETH supply has decreased despite new ETH coins being created every day to reward validators. The amount of ETH that\u2019s being burned of course depends on how much ETH users are paying for transactions on the Ethereum network. So, when demand for transactions on Ethereum grows, more ETH is burned.\n\nSo far, the amount of ETH burned through EIP-1559 has outpaced the amount of ETH that\u2019s being issued, resulting in a slight reduction in the ETH supply. If demand for transactions for Ethereum drops in the future, however, we could see ETH becoming inflationary again.\n\nETH staking\n\nETH staking is the third factor included in the Ethereum triple halving concept. Following the move to Proof-of-Stake, ETH holders can stake their coins to help secure the Ethereum network and earn staking rewards in exchange.\n\nEssentially, staking Ethereum provides another incentive to passively hold ETH and lock it up in staking, which temporarily removes it from circulation (staked coins cannot be sold without being unstaked first).\n\nThis part of the Ethereum triple halving has become a bit less relevant recently. This is because the Shapella upgrade, which was enabled on April 12, 2023, introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH coins. Between the introduction of Ethereum staking in December 2020 and the Shanghai upgrade, staked ETH could not be withdrawn, so they were truly removed from circulation.\n\nStill, the ability to withdraw ETH hasn't actually translated to a flood of ETH withdrawals \u2014 it appears that most ETH stakers are happy to stake their coins and passively earn yield on their holdings.\n\nIn fact, we can see a sharp uptick in the amount of staked ETH after the Shanghai upgrade went live on April 12, 2023. This means that overall, the upgrade increased confidence in Ethereum's staking system and made a larger number of investors willing to stake their coins. At the time of writing, there's a total of 22.7 million staked ETH.\n\nTotal amount of staked ETH (emphasis added). Image source: Dune Analytics / @hildobby\n\nNow that ETH holders have the option of withdrawing their staked coins, staked ETH can no longer be counted as removed from circulation. Still, the ability to stake ETH is an incentive against selling, so one could still argue that ETH staking is a positive influence on ETH as a long-term investment.\n\nWhen is the Ethereum triple halving happening?\n\nUnlike the Bitcoin halving, the Ethereum triple halving is not an actual event, so it doesn\u2019t have a date. All the mechanisms described by the term Ethereum triple halving have already been implemented, so we can say that the Ethereum triple halving has already happened and will continue to be in effect so long as the Ethereum protocol is changed in a relevant way.\n\nThe ETH triple halving has already turned the ETH supply deflationary, although there\u2019s no guarantee that it will remain this way. Due to the burn mechanics introduced in EIP-1559, the fluctuations in the ETH supply are determined by the demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. If ETH continues to be deflationary, the Ethereum triple halving could positively impact the long-term Ethereum price prediction.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 The Ethereum triple halving has made ETH a better long-term investment\n\nThe Ethereum triple halving\u2019s impact on the ETH supply has made ETH a more attractive asset to hold over the long term, as it significantly reduced the amount of new ETH coins that are entering circulation. In fact, ETH has even turned slightly deflationary after the last part of the Ethereum triple halving, the transition to Proof-of-Stake, was implemented in September 2022.\n\nOf course, the Ethereum triple halving is only one of the factors to consider when evaluating Ethereum as an investment. It\u2019s also important to keep up with developments on the Ethereum scalability front, which will ultimately determine whether Ethereum will be able to gain truly widespread adoption."

        "title": "'Ethereum Fails' Without These 3 Changes, Says Vitalik Buterin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "If Ethereum is to expand how it's used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or \u201cL2,\u201d scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposals bump into what has been called the \"blockchain trilemma.\" A blockchain's most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called \u201crollups\u201d as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n\"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum\u2019s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won\u2019t scale,\" CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. \"Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world\u2019s compute demand, and until the world\u2019s compute is fully supported, we can\u2019t fully realize Ethereum\u2019s vision.\"\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups \"fails,\" adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The solution isn't simply 'move users off of mainnet.' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network,\" Floersch said. \"This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains.\"\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was \u201cright\u201d in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is \u201cover the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum\u2019s success,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some \"technical issues\" to work through but is \"not a large burden\" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nBinance to Delist Monero, Zcash in 4 European Countries\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWithout [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users,\" said Buterin.\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using \"stealth address\" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are due volatility \u2014 but not thanks to \u201ctoothless\u201d United States regulators, new analysis says.\n\nIn its latest market update on June 9, trading firm QCP Capital told market participants to gear up for macro-fueled price action for BTC and ETH.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price stuck?\n\nQCP Capital: U.S. crypto \u201cmudslinging\u201d to continue\n\nThe dust is continuing to settle on this week\u2019s main macro stories \u2014 lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMore upheaval will come in the future, QCP believes, as the macro environment from next week onward becomes much more unpredictable.\n\nThe SEC and Chair Gary Gensler, however, even if they continue to go after crypto, will not spark the mass price depreciation that some fear.\n\n\u201cOnce again trigger-happy Gensler and his SEC cronies wielded their \u2018securities\u2019 threat on their favourite whipping industry. However as we have maintained before, BTC/ETH will continue to treat the SEC as a toothless adversary \u2014 especially as it becomes crystal clear that the term \u2018security\u2019 will not apply to either,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cAs more and more such far-fetched SEC complaints are filed, it becomes increasingly clear all they are seeking are sensational headlines leading to a final fat settlement. After all, Gensler has proven the most capitalist of all previous regulators.\u201d\n\nWhat could put the cat among the pigeons, QCP warns, is the U.S. Department of Justice or other arms of the establishment.\n\n\u201cAnd if one of them gets involved, then the case becomes more serious and all bets are off,\u201d it continued.\n\n\u201cNonetheless we expect more mudslinging from the Biden administration to continue on crypto, and even ramp up into election season next year.\u201d\n\nThe days following the exchange lawsuits have so far seen crypto market sentiment withstand the pressure, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index staying rooted at 50/100 \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d territory.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot).

The company is regulated as a digital assets and general insurer in Bermuda and previously ran a pilot with AON. Today it announced it has gone live.\n\nIt follows raising a funding round in April valuing the startup at $80 million.\n\nNayms provides a marketplace for insurance contracts and raises money from the capital markets, or rather the crypto markets. Hence, it provides an additional place where insurers or brokers can tap capacity to underwrite risks.\n\nEach insurer creates a cell or segregated account with its own token.\n\nAt launch, it has a single $500,000 cell. And unsurprisingly, the insurance on offer is related to blockchain, including excess cyber liability and smart contract risks. The returns are attractive, ranging from 10% to 20%, but underwriting insurance is certainly not risk-free."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 54% over the first six months of the year. However, the price of ETH has stagnated in recent weeks, leading many traders to wonder whether it\u2019s too late to buy Ethereum.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s price potential for the remainder of 2023 and highlight two emerging coins that traders are buzzing about this week.\n\nEthereum started off 2023 hot, gaining more than 30% in the first two weeks of the year. While the speed of its ascent slowed down, the token has been extremely successful over the past several months.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks in part to a major catalyst for Ethereum: the blockchain\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake in September and its successful Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked staked ETH, in April.\n\nThese two upgrades not only demonstrated the ability of Ethereum to make huge, impactful changes to its network. They also had practical impacts for investors, turning Ethereum into a yield-generating blockchain with liquid staking potential.\n\nEthereum hit a 2023 high of $2,140 immediately after the Shanghai upgrade, but the price response to this massive news was surprisingly muted. Many traders speculated that the upgrade was already priced in\u2014and the typical crypto response to \u2018sell the news\u2019 likely played a role.\n\nSince April, the ETH price has been stagnant. For the most part, the token has traded sideways between $1,750 and $1,950.\n\nThe good news for Ethereum investors is that this sideways price action likely represents consolidation after the token\u2019s run-up in the first half of the year. Trading volume remains high and Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are solid following its staking implementation.\n\nThe real test for Ethereum will be whether it can break above resistance at $2,020 later this month or in July. ETH briefly broke this level in April, but failed to maintain a breakout.\n\nIt could take several more retests of the $2,020 resistance before ETH successfully breaks out. However, it appears inevitable from both technical and fundamental perspectives.\n\nWhen the breakout happens, Ethereum could rise quickly to $2,650\u2014the token\u2019s next area of technical resistance. That represents a 43% gain from today\u2019s price.\n\nCrypto Market Resilient in Face of SEC Lawsuits\n\nEthereum is arguably one of the strongest coins in the crypto market right now thanks to its successful upgrades and its centrality to the crypto ecosystem. In contrast, Bitcoin has been trending sideways and down, with some analysts predicting a breakdown to the $20,000 price level.\n\nStill, crypto bulls have reason to be excited right now. In the face of major lawsuits by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, the crypto market hardly blinked. Bitcoin dropped 5%, then regained that amount and more within 48 hours.\n\nThis resilience suggests that crypto investors aren\u2019t plagued by the same fear that haunted the market in 2022. Traders and investors are far more bullish and are willing to be aggressive in looking for the next big opportunity.\n\nFor many traders, the biggest opportunities aren\u2019t in crypto majors like ETH or BTC. Instead, they think potentially huge profits can be found in emerging tokens like Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and yPredict ($YPRED).\n\nWall Street Memes Raises $5.5 Million to Mock Wall Street, Best Meme Coin for 2023\n\nWall Street Memes is a new meme coin that\u2019s generated a lot of excitement among traders and investors. Just two weeks after launching its presale, the project has already raised $5.5 million.\n\nWall Street Memes taps into an anti-Wall Street ethos that\u2019s always been prominent within the crypto community, and is especially strong in the wake of the SEC\u2019s campaign against the crypto industry. The project has many supporters from the r/WallStreetBets community, which has a combined 400,000 social media followers.\n\nThe team behind Wall Street Memes also has experience making a mockery of Wall Street. The same developers were behind the Wall Street Bulls NFT collection, which sold out in just over 30 minutes when it launched in 2021.\n\nThe Wall Street Memes presale is making 50% of the total $WSM supply available to the public. Anyone can join and the project is fully community-driven\u2014the developers haven\u2019t set aside any $WSM for themselves.\n\nDuring the current presale stage, investors can buy $WSM for $0.028, a 25% discount to the list price. Early investors can also join the Wall Street Memes airdrop, which is giving away $10,000 worth of $WSM to each of five lucky investors.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nTop AI Coin yPredict Raises $2.2 Million for AI-powered Predictive Models\n\nyPredict is another emerging project that has crypto traders buzzing. It\u2019s raised more than $2,2 million for its $YPRED token and has more than 20,000 on its waitlist ahead of its launch.\n\nyPredict is leveraging AI to build predictive models that can forecast the price of any crypto asset. With yPredict models, for example, traders can quickly see whether Ethereum will go up or down and by how much.\n\nThe project is releasing its AI price modeling tools to the community, enabling quants and developers to build their own custom models. Then traders and analysts can subscribe to their favorite models in the yPredict marketplace.\n\nThis approach is good for everyone. Quants and developers can earn passive income by selling subscriptions to their models. Traders and analysts can combine multiple models and take different approaches to analyzing cryptos. All transactions in the marketplace will require yPredict\u2019s native token, $YPRED.\n\nIn addition, yPredict\u2019s treasury gets a cut of each new subscription. Users who stake $YPRED token receive a 10% share of every new subscription on the platform.\n\n$YPRED is on sale now for $0.09, a 25% discount to the $0.12 list price. Traders and investors have to hurry since the next price increase is only a few days away.\n\nVisit yPredict Presale"

Specifically, Buterin has introduced what he refers to as \u201cThe Three Transitions\u201d in his recent post. Moreover, he spoke of their importance for blockchain\u2019s continued development.\n\nButerin spoke on the future of the blockchain, and how Ethereum could expand its utilization. However, for that to take place, he has highlighted Layer-2 (LS) scaling, wallet security, and privacy, as important transitions for the network.\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nButerin Brings Forth Three Transitions for Ethereum\n\nWithin the digital asset industry, there are few names as revered as Ethereum. A blockchain network that has become one of the most popular in the world has clearly established itself as an important piece of the industry\u2019s future. However, its co-founder has recently expressed what could stand in the way of that future.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum will fail without three vital changes. Specifically referred to as the \u201cThree Transitions, the post discusses the necessity for the growth of the platform. Moreover, Buterin says they are utterly important \u201cas Ethereum transitions from a young experimental technology, into a mature tech stack,\u201d seeking to grow.\n\nSource: CryptoPotato\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin first mentions L2 scaling. Buterin writes that \u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75,\u201d with it only increasing in the event of a bull run. Moreover, he notes, \u201cEvery product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Buterin references wallet security. Specifically, stating that \u201cEthereum fails because users are uncomfortable storing their funds,\u201d and will too often utilize centralized exchanges.\n\nFinally, Buterin discussed the privacy transition, discussing the necessity for its development. Buterin remarks that public availability for transitions \u201cis far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese three transitions are crucial,\u201d Buterin conclusively states. Adding that, although they are challenging, the network requires \u201cdeep changes from applications and wallets.\u201d Ultimately, calling for the transitions mentioned to \u201cradically reshape the relationship between users and addresses.\u201d"

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating on a blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone with a Bitcoin wallet address can send tokens to another address or receive tokens from another address. Bitcoin was conceptualized and created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person whose real identity remains unknown. The first block for Bitcoin was created in January 2009, and the first reported real-world financial transaction using Bitcoin took place in May 2010 when a Florida man paid 10,000 BTC for two boxes of pizzas. As of its first reported transaction, one Bitcoin was worth roughly a fourth of a cent. A few years after, millions of people began adopting the token, and demand shot up, driving the price of a single Bitcoin to an all-time high of over $67,000 in 2021. However, the 2022 crypto market crash has seen the price of Bitcoin slump to just over $16,000.\n\nPros And Cons Of Investing In Ethereum\n\nPros Supports global transactions with fast speeds\n\nSupports global transactions with fast speeds Zero network downtime over the past few years\n\nZero network downtime over the past few years Decentralized digital currency Cons Highly volatile\n\nHighly volatile Transaction fees can be high depending on network demand\n\nTransaction fees can be high depending on network demand No maximum supply, so there\u2019s a high risk of inflation\n\nETH Vs.

Differences ETH uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while BTC uses proof-of-work.\n\nBTC has a maximum supply, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nBTC relies on mining, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain processes transactions significantly faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Price\n\nBTC has historically had a much higher market capitalization than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies peaked in 2021, a bubbly year for digital assets, but in 2022 have plunged from their all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Fees\n\nEvery Bitcoin transaction includes a gas fee paid to the miners on the network validating the transaction. Likewise, every Ethereum transaction includes gas fees paid to the network\u2019s validators. These fees are separate from what exchanges and brokerages charge to facilitate transactions.\n\nETH BTC Gas Fee: The minimum number of tokens necessary to execute a transaction, and it varies based on network demand. You can offer additional tips so that validators will prioritize your transaction. Gas Fee: The amount paid to the blockchain to execute a transaction. It varies based on network demand.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Privacy\n\nUsing a decentralized exchange, you can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum without giving up your identity. In contrast, centralized exchanges have know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, so users must provide some form of identity. Yet, even when you use a decentralized exchange, both Ethereum and Bitcoin aren\u2019t fully anonymous, as someone may be able to tie your wallet address to your real-world identity via a platform you transact with.\n\nWhat Is Proof Of Work (POW) Vs. Proof-Of-Stake (POS)? Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the most popular mechanisms for validating transactions on a blockchain, but they work differently. Proof of Work Proof of Stake Relies on miners whose capacity depends on computational power Relies on stakers whose validating capacity depends on the amount of tokens they stake Miners receive block rewards Stakers receive transaction fees as rewards Requires expensive mining equipment and high energy usage Doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment or high energy usage The proof-of-work mechanism uses a competitive validation method (solving complex mathematical puzzles) to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, while proof of stake uses validators selected at random to confirm transactions and add new blocks. Bitcoin operates on the proof-of-work mechanism, while Ethereum operates on the proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nBTC Vs. ETH Use Cases\n\nYou can use BTC and ETH for different types of transactions or as a store of value.\n\nTop BTC Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.\n\n: You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets. Online Payment : Many online merchants now accept BTC for payment.\n\n: Many online merchants now accept BTC for payment. Trading : You can swap BTC for other types of cryptocurrencies on an exchange.\n\n: You can swap BTC for other types of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Dapps: You can use BTC to transact on various decentralized apps, e.g., games and gambling apps.\n\nTop ETH Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose.\n\n: You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose. Staking : You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network.\n\n: You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network. NFTs : You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms.\n\n: You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms. Lending: You can lend your ETH to other users and earn interest via a lending protocol.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Long-Term: Which Is A Better Investment?\n\nETH and BTC can be good long-term investments that\u2019ll yield profits. Yet, be sure to perform your own due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. This article isn\u2019t investment advice.\n\nA Case For Investing In ETH\n\nETH is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies globally. Anyone getting into the crypto markets as a newbie has likely heard of ETH, so may be compelled to buy it. The Ethereum network offers very fast transaction processing speeds compared to many other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s volatile but not as volatile as most altcoins. The token\u2019s recent shift from the proof-of-work mechanism to proof of stake has attracted more users and increased its demand.\n\nAs of late 2022, the crypto market is experiencing a widespread rout that has the value of many tokens to plunge, including ETH. If you believe the market is headed for recovery, it\u2019ll be a smart decision to invest in ETH.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nThe token is vulnerable to massive price swings.\n\nTransaction fees can be very high when there\u2019s significant demand on the network.\n\nMany smart contract platforms are emerging to compete with Ethereum, so its appeal might fade.\n\nCrypto wallets and exchanges where you hold ETH are vulnerable to hacking attacks.\n\nA Case For Investing In BTC\n\nBTC is the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. The demand for BTC is enormous across the globe, so there\u2019s always the chance of it increasing in value. Lately, institutional investors have set their sights on the cryptocurrency markets, and BTC is the asset most of them buy. BTC is already huge, yet there\u2019s significant potential for growth in its demand, meaning it could be a good long-term investment.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nBTC is significantly volatile.\n\nBTC is vulnerable to a 51% attack \u2014 a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it.\n\n\u2014 a group of miners controlling more than of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it. There\u2019s no central authority to retrieve your BTC if you fall victim to hacking.\n\nGovernments may decide to ban or restrict the use of Bitcoin if it\u2019s affecting their national currencies.\n\nRemember that investing comes with risks. Hence, it\u2019s wise to only invest money that you can forfeit without losing much sleep. Always do your own research before investing, and remember that this article doesn\u2019t constitute investment advice.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Exchanges To Buy ETH\n\nCoinbase: Best For Ease Of Use\n\nBest For Ease Of Use Binance: Best For Low Fees\n\nBest For Low Fees Uniswap: Best For DeFi Users\n\n1.

The wink and nod in this scam is the explicit promise of no return.

        "content": "Grill.chat, a chat app based on the Subsocial network, has now implemented Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallet compatibility, allowing users to chat using their Ethereum identities and send crypto to each other via Polygon, according to a June 7 announcement.\n\nSubsocial is a Polkadot parachain designed for social media applications.\n\nGrill.chat allows users to participate in over 70 chat rooms focused on mostly crypto-related topics. The development team seeks to attract new Web3 projects to build their communities on the platform.\n\nPolkadot Decoded chat room on Grill.chat. Source: Grill.chat\n\nThe integration means that users can now connect their Subsocial wallets to their EVM wallets by signing a transaction verifying that they are the wallet\u2019s owner. This prevents them from needing to own SUB tokens to donate to other users, and it allows them to prove their Ethereum identities to users in chat rooms. In the future, the developers plan to use this integration to allow nonfungible token (NFT) collections to be shown to other users.\n\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, Subsocial content lead Zachary Edwards stated that Grill.chat is targeting crypto projects as potential sponsors of chat rooms. Currently, many crypto communities are built around Discord servers and Telegram channels. These channels cannot be integrated into the developer\u2019s website, which means that users need to load a separate program to join the community or interact with it, creating what Edwards sees as unneeded friction for users.\n\nBy contrast, chat groups on Grill.chat can be integrated into a development team\u2019s website or application interface. Edwards pointed to the example of Zeitgeist, a blockchain-based predictions market app. Its interface features a \u201cchat\u201d icon that opens directly into a Zeitgeist chat room on Grill.chat.\n\nZeitgeist user interface with Grill.chat window open. Source: Zeitgeist\n\nHowever, the app\u2019s users previously encountered friction from another source, Edwards said. Many of the biggest crypto projects are on EVM-based networks such as Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche. Crypto users are accustomed to using wallets from these networks and don\u2019t necessarily want to download a new wallet to use a chat app.\n\nRelated: Decentralized social media: The next big thing in crypto?\n\nTo partially solve this problem, the team implemented a feature that lets users create a Subsocial wallet directly from the app\u2019s interface. They also paid for users\u2019 gas fees via a system that can delegate signing privileges for a limited number of functions.\n\nBut this still didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, as it siloed the user\u2019s Ethereum identity from their Grill.chat posts. The team implemented EVM compatibility to make it easier for Ethereum users to switch to the app, Edwards explained.\n\n\u201cThe cool thing is it's sort of using this off-chain signer technology because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s all running on Substrate [Polkadot parachain technology], and EVM wallets aren\u2019t compatible with Substrate,\u201d Edwards stated. \u201cBut we can still connect those two accounts together so you can chat on the substrate chain, but your EVM account is linked, so you can have identity, donations, NFTs, all of this sort of stuff.\u201d\n\nGrill.chat isn\u2019t the only social media app trying to entice crypto projects into building communities on it. OpenChat is a chat app on the Internet Computer network. Its team told Cointelegraph it\u2019s working on a similar feature to show OpenChat chat rooms on a project\u2019s website.\n\nWeb3 companies are racing to create a blockchain-based social media app that will see mass adoption. On April 26, the Polygon-based Lens network announced a new scaling solution that it said would allow for \u201cinstant posts.\u201d The same day, MeWe said it would move its 20 million users to the Polkadot parachain network Frequency."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Liquid staking is an efficient and flexible way to stake your crypto\n\nThere are many platforms that provide liquid staking, all with different yields, fees, and supported tokens\n\nIt\u2019s important to do your research before picking a liquid staking platform\n\nIn this article, we cover the top liquid staking platforms. Liquid staking has become all the rage in the last few years as more blockchains move to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms.\n\nSince liquid staking tokens are platform-specific, it\u2019s important to pick the correct platform so that your staked crypto is not at risk and you\u2019re maximizing your rewards.\n\nTop Liquid Staking Platforms\n\nPlatform Supported Chains APYs Supported Tokens Liquid Staking Tokens Fees Lido Ethereum\n\nPolygon\n\nSolana 4.4%\n\n6.3%\n\n6.7% ETH\n\nMATIC\n\nSOL stETH\n\nstMATIC\n\nstSOL 10% Stader Labs Ethereum\n\nPolygon\n\nBinance\n\nHedara\n\nFantom\n\nNear\n\nTerra 2.0 5.7%\n\n4.74%\n\n3.52%\n\n7.65%\n\n4.7%\n\n8.75%\n\n15.84% ETH\n\nMATIC\n\nBNB\n\nHBAR\n\nFTM\n\nNEAR\n\nLUNA ETHx\n\nMATICx\n\nBNBx\n\nHBARx\n\nFTMx\n\nNEARx\n\nLUNAx 10% Rocket Pool Ethereum 3.93% ETH rETH 5% \u2013 20% ANKR Ethereum\n\nPolygon\n\nBinance\n\nFantom\n\nAvalanche\n\nPolkadot 3.55%\n\n3.73%\n\n2.55%\n\n1.98%\n\n7.26%\n\n13.44% ETH\n\nMATIC\n\nBNB\n\nFTM\n\nAVAX\n\nDOT ankrETH\n\nankrMATIC\n\nankrBNB\n\nankrFTM\n\nankrAVAX\n\naDTOb 2% \u2013 10% Marinade Finance Solana 6.79% SOL mSOL 6% Coinbase Prime Ethereum N/A ETH lsETH 15%\n\nLido Best for Beginners Open an Account On Lido\u2019s site Review 4.8 Tokens Available SOL, ETH, MATIC SOL, ETH, MATIC Rewards 4.4% \u2013 6.7% APY 4.4% \u2013 6.7% APY Liquid Staking Yes. stETH, stMATIC, stSOL Yes. stETH, stMATIC, stSOL Supported Blockchains Ethereum, Polygon, Solana Ethereum, Polygon, Solana Fees 10% 10% Min. Staking Amount None None Lock In Period One year One year Payout Frequency Daily Daily Overview Lido is by far the most popular staking platform. The platform is responsible for over $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana liquid staking tokens. Pros & Cons Pros Staking returns that are very close to what you would get running your own node\n\nTokens such as stETH and stSOL are well-adopted and can be used as collateral for lending or in other DeFi applications Cons A large portion of all the staked ETH comes from Lido stETH, which makes validators very concentrated and contrary to the decentralized vision of Ethereum\n\nYou can sometimes get larger APYs using other staking services Features Largest liquid staking platform\n\nThree supported chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana\n\nLido charges a 10% flat fee on all staked tokens Why We Like It Since liquid staking tokens are specific to the platforms that generate them (for example, staked ETH through Lido is stETH, while staked ETH through Rocket Pool is rETH), it\u2019s important to pick a platform with a strong future. Lido has been around for a while and is well-positioned to succeed in the future, so we like it because it seems like a good bet when it comes to liquid staking.\n\nStader Best For Multi-Asset Staking Open an Account On Stader\u2019s site Review 4.3 Tokens Available ETH, MATIC, HBAR, BNB, NEAR, FTM, LUNA ETH, MATIC, HBAR, BNB, NEAR, FTM, LUNA Rewards 3.5% to 15+% 3.5% to 15+% Liquid Staking Yes Yes Supported Blockchains Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Fantom, Terra, & More Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Fantom, Terra, & More Fees 10% 10% Min.

Stader Labs introduces the ability to stake MATIC on the Polygon network, opening a yield opportunity for smaller positions.\n\nDeFi integrations: Put your staked assets to work in other DeFi protocols to boost your yield. Options vary by chain and include liquidy pools, lending platforms, and yield optimizers.\n\nNewbie-friendly UI: If you know the basics of working with a DeFi wallet like MetaMask, Stader makes it a breeze to stake assets like MATIC and ETH with a liquid token. Why We Like It DeFi can be intimidating if you\u2019re new to the space, but Stader\u2019s user interface and flow for basic liquid staking help both newcomers and seasoned pros put their crypto to work in a jiffy. Smart contract audits from Halborn and Certik help ensure the code is solid, reducing the risk of exploits.\n\nRocket Pool Best for Communities Open an Account On Rocket Pool\u2019s site Review 4.6 Tokens Available ETH ETH Rewards 3.93% 3.93% Liquid Staking Yes. rETH Yes. rETH Supported Blockchains Ethereum Ethereum Fees 5% \u2013 20% 5% \u2013 20% Availability Worldwide Worldwide Overview Rocket Pool is a large liquid staking protocol that\u2019s best known for its community-forward approach. The protocol is entirely community owned and has a large presence on platforms like Reddit. One of Rocket Pool\u2019s standout features is that it allows you to stake as little as 0.01 ETH to start earning rewards or stake just 16 ETH to run your own validator node. Pros & Cons Pros One of the most popular liquid staking platforms\n\nCan be used by individuals and businesses to set up staking pools with custom fees and rules\n\nWhen staking, users get the \u201cRPL\u201d token as a reward, which is the governance token of the Rocket Pool DAO Cons While other platforms allow immediate un-staking, Rocket Pool requires lock-ins for between 3 and 12 months for validators\n\nFees can be as high as 20% on rewards from certain staking pools Features Run by the community through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\n\nYou can run an Ethereum node by staking just 16 ETH (it normally costs 32 ETH)\n\nThe protocol does not charge a flat commission fee on rewards, instead, you can pick from fees between 5% and 20% depending on how you decide to stake Why We Like It When it comes to community-owned and managed liquid staking platforms, Rocket Pool is definitely at the top. While many other liquid staking providers are opaque private companies, Rocket Pool is governed by a DAO where users can vote on proposals and decide the future of the protocol together.\n\nANKR Best for Multi-Chain Staking Open an Account On ANKR\u2019s site Review 4.5 Tokens Available ETH, MATIC, BNB +More ETH, MATIC, BNB +More Rewards 3.55%-13.44% 3.55%-13.44% Liquid Staking ankrETH, ankrMATIC, ankrBNB +More ankrETH, ankrMATIC, ankrBNB +More Supported Blockchains Ethereum, Polygon, Binance +More Ethereum, Polygon, Binance +More Fees 3.55%-13.44% 3.55%-13.44% Availability Worldwide Worldwide Overview ANKR provides liquid staking for a wide range of popular crypto assets, including Ethereum, Binance, Polygon, and several more.

Pros & Cons Pros Liquid staking for a wide range of popular cryptocurrencies\n\nPartnered with lots of blockchains, including Polygon, Solana, Binance, and more, to offer natively integrated services that are faster and cheaper Cons Liquid staking is not ANKR\u2019s main offering, so it can sometimes be deprioritized in favor of other services\n\nNot as popular as Lido or Rocket Pool Features Offers delegated staking, bridge services, and self-hosted blockchains for more advanced users\n\nProvides services on multiple chains, not just Ethereum\n\nUses a reputation-based system to ensure all node validators are trustworthy and staked funds are protected Why We Like It ANKR has built a reputation as one of the most reliable blockchain services. Its liquid staking features several different chains and fees that are competitive, all backed up by the reputation of the ANKR brand.\n\nMarinade Finance Best for Solana Staking Open an Account On Marinade Finance\u2019s site Tokens Available SOL SOL Rewards 6.79% 6.79% Liquid Staking Yes. mSOL Yes. mSOL Supported Blockchains Solana Solana Fees 6% 6% Availability Worldwide Worldwide Overview Marinade Finance is the top liquid staking platform on the Solana blockchain. While it only supports staking for the SOL token, Marinade has a \u201ctotal value locked\u201d (TVL) of over $130 million. Pros & Cons Pros Staking rewards for SOL are more than 6%, and fees are only around 6% of earned rewards\n\nMarinade is governed by a DAO, so it is decentralized and community-owned\n\nYou can use your mSOL to earn upwards of 20% APY by staking it on the Marinade website Cons As a Solana-specific product, Marinade only supports staking SOL\n\nMarinade is a newer liquid staking protocol that has not been stress-tested as much as some others Features Stake SOL and receive the liquid mSOL token\n\nThe mSOL token represents both your underlying SOL balance and the APY rewards\n\nUnstake at any time Why We Like It Marinade is a great option for anyone looking to stake their SOL. The platform provides an easy-to-use staking interface as well as instant unstaking for low fees.\n\nCoinbase Best For Beginners Open an Account On Coinbase\u2019s site Review 4.6 Coinbase Review Tokens Available ETH, SOL, ADA, XTZ + more ETH, SOL, ADA, XTZ + more Rewards 2% to 6.12% 2% to 6.12% Liquid Staking Yes. lsETH Yes. lsETH Supported Blockchains Ethereum, Cardano, Solana + More Ethereum, Cardano, Solana + More Min.

Coinbase is the first stop for many first-time crypto buyers and gives users room to grow with an exchange, a wallet, a rewards card, an NFT marketplace, and more. Pros & Cons Pros Easy to use, start earning in seconds\n\nEarning displayed immediately upon login\n\nStart staking with as little as $1 Cons Limited selection of cryptos for staking\n\nLower APYs compared to other exchanges Why We Like Coinbase For Staking In a nutshell, it\u2019s easy. Coinbase offers fewer staking options (just six) compared to many other exchanges. But if you\u2019re a Coinbase user already, you\u2019ll appreciate the way Coinbase displays your earnings in your account dashboard, never leaving you guessing. Staking on Coinbase is as easy as you\u2019d expect, taking just a few newbie-friendly clicks. Options include top cryptos like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.\n\nWhat is Liquid Staking?\n\nLiquid staking is a special type of staking. Rather than simply locking up your crypto to earn rewards, you can actually receive a liquid token in return for staking that you can then use in place of your original crypto.\n\nFor example, in traditional staking, you lock up your SOL (Solana) for some period of time in order to earn some annual percentage yield (APY). During this time, your SOL cannot be used for anything else \u2014 if you unstake or move your SOL, you will stop earning interest.\n\nLiquid staking fixes this by issuing you a liquid token any time you stake. When you stake your SOL, for example, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token such as mSOL in return that you can trade and sell just as if you had your original SOL. This allows you to earn even more in rewards using your mSOL by lending it out or using it across DeFi (decentralized finance).\n\nLiquid Staking vs. Staking\n\nWe\u2019ve already covered the basic differences between liquid staking and traditional staking \u2014 namely, liquid staking gives you a new \u201cliquid\u201d token that you do not receive with traditional staking.\n\nWhile traditional staking is supported natively by many blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, third-party platforms must be used to facilitate liquid staking. Services such as Lido, Rocket Pool, and others make liquid staking possible by issuing their own liquid tokens in exchange for your staked cryptocurrencies (such as ETH and SOL).\n\nThis means that while normal staking only exposes you to the blockchain itself, liquid staking also exposes you to a third-party platform. If Lido or Rocket Pool were to get hacked or go bankrupt, your liquid staking tokens would also go down with them, so it\u2019s important to be mindful when choosing between these platforms.\n\nWant a full rundown of crypto staking? Check out our full guide.\n\nHelpful Definitions\n\nExplaining liquid staking involves lots of jargon. Check out the dropdown below for some helpful definitions before reading on.\n\nStaking Definitions\n\nLiquid Staking Derivative Token: When you stake a cryptocurrency, such as ETH or SOL, through liquid staking, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token in return. This token will usually have a prefix, such as \u201cstETH\u201d or \u201cmSOL.\u201d It usually represents your underlying staked crypto plus the accrued interest from staking.\n\nWhen you stake a cryptocurrency, such as ETH or SOL, through liquid staking, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token in return.

This is a reward that they get on top of their staked ETH for their service of helping to validate the blockchain. Commissions/Fees: Many liquid staking platforms will take a commission or a fee out of the APY paid out to stakers. If a blockchain pays 6% APY to stakers, for example, your liquid staking platform may take 10% of that APY as a fee for providing you with a liquid token.\n\nLiquid Staking Benefits\n\nLiquid staking has many benefits, which make it a preferred option for investors looking to get the most out of their crypto.\n\nLiquidity : As the name implies, liquid staking gives you a liquid token in return for your staked crypto. This allows you to earn an even higher yield on your staked crypto by lending out your liquid token or leveraging it across DeFi.\n\n: As the name implies, liquid staking gives you a liquid token in return for your staked crypto.

Risk Management: Your liquid staking tokens can be used as collateral to take out DeFi loans or to provide you additional yield in interest-bearing accounts. You can put these loans to work for personal use, or you can re-invest the funds.\n\nLiquid Staking Risks\n\nAs with anything in crypto, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Liquid staking comes with its own risks:\n\nPlatform Risk: Your liquid staking tokens will be platform-specific. stETH, for example, is a liquid staking token for ETH that\u2019s specific to the Lido platform. This means that any time you are holding stETH, you are exposed to how Lido performs as a company. If it were to get hacked or go bankrupt, the value of your stETH tokens might be affected.\n\nYour liquid staking tokens will be platform-specific. stETH, for example, is a liquid staking token for ETH that\u2019s specific to the Lido platform.

Limited Support: Liquid staking tokens are generally not as well supported by exchanges as other major cryptocurrencies. For example, you can trade ETH pretty much anywhere and use it for any DeFi application. stETH, meanwhile, is less well-supported, so your options may be more limited.\n\nLiquid staking tokens are generally not as well supported by exchanges as other major cryptocurrencies.

Taxes: In the US, trading your staked crypto for a liquid staking derivative represents a taxable event. This is because the trade is a \u201cswap,\u201d which is considered a sale that has to have capital gains or losses calculated.\n\nWho Should Liquid Stake?\n\nPeople Who Are Intermediate Users: Liquid staking is an advanced concept in crypto that can prove difficult to navigate. While savvy beginners may be able to participate in liquid staking, they should do so at their own risk and be aware of some of the risks they are taking.\n\nLiquid staking is an advanced concept in crypto that can prove difficult to navigate.

People Who Can\u2019t Afford To Lose Any Crypto: Liquid staking is risky \u2014 you may make a mistake during the many steps required to stake and unstake your crypto, or your liquid staking platform may experience a hack or become insolvent. It\u2019s best done with crypto you can afford to lose and that you plan on holding for a long time.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIn summary, liquid staking is an intermediate strategy used by savvy traders to earn yield on their crypto while also retaining a liquid asset. While it can be very profitable, it\u2019s important to note that liquid staking is risky and should be undertaken only after you do proper research.\n\nRemember to never stake money that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy Is Liquid Staking Different Than Other Types Of Staking? Liquid staking is different from traditional staking because it provides you with a \u201cliquid\u201d token while your crypto is staked. You can use this liquid token to lend, provide liquidity, and much more across DeFi to boost your yield even more. What Liquid Staking Protocol Is Best? It\u2019s difficult to determine which staking protocol is the best. Lido is the largest staking protocol, while Rocket Pool is known for its vibrant community. Additionally, Coinbase Prime and ANKR are good choices for institutional stakers. What Are Liquid Staking Derivatives? Liquid staking derivatives are simply the liquid tokens that represent your staked crypto. For example, when staking ETH through Lido, your \u201cliquid staking derivative\u201d token will be \u201cstETH.\u201d What\u2019s The Difference Between Liquid Staking And Liquidity Pools? While similar in name, liquid staking, and liquidity pools are two very different concepts. Liquid staking is when you receive a liquid token in return for staking your crypto. Liquidity pools, on the other hand, are when you provide \u201cliquidity\u201d to a pair of tokens that other traders can use to trade. For example, you can supply ETH liquidity into a USDC/ETH pool which will provide the ETH that traders need to buy when they are selling USDC. What Are The Advantages Of Liquid Staking Tokens? Liquid staking tokens allow you to have access to your staked crypto without any lockups. Normally, you can\u2019t use your staked tokens for anything until you un-stake them. With liquid staking, you can use your liquid tokens to lend, provide liquidity, or as collateral when taking out loans.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum (ETH) from experimental niche technology into a mainstream tech stack includes three roadmaps. Should the network fail at one of them, it would be difficult for it to achieve massive adoption in competition with centralized competitors. Vitalik Buterin described these \"building blocks\" of a mature Ethereum (ETH).\n\nScaling transition, security transition, privacy transition: Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum (ETH) maturing\n\nIn order to continue its evolution into a mature tech stack that is able to bring an \"open, global and permissionless experience\" to a new generation of users, Ethereum (ETH) needs to undergo three transitions. The second largest blockchain needs to focus on scalability, security and privacy; the three milestones should be accomplished almost simultaneously, Buterin claimed in his recent article.\n\nIn terms of L2-centric scaling, rollups are the best solution: every dApp should move its operations to a rollup-based network. The wallet security transition will be achieved through \"smart conract wallets\" enabled by the Account Abstraction concept.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Account Abstraction, or EIP 4337, is a recent update of the Ethereum (ETH) protocol design. It blurs the line between on-chain wallets and smart contracts: every wallet can now become a \"decentralized bank.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the privacy transition is of paramount importance: privacy should be available for all operations - both existing and potential - on Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Vitalik stresses:\n\n...making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available, and making sure all of the other gadgets that are being developed (social recovery, identity, reputation) are privacy-preserving.\n\nVitalik highlighted that we should not view these changes as simple EIPs or even hardforks as they are far more sophisticated. To achieve the mentioned goals, in some aspects, Ethereum's (ETH) design needs to change \"pretty fundamentally.\"\n\n\"You only can choose three out of three\"\n\nAt the same time, all three goals should be addressed simultaneously: we cannot focus on one or two of them. Without a scaling transition, Ethereum (ETH) fees will be too high, and products will be seeking centralized alternatives to moving money on-chain.\n\nWithout advanced wallet security, it would be uncomfortable for users to store Ethers and Ethereum-based tokens in noncustodial wallets so that they would yet again need centralized custody.\n\nRegarding the third roadmap, the situation looks the same for Vitalik: future users of Ethereum (ETH) will not be happy about having all of their activities exposed to third parties with no obfuscation.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bitcoiners (BTC) accused Ethereum (ETH) developers of \"lying\" about the scaling potential of their L1 blockchain."

If there was something coming for it, I needed to be on it. But the type of developments that they have done over those last 26 months \u2013 mind-blowing, absolutely crazy.\u201d\n\nHe says the improvements to the blockchain project like Jump Crypto\u2019s open-source validator client Firedancer will boost scalability and network processing times.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s really intriguing to me is this, is how they\u2019re going to scale as they go forward with Firedancer and they have a thing called side-scaling and this basically will change exactly how they go forward. Firedancer is a Solana validator developed by Jump Crypto and it aims to significantly enhance Solana scalability and most importantly, what people don\u2019t focus on, is reduce latency times down to essentially milliseconds. This will pose a huge threat to many other things\u2026\n\nThis came from [crypto analytics firm] Messari actually. They talk about how Firedancer puts Solana in the range of CEX (centralized exchange) latency times, i.e. the ability to run a New York Stock Exchange or a NASDAQ or multiple exchanges. And they go on and talk about things like security and expenses and processing times and, again, latency, which is so important.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the upgrades going on in the ecosystem set it apart from many of the other blockchain projects and it will lead to more development and use cases.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the things that I think are just mind-blowing about Solana that many people kind of don\u2019t understand. They lump it in the same category with other layer-1s, layer-2s, but it is so far ahead because of some of those things that I mentioned and it all comes down to scale. How can you onboard a billion people The answer is with a truckload of scale. And how do you have a breadth of use cases, the answer is zero latency and a ton of throughput.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $18.73 at time of writing, down 8% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here's why some other cryptocurrency experts are not excited about the concept of proto-danksharding.\n\nStealthy pivot instead of scaling L1: Tuur Demeester slams Ethereum (ETH) devs\n\nCore developers of Ethereum (ETH), the second largest blockchain, lied about its scaling opportunities from the very beginning. All initiatives in this field were actually an \"on-chain scaling narrative,\" Mr. Demeester stated in a recent tweet.\n\nEthereum founders lied about scaling from the start. While bitcoiners took years to build L2, ETH devs sneered and pumped ETH using an on-chain scaling fairy tale. Later they stealthily pivoted. What's next? You know what they say: there's no way to tell a liar's hard-fork. pic.twitter.com/Ak1aGIp0tg \u2014 Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) June 7, 2023\n\nAs such, all announcements about Etheruem (ETH) scaling concepts outside L2 solutions were just made to \"pump-and-dump\" the price of Ether, an asset of Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\n\nWith this post, Tuur Demeester agreed with the skepticism of James Prestwitch, a founder of Storj (STORJ) protocol. Mr. Prestwitch recalled that the approach to on-chain scaling evolved from \"original\" sharding into a \"block-as-a-shard\" solution designed to make rollups by third-party devs do all the legwork.\n\nMeanwhile, Demeester stressed that Bitcoiners (BTC) spend \"years\" building real second-layer solutions.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, recently, Ethereum (ETH) core developers approved the activation of the Cancun-Deneb upgrade in Q4, 2023.\n\nThe upgrade is designed to supercharge Ethereum (ETH) by proto-danksharding, a resource-efficient method of data logistics optimization.\n\nWhat about Bitcoin's (BTC) L2s?\n\nCancun-Deneb (or Cancun) is designed to make the computational costs for all Ethereum (ETH) L2s lower and, therefore, make the blockchain more rollup-friendly.\n\nWhile Bitcoiners (BTC) in general supported Demeester's position, some of his followers decided to strike back. They immediately started asking him about the traction of Lightning Network, the most popular Bitcoin (BTC) L2 scaling solution on payment channels.\n\nEthan Kravitz of AGE Crypto Asset Investment Funds stressed that LN failed to achieve massive adoption so far:\n\nBitcoiners have been pumping Lightning since 2017 at least. It\u2019s still unusable though looks like Lightspark is hopefully fixing that.\n\nSome of Demeester's opponents also called LN a \"coming-soon\" protocol with 100 users maximum."

        "content": "Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, stopped sending transactions to mainnet for roughly two hours on Wednesday due to a software bug affecting the optimistic rollup\u2019s sequencer.\n\nThe snafu effectively left more than $2.2 billion in crypto in the lurch, locked inside dapps running on the blockchain, including GMX and Uniswap.\n\nArbitrum, like other rollup-centric networks, is intended to relieve Ethereum mainnet of activity by providing users an off-chain environment in which to transact. The company behind Arbitrum is Offchain Labs.\n\nEvery so often, Arbitrum must batch those transactions together and forward them to Ethereum for finalization. Code associated with a network node crucial to this process \u2014 the sequencer \u2014 was responsible for the outage.\n\nIn order for the node to send the transactions to Ethereum, one of the two wallets associated with the node needs enough ETH to pay for transaction fees.\n\nArbitrum developers explained in a tweet thread that a \u201cmalfunction\u201d in the sequencer meant batches of transactions stopped being passed to the Ethereum mainnet. This interrupted an automated function that refilled the node\u2019s wallet with ETH for transaction fees \u2014 effectively causing transactions to pile up for hours, awaiting settlement.\n\n\u201cThe Sequencer spent the ~5 ETH it had, but the gas-refunder (which had ~250 ETH) didn\u2019t refill it until it posted a successful batch,\u201d the developers tweeted.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nDespite the incident, the group described the system as \u201cworking as intended,\u201d as the sequencer is only provided ETH if it can successfully post batches. \u201cIf there is a malfunction in the Sequencer, then it cannot spend its way through the high ETH balance of the gas refunder.\u201d\n\nThe network was back processing transactions on Ethereum mainnet as normal as of 10:00 am ET, Wednesday. Since its Nitro upgrade in August 2022, Arbitrum has encountered 8 outages of between 30 minutes and 2 hours, according to blockchain bridge developer Shotaro Granzier-Nakajima.\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident was not an outage of that magnitude, according to A.J. Warner, chief strategy Officer at Offchain Labs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no parallel. This was not sequencer downtime. This was a bug that caused a delay in batch posting,\u201d Warner told Blockworks. In fact, Arbitrum \u201coften delays posting to [layer-1] in times of high [layer-1] congestion,\u201d Warner said, noting that alternative zk rollups can also take several hours before posting data to Ethereum mainnet under normal operation.\n\nOffchain Labs said a full postmortem on the situation would be released later today.\n\nNews analysis by Macauley Peterson\n\nAll Ethereum layer-2\u2019s currently operating, employ a centralized sequencer \u2014 in Arbitrum\u2019s case one run by Offchain Labs. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s meant to be forever, but moving further out on the decentralization spectrum is mostly aspirational at this stage of their development.\n\nAccording to Arbitrum\u2019s documentation, \u201ceventually, sequencing affordances could be given to a distributed committee of sequencers which come to consensus on ordering.\u201d\n\nBlockworks Research\u2019s timely report \u201cSequencers: The Key to The Rollup Investment Thesis\u201d includes the key takeaway that \u201ccentralized sequencers bring concerns surrounding liveness, censorship resistance, and regulatory arbitrage for the L2s.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident represents a potential censorship resistance failure. No transaction batches posted \u2192 no layer-1 finality.\n\nThe sequencer was misbehaving, although it was not strictly \u201cdown\u201d and continued to process transactions without posting them to Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn theory, there\u2019s another route to getting layer-2 transactions processed by submitting them via layer-1 into what Arbitrum calls \u201cthe delayed Inbox.\u201d That is a primary selling point of Ethereum layer-2s and the basis of the claim that they are \u201cinheriting,\u201d in some sense, the security of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nFollowing a previous incident which did involve sequencer downtime in January 2022, the Arbitrum team wrote, \u201cthe network is designed to sustain even permanent Sequencer failures by falling back to using Ethereum to process transactions.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t necessary in this case.\n\nBe that as it may, there is still a considerable amount of trust in Offchain Labs required, even after the launch of the ARB token and initial efforts to decentralize governance.\n\nUntil fraud proofs can be validated permissionlessly, rather than via whitelisted nodes, and solutions to the decentralized sequencer are found, tested, and battle hardened, there will always be additional risks with rollups. It\u2019s a tradeoff users make for higher performance and lower transaction costs.\n\nAnd plenty of users are making that tradeoff! Funds at risk have climbed from a July 2022 trough of about $560 million to a recent peak in May of $2.55 billion.\n\nThe Arbitrum token (ARB), with a current market cap of $1.44 billion, fell roughly 5% on the news, but has recovered about half of that since.\n\nUpdated: June 8, 2023, at 10:48 am ET with comments from Offchain Labs received after publication.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Firedancer delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million TPS.\n\nSOL dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim that the altcoin was security.\n\nScalability is one of the most significant barriers to blockchain progress in current times. Networks are continuously looking for new, innovative ways to improve transaction throughput so as to gain an upper hand in the competitive environment.\n\nWhile most entities opt for the modular approach i.e, splitting the functions across sidechains and layer-2 chains (L2), the Solana [SOL] network opted for a monolithic way of improving scalability at layer-1 itself, according to on-chain analytics firm Messari.\n\nThe initiative to develop Firedancer, Solana\u2019s second validator client, represents an important step in this direction.\n\n1/ Scalability is a key factor in the crypto space, with the modular approach gaining popularity. However, @Solana has taken a contrarian stance.@kelxyz_ explains how @jump_firedancer, a validator client developed by @jump_ aims to enhance Solana's monolithic approach.? pic.twitter.com/zRc3Q5wSeT \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 6, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana on \u2018Fire\u2019\n\nSolana got into a partnership with Web3 infrastructure developer Jump Crypto in August 2022. This was to create a new validator client Firedancer, separate from the one originally built by Solana Labs. With the ambition of boosting network throughput, the project delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAmong other potential benefits of Firedancer, the first and foremost was reducing Solana\u2019s latency times significantly. This made the network conducive for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and attracting high-frequency traders. Messari stated that Solana\u2019s latency times might be reduced to 400-500 milliseconds, putting it on par with centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nMessari\u2019s research highlighted that if it clicks the right boxes, Firedancer had the potential to open up unexplored market space and create new demand for the Solana chain. For example, if it manages to clock 1 million TPS, Solana could attract Web2 applications like social media and financial platforms.\n\nAt the time of writing though, the \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019 processed an average of 4,000 TPS over the last seven days, per data from Solscan. The total transaction fees paid to validators to secure the network was 39.256 in the last 24 hours.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nSOL suffers but\u2026\n\nSOL was yet to recover from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s latest blow labeling the ninth-largest crypto asset in the market as a security. At press time, it exchanged hands at $19.85, having dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim, according to Santiment.\n\nSurprisingly, market sentiment for the coin turned favorable as a result of this development, going into the positive zone after a week of trading."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes Ethereum still requires \u201cthree major technical transitions\u201d to fully mature as a tech stack \u2013 and anything less will be insufficient.\n\nIn a Friday blog post, the developer highlighted what\u2019s needed to implement each of his ideal improvements, which could include \u201cdeep changes from applications and wallets.\u201d\n\nScaling, Security, and Privacy\n\nAccording to Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s three transitions include layer-2 scaling (rollups), enhanced wallet security (smart contract wallets), and improved privacy \u2013 for both standard funds transfer and other Ethereum applications.\n\n\u201cYou can only pick 3 out of 3,\u201d wrote the developer. Failure of just one of these transitions would mean a failure of the entire protocol, as users are incentivized to adopt cheaper \u201ccentralized workarounds\u201d that are more reliable and \u201csomewhat hide your data.\u201d\n\nYet the transitions will be difficult: for instance, the adoption of layer 2 protocols, and stealth addresses, will encourage users to use far more blockchain addresses, dismantling the \u201cone user ~= one address mental model,\u201d the ecosystem has grown familiar with. For Buterin, this raises the following questions:\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay someone, how will you get the information on how to pay them?\u2026 If users have many assets stored in different places across different chains, how do they do key changes and social recovery?\u201d\n\nEach transition will also require updated secondary infrastructure. \u201cUsing ENS is expensive,\u201d wrote Buterin, referencing the Ethereum Name Service \u2013 a system for applying human-readable names to blockchain addresses.\n\nDuring a bull market, Buterin estimated that fees to register a domain name could surge back above $100. Thankfully, ENS has been developing tools to make its system work on L2, which will enable the \u201cnearly-free\u201d domain registration needed for \u201cpeople to actually use ENS.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadical reforms of the kind that we need are actually possible,\u201d wrote Buterin, \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more application-layer reform that will need to be done.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Core Use Cases\n\nIn December 2022, Vitalik reflected on Ethereum\u2019s feasible use cases, stating that \u201cmoney\u201d is still the most important application ever discovered for blockchain.\n\nOthers like decentralized finance (DeFi) remain relevant, however, so long as it sticks to simple over-collateralized loan products, and doesn\u2019t inflate into an \u201covercapitalized monster\u201d reliant on unsustainable forms of yield farming.\u201d\n\nSome ideas, however, are not realistic:\n\n\u201cIndustrial supply-chain applications have not gone anywhere,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cDecentralized Amazon on the blockchain has not happened.\u201d"

        "content": "Deutsche Telekom has started running a validator node for Polygon.\n\nBut it's not entirely clear what the company hopes to gain by doing so.\n\nLast week, Deutsche Telekom started running a validator node for Polygon, a top-ten blockchain by the amount of investor deposits in its DeFi ecosystem. Polygon supporters praised the blockchain\u2019s high-rolling partnership.\n\nValidators nodes, like the ones Deutsche Telekom runs, help confirm transactions sent through blockchains. Those who run them must put up some crypto as collateral to do so, or have others delegate assets to them. In return, those who put up their assets automatically receive rewards from the network.\n\nIn this sense, running validators helps keep blockchains secure.\n\nBut why is Deutsche Telekom, a technology giant associated with a bygone era, diving into the role of a Polygon validator?\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDeutsche Telekom has a goal to become an infrastructure provider in web3, Dirk R\u00f6der, head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, told DL News.\n\n\u201cSupporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in this objective,\u201d he said.\n\nSupporting Ethereum by validating for Polygon?\n\nBut Deutsche Telekom has an even more specific interest in web3.\n\nThe company has \u201ca focus on the Ethereum ecosystem and its scalability solutions,\u201d and Deutsche Telekom\u2019s foray into Polygon is in line with that, R\u00f6der said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe company describes Polygon as \u201cthe leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform\u201d which implies that Polygon relies on Ethereum for its blockchain security like Arbitrum and Optimism. It also says the company \u201crelies on Polygon to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolygon validators sign checkpoints on the Ethereum blockchain, security is derived directly from Ethereum Layer 1 consensus, which is secured by more than 20 million ETH staked,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: LayerZero demands anonymous devs reveal identities to work on new bug bounty effort\n\nBut Deutsche Telekom\u2019s specific interest in Polygon may not accurately represent the nature of the blockchain \u2014 a concern that once led Polygon to change its marketing.\n\nPolygon initially promoted its technology as a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. However, in response to criticism from many in crypto about potential misrepresentation, the company decided to discontinue the use of such terminology.\n\nPolygon is a sidechain, which operates like an independent blockchain with no security relation with Ethereum. More specifically, some have called Polygon a \u201ccommit-chain\u201d based on the fact that it \u201ccommits\u201d its transaction history to Ethereum but does not rely on it to ensure transaction records are accurate.\n\nDefinitely an error, will correct.\n\n\n\nPolygon PoS is not an average sidechain as well.\n\n\n\nWe generally use the term scaling solutions, but sometimes employees or journalists use L2 because it's very common. Btw sidechains used to be called L2s until very recently (even by the EF). \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) June 27, 2022\n\nR\u00f6der did not immediately reply to a question about Polygon not relying on Ethereum for its security.\n\nPolygon\u2019s assets are secured by a multi-signature wallet controlled by a group of eight individuals or entities. Signature from five of them is enough to make drastic changes to the network which secures almost $1 billion worth of assets.\n\n\u201cDecentralisation often comes at the expense of speed,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\n\u201cAs a result, many blockchain projects initially begin in a more centralised form and gradually transition to a decentralised model,\u201d he said. \u201cPolygon follows a similar approach.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the fact that Polygon is a sidechain, which has nothing to do with Ethereum, doesn\u2019t matter for Deutsche Telekom that much. After all, the company\u2019s not an Ethereum maximalist \u2014 it supports six different blockchains.\n\nIn addition to Polygon, Deutsche Telekom runs validators for major and minor blockchains including Ethereum, Q, Celo, Flow, and Energy Web. It also contributes to Chainlink\u2019s oracle node network which helps DeFi apps receive data from outside sources.\n\nNOW READ: Montenegro leaders turn on crypto after Vitalik\u2019s Zuzalu fest. The reason: Do Kwon\n\nRunning a validator node itself is not an overly complex task. Many are hosted in giant data centres run by companies like Amazon Web Services for a small fee.\n\nHowever, many of the blockchains Deutsche Telekom supports don\u2019t let everyone run a validator. You need a special invite for that.\n\nIn the case of Polygon, one of Deutsche Telekom\u2019s recent additions, the network comprises only 100 hand-picked validators like Deutsche Telekom. In comparison, Ethereum, where anyone can spin up a validator at home or host one at a data centre, has over 700,000 validators.\n\n\u2018Infrastructure, not asset management\u2019\n\nWhat Europe\u2019s largest telecommunications company\u2019s strategy from running validators is remains unclear.\n\nR\u00f6der emphasised that blockchain technology presents a \u201cvalid business case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expression \u2018valid business case\u2019 refers to our business model. Deutsche Telekom runs web3 infrastructure and receives percentages of the rewards,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\nBut according to another Deutsche Telekom representative, the company does not stake any of its own crypto assets, and instead relies on others to do so and takes a cut of their rewards.\n\n\u201cOur business is infrastructure, not asset management,\u201d the other representative said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting paid to provide rock solid infrastructure to asset holders. Those people use our infrastructure to delegate their tokens and we receive a commission for our service from those rewards.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Everything is about to change at MakerDAO: Rune Christensen on his Endgame plan\n\nThis week, it announced it was doing the same for the lesser-known Energy Web blockchain.\n\nBut some think that Deutsche Telekom buddying up with blockchains could be more of a marketing strategy than anything else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because they\u2019ve been fairly active in crypto for years,\u201d Santiago Santos, a crypto angel investor, told DL News.\n\nSantos speculated on what might be behind the move. \u201cPresumably, some angle to be relevant with their young user base,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s probably cool to run a validator."

Visit Halborn\n\nWhat Is A Smart Contract Audit?\n\nA smart contract audit is an extensive evaluation of the code that powers dApps, how the contracts function, and how they interact with the blockchain or other smart contracts. Smart contract audits involve testing for potential vulnerabilities, unintended \u201cfeatures\u201d (bugs), and access control (who has the keys and controls the funds).\n\nBefore launch, crypto projects and protocols usually enlist one or more companies to dig into the code and create a detailed report. Typically, you can find a link to audits on the project website, GitHub, or in the project\u2019s documentation.\n\nIn most cases, once a smart contract is deployed, it can\u2019t be changed. Not easily, anyway. It\u2019s better to get it right the first time \u2014 and it\u2019s always better to have a third party who has no investment in the project be the one that checks the code in question.\n\nIt\u2019s like checking the house (twice) before you leave for vacation to be sure you fed the fish, locked the doors, and didn\u2019t leave any kids behind. Except that someone else \u2013 who isn\u2019t stressed about catching the flight \u2013 does the double-checking.\n\nWhat Is A Smart Contract Audit Company?\n\nSmart contract audit companies are firms that specialize in smart-contract security. They test smart contracts and evaluate every function to find potential vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.\n\nWhy are smart contract audit services needed? Here\u2019s an example of what can happen without an audit.\n\nIn 2022, the stablecoin CASH fell to an exploit in which a user took $52 million. Reportedly, the code had not been audited prior to the exploit.\n\nMany times, crypto losses reported as hacks are better described as exploits, meaning that someone figured out a loophole. Basically, if you press this button or pull this lever or sing Yankee Doodle Dandy \u2014 money pops out of the flawed contract. The code let it happen, but a smart contract audit company could have saved the day by finding the potential exploit before the contract went live.\n\nCrypto audit companies also provide smart contract audit consulting, which can help identify areas of focus and the scope of a smart contract audit.\n\nWhat Happens During A Smart Contract Audit?\n\nCrypto smart contract audits are typically broad in scope and require several steps.\n\nIdentify the objectives (and scope) of the audit: Crypto auditing companies need to know what you want to accomplish with the audit. Do you need to test the smart contract under certain conditions? For example, a decentralized exchange or perpetual swaps contract might require special attention to risks for users, such as frontrunning (where bots steal profitable trades from users). Collect functional requirements: Generally, this is the project\u2019s documentation, the how-to manual that explains how the protocol is supposed to work. Auditors will later compare this to how the code actually works, noting any differences in the report. Collect technical documentation: Auditors often request any internal documents regarding the code. These aren\u2019t necessarily user-friendly directions but instead might document the intended function or how the contract is intended to interact with blockchains, tokens, and other contracts. Think design specs. Plan the audit: Once the auditors have the code, the docs, and the scope of the audit in hand, then the planning phase begins. This step ensures that nothing is missed and the testing that happens next answers the audit\u2019s full scope. Testing, testing, more testing: Crypto auditing companies run the code manually in a sandboxed environment or on a network testnet. Automated testing is often run as well, simulating actions of users and contract interactions. Crypto audit companies look for vulnerabilities but typically also document unexpected behaviors or complex code that aren\u2019t necessarily security issues. Reporting: After testing is complete, the crypto audit company provides a detailed report specifying the number of issues found, their type, and any risks or performance problems. Reports typically go well beyond bugs and vulnerabilities. The Uniswap V3 audit evaluated a range of areas. General code assessment: This step evaluated structure and syntax. Entity usage analysis: Auditors looked at Internal calls to other functions and external calls. Access control analysis: Auditors checked who has access to what, as well as which assets the system should protect Code logic: Did the code run like a well-oiled machine in testing? If not, why \u2014 and were any external libraries the code used up to date?\n\nAfter the report is complete, project developers usually have a chance to fix errors and have a second evaluation of the code. Fixed errors are marked as \u201cfixed\u201d in the final report.\n\nBenefits Of Using An Auditor\n\nError checking: The obvious benefit for crypto projects is that auditors will catch mistakes the dev team misses. It\u2019s not that one coder is better than another. It\u2019s another set of eyes on the code \u2014 another team with no emotional or financial investment in the project.\n\nThe obvious benefit for crypto projects is that auditors will catch mistakes the dev team misses. It\u2019s not that one coder is better than another. It\u2019s another set of eyes on the code \u2014 another team with no emotional or financial investment in the project. Security: Many crypto protocols involve tokens or transfers of value, like NFTs. It\u2019s essential that the code functions as intended and doesn\u2019t put user (or treasury) assets at risk.\n\nMany crypto protocols involve tokens or transfers of value, like NFTs.

Costly protocols can lose users to more efficient protocols.\n\nOn the Ethereum network and Layer 2 networks, gas fees pay for network usage. Needlessly complex code leads to higher transaction costs for users. Costly protocols can lose users to more efficient protocols. Reputation: Seasoned crypto veterans won\u2019t even link a wallet without reading the docs and looking for an audit report first. And if they don\u2019t find one, other users will hear about it through social media, including Telegram, Twitter, and Discord. If your project wants to reach savvy users and have them become ambassadors rather than detractors, an audit from a reputable company is in order.\n\nRisks Of Using An Auditor\n\nThe audit might miss something. Most protocol hacks are really exploits. The code wasn\u2019t changed by a hacker. The code just allowed something unexpected to happen. Testing for every possible situation is impossible. Smart contract audits and targeted dApp audits are important tools, but they can\u2019t guarantee the security of the smart contracts used by a protocol.\n\nMost protocol hacks are really exploits.

Smart contract audits and targeted dApp audits are important tools, but they can\u2019t guarantee the security of the smart contracts used by a protocol. Audits can cause delays in launch. A crypto audit might take days or weeks. In other cases, you might be waiting months. And if the audit finds flaws (likely), those have to be addressed before retesting and a final audit report. Be sure your project has enough runway to cover delays before you can go live and begin generating revenue.\n\nA crypto audit might take days or weeks. In other cases, you might be waiting months. And if the audit finds flaws (likely), those have to be addressed before retesting and a final audit report. Be sure your project has enough runway to cover delays before you can go live and begin generating revenue. Audits cost a lot of money. While the investment in a crypto audit limits risk, the cost in time and money can be considerable. For a simpler token audit, the cost may be $5,000 to $10,000, with a short delay of a few days. More complex contracts, like those found in DeFi, can cost much more \u2014 sometimes up to $70,000, with a months-long waiting period.\n\nHow Much Does A Smart Contract Audit Cost?\n\nSmart contract audit costs vary by complexity. It\u2019s like when you take your car in for service. Tire rotations are cheap. Diagnosing a performance problem for a 12-cylinder Lamborghini Aventador is expensive. And you probably wouldn\u2019t take your Lambo to a shop that works on Fords and Hondas. Ditto for smart contract audits.\n\nFind the experts in your niche.\n\nToken contracts are among the most affordable types of contract audits, often ranging from $5,000 to $15,000. More complex contracts, like those found in DeFi, can cost much more. You can spend $30,000 to $70,000 to audit a smart contract that performs several functions or interacts with other protocols.\n\nPrice also varies by the smart contract auditing firm you choose. However, it\u2019s likely worth the extra investment to work with a smart contract audit company that\u2019s experienced with similar projects.\n\nLastly, the scope of the audit plays a role in cost. How much testing is enough? That\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to decide as you discuss your needs with your crypto audit company. This is one of those areas where cost savings can cost much more in the long run.\n\nWho Needs A Smart Contract Auditor?\n\nCompanies that transact in cryptocurrencies: If your company buys, sells, trades, or trades crypto \u2014 or if your company accepts crypto payments, it makes sense to have the top smart contract auditors review your procedures, apps, and wallets you use.\n\nIf your company buys, sells, trades, or trades crypto \u2014 or if your company accepts crypto payments, it makes sense to have the top smart contract auditors review your procedures, apps, and wallets you use.

A crypto auditing company can go through the processes and code to look for weaknesses that should be addressed.\n\nTips For Choosing Smart Contract Audit Companies\n\nConsider cost: Price matters, but this is one area where cutting costs can be more expensive in the end. Consider additional fundraising if needed rather than choosing the cheapest Blockchain security audit company you can find. Compare the cost to the value they\u2019re providing. As Uncle Warren (Buffett) once said, \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get.\u201d\n\nPrice matters, but this is one area where cutting costs can be more expensive in the end.

Are there complementary services such as smart contract audit consulting and efficiency tuning? Lastly, are you paying for services you don\u2019t need? Consider past experience: The clients an auditor has worked with in the past signal their reputation for quality work. If the auditor has worked with reputable crypto companies, that\u2019s a good sign. But you also want a company that\u2019s experienced in your particular area. In short, check their resume. The best blockchain audit company for your specific needs may not be the biggest player in the space. Specialization matters in many cases.\n\nThe clients an auditor has worked with in the past signal their reputation for quality work.

The best blockchain audit company for your specific needs may not be the biggest player in the space. Specialization matters in many cases. Certifications: One common certification, Certified Cryptocurrency Auditor (CCA) \u2014 awarded by the Blockchain Council, indicates that the auditor has completed training specifically for crypto audits and processes to do complete audits. Some certified auditors focus on the path of transactions, giving a forensic view of money flow, while others examine the code itself. Experience and track record are likely more important, but the best smart contract auditors often have specialized certifications to show they have the right training for the job.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIt\u2019s essential for crypto projects to hire independent smart contract auditing firms to review their codebase and architecture. The audit process helps ensure apps and protocols are free from bugs and vulnerabilities \u2014 but can also find areas where efficiency can be improved. Experience also matters. Look for smart contract audit companies that have experience with apps similar to yours and a proven track record overall.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWho Are The Best Crypto Auditors? There are many experienced crypto auditing companies out there. We did the research and identified the best ones that you can choose from. They include the likes of CertiK, Hacken, Chainsulting, and others you can spot on this list. Smart Contract Audit Company Vs. Blockchain Security Audit: What\u2019s The Difference? Smart contract auditors focus on the underlying smart contract of a blockchain project while blockchain security auditors focus on both that and some external aspects such as user interface, code optimization, social engineering, and anti-phishing. Who Ae The Best DeFi Auditors? OpenZeppelin, Hacken, and Consensys Diligence are some of the best DeFi auditors you can choose. Is CertiK The Best Audit Company? CertiK does not just offer smart contract auditing but instead a broad range of security services for blockchain companies. We can\u2019t call it the absolute best but it\u2019s one of the best out there for sure.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "title": "Vitalik Outlines Three Transitions for Ethereum's future - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn a recent blog post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a roadmap consisting of three significant technical transitions that he believes are vital for ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThree must-implement transitions\n\nButerin emphasises that these transitions, namely Layer 2 scaling, wallet security enhancement, and privacy measures, are essential in maintaining Ethereum's decentralised nature and for guaranteeing open and unrestricted access for all users.\n\nFailure to implement these transitions, warns Buterin, could potentially undermine Ethereum's viability as a robust and widely adopted platform.\n\nLayer 2 scaling\n\nThe first transition focuses on scaling Layer 2 solutions. Over the past few years, Ethereum has witnessed the emergence of a Layer 2 ecosystem comprising solutions like Optimistic Rollup and Zero Knowledge-Rollup, which have effectively reduced transaction costs. However, as the majority of activities still occur on the main Ethereum network, further maturation and scaling of the Layer 2 space are necessary.\n\nButerin highlights the potential consequences of neglecting Layer 2 scaling, including skyrocketing transaction fees during market expansion phases or bullish market trends. Such circumstances may lead users to seek centralised alternatives, posing a threat to Ethereum's decentralisation goals.\n\n\"The absence of the first transition, Layer 2 scaling, would render Ethereum vulnerable, with each transaction costing $3.75 ($82.48 during a bullish market). This would inevitably drive mass-market products to disregard the Ethereum chain and adopt centralized workarounds,\" Buterin explained.\n\nWallet security\n\nThe second transition highlighted by Buterin centres around wallet security. Buterin expresses concern that potential security risks may discourage users from storing their funds and non-financial assets on the Ethereum network, driving them towards centralised exchanges as a safer alternative.\n\n\"Without the second transition, wallet security, Ethereum's success is compromised as users become hesitant to store their funds securely. This could result in a mass migration towards centralized exchanges,\" warns Buterin.\n\nTo enhance wallet security, Buterin proposes a shift towards smart contract wallets with advanced features such as social recovery, similar to the concept of account abstraction. These enhanced wallets would offer improved security measures and an enhanced user experience.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe third and final transition emphasised by Buterin is privacy. He cautions that the absence of robust data privacy measures may discourage users from utilising Ethereum's capabilities fully. To address this concern, Buterin suggests the implementation of stealth address protocols, which would provide privacy features for Ethereum users.\n\nBy integrating stealth address protocols, Ethereum would be able to offer enhanced privacy options, attracting users who value anonymity and data protection.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Their prediction of Ethereum surpassing $50,000 by 2023 highlights the firm's confidence in the potential of this leading blockchain platform. This Ethereum price estimate may initially appear idealistic, yet it is based on actual research.\n\nThe market acquisition strategy of Ethereum is a crucial component of its future development and price. The emphasis of Ethereum is not constrained to any one business or area. Instead, it seeks to disrupt many industries, including Infrastructure (I), Metaverse, Social and Gaming (MSG). Due to its exceptional potential to lower costs, increase efficiency, and create new income streams, there are vital signs that Ethereum can win a large portion of the market in these segments.\n\nThese factors can potentially drive Ethereum's demand and fuel its upward price trajectory.

        "content": "Thu 08 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nWhat surprises does the crypto market hold for us? While it is impossible to answer this question with certainty, analysts cannot resist making predictions and speculations. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is one of those experts who taps into his knowledge to examine possible scenarios and shares his conclusions with his numerous followers. His latest prediction suggests a potential upward trend for two cryptocurrencies: Litecoin (LTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price: Surging to unprecedented heights since 2021?\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe made headlines last May by predicting a surge for Bitcoin amidst a banking crisis. Tireless, the renowned analyst now turns his attention to two altcoins.\n\nIn a recent video published on his YouTube channel, he first predicts a breakthrough for Litecoin (LTC). And the catalyst for this potential surge is none other than the upcoming halving, according to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe.\n\nHe states, \u201cLitecoin (LTC) is also doing very well. It is destined for a breakout. I believe the halving will occur in (August), which means we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think a very strong rally is certainly likely if it surpasses $100. If it goes beyond $100\u2026, then I suppose it will peak around $160 to $180.\u201d\n\nWhile we wait for Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s envisioned scenario to unfold, the price of Litecoin (LTC) is currently at $88.37 (at the time of writing this article).\n\nEther (ETH) not falling behind?\n\nFurther into his analysis, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe asserts that Ether might follow in Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) footsteps. According to the expert, ETH could also appreciate in value. For this to happen, it is crucial for it to maintain its resistance level at $1800.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that if it manages to surpass the immediate resistance at $1903, it can skyrocket and reach $2800. Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) is trading at $1846.41.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s prediction should delight holders of both cryptocurrencies. But be cautious not to rejoice too soon because another equally renowned analyst, Benjamin Cowen, predicts a decline in altcoins.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ethereum Dev Finalize \"Dencun\" Upgrade, Set To Enhance Scalability & Reduce Fees - TronWeekly",
        "content": "In a significant development for the Ethereum network, developers reached a consensus on Thursday regarding the full scope of an upcoming upgrade known as \u201cDencun.\u201d\n\nExpected to be implemented later this year, this hard fork will incorporate five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at enhancing data storage capabilities and reducing transaction fees.\n\nOne of the key components of the upgrade is EIP-4844, colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. This groundbreaking feature intends to scale the blockchain by creating additional space for data \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nThis expansion is anticipated to result in reduced gas fees for layer 2 rollups, a significant improvement for its scalability.\n\nAs part of the upgrade, in addition to proto-danksharding, several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have been chosen for integration.\n\nOne of these is EIP-1153, which aims to decrease fees related to on-chain data storage, ultimately improving blockspace and transaction efficiency. Another selected proposal is EIP-4788, which focuses on enhancing the design of bridges and staking pools to enhance interoperability and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, EIP-5656 suggests minor code modifications to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to streamline and optimize the platform\u2019s execution capabilities. Lastly, EIP-6780 is designed to eliminate code that could potentially terminate smart contracts, reinforcing the reliability and robustness of ETH\u2019s smart contract ecosystem.\n\nRelease Date: Ethereum Dev Expected To Go Live by End of 2023\n\nDuring the All Core Developers Execution Layer 163 call, Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, emphasized that no additional elements would be included in the fork. This commitment ensures that the upgrade remains focused and aligned with the outlined objectives.\n\nAlthough an exact date for the hard fork implementation has not been announced, the ETH community expects the Dencun upgrade to go live by the end of 2023. Notably, Dencun will encompass simultaneous upgrades occurring on both sides of the blockchain.\n\nThe execution layer will undergo the \u201cCancun\u201d upgrade, which primarily addresses protocol rules, while the consensus layer, responsible for block validation, will undergo its own separate fork known as \u201cDeneb.\u201d The term \u201cDencun\u201d is a clever amalgamation of these two simultaneous upgrades.\n\nThe agreement among Ethereum developers on the scope of the Dencun upgrade signifies a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution.\n\nAs the network continues to refine its infrastructure, users, and stakeholders eagerly await the implementation of these improvements, which are expected to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n\nRelated Reading | Binance\u2019s Cosmic Connection: Manta Network Co-Founder\u2019s Journey of Inspiration"

        "title": "Ethereum Success Hinges On Vitalik Buterin's Proposed '3 Transitions' - What Are They? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum, the renowned blockchain platform and brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, faces a crucial crossroad on its path to further growth and adoption.\n\nIn a blog post recently shared by the Ethereum co-founder himself, Buterin highlights the imperative need for three pivotal transitions that Ethereum must undergo in order to ensure its prosperous future.\n\nThese transitions, aptly dubbed \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d revolve around the realms of Layer-2 scaling solutions, the implementation of smart contract wallets, and the augmentation of privacy in fund transfers.\n\nWithout embracing these transformative changes, Buterin says Ethereum risks hindering its own expansion and jeopardizing its position as a frontrunner in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized technologies.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling: Addressing Ethereum\u2019s High Gas Fees\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges faced by the Ethereum network is the issue of exorbitant gas prices, according to Buterin. To tackle this problem head-on, Buterin proposes the adoption of Layer-2 rollups, which offer a promising solution.\n\nBy embracing rollups on a large scale, Ethereum can effectively mitigate the persistently high gas fees that have been a significant deterrent for users.\n\nEven in the current crypto winter, widely considered the harshest downturn in the history of cryptocurrencies, gas fees for Ethereum transactions still hover around $3.\n\nButerin emphasizes the unsustainability of this situation, emphasizing that widespread adoption of Layer-2 solutions is the key to resolving the issue.\n\nNeglecting to do so would inevitably lead users to seek out \u201ccentralized workarounds\u201d that offer more affordable alternatives and are easier to navigate.\n\nWallet Security: Enhancing User Experience And Trust\n\nAccording to Buterin, the lack of improved wallet security creates a barrier to users fully embracing the self-custody of their assets, leading them to seek centralized alternatives like exchanges. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to enhance wallet security measures and provide a user-friendly experience that instills trust.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin highlights the significance of interoperability between wallets and networks. Seamless integration allows for a smoother experience when utilizing cryptocurrencies for day-to-day transactions such as purchasing groceries.\n\nETH market cap currently at $209 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Privacy: Overcoming The Transparency Challenge\n\nThe absence of privacy in individual transactions poses a significant hurdle to Ethereum\u2019s goal of becoming the preferred network for everyday users, according to the developer.\n\nThe lack of confidentiality and the public visibility of transactions can deter individuals from embracing cryptocurrencies in their daily lives.\n\nButerin contends that if transactions are easily traceable and linked to users, people would be reluctant to use crypto for everyday activities.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of privacy, he proposes the utilization of stealth addresses as a potential solution. However, he also admits that privacy concerns remain a formidable problem without a readily available remedy.\n\nWhile Buterin recognizes the significance of privacy, finding a comprehensive and practical solution is a complex challenge.\n\nEthereum, like many other blockchain networks, grapples with balancing transparency and security with the need for individual privacy.\n\nResolving this issue requires ongoing research, development, and collaboration to ensure that privacy concerns are adequately addressed within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Cryptonomist"

        "content": "Stellar Foundation makes a compelling case for Soroban, and why it should be prioritized similarly to platforms such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nThe Soroban smart contract is attempting to compete with Ethereum as it caters to a wider audience despite being a newbie on the market.\n\nSoroban, according to Stellar\u2019s definition, is a developer-friendly Rust-based smart contracts platform. The smart contract was not only designed for sensibility but also for scalability. The smart contract is already live on a test network known as Futurent. It also integrates with and works alongside the Stellar blockchain network. designed for scale and sensibility.\n\nIn a recent blogpost, Stellar has detailed multiple reasons why the smart contract should hold as much importance as the likes of Ethereum and Solana, despite their popularity and larger adoption levels. When it comes to the best platform for specific use cases, that also supports a specific goal and value, Stellar wants the ecosystem to consider Sobran for a variety of reasons.\n\nAlthough Stellar maintains that Soboran might not be the answer for every smart contract developer or entrepreneur, the foundation is certain that the smart contract is a compelling choice to consider when looking to build a blockchain-based project. The blogpost read.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious tech differences. Ethereum uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime environment, and contracts are built using the Solidity programming language (for the most part, you can also use Vyper or Yul), while Soroban uses the WebAssembly (WASM) runtime environment and supports contracts written in a broader range of languages such as Rust, C, C++, Go, AssemblyScript, and more.\n\nSoroban seeks to disrupt the real-world and fintech finance ecosystem\n\nAdditionally, it was revealed that its mission since conception, has been centered around bringing financial access to everyone across the globe. This inclusive approach is one that Soroban also follows. While EVM was created mainly for the Ethereum blockchain, WASM was created for broader interoperability. This makes it possible for WASM to be utilized in many different environments like web browsers, server-side applications, and other blockchain platforms. The blog spot further added.\n\nThe same interoperability distinction can be applied to Solidity versus Rust. Solidity was explicitly designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, while Rust is a general-purpose programming language that, while great for smart contract development, can also be used for web development, systems programming, and more.\n\nAsides from being an inclusive technology, the Soroban smart contract also serves the greenfield ecosystem and the real-world tech ecosystem.\n\nEthereum currently boasts a large number of assets on the network, along with many fiat-backed stablecoins. It is however worth noting that the stablecoins on the network are backed by popular fiat currencies and CBDCs. Stellar on the other hand is more focused on worldwide reach with a more expansive range of fiat-backed stablecoins such as Circle\u2019s USDC and Euro Tempo (EURT) issued by Tempo.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Per the paper report, Ethereum must ensure the availability of these features; transition to roll-ups (layer-2), Smart contract wallets, and privacy-oriented measures to ensure it maintains its position at the top of blockchain technology.\n\nThe article highlighted how the transition to roll-ups would be significant in Ethereum\u2019s growth, noting that it will provide substantial scaling support to empower Ethereum.\n\nAlso, Smart contract wallets got emphasized in the article. Smart contract wallets are viable options for resolving security problems. Per the report paper, deploying privacy-oriented standards could help solve investors\u2019 privacy concerns.\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu Team Member Releases Latest Update Regarding Shibarium Launch: Details\n\nHow Far Has Shiba Inu Gone In Addressing These Issues\n\nKusama\u2019s reaction to Buterin\u2019s article indicates that Shiba Inu already made provisions to solve these problems. The most notable anticipated solution is the Shibarium, the upcoming layer-2 network for Shiba Inu.\n\nScalability experienced in Ethereum appears solved due to Shibarium\u2019s unique nature. The Layer-2 network could double as a second layer for layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, taking some workloads off the layer-1 blockchain.\n\n<\n\nIn addition, Shibarium promises users top-notch security features by integrating proof-of-stake (PoS) validators and the Plasma framework. In users\u2019 privacy aspect challenges, the incorporation of Bermuda, a privacy-oriented blockchain solution, would likely solve this problem.\n\nThe solutions highlighted above are the possible ways Shibarium could address the challenges highlighted in Buterin\u2019s article; it is yet to be confirmed if Kusama hinted at more efficient measures detailed in drafts of a yet-to-be-released Woofpaper version.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum L2 Network, Arbitrum, Shuts Down for Hours Due to a Bug - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Outages over the blockchain network hampers general activities like transactions and operations over DeFi platforms, and more. The potential reasons for the same vary from a bug, network congestion, failure of update, etc. Out of these reasons, the Layer 2 scaling solution of Ethereum network, Arbitrum, recently got shut down for a couple of hours because of a software bug.\n\nArbitrum network users reportedly witnessed a sudden stop in mainnet transactions on Wednesday, June 7. The halt lasted for about two hours before the operations continued. Soon enough, the initial probe found a software bug behind the hindrance in the regular operations, following \u2018the sequencer\u2019 getting affected.\n\nThe developers team of Arbiturm explained in detail over Twitter about the malfunction in the sequencer, and how the bug did not let the transactions pass to the Ethereum mainnet. The automated function of refilling the wallet belonging to the node with transaction fees in ETH had also stopped. Thus, until the process resumed after a wait of two hours, the settlements piled up in abundance.\n\nIn a short period of inactivity, the activities got hampered over the network. It resulted in 2.2 Billion worth cryptocurrency transactions or movement over the Ethereum scaling network to be stopped. The decentralized applications over the blockchain like Uniswap and GMX also faced similar experiences.\n\nThe sequencer, which is a full node of Arbitrum designated and responsible to carry forward the users\u2019 transactions to Layer 1, was said to be behind the outage over the network. This way the node becomes crucial for the transaction process over the network. One of the two wallets involved in the transaction to send it over Ethereum needs to hold ETH equivalent to transaction fees.\n\nHelping Hand for Ethereum Network\n\nBlockchain research and development company, Off Chain Labs, developed Arbitrum in 2018. The layer 2 scaling solution was aimed to burden-off the heavily loaded with activities off the Ethereum mainnet. Akin to other networks based on rollup systems, the network facilitates off-chain transactions to its users. The scaling solution currently holds total value locked (TVL) worth 2.2 Billion USD.\n\nIts Optimistic Rollup Technology empowers the solution for boosting its transactions across decentralized applications. Arbitrum network primarily collects the transactions together and makes them bundled in batches prior to forwarding it to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe network had been through the Nito upgrade in August, last year. Since the upgrade, it has had outages about eight times lasting from 30 minutes to 2 hours.\n\nUSDC Stablecoin on Arbitrum\n\nStablecoin issuer, Circle, announced the launch of its native USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin on Arbitrum. Following the upgrade, the blockchain network becomes the ninth one to support USDC. The stablecoin will continue its inherent facilities over the new network."
