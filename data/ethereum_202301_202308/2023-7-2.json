        "title": "Solana Co-Founder Says Ethereum Could Be Layer-2 for SOL - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite certain limitations and potential risks, the idea of using Ethereum (ETH) as a layer-2 for the Solana (SOL) blockchain is not as farfetched as it may seem, according to Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Yakovenko took a closer look at how such an integration could take shape, suggesting that the technical collaboration, is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 solutions aim to address scalability issues faced by blockchains like Ethereum, which have experienced congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, promises a blockchain platform capable of efficiently accommodating various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPointing out that these scaling solutions \u201care bridge protocols that provide one-way security,\u201d Yakovenko argues that Ethereum being a layer-2 for Solana would mean that holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to safely exit back to Solana even in cases of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nMaking this setup work would first require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana, according to Yakovenko, as well as submitting a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root for the resulting state\u2014something that would serve as evidence that consensus has been reached among Ethereum validators regarding the state of the network.\n\nFinally, to identify and address possible faults within a bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism will be necessary. Some examples of faults, per Yakovenko, include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship.\n\nLimitations and risks of Solana's ETH-based L2\n\nThe Solana Labs co-founder also highlighted the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration, saying that while it would be safe to hold SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, it will not be safe \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne key risk is the possibility of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representations of Solana assets held on Ethereum could become separated from the consensus fork, resulting in a situation where these assets become effectively worthless.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork. Solana users can get their\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nLending Solana-based USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin from Circle, on Ethereum could lead to a situation where the borrower can withdraw the real USDC on the Solana network, while the lender on Ethereum receives a \"junk token.\"\n\nThis scenario, argues Yakovenko, is similar to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum's Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) would likely remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs), and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges, potentially leading to inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nClobs are ok, AMMs and non flash loan borrow lending protocols are not. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nYakovenko\u2019s proposal came hot on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lamenting about how U.S. regulators are targeting various crypto projects, including Solana, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its recent lawsuit against Binance labeled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory,\u201d Buterin tweeted last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

ETH formed a support base and started a fresh increase above the $1,880 level, outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a clear move above the $1,920 resistance zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,925 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price even traded to a new multi-day high at $1,960 and is currently consolidating gains.\n\nIt is now showing positive signs and might soon continue to rise toward the $2,000 resistance. Ether is now trading above $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that he does not stake all of his Ether (ETH) due to multisignature wallets being \u201ccomplicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nOn the June 29 episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin revealed the \u201cbiggest reason\u201d why he is only staking a small fraction of his ETH. He explained:\n\n\u201cBecause if you stake your ETH, the keys that access it have to be public on a subsystem that is online. For safety, it has to be a Multisig. Multisig for staking is still fairly difficult to set up; it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nButerin speaking on the Bankless podcast on June 29. Source: Bankless\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, took to Twitter on June 30, stating he is \u201cat a loss for words\u201d after hearing Buterin only stakes a small portion of his Ether.\n\nHoskinson added that \u201call\u201d of his Cardano (ADA) is staked.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked.

Trustworthy stakers are much less likely to actually get slashed.\u201d\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, explained there are \u201ccomplex risks\u201d with restaking, and it is important to take a \u201cconstrained approach in building restaking.\u201c\n\n\u201cConstraints being what is really good for the ecosystem, and having constraints on building what new innovation can be unleashed based on this concept,\u201d he stated.\n\nPanelists on the June 29 Bankless podcast episode.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has successfully broken through a key resistance level since it managed to exceed the significant $1,915 price threshold. However, it is not clear what's next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development comes after several unsuccessful attempts to cross this resistance point. The past few weeks have seen Ethereum test this level at least five times, only to face strong selling pressure that has thwarted its upward journey. This persistent struggle around the $1,915 mark only highlights the significance of this breakthrough.\n\nThe successful breach of this resistance level indicates that bulls are firmly in control of Ethereum's market, a positive sign for its near-term price action. This could potentially signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for Ethereum, especially if it manages to maintain its position above this key level.\n\nHowever, there is a need to approach the breakthrough with caution. The breakout occurred toward the end of the week, a period often characterized by lower liquidity in the markets. With fewer trades taking place, price movements can be more volatile and potentially less reflective of broader market sentiment.\n\nTherefore, as we move into a new week, it will be crucial to see whether Ethereum can sustain its position above the $1,915 mark. If it does, this could provide a solid foundation for further gains. If it cannot, Ethereum may be set for another bout of consolidation or possibly even a retest of lower support levels.\n\nRegardless of what happens next, Ethereum's breach of this key resistance level is beneficial for bulls who have been aiming for $2,000 for a long time. Additionally, we shall expect a surge of volatility in the upcoming week, as bulls will try to push Ether to the local high again."

        "title": "[EXPLAINER] How to Check the Status of an Ethereum Transaction - bitcoinke.io",
        "content": "When it comes to the Ethereum blockchain, a transaction is initiated by an external account owner rather than a contract. To illustrate, consider the scenario where User A sends 1 Ether to User B. This action, involving the debiting of funds from one account and crediting them to another, leads to a modification in the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe change brought about by a transaction occurs within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). When an Ethereum transaction is initiated, it must be broadcasted to the entire network. Any node within the network can send a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, various types of transactions exist, each serving a specific purpose. Some of the common types of transactions include:\n\nValue Transfer Transactions: These transactions involve the transfer of Ether ($ETH) or other tokens between Ethereum addresses. Users can send or receive digital currency through these transactions\n\nContract Deployment Transactions: When deploying a smart contract onto the Ethereum blockchain, a contract deployment transaction is used. This transaction includes the necessary code and data to create a new smart contract on the network\n\nContract Interaction Transactions: These transactions are used to interact with existing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can execute specific functions within a contract, providing inputs and receiving outputs as per the contract\u2019s defined behavior\n\nToken Transfer Transactions: Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem supports the creation of various tokens using the ERC-20 or ERC-721 token standards. Token transfer transactions enable the exchange or transfer of these tokens between addresses\n\nContract Calls: Contracts can have functions that perform specific tasks. Contract call transactions invoke these functions, allowing users to interact with the contract\u2019s logic and retrieve information or trigger actions\n\nTransaction Batching: Batching involves combining multiple transactions into a single transaction, reducing the number of individual transactions sent to the network. This can optimize gas costs and improve efficiency by executing multiple actions within a single transaction\n\nStep 1: Select an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer\n\nThere are several Ethereum-focused blockchain explorers available, including:\n\nThese explorers are specifically designed to provide detailed information and insights into the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com and TokenView that support multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum. These explorers offer a broader scope, allowing users to explore and analyze transactions, addresses, and blocks across different blockchain platforms in addition to Ethereum.\n\nStep 2: Enter the Transaction Hash into the Blockchain Explorer\u2019s Search Field\n\nA transaction identifier, commonly referred to as a TxID, serves as a unique identifier associated with a particular transaction. Each transaction conducted on the blockchain, whether it involves on-chain activities or transfers to and from external addresses, is assigned a distinct TxID.\n\nDepending on the platform or wallet being used, the transaction identifier may also be referred to as a \u2018hash\u2019 or \u2018Txn Hash\u2019 which typically appears as an alphanumeric string consisting of random letters and numbers. For instance, on platforms like MetaMask, users can easily view the TxID by navigating to the \u2018Activity\u2019 tab and selecting the specific transaction of interest.\n\nIn addition to the transaction identifier (TxID or Hash), traders can utilize their public address to access an overview of their wallet activities. A public address is a string of 42 characters that corresponds to their public Ethereum account. This provides them with the ability to independently navigate to specific transactions within their wallet and obtain a comprehensive view of their transactional activities and associated details.\n\nStep 3: Click the Icon for \u2018Search\u2019 or \u2018Enter\u2019 on the Blockchain Explorer\n\nEntering a public address reveals the address\u2019 information, balances, and transfers.\n\nStep 4: Check if the Transaction was Successful or Not\n\nTo determine the success of an Ethereum transaction, you can rely on the information provided by a blockchain explorer. By searching for the transaction\u2019s details on a blockchain explorer, you will find indicators that reflect the state of the transaction.\n\nIf the transaction has been successfully validated and added to the blockchain, it will typically be labeled as \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018successful.\u2019\n\nOn Etherscan, successful transactions are marked with a green button and a check button that says \u2018Success.\u2019\n\nIn the absence of any error messages or indications of issues, it is generally safe to assume that the transaction has been successfully completed. Once a transaction has been validated and confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain, the Ether ($ETH) should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24hrs.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Takes On $2,000 \u2013 Is This The Bullish Escape To $5,000? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is doubling down its bullish efforts after reclaiming support at $1,900 and extending the leg to $1,950. The second largest smart contracts token, powered by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is up 1.6% on the day and trading at $1,945 on Monday.\n\nBitcoin price is also slightly in the green with 0.5% in accrued gains over the last 24 hours and doddering at $30,660. As analyzed earlier, BTC is poised for a massive breakout to $35,000 and $38,000, but first, the resistance between $31,000 and $32,000 must come out of the way.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum boasts approximately $8 billion in its 24-hour trading volume and a market cap of $234 billion. Its immediate downside is protected by the recently reclaimed ascending trendline support, but if declines intensify, it would be prudent for investors to anticipate a minor and brief retracement to stronger support at $1,800 and $1,650, respectively.\n\nHow Will Investors React To Ethereum Price Lifting Above $2,000?\n\nThe sudden interest in the crypto market by institutional investors like Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and Cathie Wood was a substantial boost for the crypto market in June.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s decision to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF has, within a few weeks, encouraged other players like Cathie Wood and Fidelity to cast their nets with the hope of operating a similar product in the US.\n\nMarket participants believe Blackrock has a higher chance of getting the coveted approval, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has managed to avoid for several years, citing market volatility and manipulation, among other bottlenecks.\n\nAs more institutional investors stream into the market, major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are bound to react positively. Retail investors also see this as a signal that the market is on an upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum\u2019s sturdiness from support at $1,650 can mainly be attributed to the rise in interest from institutional and retail investors combined.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that with Ethereum holding above $1,900 and particularly on top of the dotted rising trendline, the path with the least resistance gradually turns to the upside. That said, the anticipated breakout above $2,000 is, at the time of writing, a matter of when and not if.\n\nEvaluating Ethereum Price Bullish Outlook\n\nTwo indicators affirm the bullish outlook for Ethereum price, starting with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. This call to buy Ether triggered on June 20, has managed to keep investor interest intact, but resistance at $2,000 is the biggest stumbling block, at least for now.\n\nA second bullish signal emanates from the SuperTrend indicator, which like the MACD, flipped in support of an Ethereum uptrend on June 20. Like a moving average, this indicator overlays the chart, but it also integrates readings from the true average range (ATR) to gauge the volatility in the market.\n\nAs long as the SuperTrend is trailing Ethereum price, recovery to $2,000 will remain steady. Traders may want to confirm ETH closes the day above the dotted trendline and the buyer congestion at $1,900 to validate the expected breakout beyond the psychological resistance.\n\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) could suddenly be the driving force for Ethereum price targeting the ultimate move to $3,000 and subsequently climbing to the all-time high of $4,878.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko believed that Ethereum (ETH) can act as a layer-2 network for the SOL blockchain. Yakovenko took to Twitter to express his views on the possibility. According to Yakovenko, the collaboration is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW July 2, 2023\n\nLayer-2 solutions try to solve the scalability problems that blockchains often face. Despite its popularity, Ethereum has seen congestion and high transaction costs when there has been a spike in activity. On the other hand, Solana is famous for its high throughput and cheaper transactions.\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, if Ethereum (ETH) becomes a layer-2 for Solana (SOL), SOL assets on the ETH blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to exit back to Solana safely. This would happen even in the face of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nYakovenko mentioned that making the setup work will require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana. In addition, it will need to submit a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root. This will demonstrate that the network\u2019s current state has been agreed upon by all Ethereum validators. Finally, a bridge timeout mechanism will be required to detect and correct potential protocol flaws.\n\nYakovenko also emphasized the restrictions and possible dangers connected to this integration. It would be secured to store SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, but it would not be secure \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin speaks on Solana\n\nYakovenko\u2019s tweet about ETH being a potential layer-2 for SOL follows Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s comment about SOL\u2019s current predicament. Buterin expressed displeasure with the way U.S. officials are going after cryptocurrency initiatives like Solana.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Reveals His ETH Staking Strategy\n\nAccording to Buterin, the real competition is the \u201crapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak,\u201d and not other chains. Buterin took to Twitter and said that \u201cI feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way.\u201d\n\nThe one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don't deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \"winning\" through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that's not an honorable way to win, and in the long term\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2023\n\nSolana (SOL) has had a series of hard times, especially after the collapse of FTX. FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried had a lot riding on SOL, and the exchange\u2019s collapse left a heavy blow on the project. Many developers left the SOL network to join rival chains. However, the project has since made a healthy recovery, despite the ongoing crackdown on crypto projects in the U.S. At press time, SOL was trading at $19.33, up by 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Mark Cuban Gets into Heated Debate With SEC Official Over Crypto Regulation"

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed solidarity with Solana, a rival blockchain project.\n\nThe once touted \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d Solana, has seen a rough spot. However, it is just one of many projects facing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto crackdown.\n\nVitalik Buterin: \u201cI Feel Bad for Solana\u201d\n\nIn a recent Twitter AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his views on the recent regulatory shift in crypto.

However, Buterin explained that he doesn\u2019t see Solana as a competitor.\n\n\u201cThe real competition is not other chains,\u201d Buterin elaborated. \u201cIt\u2019s the rapidly expanding centralized world imposing itself on us as we speak.\u201d\n\nSEC\u2019s Case Against Binance: Implications for Solana\n\nIn a sweeping lawsuit against Binance, the SEC named several cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), securities. This development has significant implications for these digital assets and their respective blockchain platforms.\n\nThe June 5 SEC\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Binance has been selling unregistered securities in the US. According to the SEC lawsuit, these include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and others.\n\nThe classification of these cryptocurrencies as securities could have far-reaching implications. For instance, if the SEC\u2019s allegations are upheld, these digital assets could be subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including registration and disclosure obligations.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOnce hailed as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d Solana has faced an existential crisis since the FTX crash of November 2022. Solana was one of the projects with major exposure to FTX, an investor in Solana.\n\nDespite the regulatory woes, Solana is seeing increased adoption in some segments. The week ending on Sunday, July 2, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily NFT sales.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nButerin\u2019s endorsements signal that the crypto community is closing ranks against what they see as regulatory attacks against the industry.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s regulatory woes:\n\nSEC v.

        "content": "Controversy emerged in the cryptocurrency community as Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed his cautious stance towards staking his Ether (ETH) holdings.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin explained his decision, citing the complications surrounding multi-signature wallets as the primary reason. This revelation left many, including Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, at a loss for words.\n\nDuring the podcast, Buterin also discussed the EigenLayer protocol, an innovative concept that allows validators and stakers to re-stake their assets on emerging networks. However, Buterin raised concerns about potential centralization risks associated with the protocol, emphasizing the need for a constrained approach to its development.\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, echoed Buterin\u2019s sentiments, acknowledging the complex risks involved in restaking. Kaanan stressed the importance of maintaining constraints to safeguard the ecosystem and prevent any potential negative consequences of this novel concept.\n\nThis news comes in the wake of Buterin\u2019s earlier statement regarding the shortcomings of the Ethereum blockchain without adequate scaling infrastructure. Buterin underlined the necessity of affordable transactions and highlighted the challenges posed by smart contract wallets, which can create user experience complexities when managing multiple addresses simultaneously.\n\nButerin\u2019s measured approach to staking and his insights into potential risks associated with new protocols have sparked a lively debate within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Raises Concerns Over SEC and Solana\n\nWhile some praise his prudent outlook, others express concerns about the impact on Ethereum\u2019s progress.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Thinks The Over $40 Billion Staked ETH Can Be Stolen - NewsBTC",
        "content": "It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn\u2019t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions.\n\nVitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking\n\nButerin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution.\n\nIn a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet\u2019s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds.\n\nDuring the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains:\n\nProbably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I\u2019m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that\u2019s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\n\nETH Prices Stable Below $2,000\n\nHis remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was \u201clost for words,\u201d clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a \u201cproperly designed proof-of-stake system.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren\u2019t affected by Buterin\u2019s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin's rally continued on Monday as the coin jumped back above $31,000 for the second time over the past week. The largest digital asset by market cap was trading for $31,052 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThat's a 1.8% 24-hour jump. The asset is also up over 2% in the past seven days, with a 17% gain over the past 14 days.\n\nBitcoin first broke past $31,000\u2014for the first time in over one year\u2014two weeks ago thanks in part to renewed institutional investor interest. A high-profile Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from BlackRock and the launch of a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets were among the triggers, according to experts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin dropped below that mark in recent days and was holding firmly above $30,000 per coin aside from a brief dip on Friday. But the price is now comfortably above $31,000 again.\n\nInvestment firm CoinShares said on Monday that institutional investors are continuing to plug money into digital asset products, with $125 million worth of inflows over the past week. And most of that money is focused on Bitcoin, it added.\n\nThis week in Fund Flows, by CoinShares Head of Research @jbutterfill:\n\nBullishness on crypto among investors continues, with US$125m inflows in digital asset investment products. \ud83e\uddf5 (1/5) pic.twitter.com/rX6KZrSOgm \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) July 3, 2023\n\nInstitutional investors are interested in the digital asset market because major Wall Street firms like BlackRock\u2014the world's largest asset manager\u2014and Fidelity have applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors to buy shares that track the price of an asset, does not yet exist in the U.S. However, the flurry of applications potentially show that traditional investors are hungry for such a product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe largest digital asset by market cap isn't the only cryptocurrency up today: Ethereum, the second largest, is fast closing in on $2,000 per coin, CoinGecko data shows. It is right now trading for $1,961, a 2.3% climb over the last 24 hours.\n\nIf it hits $2,000, it will be the first time since May that the coin topped that mark. Ethereum remains down nearly 60% from its peak price of $4,878 from November 2021, according to CoinGecko, while Bitcoin is down 55% from its own all-time high from the same month.\n\nAnd Pepe, a newer meme coin which launched in April, is one of the best-performing digital assets today: it is up 16.7% in the past day and 15.1% in the past week, trading hands for $0.00000182.\n\nThe asset has surged in value since its launch\u2014with one lucky investor managing to turn $250 into $1.02 million worth of the cryptocurrency in just four days amid its initial spike. However, Pepe has shed about 58% of its value since its April peak."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks the over $40 Billion Staked ETH can be Stolen - Tekedia",
        "content": "In a recent Podcast, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his concerns about the security of the Ethereum 2.0 network, which is currently in the process of transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. PoS is supposed to make the network more scalable, energy-efficient and decentralized, but it also introduces new risks and challenges.\n\nOne of the main issues that Buterin highlighted is the possibility of a large-scale theft of the staked ETH, which are the tokens that validators lock up in order to participate in the network and earn rewards. According to Buterin, there are two scenarios in which this could happen: a software bug or a malicious attack.\n\nA software bug could occur if there is a flaw in the code of the Ethereum 2.0 client software, which is responsible for running the nodes and validating the transactions. If such a bug is exploited, it could allow an attacker to steal or manipulate the staked ETH of other validators, or even cause the network to fork or halt. Buterin said that this is a \u201clow-probability but high-impact\u201d event, and that the developers are working hard to ensure that the code is as secure and bug-free as possible.\n\nA malicious attack could occur if a large enough group of validators colludes to take over the network and censor or revert transactions. This is known as a \u201c51% attack\u201d, and it is theoretically possible in any blockchain network. However, Buterin argued that this is more likely to happen in PoS than in PoW, because PoS makes it easier and cheaper for validators to acquire a majority stake in the network. He said that this is a \u201chigh-probability but low-impact\u201d event, and that the network has built-in mechanisms to deter and punish such behavior.\n\nButerin estimated that the total value of the staked ETH on Ethereum 2.0 is currently over $40 billion, making it a very attractive target for hackers and attackers. He said that this is one of the reasons why he is not staking his own ETH on the network, and that he prefers to keep his tokens in cold storage. He also advised other users to be careful and vigilant when staking their ETH, and to use reputable and trustworthy staking services or platforms.\n\nButerin concluded by saying that he is optimistic about the future of Ethereum 2.0, and that he believes that the benefits of PoS outweigh the risks. He said that he expects the network to become more secure, stable and efficient over time, as more validators join and more features are implemented. He also said that he hopes that Ethereum 2.0 will inspire other blockchain projects to adopt PoS and contribute to the innovation and growth of the crypto space.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "There are strata within the crypto market, with the peak being \u201cblue chip tokens.\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fit into this category, with the latter predicted to offer even more returns in 2023. Alongside Ethereum (ETH), another emerging crypto to watch out for is InQubeta (QUBE). InQubeta leverages blockchain technology and intersects with AI, the two most disruptive technologies and fastest-growing industries in the world. Consequently, it has been touted as an investment opportunity to offer high returns in 2023, alongside Ethereum (ETH).\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The utility token with immense growth potential\n\nInQubeta has something for everyone, whether they are adopters or investors. As the world\u2019s first decentralized crowdfunding platform for AI startups, adopters in the form of AI developers can raise funds through its platform, while investors can invest in promising projects by purchasing stakes in them. On the other hand, its utility coin, QUBE, has significant growth potential and has been predicted to soar after launch. This makes its deflationary token a great investment opportunity for investors.\n\nWith its novel marketplace, AI startups will be able to mint investment opportunities and offer them on the marketplace to collect funding for their projects. Meanwhile, investors can buy equity-based NFTs, which provides them with a stake in startups and the profits that come from their success. InQubeta\u2019s fractional investment approach allows for partial investments in companies and eliminates buy limits, allowing investors to pick their level of commitment.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s native token, QUBE, will be vital to the ecosystem and will soar 30x after its launch, according to analysts and experts. Aside from its enormous potential growth, QUBE also provides holders with other incentives such as staking rewards and voting rights.\n\nWith the presale still ongoing and currently in stage 1, early adopters have ample opportunity to purchase the token at a cheap price. A QUBE token currently costs $0.00875, which is a great entry point as it is poised to skyrocket.

It is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world and a blue-chip token. Through Ethereum (ETH), decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts can be deployed, making it crucial to the crypto and blockchain ecosystems.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has experienced a steady increase this year since its opening price of $1,196 on January 1. Although a long way from its all-time high of $4,891 recorded on November 16, 2021, Ethereum (ETH) has been in an uptrend in 2023 to reclaim old prices. With its current bullish momentum, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to break the $2,000 resistance. This makes Ethereum (ETH) a token to look out for in 2023, as its bullish indicators are strong and its return on investment promises to be high.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum (ETH) is integral to the crypto and blockchain ecosystems, meaning it will soar over time. Riding this bullish wave will be InQubeta, an innovative idea that cuts across crypto, blockchain, and AI. Its utility coin, QUBE, is poised to skyrocket, making it one to look out for in 2023 alongside Ethereum (ETH).

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs has announced plans to introduce Layer 2 (L2) interoperability for its ENS domains during a community call on June 28.\n\nThe implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains.\n\nThe decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase\u2019 cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.\n\nAccording to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.\n\nENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.\n\nWhile .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS\u2019 annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal.\n\nThe daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.\n\nThis development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Canada Approves Etherium ETF. What Does That Mean? - Money.ca",
        "content": "In this article\n\nWhat are the 3 new Ether ETFs on the TSX?\n\nThe three Ether ETFs debuting on the Toronto Stock Exchange on April 20, 2021 are:\n\nComparing Ehter ETFs Name Ticker Management Fee Purpose Ether ETF ETHH 1.00% CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF ETHX 0% until June 15,0.40% thereafter Evolve Ether ETF ETHR 0% until May 31,0.75% thereafter\n\nThe ETF providers offer the Ether ETFs in both CAD and USD, as well as hedged or unhedged.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain software that has many applications but is most commonly known for its currency, Ether. The terms \u201cEther\u201d and \u201cEthereum\u201d are often used interchangeably to describe the cryptocurrency (you\u2019ll see me refer to both in this article, too), but they are technically different things.\n\nEthereum is a technology that enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications to run quickly and without any interference from third parties. It\u2019s very secure and prevents any kind of fraud or forgery, making it useful for many applications across all industries, including finance, medicine, art, and sports. The \u201cgas\u201d that powers these transactions on the Ethereum network is the currency, Ether.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin\n\nEthereum has the second-largest market cap in the cryptocurrency marketplace, right behind Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has gotten most of the attention in the media, there are other cryptocurrencies worth considering. Not only that, but compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum likely has the most long-term potential.\n\nCryptocurrency feels very new, but at the rate new computer technology develops, Bitcoin\u2019s 2009 birthday makes it an old-timer. Ethereum launched in 2015 with much faster, and less resource-demanding technology than its Bitcoin predecessor. Furthermore, because Ethereum can be used for more than just currency, it has more applications than Bitcoin.\n\nFor anyone interested in more than just the financial impact of new technology, Ethereum is an ideal investment.\n\nWhat is the Ether ETF?\n\nThe Ether ETF is an ETF that lets you invest directly into the popular cryptocurrency, Ether. Instead of buying full or partial Ether coins on a cryptocurrency exchange, you buy shares of an ETF on the stock market from an ETF provider that is investing directly in the currency.\n\nEther ETFs make investing in Ethereum more convenient and secure. Investors who find using a cryptocurrency exchange and digital wallets intimidating or lacking security can rely on the ETF providers and the trusted security of their brokerage accounts to invest in crypto. For both the Purpose and Evolve ETFs, Gemini will hold the underlying Ether in cold storage. CI Global Asset Management will rely on Galaxy Digital.\n\nEthereum ETF performance\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is brand new to the stock market, so it has no price history yet. However, Ethereum as a cryptocurrency has been trading since 2015. It debuted at only a few cents per coin and now is worth over $2,000 per coin. Year to date, Ethereum has returned over 190% to investors and there\u2019s still more to be had!\n\nI\u2019ve personally been investing in Ethereum as long as I\u2019ve been investing in Bitcoin. In fact, I\u2019ve always thought Ethereum technology to be superior to that of Bitcoin because it has more applications than just currency. Often I split all my cryptocurrency investments, allocating 50% of my cash to Bitcoin and 50% to Ethereum.\n\nLike with Bitcoin, I\u2019m bullish on the long-term potential of Ethereum, and think it\u2019s a great financial investment. The Ethereum ETFs are a perfect way for new investors to gain financial exposure to cryptocurrency.\n\nHow does this affect investing in Crypto?\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is yet another signal that cryptocurrency is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate investment. As more cryptocurrency ETFs appear on the stock market, more retail and institutional investors alike are taking positions in crypto.\n\nWhere cryptocurrency has historically been a speculative asset, it continues to become more mainstream as people recognize its value and utility. Ethereum is in an even better position than Bitcoin, because it\u2019s less environmentally destructive to mine, and it can be used for many things. For example, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that recently took the world by storm are on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts for ownership of digital and physical assets are just one of the many applications of Ethereum.\n\nBy legitimizing and accepting Ethereum by making it a financial asset that can be accessed via the traditional stock market, we are making blockchain even more a part of our daily lives. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are here to stay, and now is a great time to get started investing.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Canadian investor?\n\nNot only does the Ethereum ETF make it easier than ever for Canadians to invest in Ethereum, but it also provides a unique opportunity to tax-shelter this crypto coin.\n\nBecause cryptocurrency typically trades on cryptocurrency exchanges, which are unregulated and uninsured, Canadians cannot open tax-sheltered accounts like the TFSA or RRSP on these platforms. However, you can open brokerage accounts under the TFSA or RRSP umbrella. Now that the cryptocurrency ETFs are available on the stock market, you can purchase these shares inside of registered accounts. This is a roundabout, but totally effective, way to tax-shelter your cryptocurrency gains.\n\nHow to invest in the Ethereum ETF, step-by-step\n\nThe Ethereum ETFs are trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, so you can buy shares through a brokerage account you\u2019re already using or through an online brokerage. There is no need to set up an account at a cryptocurrency exchange, everything you need is available on the trading platform you use. Here\u2019s how to get started investing:\n\nStep 1: Log on to your brokerage trading platform during market hours\n\nLog on to your brokerage trading platform during market hours Step 2: Look up the ticker of the Ethereum ETF you\u2019re interested in investing in on the Toronto Stock Exchange\n\nLook up the ticker of the Ethereum ETF you\u2019re interested in investing in on the Toronto Stock Exchange Step 3: Select the number of shares you want to purchase\n\nSelect the number of shares you want to purchase Step 4: Click \u201cBuy\u201d and that\u2019s it, you\u2019re now invested in an Ethereum ETF!\n\nPros & cons\n\nThere are plenty of benefits a few downsides to investing in an Ethereum ETF. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\nSafe and secure. Purchasing Ethereum ETF shares on your brokerage account is safer and more secure than buying Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange\n\nPurchasing Ethereum ETF shares on your brokerage account is safer and more secure than buying Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange Accessible. You can buy and sell shares of an Ethereum ETF on the stock market, just as you do any other stock or ETF\n\nYou can buy and sell shares of an Ethereum ETF on the stock market, just as you do any other stock or ETF Tax-Sheltered.

The Ethereum ETF only gives you financial exposure to Ethereum, you cannot transfer your coins to a digital wallet or use them as currency to make purchases\n\nThe Ethereum ETF only gives you financial exposure to Ethereum, you cannot transfer your coins to a digital wallet or use them as currency to make purchases Can only trade during stock market hours. Because the cryptocurrency market is unregulated, trading never stops. However, the Toronto Stock Exchange is only open weekdays, during regular business hours. You are not able to trade the Ether ETFs outside of the regular hours of the TSX\n\nShould you invest in the Ethereum ETF?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been hesitating about investing in cryptocurrency, or are already invested in the Bitcoin ETF and looking to diversify your exposure to cryptocurrency, an Ethereum ETF is a great choice. It\u2019s perfect for anyone who knows that having some exposure to cryptocurrency is important but isn\u2019t sure how to get started because they only have experience with the traditional stock market.\n\nHowever, if you currently have no investments of any kind yet, you\u2019re better off starting your investment journey with more traditional ETFs, like index funds of the global stock and bond markets. The cryptocurrency ETFs will still be there when you\u2019re ready to diversify!\n\nFinal word\n\nThe Ether ETFs are an exciting new addition to the Canadian financial markets and a wonderful way for retail investors to begin to build a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. The future applications of Ethereum make the ETFs exceptionally attractive investments, and anyone bullish on new technology and the growing asset class of cryptocurrency should definitely consider investing!\n\nRecommended reads:"

        "content": "Amid the broader market rally, the price of Ethereum (ETH) saw notable gains in recent weeks as crypto investors moved to capitalize on the ongoing hype around institutional adoption.\n\nTo obtain further insights on ETH\u2019s possible price action in the short run as the second largest asset by market cap looks to reclaim the crucial $2,000 price level, Finbold analyzed the predictions by the machine learning algorithm over on the crypto monitoring and prediction platform PricePredictions on July 3 to gauge insight into where it will trade by the end of the month.\n\nNotably, the algorithm expects Ethereum to be $2,105 on July 31, 2023, which, if materialized, would represent a price surge of more than 7% from its price at the time of publication.\n\nEthereum price prediction for July 31. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe projection relies on several widely-used technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), and more.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,965, up 2.58% in the past 24 hours.\n\nNotably, the cryptocurrency gained more than 3.2% over the past month and has witnessed 15 green days during that period.\n\nETH 1-month price chart.

If the cryptocurrency breaks through this wall, a jump toward $2,330 or even $2,750 can be expected.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "In a recent exchange with Matt Huang, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Paradigm, a crypto-focused venture capital firm, Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin expressed his concerns over the U.S. policy approach to cryptocurrency. His comments came in the wake of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s allegations against Binance and Coinbase include offering unregistered securities to the public. The lawsuits have also cast a shadow over several other tokens, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), BNB (BNB), Voyager Token (VGX), Chiliz (CHZ), NEAR protocol (NEAR), Flow (FLOW), Dash (DASH), NEXO (NEXO), and Internet Computer (ICP).\n\nThese allegations have left the status of these tokens in a state of uncertainty, creating risks for markets and participants transacting in these tokens, as well as potentially for their creators. This was highlighted by Jesse Overall and Steve Gatti, attorneys at the UK-based law firm Clifford Chance, in a recent conversation with CoinDesk.\n\nIn this context, Buterin\u2019s comments reflect a sense of solidarity with other blockchain projects, particularly Solana. He expressed regret that Solana and other projects are being targeted in this manner, stating, \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s comments underscore the fact that the real competition for blockchain projects is not each other but the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on the decentralized space. He concluded his remarks by wishing all \u201chonorable projects\u201d a fair outcome in the ongoing situation."

        "content": "Buterin was born in Kolomna, Russia in 1994. He became world famous after his invention of Etherum with the other founders, and he described it in a white paper in November 2013.\n\nLater, on 26 January 2014, he described Ethereum more publicly in a speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Miami. He stated his views on the Ethereum Project by expressing his thankfulness to work with prominent cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists.\n\nEthereum is popular for its variety of uses, such as staking, DeFi, and investing. Vitalik Buterin holds over 240,000 ETH at his address, which is nearly $400 Million.\n\nJourney of Vitalik Buterin before Inventing Ethereum\n\nVitalik\u2019s father, Dmitry, is a computer scientist. Vitalik lived in Russia till the age of six, and then moved to Canada where he was placed in the class of gifted children in the 3rd standard. He was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics. He attended high school in Toronto, and learned about Bitcoin at the age of 17 from his father.\n\nAfter completing his schooling, he attended the University of Waterloo where he took advanced courses, and was the research assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg, who co-created Off the Record Messaging . In 2012, for Informatics he won a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Italy.\n\nIn 2013, to share his excitement and knowledge about the code he visited developers in other countries. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum. He went to work on Ethereum full time in 2014 after dropping out of the university. On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel.\n\nIn 2011, he started writing for a publication, Bitcoin Weekly, where the owner offered five bitcoins to anyone who would write an article for him. He continued writing till the site was closed due to insufficient revenue. Later in the same year, in September, he was hired as a co-founder and writer for Bitcoin Magazine. In 2012, it came to print edition, fully dedicated to cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2018, his father suggested that Buterin shift his attention to research. Buterin stated he realized the horrors centralized services can bring and soon decided to quit.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Association with Other Open Source Projects\n\nVitalik Buterin is the CMO at ERCSwap, Founder and Developer at Tokeneo and Founder and Inventor at Ethereum Foundation. ERCSwap was founded on May 9, 2022. It is an open source trusted peer to peer NFT trading and swap system, and part of the Ethereum Foundation. The Tokeneo community owns 90% of the Ethereum based TEO tokens.\n\nAs a developer, Vitalik has also contributed to open source software projects such as DarkWallet by Dody Wilson, Bitcoin Python libraries and cryptocurrency marketplace site Egora.\n\nIn a recent AMA session, he has described his least favorite aspect of cryptocurrency. Replying to David Hoffman in the session he said he faced disappointment in those who perceive the main innovation of cryptocurrency to be merely tokenization. Buterin also suggested ways to create amity between Ethereum and Bitcoin supporters.\n\nAnother sparkling news is how Elon Musk started following Vitalik Buterin on Twitter, and this forms the base to speculations about potential collaborations. He also tweeted the word Ethereum in April 2019. Buterin then extended an invitation to Musk to attend a conference. Musk responded to the query about potential developments on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Current Statistics\n\nThe market cap of Ethereum is up by 1.86% and it is currently at $226B. Its volume is up by 19.35% at $7B. It has a circulating supply of 120,220,157.47 ETH.\n\nAs per coinmarketcap chart on July 1, 2022 the number of whales are 26.5M, investors are 21.8M, and retail of 70.5M which has risen to 34.3M whales, 17.0M investors, and 70.7M retail on 28th June 2023.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nSummary\n\nVitalik Buterin said he wants to expand Ethereum, by undergoing three major changes on Ethereum i.e., better privacy measures, scaling solutions, and secure wallets."

Even in the event of a double spend or an invalid state transition on Ethereum, users can retrieve their SOL assets securely. However, three key components are necessary to make Ethereum an L2 protocol for Solana.\n\nSubmitting Ethereum Transactions to Solana: To enable secure interoperability, all Ethereum transactions must be submitted to the SOL blockchain, making the necessary transaction data accessible to Solana\u2019s network.\n\nSPV Root for Resulting State: A Simplicity Payment Verification (SPV) root, representing the agreed-upon state root, would need to be submitted as proof of Ethereum consensus signatures aligning on a specific state root. This enables validators to reach a consensus on the Ethereum state.\n\nBridge Timeout for Fault Resolution: A bridge timeout mechanism would be required to identify and address faults within the bridge protocol. These faults could include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship. The timeout mechanism would facilitate effective fault resolution.\n\nWhile the proposal offers a way to secure Solana assets on Ethereum, it is essential to understand the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration. Yakovenko emphasizes that holding assets on Ethereum would be safe, but it would not be advisable to lend or maintain positions against them.\n\nIn the event of an Ethereum fault, Solana assets held on Ethereum would become separated from the Ethereum social consensus fork, rendering the representations of these assets worthless. If someone lent Solana USDC on Ethereum, the borrower could withdraw the USDC on Solana. The lender would receive a valueless token. This situation resembles holding USDC on Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work chain.\n\nYakovenko further notes that while central limit order books (CLOBs) would remain functional in this setup, automated market makers (AMMs) and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols would encounter limitations.\n\nResponding to a question about Ethereum\u2019s consideration of becoming an L2, Yakovenko suggests that this is a permissionless bridge protocol, implying that Ethereum does not need to consider this integration explicitly. He states, \u201cThis is a permissionless bridge protocol. Eth doesn\u2019t need to consider anything.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, Yakovenko\u2019s contemplation of Ethereum as an L2 protocol has sparked discussions about the possibilities and challenges of such an integration. While the proposal offers a means to secure Solana assets on Ethereum and enhance interoperability, it does come with certain limitations and risks.\n\nRelated Reading: | Ethereum Founder Expresses Sorrow Over SOL Situation"

        "content": "Solana Co-Founder envisions Ethereum as a potential layer-2 solution for SOL, highlighting the feasibility of the integration\n\nIntegration would provide SOL asset holders on Ethereum with finality guarantees and secure exit options back to Solana.\n\nIntegration may have implications for DeFi protocols, with potential limitations and challenges for AMMs and non-flash loan borrowing and lending.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, has sparked interest by suggesting that Ethereum (ETH) could serve as a layer-2 solution for the Solana (SOL) blockchain. Despite the concept initially appearing ambitious, Yakovenko highlights its feasibility and potential benefits.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets, Yakovenko delved into the intricacies of integrating Ethereum as a layer-2 solution for Solana. He revealed that the technical collaboration between the two platforms is more plausible than commonly perceived.\n\nLayer-2 solutions tackle scalability challenges faced by blockchains such as Ethereum, which often suffer from congestion and high transaction fees during peak activity. Solana, renowned for its exceptional throughput and cost-efficiency, offers an ideal ecosystem for diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nYakovenko emphasized the significance of layer-2 solutions as bridge protocols that provide one-way security. Should Ethereum become a layer-2 for Solana, holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would enjoy the assurance of \u201cfinality guarantees.\u201d This means they could confidently transition back to Solana, even in scenarios involving transaction double spends or invalid state transitions.\n\nSuccessful implementation of this arrangement would involve Yakovenko\u2019s proposal to submit all Ethereum transactions to Solana. Additionally, a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root would need to be submitted, serving as evidence of consensus among Ethereum validators regarding the network\u2019s state.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism would be essential in detecting and resolving potential faults.

While holding SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain is deemed safe, Yakovenko warns against lending or maintaining positions against them.\n\nOne significant risk is the potential occurrence of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representation of Solana assets held on Ethereum may become disconnected from the consensus fork, rendering these assets effectively worthless.\n\nYakovenko draws parallels to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes. Lending Solana-based USDC on Ethereum could lead to a situation where borrowers can withdraw real USDC on the Solana network, while lenders on Ethereum receive \u201cjunk tokens.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) are expected to remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs) and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges. This could potentially result in inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them.

The recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance categorized Solana as unregistered securities.\n\nExpressing his disappointment, Buterin took to Twitter last week, stating that such projects do not deserve regulatory crackdowns. He emphasized that if Ethereum were to \u201cwin\u201d by default, due to other blockchains being removed from exchanges, it would not be an honorable victory and might not even be considered a true triumph in the long run.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends Trading Masterclass"

        "title": "Comparing the Best ZK Rollups Projects on Ethereum - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2018s blockchain, while revolutionary, has encountered significant scaling challenges due to its growing popularity. However, innovative solutions like ZK-Rollups are now making it possible for Ethereum to handle more transactions per second, reduce gas fees, and improve overall scalability.\n\nThis article delves into some of the most exciting projects utilizing ZK-Rollups on the Ethereum network. Each of these projects brings unique attributes to the table, demonstrating the versatility and potential of ZK-Rollups as a layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nWhat are ZK rollups?\n\nZK-Rollups are an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that is then posted on the Ethereum mainnet. Each transaction in the ZK-Rollup is completely valid, and the Ethereum mainnet can trust this without having to validate each transaction individually, thereby reducing the amount of computational resources needed. This greatly increases Ethereum\u2019s throughput, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees.\n\nIn essence, ZK-Rollups move computation off-chain and leave only necessary data on-chain, which results in a drastic decrease in gas fees. Importantly, the technology helps retain a high level of security by maintaining a data availability layer on-chain. This ensures that even if the ZK-Rollup layer goes offline, users can still withdraw their funds.\n\nOne of the main advantages of ZK-Rollups over other Layer-2 solutions is that they maintain complete Ethereum compatibility, meaning that developers can leverage their existing knowledge and tools. Additionally, they provide finality, meaning once a transaction is included in a ZK-Rollup, it\u2019s final and can\u2019t be reversed.\n\nOverall, ZK-Rollups are seen as one of the most promising solutions to the scalability issues of Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining a high degree of security and decentralization.\n\nThe Top ZK Rollup Projects in 2023\n\nSeveral protocols, such as borrowing and lending protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), have become multi-chain. This means that they support multiple ZK-Rollup based Layer-2s, giving users various choices to lower transaction fees and achieve quicker transaction times and finality.\n\nWe have listed some of the leading projects in the market that use ZK-Rollup technology for scaling.\n\nPolygon\n\nInitially launched in 2017 under the moniker Matic Network, Polygon is the brainchild of Ethereum developers Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun, Jaynti Kanani, and Mihailo Bjelic.\n\nPolygon capitalizes on ZK-Rollups to enhance scalability, despite conventional ZK-Rollups posing certain limitations such as requiring substantial time. The ingenious application of recursive proofs by Polygon mitigates this challenge. Unlike the average ZK-Rollup-based blockchains that generate proofs for a single transaction at a time, Polygon has the capability to create proofs for each transaction in a batch before dispatching the batch to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe unique structure of Polygon\u2019s ZK-Rollups renders the network swifter and more cost-effective than the majority of other ZK-Rollup scaling remedies, removing the need for validators to possess specialized equipment. Indeed, some proofs on the under-development network, Polygon Zero, are as compact as 45kb, placing significantly less pressure on blockchain performance compared to alternative scaling solutions.\n\nPolygon\u2019s ZK-Rollups diverge from most Layer-2 counterparts in that they\u2019re entirely Ethereum compatible, so developers aren\u2019t required to master new languages to script Polygon smart contracts, unlike with Layer-2 alternatives like StarkNet.\n\nPolygon operates by producing multiple \u201ccommit chains,\u201d somewhat analogous to sidechains, but with a distinct function, drawing a larger proportion of their security from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nStarkNet/StarkEx\n\nStarkNet and StarkEx are both creations of Starkware, a company established in 2017 by Alessandro Chiesa and Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nStarkNet stands as another decentralized ZK-Rollup based Layer-2 blockchain. However, unlike Polygon, developers venturing into StarkNet must master the Cairo programming language instead of Solidity, which can potentially complicate the induction of new developers. Nevertheless, to overcome this hurdle, transpilers from Solidity to Cairo and other popular programming languages are under development.\n\nStarkNet, similar to other ZK-Rollup-based chains, packages multiple Layer-2 transactions into a singular Ethereum transaction, enhancing transaction speed while curtailing gas fees.\n\nThe same team that developed StarkNet also created StarkEx, another distinct blockchain. StarkNet facilitates public dApp development, whereas StarkEx serves as a SaaS (software-as-a-service) scalability solution specifically tailored for decentralized crypto exchanges (DEXs), enabling the exchanges to cut costs while elevating speed and liquidity.\n\nStarkEx extends support to ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and tokens on other EVM-compatible chains, as well as the globally popular ERC-721 NFTs. It\u2019s also working on providing off-chain minting support for ERC-1155 semi-fungible dynamic NFTs. StarkEx, having launched on Ethereum since mid-2020, is one of the biggest Layer-2 solutions by TVL (total value locked). It currently powers a wide range of dApps and protocols.\n\nZKSync\n\nThe brains behind ZKSync are Alexandr Vlasov and Alex Gluchowski from Matter Labs, which launched the solution in 2020.\n\nCrafted to deliver high-speed transactions (2,000+ TPS) while maintaining low gas fees and high security, ZKSync is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution. Unlike numerous Layer-2s, ZKSync offers almost instantaneous fund withdrawal to the Ethereum Layer-1 mainnet. It\u2019s worth noting that ZKSync is the only zk-rollup protocol with complete EVM compatibility to date, enabling developers to easily redeploy live smart contracts from Ethereum without the need for rewriting or customizing them for ZKSync. This considerably boosts interoperability and trims down development time.\n\nZKSync bears similarities to StarkNet and StarkEx in certain respects, with the key differentiation lying in the type of proofing protocols used. ZKSync employs SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive ARgument of Knowledge), while StarkEx leverages STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge).\n\nZK-SNARKs require a one-off setup in which a handful of developers need to be trusted to create code correctly and securely, leading to increased centralization and reduced trustlessness. In contrast, ZK-STARKs use publicly verifiable randomness to establish trustless verifiable systems. STARKs are also perceived to be quantum-resistant, whereas SNARKs are not. STARKs further promise enhanced scalability. Therefore, ZKSync does exhibit some drawbacks in comparison to StarkNet.\n\nSome notable projects deployed on the ZKSync blockchain include Argent, Gitcoin, Yearn Finance, Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, Tally, and the 1inch Network.\n\nImmutable X\n\nImmutable is a platform that offers layer-2 solutions built on Ethereum. It provides developers with APIs and developer tools to facilitate the development of applications on layer-2.\n\nDevelopers can utilize Immutable X to create fast, scalable, and secure applications for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain games. For instance, game developers can leverage Immutable X to implement sophisticated in-game economies that ensure true ownership of in-game assets. They can also take advantage of features like free minting of game assets, fast and affordable in-game transactions, self-custodial wallets to empower users with ownership of their in-game items, and a global order book for trading in-game items on the open market.\n\nAdditionally, Immutable X caters to token and asset trading platforms by enabling fast, secure, and cost-effective trades between users. It provides a global order book that ensures maximum liquidity. Also, blockchain transaction analysis tools can access Immutable X\u2019s APIs to obtain easily accessible data on past transactions, trades, and user behaviors.\n\nImmutable chose to build its solutions on Ethereum due to its reputation as the most decentralized, secure, and widely-used blockchain, resulting in significant network effects. Ethereum allows the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from third parties.\n\nImmutable X offers two execution layers, both utilizing the ZK rollup batching mechanism. ZK roll ups consist of two main components: an off-chain batching mechanism (virtual machine) that generates a compressed cryptographic proof from a batch of transactions, previous state root, and new state root, and an on-chain contract that stores the current state root and verifies the consistency of the batch.\n\nHere\u2019s how ZK rollups work within Immutable X: A collection of Layer 2 transactions is sent to the batching mechanism, which generates a cryptographic proof based on the transactions, previous state root, and new state root. This proof is then sent to the Layer 1 smart contract for verification. The smart contract checks if the previous state root in the proof matches its current state root. If they match, the smart contract updates its current state root to the new state root of the batch.\n\nImmutable currently offers two Layer 2 solutions: StarkEx, which provides a service for batching specific types of transactions created and maintained by Starkware, and Immutable zkEVM, a smart contract platform that allows any developer to write and deploy smart contracts to zkEVM. Developers can access these solutions by signing up or utilizing the API endpoints provided by Immutable X. Immutable zkEVM, specifically designed for games, delivers low-cost, high-throughput, Ethereum-compatible smart contracts within an EVM zk-rollup framework.\n\nLoopring\n\nLoopring is a Layer-2 scaling protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It enables the settlement of thousands of trades per second while offering various functionalities. In addition to serving as a protocol layer for DEXs, Loopring provides Loopring Exchange, a non-custodial trading platform that facilitates secure and high-speed trades without gas fees.\n\nThe key technology behind Loopring is Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), which are blockchain innovations that bundle transactions together for improved efficiency. By leveraging ZKPs, Loopring enables the development of high-throughput, non-custodial DEXs. The protocol also introduces its native LCR token, which is utilized to reward Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) operators and liquidity providers.\n\nLoopring\u2019s approach involves implementing Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), a Layer-2 solution that enhances scalability by working alongside the Ethereum network. zk-Rollups can consolidate numerous transactions into a single, lightweight Zero-Knowledge Proof, which is then confirmed as a batch on the Ethereum network. This substantially increases transactional throughput compared to Ethereum\u2019s standalone capabilities. The zk-Rollup computation process occurs off-chain, while the underlying data and transactions remain on the Ethereum blockchain. By integrating zk-Rollups with DEX protocols, Loopring enables complex computations, leading to reduced transaction fees and significantly improved liquidity.\n\nWhen compared to conventional order book-based centralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs typically offer lower transaction fees and support for a broader range of digital assets. However, centralized exchanges still outperform DEXs in terms of liquidity and transaction speeds. Loopring aims to bridge this gap by incorporating zk-Rollups, bringing the advantages of centralized exchanges to the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nWithin the Ethereum network, zk-Rollups offer faster and more cost-effective validation of transaction blocks. They involve less data inclusion and only require a smart contract to verify the final cryptographic proof, resulting in improved efficiency. Transactions processed through zk-Rollups are stored on the Ethereum blockchain as call reference data, which requires less computation compared to retrieving data from the network. By combining these functionalities into a single open protocol, Loopring accelerates the adoption of blockchain technology by enhancing efficiency across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe scalability issues on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain are being met head-on with innovative technologies like ZK-Rollups. As we\u2019ve explored, several prominent projects are already leveraging this technology to improve transaction speed, reduce costs, and ensure security on the Ethereum network.\n\nAs these solutions continue to evolve and mature, they hold the promise of unlocking the full potential of Ethereum, making it more accessible and efficient for users and developers alike. The future of Ethereum, it seems, is bound to be intertwined with the evolution and application of ZK-Rollups."
