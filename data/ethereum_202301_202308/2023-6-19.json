        "title": "Ethereum Use Cases You Might Not Know - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform, has gained significant attention for its role in powering cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH). However, Ethereum\u2019s potential extends beyond just being a digital currency. In this article, we will explore some lesser-known use cases of Ethereum that highlight its versatility and transformative capabilities. From decentralized finance to supply chain management and even digital identity solutions, Ethereum is revolutionizing industries in ways you might not have imagined. So, let\u2019s dive into this listicle and discover the diverse applications of Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nOne of the most prominent use cases of Ethereum is its role in the decentralized finance sector. Ethereum enables the creation of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that eliminate the need for intermediaries. DeFi platforms built on Ethereum allow users to access various financial services, such as lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming, without relying on traditional banking institutions. The transparency and security provided by Ethereum\u2019s blockchain make DeFi applications more efficient, accessible, and inclusive.\n\nTokenization of Assets\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities enable the tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, artwork, or even rare collectibles. By representing these assets as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, ownership and transfer become more efficient, transparent, and accessible to a broader audience. Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize traditional asset ownership models, unlocking liquidity and fractional ownership opportunities.\n\nOnline Betting with Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology has paved the way for decentralized online betting platforms. By utilizing smart contracts, Ethereum enables secure and transparent betting experiences. Ethereum sports betting, in particular, has gained popularity, allowing users to place bets on sporting events using Ether. These platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries, provide fair odds, and ensure prompt payouts, enhancing the overall betting experience.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology can enhance supply chain management by providing transparency, traceability, and immutability. By recording each step of a product\u2019s journey on the Ethereum blockchain, stakeholders can verify its origin, authenticity, and compliance with regulations. This technology has the potential to combat counterfeiting, improve inventory management, and build trust between suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers.\n\nDecentralized Governance\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature makes it an ideal platform for experimenting with decentralized governance models. Through the use of smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Ethereum allows communities to govern themselves and make collective decisions. These governance models can be applied to various domains, such as voting systems, project funding, or even decentralized social networks, empowering individuals and fostering more inclusive decision-making processes.\n\nDigital Identity Solutions\n\nEthereum can revolutionize digital identity management by providing individuals with control over their personal data. Using Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, individuals can create self-sovereign identities that are secure, portable, and verifiable. This eliminates the need for centralized identity providers and puts individuals in charge of their personal information. Digital identity solutions built on Ethereum can enhance privacy, reduce identity theft, and enable seamless verification across different platforms.\n\nGaming and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain has been at the forefront of the booming NFT market. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent ownership of in-game items, virtual real estate, digital art, and more. Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts enable the creation, ownership, and transfer of NFTs, providing a secure and transparent infrastructure for the gaming and digital art industries. NFTs have the potential to revolutionize ownership and monetization in the virtual world, creating new opportunities for creators, collectors, and gamers.\n\nDecentralized File Storage\n\nTraditional file storage systems are centralized, making them vulnerable to data breaches and censorship. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can be utilized to create decentralized file storage solutions, where files are distributed across a network of nodes rather than being stored in a central server. This enhances data security, reduces reliance on centralized platforms, and enables users to have greater control over their data.\n\nEnergy Trading and Grid Management\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology can facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading and improve grid management. By leveraging smart contracts, individuals and businesses can trade excess energy directly with each other, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can enable more efficient management of energy grids by tracking energy production and consumption in a transparent and secure manner.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights\n\nIntellectual property rights management can be improved using Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Smart contracts can automate the licensing, distribution, and royalties of digital content, ensuring that creators are properly compensated for their work. Blockchain-based solutions on Ethereum offer a transparent and tamper-proof mechanism for tracking and enforcing intellectual property rights, revolutionizing the creative industries.\n\nMusic and Royalty Management\n\nThe music industry faces challenges in terms of royalty distribution and copyright management. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can provide a transparent and efficient solution for music rights management. Smart contracts can automate royalty payments, ensuring that artists receive their fair share of revenue. Additionally, blockchain-based platforms can enable direct peer-to-peer music sharing and monetization, allowing artists to connect directly with their audience and bypass traditional record labels.\n\nHealthcare Data Management\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain has the potential to revolutionize healthcare data management by providing a secure and interoperable platform. Patient records, medical research, and clinical trial data can be stored on the blockchain, ensuring privacy, integrity, and accessibility. This can facilitate seamless data sharing between healthcare providers, enhance medical research, and improve patient outcomes.\n\nWind Up\n\nEthereum\u2019s impact goes beyond just being a cryptocurrency platform. Its smart contract capabilities have opened up a world of possibilities, revolutionizing industries ranging from finance and supply chain management to gaming and digital identity. Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature, transparency, and security make it an ideal platform for transforming traditional systems into more efficient, inclusive, and trustworthy solutions. As Ethereum continues to evolve and innovate, its potential use cases will only expand further, leading to a more decentralized and interconnected future."

        "title": "What are Ethscriptions? Inscriptions on the Ethereum Blockchain, Explained - nft now",
        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinal Inscriptions have significantly impacted the Web3 space since the Ordinals protocol was introduced in January 2023. Millions upon millions of Inscriptions have been minted, inspiring established projects to expand from Ethereum and Solana to Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals also seem to have inspired Ethscriptions \u2014 a recently launched (and quickly adopted) protocol that enables the creation and sharing of digital entities on the Ethereum blockchain (as long as they\u2019re under 96 kilobytes).\n\nCreated by Tom Lehman, co-founder of Genius.com, the innovation has sparked considerable interest since its June 17 launch, with over 130,000 Ethscriptions generated to date. To add to the excitement, Lehman also introduced Ethereum Punks, a collection consisting of 10,000 Punks that were all claimed within hours.\n\nSo what exactly are Ethscriptions? We dive into the new protocol, how it works, and why Lehman believes it\u2019s needed.\n\nHow do Ethscriptions work?\n\nEthscriptions work by harnessing Ethereum \u201ccalldata\u201d \u2014 the data passed along in a token that allows us to send messages to other entities or interact with smart contracts \u2014 to inscribe non-financial data directly onto the Ethereum main chain. According to Lehman, this allows for a more affordable and decentralized alternative to contract storage.\n\nIt's cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\n\n\nAlso protocol guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions!\n\n\n\nPlus it's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nEthscriptions operate on the Ethereum platform in the following manner:\n\nAn Ethscription is created whenever an Ethereum transaction is successful, and its input data (interpreted as UTF-8) forms a valid data URI. This URI must be unique, meaning duplicate content is disregarded. Ethscriptions support all valid mimetypes. The URI\u2019s uniqueness is guaranteed by ensuring that no prior block or transaction within the same block has identical content as the Ethscription. The input data of any Ethereum transaction can also serve as a valid Ethscription transfer, as long as the data is the transaction hash of a valid Ethscription and the sender of the transaction is the rightful owner of the Ethscription. When an Ethscription is created, the recipient becomes the initial owner, while the sender is designated as the Ethscription\u2019s creator.\n\nRight now, Ethscriptions can only be images, but Lehman says this will change in the future.\n\nCredit: Ethereum Punks\n\nThe future of Ethscriptions\n\nLehman believes that Ethscriptions are essential to the Web3 space. He detailed his reasoning in a June 20 tweet, where he essentially explained that they provide an affordable solution to those seeking decentralized solutions and unlocking Ethereum\u2019s full potential.\n\nSince Lehman announced the protocol in a June 16 Twitter space, most of the Web3 community has reacted with excitement and interest, with many questioning whether Ethscriptions will see the same success as Ordinals. However, some have criticized the new protocol, with others pointing out that it\u2019s really nothing novel.\n\nRegardless of the initial reception of the launch, which Lehman sees as a \u201chuge success,\u201d he plans to keep innovating on Ethscriptions. \u201cI also have lots of plans for extending the protocol that I can\u2019t wait to share, but the foundation must come first,\u201d Lehman shared on Twitter.\n\nEthscriptions represent a promising frontier in the crypto landscape. As a unique protocol that navigates the balance between decentralization and functionality, Ethscriptions open a new avenue for accessible, affordable, and secure data transactions on Ethereum. Despite being in its early stages, the relevance and potential of Ethscriptions are only just beginning."

        "content": "Ethereum core developers plan to implement a 64-fold increase in the maximum amount of staked Ether (ETH) required to become a validator, from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH while the minimum staking amount remain at 32 ETH.\n\nThe proposal was made during a June 15 Ethereum core developer consensus meeting by Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder. The researcher noted that although the current limit of 32 ETH allows more validators to join the Ethereum network, making it more decentralized, it also leads to an inflation of the validator set size.\n\nNeuder added that such a large increase would ultimately help the Ethereum network become more efficient over time. Besides the proposal to increase the minimum required staked ETH for validators, Neuder also called for auto-compounding validator rewards.\n\nEthereum consensus layer meeting. Source: YouTube\n\nThe auto-compounding of rewards would allow validators to make more money on their staked ETH. Currently, to produce any staking income, rewards received in excess of the 32 ETH cap must be transferred to another account. These benefits could be rapidly compounded if the cap were raised, giving validators a practical way to increase their earn reward.\n\nNeuder claimed the current proposal would not only make the Ethereum network more efficient and make way for validators to earn more money, but it would also help large node operators, such as exchanges, which currently manage thousands of validators.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong legislator invites Coinbase to the region despite SEC scrutiny\n\nThe 32 ETH limit has led to a significant surge in validator addresses after Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake network. At present, there are over 700,000 validators, with around 90,000 awaiting activation in the queue.\n\nTotal Ethereum validators. Source: Beaconscan\n\nThe proposal received mixed reactions from the crypto community, with several users pointing out that such a significant change in staked ETH would lead to fewer validators and thus make the network more centralized. Other users dismissed the idea and claimed it wouldn\u2019t benefit the network.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Ethereum (ETH) could correct in a big way as he believes the leading altcoin is poised to retest a long-term trend indicator before it could give birth to a new bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 785,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum has been respecting the fair-value logarithmic regression band as support since 2017.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the logarithmic regression band is designed to track the fair value of an asset using \u201cnon-bubble data.\u201d\n\nCowen says that in an optimistic scenario, Ethereum may retest the upper bound of the trend indicator, which he notes coincides with ETH\u2019s bear market low at around $875.\n\n\u201cNow, an interesting development is that the fair value according to this fit to non-bubble data of Ethereum is at $875, but the prior low was actually at $880. So they\u2019re essentially the same.\n\nIf Ethereum went back down to its prior low, that would get it back home. And we talked about this a year ago. I said, \u2018Look guys, what I think is going to happen is we either go down to the regression band or we go sideways until it catches up.\u2019 Now, if we were to dump now, if we were to dump to what I\u2019ve called home before, it would actually correspond to the prior low.\u201d\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, Cowen says that ETH could briefly trade below the logarithmic regression trendline, similar to what happened in March 2020.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t go below that level. As you can see, we did go entirely below the entire regression band back in March 2020. And in fact, it went about 34% below the regression band during that drop.\n\nIf we were to have another drop, similar to that, like 34% below this level, that would correspond down to about a $400 Ethereum, which is why I\u2019ve thrown that number out there in the past as a potential outcome in a worst-case scenario environment.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,736 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Validator Limit to Increase from 32 to 2,048 ETH - Crypto Times",
        "content": "In a recent development, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have been deliberating on a proposal that suggests a significant increase in the maximum validator balance. The current limit of 32 ether (ETH) per validator could potentially be raised to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThis proposed change aims to enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network while maintaining decentralization. Let\u2019s delve into the details of this proposal and its potential implications.\n\nPresently, Ethereum validators face an effective balance cap, which restricts them to a minimum and maximum stake of 32 ETH. This limitation forces large-scale staking operations to create multiple validators in order to earn yield on amounts exceeding this threshold. Consequently, there has been a surge in the number of validators, with approximately 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 waiting to be activated in the queue.\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, Michael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a prominent advocate of the proposed change, put forth a compelling argument in favor of raising the validator cap. Neuder highlighted that while the current cap promotes decentralization, it inadvertently leads to an inflationary growth of the validator set size.\n\nOne of the key benefits of raising the validator cap is the potential to improve the network\u2019s efficiency in achieving finality within a single Ethereum slot. By slowing down the expansion of the active validator set, this change would enable more effective utilization of resources and enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nAnother significant advantage that the proposed increased cap brings is the possibility of auto-compounding validator rewards. Currently, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be directed elsewhere to generate staking yield. However, if the cap is lifted, validators would have the opportunity to immediately compound these rewards, thereby maximizing their earnings from staked ETH.\n\nThe proposal also addresses operational concerns faced by larger node operators, including exchanges like Coinbase and defi protocols such as Lido. These operators currently maintain tens of thousands of validators due to the existing 32 ETH cap per validator. By raising the maximum effective validator balance, they would be able to manage fewer but higher-stake validators, reducing complexity and streamlining their operations.\n\nWhile the proposed change offers several advantages, it is crucial to consider the associated risks. With a higher validator balance, there is a potential increase in penalties for accidental double attestations or proposals, commonly known as \u201cslashing.\u201d It is essential to carefully evaluate and mitigate these risks to ensure the smooth functioning of the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethscriptions a new NFT Protocol live on ETH Blockchain\n\nThe proposal is currently under debate among the core developers, who have agreed to continue discussing its implementation details on social platforms such as ETHMagicians and Discord. This open dialogue allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal\u2019s impact and the incorporation of valuable insights from the Ethereum community."

It is one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, known for its smart contract functionality and its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). Ethereum allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on its platform, offering a wide range of possibilities beyond simple financial transactions.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum is a distributed network of computers that collectively maintains a blockchain, which is a public ledger containing a record of all transactions and smart contracts executed on the network. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions, Ethereum aims to be a decentralized platform for executing code of any complexity.\n\nOne of the key features of Ethereum is its support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. This feature allows for the creation of decentralized applications, enabling developers to build and deploy applications that can interact with each other, access and modify data, and execute transactions autonomously.\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, Ether (ETH), serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it is used to incentivize participants on the network to perform computations and secure the blockchain through a process called mining (although Ethereum is transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism). Secondly, Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating transactions and powering the execution of smart contracts.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine, meaning it can execute any algorithm or computation that a conventional computer can perform. The EVM runs on the nodes of the Ethereum network, and every node stores a copy of the blockchain and processes transactions and smart contract code.\n\nEthereum has gained widespread popularity due to its ability to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without intermediaries like banks or brokers. This has led to the creation of numerous DeFi platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and other financial instruments built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is continuously evolving and expanding. It has a vibrant community of developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts who contribute to its growth. Ethereum has also introduced several upgrades and improvements over time, with the most notable upgrade being Ethereum 2.0, which aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability by transitioning from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and the execution of smart contracts.

        "title": "Ethereum Eyes Dramatic Shift: Proposes Validator Limit Increase From 32 To 2048 ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, could be on the cusp of a significant operational shift. In the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, a key agenda item under discussion was a proposed increase in the maximum validator limit.\n\nIf implemented, this adjustment would see the limit skyrocket from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH per validator. Currently, validators in Ethereum\u2019s network maintain a balance cap set at both the minimum and maximum of 32 ETH.\n\nThose managing large-scale staking operations, consequently, must establish multiple validators to earn yield beyond this limit. As such, the result is a significant growth in the number of validators, with the current count reaching 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 on standby.\n\nStreamlining For Optimization\n\nMichael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a primary advocate of this change, argues that the proposed increase would alleviate the pressures caused by the expanding validator set size.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively\n\nNeuder highlighted that the current validator cap does support decentralization, but it simultaneously leads to an inflation of the validator set size. This increasing size eventually enhances the system\u2019s performance by expediting the conclusion within a solitary Ethereum slot.\n\nIn addition, Neuder pointed out the prospect of auto-compounding validator rewards brought on by this change. Given the current restrictions, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be averted to other places to generate any staking yield.\n\nWith a raised cap, these rewards could be compounded instantaneously, enabling validators to reap greater benefits from their staked ETH.\n\nImpact On Large-Scale Operators And Associated Risks\n\nThe proposal also aims to address the procedural challenges encountered by major node managers, such as exchanges like Coinbase, that presently supervise multitudes of validators due to the standing 32 ETH constraint per validator.\n\nIf the cap were to be elevated, such operators could manage fewer validators with higher stakes, which could potentially simplify operations. However, Neuder cautioned about the risks tied to this proposed change.\n\nFor instance, the increase could potentially lead to steeper penalties for inadvertent double attestations or proposals, also known as \u201cslashing.\u201d This highlights the importance of considering all possible implications in the path toward improving network efficiency and validator rewards.\n\nNotably, as Ethereum continues to evolve, this potential change in the validator limit serves as a critical discussion point in the broader conversation about the platform\u2019s future.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Price Prints Bullish Technical Pattern, Why Close Above $1,780 Is Critical\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is down 1% in the past week amid the industry\u2019s current condition. The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a downward movement, also falling by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH trades above $1,700 after moving below that price range to trade at the $1,600 region last week. ETH\u2019s trading volume has plummeted over the past 7 days from above $7 billion last Monday to below $4 billion in the past 24 hours, indicating a decline in trading activity.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

ETH could continue to move up if it clears the $1,780 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum was able to climb above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,750 and $1,780 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Attempts Recovery\n\nEthereum\u2019s price was able to form a support base above the $1,620 level. ETH started a decent recovery wave above the $1,680 and $1,700 resistance levels, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nBesides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,750 resistance and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It tested the $1,770 level. A high is formed near $1,768 and the price is now correcting gains.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,750 level. Ether dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,768 high.\n\nIt is now trading above $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,740 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,770 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main resistance is near $1,780. A proper move above the $1,770 and $1,780 resistance levels might start a steady recovery wave. The next resistance sits near $1,820, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,850 level. Any more gains above the $1,850 resistance zone might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,780 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,710 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,675 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,768 high. If there is a break and close below the $1,675 support, the price could dive toward the $1,620 support.

        "title": "Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The tentatively slated Ethereum upgrade Cancun / Deneb for autumn will be a game-changer for layer-2 rollup technologies such as Arbitrum and Optimism. The basis for this will be the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will be the main code change of the upgrade, as Christine Kim, vice president in Galaxy Digital\u2019s research team explained.\n\nLast Friday, 15 June, the 111th All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call was held. Chaired by Ethereum Foundation Researcher Alex Stokes, participants finalized the final scope of the upgrade. And EIP 4844 (proto-thanksharding) is being implemented.\n\nEthereum: Next Upgrade Is Huge For ARB And OP\n\nAs Kim writes, EIP 4844 introduces a new transaction type called \u201cblobs\u201d. This increases the data and storage requirements of Ethereum blocks and creates a new fee market to value blobs separately from regular transactions.\n\nData blobs are the first milestone for Ethereum\u2019s full Danksharding, which will allow rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism a 100-fold increase in capacity. This is realized by allowing nodes to safely process multiple blobs per block than the initial maximum set by EIP 4844.\n\nImportantly, EIP 4844 does not improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability as a general-purpose blockchain for executing transactions and smart contracts, Kim notes. It does not significantly increase or improve the transaction capacity of Ethereum itself.\n\nHowever, proto-Danksharding reduces the cost of transferring large amounts of data to Ethereum and thus lowers the operating costs of rollups. This is of equal importance, as recent years have seen a surge in transactional activity from rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism. While Ethereum mainnet transactions per second (TPS) reached a maximum of 20 TPS this year, L2 TPS peaked above 50.\n\nCompared to the cost of deploying code and transactions directly on Ethereum, rollups have saved end users and dapp developers over 99% in gas fees. The goal of EIP 4844 is therefore of great importance for scaling Ethereum.\n\n\u201cBlob blockspace will be auctioned according to its own fee market, modeled after the fee market design of EIP 1559,\u201d says Kim who emphasizes that there are many parallels to the introduction of blobs on Ethereum and the introduction of segregated witness (segwit) on Bitcoin. However, one of the main differences between segwit and EIP 4844 is the expected long-term impact of these code changes.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Price At Crucial Resistance\n\nIn recent weeks, ARB has shown relative strength compared to OP. The ARB price has swept the previous low and now needs to overcome resistance at $1.03 to enter the trading range from May 6 to June 10. If the ARB price fails to do so in the next few days, a price discovery to the downside could be imminent. Otherwise, a rise to mid-range resistance at $1.15 could be on the table.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Following a period of correction, Ethereum\u2019s price found support at a significant region comprising the 200-day moving average and the lower trendline of the flag pattern, located at $1.6K. As a result, the price initiated a slight bullish rally.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter an extended bearish phase, the price reached a notable support region encompassing the 200-day moving average and the lower boundary of the flag pattern. This zone serves as robust support, as it also aligns with the static support level of $1.6K, indicating substantial buying pressure.\n\nConsequently, this buying pressure led to the formation of a bullish rally. However, the positive momentum weakened upon reaching the previous minor swing on the daily chart, resulting in decreased volatility and the development of very small candles.\n\nNonetheless, if the bullish rally continues, Ethereum\u2019s next target will be the 100-day moving average and the upper trendline of the flag pattern, positioned at $1834.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn to the 4-hour chart, after breaking below the lower trendline of the extended ascending channel, the selling pressure remained high, causing the price to continue plummeting.\n\nNevertheless, after a few days of red candles, ETH reached the crucial Fibonacci level of 61.8%, representing the initial target for the correction legs during the bullish rally that originated from $1368 and persisted until encountering significant resistance at $2.1K.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the recent rebound could be a retracement toward the broken level. Ultimately, Ethereum\u2019s next move will be determined by future price action.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart illustrates the relationship between Ethereum\u2019s Exchange Netflow metric and its price. After encountering resistance at the $2.1K level, Ethereum\u2019s price entered a prolonged consolidation correction phase, leading to a 24% correction. As depicted in the chart, the Netflow metric exhibited a downtrend during this market condition, ultimately plummeting below 0.\n\nHowever, the recent lawsuit involving Binance, Coinbase, and the SEC acted as a catalyst for the bearish trend in the market, prompting participants to withdraw their assets from these exchanges. Consequently, the Netflow metric experienced a further impulsive decline, indicating the prevailing fear within the market.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that a robust and sustainable bullish rally should not be anticipated until the fear and uncertainty vanish from the market and sufficient demand returns."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s core developers are currently considering a proposal that would significantly raise the maximum effective validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, while retaining the minimum staking amount at 32 ETH.\n\nThis proposal, if adopted, would have far-reaching implications on the Ethereum network\u2019s operations, particularly in the context of network decentralization and validator set size.\n\nMichael Neuder, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation and a leading advocate for this change, has argued that the existing validator cap, while ostensibly promoting decentralization, has the unintended consequence of incentivizing operations to set up more and more validators.\n\nNeuder originally posted the proposal, in addition to sharing his perspective during the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting held last Friday.\n\nThis would be a pivotal change that could redefine the operational dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s network by adjusting the balance between decentralization and efficiency\u2014the balance that is always at stake in an intentionally decentralized blockchain ecosystem.\n\nMaxEB\n\nMAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE (abbreviated as MaxEB) is a rule that limits the effective balance of Ethereum validators to 32 ETH. The effective balance is a value derived from the validator\u2019s balance and prior effective balance. This means if a validator stakes more than 32 ETH, any amount over that would not earn them extra yield.\n\nThis incentivizes validators to set up additional \u201cvalidator spots\u201d for each extra 32 ETH they want to stake\u2014in other words, single entities are incentivized to set up multiple validators, making the true measure of decentralization in the network difficult to assess.\n\nProponents argue that increasing MaxEB would unblock future upgrades on the consensus layer, enhance the performance of the current consensus mechanism and the peer-to-peer (p2p) layer, which is the network of nodes that Ethereum runs on, and improve operational efficiency for validators, regardless of their size.\n\nWhile arguments in favor of the proposal center around streamlining network growth and validator management, Neuder acknowledges that critics could argue that the upgrade may introduce unnecessary complexity to the ecosystem or open Ethereum to new potential security risks. Nevertheless, the proposal also responded to such potential criticisms by expressing confidence that such eventualities were manageable.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "In a world of different blockchains, interoperability is becoming an increasingly important issue. While many solutions are already connecting the numerous chains, they don\u2019t come without risks.\n\nDifferent layer-1 blockchains aim to solve this interoperability problem by creating a network with integrated bridges between chains and asynchronous message passing. Using a cross-chain bridge, it\u2019s possible to move value from one chain to another. However, this raises several issues for developers and users. One major issue is the potential for bridge hacks, which have caused billions of dollars in damage in recent years.\n\nIn addition, a fragmented blockchain landscape leads to inefficiencies and complexity, exposing additional vulnerabilities. Trading across chains can be costly with rising gas prices and slippage risks. What\u2019s more, bridging solutions can take anywhere from minutes to hours to get a transaction through.\n\nAttacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022. Source: Chainalysis\n\nOne blockchain to connect them all\n\nZetaChain, a decentralized layer-1 chain, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to make the blockchain industry more interoperable by natively supporting cross-chain bridging of assets, data and liquidity.\n\nZetaChain\u2019s approach makes it possible to build omnichain decentralized applications (DApps) that allow users to access all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on. The increased interoperability and ability to create omnichain DApps could improve user experience, which could, in turn, benefit the adoption of blockchain technology in general.\n\nFurthermore, ZetaChain not only supports smart contract chains like Ethereum but can also integrate non-smart contract blockchains like Dogecoin and Bitcoin using the cross-chain toolkit for developers. The network effectively allows for Bitcoin smart contracts giving developers the tools and infrastructure to merge their BRC-20 projects, for example. Overall, however, the network is blockchain agnostic.\n\nSource: ZetaChain\n\nGaining momentum\n\nZetaChain is a new project and therefore is working hard to gain a foothold within the crypto industry. The project recently published its white paper, available in 17 different languages. The document highlights the focus on interoperability between chains and developers worldwide.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s testnet has attracted more than 1.5 million users from over 100 countries while its community continues to grow. In addition, ZetaChain\u2019s social media channels have built a follower base of over 1.7 million people in the short time they have been live.\n\nOn the developer side, the momentum is visible as well. The project has partnered with many big names in the crypto industry, including an infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain ecosystem Ankr, blockchain security company Halborn, and bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. DApp development ranges from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to NFTs and universal and private identity platforms, all to expand the reach of the ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers interested in building DApps on top of ZetaChain can apply for funding through the ZetaChain Grants Program. Hundreds of developer teams have already applied for this funding, hoping to receive a kick-start from the project.\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Announcing $5 million in ZetaChain grants to power the next generation of Omnichain dApps. Learn about the program and apply here:https://t.co/ISA1vorcbP \u2014 ZetaChain (@zetablockchain) April 13, 2023\n\nNot stealing from other chains, but growing with them\n\nA key aspect of ZetaChain\u2019s mission is to grow with other networks rather than at their expense. Brandon Truong, chief product officer at ZetaChain, emphasized this aspect: \u201cZetaChain is in a unique position as a new L1 that connects other chains agnostically. Instead of trying to steal liquidity and users from other ecosystems and chains, it can grow with them. The growth of ZetaChain goes hand in hand with the growth of crypto in general.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s founders began their journey by exploring the different types of architecture that exist to connect other chains. They quickly discovered many issues, from the aforementioned vulnerabilities to async messaging-based and centralized approaches. By developing an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain, ZetaChain aims to be a solution that works for users and developers while keeping security concerns in mind.\n\nZetaChain empowers developers to create easy-to-use DApps that onboard non-crypto natives to the crypto space. Moreover, the network allows developers to create DApps that are cross-chain by default and take out the unnecessary burden of reworking code to make a product work on several chains. With its comprehensive omnichain interoperability features, ZetaChain connects all blockchains, including non-smart contract chains, lowering the barriers to building cross-chain applications to interact with any chain.\n\nLearn more about ZetaChain"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s mean and median gas price declined in recent weeks.\n\nActive users and volume remained untouched, indicating sustained activities.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network has long been criticized for its exorbitant gas prices, which have been a source of frustration for users. The fees have remained stubbornly high despite its massive user base and daily transactions. However, there is a glimmer of hope.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum sees gas price decline\n\nOn 18 June, a recent chart from Glassnode revealed a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2018s median gas price, reaching approximately 18.0 GWEI, marking a five-month low. Furthermore, as of this writing, the gas price had further decreased to around 17.8 GWEI.\n\nThis reduction in median gas price prompted an examination of the average gas price, or mean, on CryptoQuant.\n\nAnalysis of the data on CryptoQuant demonstrated a consistent decline in gas prices. As of this writing, the mean gas price stood at around 19.2 GWEI. This level represented a substantial drop from the peak of around 150 GWEI observed in May.\n\nConsidering the reduction in gas prices, it is worth exploring whether key activities on the Ethereum network experienced a corresponding decrease.\n\nEthereum\u2019s active users, fees, and volume\n\nDespite the observed reduction in gas prices, close attention was paid to key network metrics to determine if there was a corresponding decrease in activity. An examination of the volume metric on DefiLlama revealed no noticeable drop in volume on the Ethereum network.\n\nAs of this writing, the volume surpassed $520 million, indicating sustained activity. Additionally, the active user metric demonstrated a consistent number of users engaging with the network over the past week, with over 358,000 active users currently.\n\nFurthermore, data from Crypto Fees indicated that Ethereum continued to generate substantial fees, suggesting an increase in transactions. As of this writing, the daily fee exceeded $3.5 million, with a seven-day average exceeding $4 million.\n\nThe data indicated that the volume of interactions or transactions on the Ethereum network had not experienced a decline.\n\nAre L2s taking the shine?\n\nThe reduction in Ethereum gas fees could be attributed to the emergence of various Layer 2 solutions (L2s). These L2s aim to alleviate congestion on the Ethereum network, which helps mitigate the escalation of gas prices.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to data from L2 Beats, these Layer 2 solutions are steadily gaining traction, as evidenced by their increasing Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nAs of this writing, the L2 TVL surpassed $8.4 billion, indicating a growing adoption of these solutions. As the adoption of L2s expands, we may witness a further reduction in gas prices on the Ethereum network."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nEthereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder proposed increasing the validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe idea being considered within the developer community would stem the growing active validator set size and optimize network efficiency.\n\nIncreasing the limits of validator balances would also make room for auto-compounding of rewards, allowing validators to earn maximum yield for their staked coins.\n\nFollowing a proposal from Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder, core developers of crypto\u2019s largest altcoin network could increase the validator balance cap from the 32 ETH limit to a staggering 2,048 ETH if the idea garners support.\n\nNeuder shared the proposal during the developer\u2019s bi-weekly call where client teams meet to discuss and coordinate the most important updates to the network. The increase in validator balance seems to address a major concern \u2013 the growing number of validators on Ethereum\u2019s PoS network.\n\nIndeed, the current 32 ETH limit means that entities must run multiple validators if they wish to stake past the limit and access more staking rewards. The balance limit has so far spurred an increase in validators which currently exceeds half a million, a rapid increase since The Merge.\n\nAccording to Neuder\u2019s proposal, increasing the balance limit will push Ethereum toward greater efficiency by optimizing finality in a single block.\n\nWhile the current balance cap buoys decentralization, it also causes entities to operate a concerning number of validators which could adversely impact network efficiency, Neuder argued during Friday\u2019s developer\u2019s call.\n\nMore Ethereum Rewards For Validators\n\nFurthermore, Neuder\u2019s proposal could unlock greater rewards for Ethereum validators since they would be able to stake more and therefore, earn more yield on their staked tokens.\n\nCurrently, the 32 ETH limit does not allow validators to earn rewards beyond their capped balances. This limit propels operational costs for larger node operators who end up managing hundreds or thousands of validators in a bid to maximize their yield generation.\n\nIf the cap is increased, Neuder argued that an auto-compounding feature could allow for fewer Ethereum validators to exist while accessing greater rewards through auto-compounding of their staked yield.\n\nThe researcher warned that the idea is not without risk and developers will continue to weigh the merits alongside other hot-button upgrades mulled in the upcoming Deneb and Cancun.\n\nDeneb which focuses on changes to the consensus layer should roll out based on three EIPs. EIP 7044 introduces a code change that accepts signed validator exits in perpetuity, thus bettering the shaking experience.\n\nAnother staking experience upgrade, EIP 4788, aims to improve access to Beacon chain blocks with information on the chain state inside EVMs. EIP 7045 focuses on improved security by expanding the attestation slot from a rolling window of one epoch to two epochs."

As a result, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins are stuck consolidating. But things are likely to change quickly as BTC nears a breakout.\n\nRead Bitcoin's big-picture outlook here: Is Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 bull rally at an end?\n\nBitcoin price attempts a breakout\n\nBitcoin price has been sliding lower since April 19 and has produced three distinctive lower lows and lower highs. Connecting these swing points reveals a falling wedge setup from which BTC attempts to break out in the short term.\n\nA failure to push through could lead to a revisit of the $25,209 support floor. The ideal scenario would include a fake out to the downside, namely a sweep below the $25,209 support level and a potential retest of $23,905 followed by a recovery into the failing wedge and a breakout.\n\nThis move would trigger massive pain for buyers and sellers, and the breakout from this manipulative move could see Bitcoin price retest the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a breakdown of the $20,000 psychological level could hamper the bullish outlook and trigger a selling spree among investors. Such a development could see Bitcoin price revisit the $19,251 and $17,676 support floors.\n\nEthereum price at an inflection point\n\nEthereum price has recovered above the $1,703 support level, but it is unsure if this is the start of a recovery rally. If ETH fails to sustain above the aforementioned support, then the smart contract token is likely to retest the daily inefficiency, which extends from $1,478 to $1,563.\n\nThis move in Ethereum price would represent a 9.30% loss from the current price level.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price maintains its position above $1,703, it will mean that the bulls are in control. In such a case, ETH could further ascend to retest the $1,817 and $1,853 resistance levels.\n\nRipple price needs to conquer critical hurdles\n\nRipple price completed its inverse head-and-shoulders setup on June 13 and has since dropped more than 14%. XRP price trades at $0.485 at the time of writing and is awaiting directional bias from Bitcoin.\n\nA surge in bullish momentum could see Ripple price tag the immediate hurdle at $0.515. In a highly bullish case, XRP could even retest the $0.548 resistance level.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nWhile the outlook is also ambiguous for Ripple price, a swift and decisive breakdown of the $0.468 support level will confirm a bearish regime. In such a case, XRP price could revisit the $0.442 and $0.408 support floors."

Introducing Ethscriptions. here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nTL;DR\n\nEthinscriptions are Ethereum\u2019s response to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal Inscriptions. Tom Lehman, the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast and former CEO of genius.com, brings this concept to life on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGenerated through unique transaction data on Ethereum, ensuring content uniqueness. The file size of Ethinscriptions is limited to 96KB.\n\nUsers created thousands of Ethscriptions, making them available for trading on platforms like OpenSea. Ethscriptions offer a fresh approach to digital artifacts, with the potential for lasting impact in the crypto community.\n\nWhat are Ethscriptions?\n\nIn the rapidly changing world of Web3, a new concept is causing a stir among enthusiasts. Introducing Ethscriptions, Ethereum\u2019s response to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal inscriptions. Tom Lehman, the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast and former CEO of genius.com, brought this new concept to life. Lehman leverages the power of the Ethereum blockchain to create and share digital artifacts.\n\nSignificantly, during a Twitter Space on June 16th, 2023, Lehman revealed Ethereum inscriptions to the world. The idea quickly gained attention, with Middlemarch writing a thread introducing a collection called \u2018Ethereum Punks\u2019 on the same day. The inscriptions are generated on the Ethereum network through successful transactions that contain unique data URIs. Notably, duplicate content is disregarded, and they support all valid mime types.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, to guarantee uniqueness, no previous Ethscription within a block or the same transaction block can have the same content. The transfer of Ethereum inscriptions occurs when the input data of a transaction is the hash of a valid Ethscription, and the sender of the transaction becomes the owner of the Ethscription. However, it\u2019s important to note that the file used for an inscription on the ETH chain must be below the 96-kilobyte threshold.\n\nMoreover, when a creation transaction takes place, the recipient becomes the initial owner of the Ethscription, while the sender assumes the role of the creator. Lehman has started ethscriptions.com, a website that allows visitors to explore and browse all the Ethereum inscriptions created thus far. It also provides the necessary tools for inscription creation on the Ethereum chain.\n\nAre They Gaining Popularity?\n\nSince its launch, users have created thousands of Ethscriptions, establishing their presence on marketplaces like OpenSea. Additionally, the Emblem Vault team has enabled trading for a collection of Ethscriptions on their NFT platform.\n\nThe introduction of Ethscriptions has set the crypto community abuzz, with its unique approach to creating and sharing digital artifacts. Therefore, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain opens up a path of possibilities, bringing new life to the concept of inscribed artworks.\n\nAs Ethscriptions start to gain attention, the future of digital artifacts and their impact on the crypto landscape seems more exciting than ever. This is a space where trends pop up and quickly fade away. Will this be one of them? Or could this potentially be here to stay?"

        "title": "Higher Bitcoin-Ethereum Correlation Is Not Helping Ether: Here's Why - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "In 2021, there was a constant sense of exhilaration for Altcoins to rally, whenever Bitcoin took a step up. It is an obvious observation that during bear markets, BTC\u2019s influence does not propagate to the same extent; at least not in 2023. At the moment, all eyes are currently on Ethereum, as it continues to hover above $1700. According to Coinmetrics, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to share a high correlation.\n\nAs illustrated in the chart, both assets share a correlation level of 0.88. The correlation dropped to a low of 0.735 on May 26, and a downtrend was observed from March. However, the decrease in correlation doesn\u2019t really match up with both assets\u2019 price action. Let us take a better look into both asset side by side.\n\nBitcoin, and Ethereum: Different But Same?\n\nAs observed in the data set, the correlation dropped sharply from 0.93 on March 26th, to 0.735 on May 26th. Now, a reduced correlation would mean that both assets possibly registered different rallies or corrections. However, that was not the case.\n\nComparing both assets\u2019 price actions during that period, rather than independent, a cohesive downtrend can be observed. Both the tokens are forming lower highs on the daily chart. On three occasions, BTC and ETH tested the descending trendline, with Bitcoin close to its resistance at the moment. Ethereum (lower high 4) still has to bridge the gap on the upside.\n\nOn further analysis, Bitcoin and Ether registered similar upswing ranges, and consolidation periods(highlighted by the boxes). Hence, it is clear that neither Ether nor Bitcoin commanded the upper hand during the uncorrelation period. Inference can be drawn that correlation might not be an appropriate metric to understand the market dependability of certain assets.\n\nAt the moment, analysts in the industry are expecting Ethereum to rally above $1800 and follow Bitcoin\u2019s laid-out bullish path. But the above analysis indicated that Ether might be on its own for now.\n\nFinding Factors\n\nFor Ethereum, the decreasing reliance on Bitcoin correlation is also somewhat positive. It allows Ether to sustain a strong rally whenever the market turns positive for the largest Altcoin. Staking on Ethereum and the recent withdrawals completely changes the market dynamics for ETH. After the Shanghai update, Ethereum\u2019s expansion is much more comprehensive in the broader DeFi ecosystem. The rise of lending and LSD protocols should technically allow increasing liquidity for the ETH industry. Over time, increased liquidity on staked ETH should also lead to increased users and wider retail investors."

The proposed change would increase the validator limit from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, marking an approximate 64-fold increase. This decision is anticipated to reshape the staking landscape and potentially influence Ethereum\u2019s price. Lets take a look at this Ethereum Validators limit increase article in more detail.\n\nThe Current State of Ethereum Staking\n\nUntil now, the threshold to become a validator in the Ethereum network was set at 32 ETH. The validators are responsible for proposing and verifying new blocks within the Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The amount was deliberately kept low to ensure widespread participation and decentralization of the network.\n\nEthereum Staking involves committing 32 ETH to initiate validator software. As a validator, your duties encompass data storage, transaction management, and appending new blocks to the blockchain. This not only fortifies Ethereum\u2019s security for all users, but it also generates additional ETH as a reward for your contribution.\n\nWhy stake your ETH?\n\nBy staking your ETH, you can earn rewards for activities that aid the network in achieving consensus. These rewards are granted for operating software that correctly groups transactions into new blocks and verifies the work of other validators, contributing to the chain\u2019s secure operation.\n\nAs more ETH is staked, the network\u2019s resilience to attacks strengthens, as it would necessitate a larger amount of ETH to seize control over the majority of the network. To pose a significant threat, one would need to control most of the validators, thereby owning the majority of the system\u2019s ETH \u2013 a hefty requirement indeed!\n\nWhat the Proposed Changes Mean?\n\nThe proposition to raise the validator limit to 2,048 ETH is a monumental one, with far-reaching implications. This limit increase means that validators will need to stake a significantly higher amount of ETH to participate in the network\u2019s security and consensus mechanism.\n\nImplications for Ethereum Staking\n\nA New Power Dynamic\n\nThe proposed change could reshape the power dynamic within the Ethereum ecosystem. As the staking limit increases, the pool of potential validators will likely shrink to a more elite group who can afford to stake larger amounts of ETH. This shift could lead to centralization, an outcome that runs counter to the ethos of the decentralized blockchain movement.\n\nIncreased Security and Network Integrity\n\nOn the positive side, a higher staking requirement might lead to a more secure network. Validators, having more capital at risk, would be more incentivized to act honestly and maintain the network\u2019s integrity.\n\nThe Impact on Smaller Stakers\n\nThe significant increase in the staking limit may discourage smaller investors from becoming validators due to the increased financial commitment. Instead, they might opt to join staking pools, where several investors combine their resources to reach the new threshold.\n\nInfluence on Ethereum Price\n\nPotential Price Surge\n\nThe validator limit increase could potentially cause a surge in Ethereum\u2019s price. The demand for Ethereum might increase as validators compete to accumulate enough ETH to meet the higher staking requirements.\n\nMarket Stability\n\nThe proposal might also contribute to market stability. With more ETH locked away in the staking process, there would be less ETH circulating in the market, potentially reducing volatility.\n\nPossible Negative Impact\n\nHowever, this decision could also negatively affect the price if it\u2019s perceived as a move towards centralization. Ethereum\u2019s appeal partly lies in its decentralized nature. Any move towards centralization could decrease its attractiveness to investors, potentially negatively impacting the price.\n\nPros and Cons of Raising Validator Threshold\n\nAt present, the 32 ETH cap prevents validators from accruing interest on any staked ether beyond this figure. The modification suggested by Neuder seeks to eliminate this restriction, potentially unlocking several advantages for validators. Anticipated benefits include simplifying the staking infrastructure for major validators and enhancing the user experience if successfully applied. However, critics suggest that increasing the validator limit might contribute to network centralization, as it could enable substantial entities to wield an imbalanced share of power.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum developers\u2019 proposal to increase the validator limit is a major step that could significantly change the staking landscape and affect Ethereum\u2019s price. While the potential benefits include increased security and price stability, concerns remain about centralization and the impact on smaller stakers. As the Ethereum community reviews this proposal, these issues will undoubtedly be at the forefront of the discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Ethereum"

        "content": "Litecoin had 20 million more addresses than Ethereum as of press time.\n\nSeveral metrics looked bullish for LTC, as were the market indicators.\n\nLitecoin [LTC] has outperformed Ethereum [ETH] in a key metric, as per Glassnode. Notably, LTC\u2019s total addresses reached 200.7 million at press time,while ETH\u2019s figure stood at 181 million, which gave the former a lead of over 20 million addresses.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s LTC\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nOther metrics also revealed that the blockchain\u2019s performance was something to rejoice over. For instance, daily active addresses also spiked, reflecting increased usage. Besides that, LTC\u2018s velocity was up.\n\nAn increase in the metric meant that LTC was used in transactions more often within a set time frame. Moreover, daily on-chain transaction volume in profit also increased last week.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s price moved sideways\n\nThough the blockchain\u2019s network activity was on the rise, its price action did not follow the same trend, as it increased marginally last week. According to CoinMarketCap, LTC\u2019s price has risen by over 1% in the last seven days.\n\nAt press time, it was trading at $77.43, with a market capitalization of over $5.6 billion.\n\nHowever, LTC\u2019s whale activity remained high, as per Santiment\u2019s chart. Sentiment around LTC also improved last week, as evident from its weighted sentiment and social volume.\n\nInterestingly, Coinglass\u2019 data revealed that LTC\u2019s sideways trajectory might soon change. Litecoin\u2019s Open Interest has registered a decline since the beginning of June.\n\nA decline in that metric usually means that the ongoing price trend may end soon. Therefore, the possibility of LTC registering gains seemed likely.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 LTCs worth today?\n\nThis can be expected from LTC\n\nLTC\u2019s daily chart pointed out quite a few bullish market indicators, suggesting a price hike in the coming days. For instance, LTC\u2019s MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. Litecoin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick.\n\nIts Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed the same trend, increasing the chances of a northbound price movement in the coming days."

        "content": "As cryptocurrency prices soar, many investors are eyeing the Ethereum price during the crypto bull run.\n\nRecession is weakening fiat currencies in world economies. Cryptocurrencies are picking up steam. On the other hand, Ethereum, or ETH, stands out among cryptocurrency assets. It is boosted by the surging interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), which leverages algorithms and science-oriented cryptocurrencies to operate the blockchain. The Ethereum price is currently about US$1,700, down 62% from its peak of US$4,891, reached in November 2021. However, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has increased 49% over the past six months, showing a crypto bull run.\n\nThe Ethereum price is currently trading above the US$1,780 barrier. The price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent wave from the US$1,720 swing low to the US$1,873 high. The bulls\u2019 ability to keep the price above US$1,780 may pave the way for a move up to the US$1,850 resistance level. If US$1,850 is broken, the positive trend may continue to increase, and the price may move closer to the US$1,920 resistance level. Alternatively, a new collapse can begin if the bears drive the price below $1,780. Near $1,750 is the next significant support level, below which the cryptocurrency price may fall to reach the $1,720 support level.\n\nShould You Invest in Ethereum Now?\n\nWhile some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s price will likely fall over time, others indicate that it will likely continue to increase. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 is presently underway. The upgrade is anticipated to boost the scalability and security of the Ethereum network. If the update is effective, it might raise interest in Ethereum, raising the price. It is a blatant sign that experts believe now is the ideal moment to invest in Ethereum.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Despite its relatively recent launch, Ethscriptions has shown tremendous acceptance, evoking parallels with Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community, known for its unrelenting pursuit of experimentation and innovation, has a new brainchild\u2014Ethscriptions.\n\nEthscriptions is the latest protocol stirring interest in the Ethereum community. It leverages Ethereum\u2019s calldata to enable users to inscribe non-financial data directly onto the Ethereum main chain.\n\nDeveloped by Tom Lehman, co-founder of Genius.com, Ethscriptions offers a more decentralized and economical approach than the conventional contract storage method.\n\nIntroducing Ethscriptions: a new way of creating and sharing digital artifacts on Ethereum using transaction calldata.https://t.co/XfQ7RdtblD\n\n\n\nALSO: Introducing Ethereum Punks. Because why should all non-contract Punk collecting happen on Bitcoin?https://t.co/d3Ycwbdc2Z\u2026 \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 16, 2023\n\nBy leveraging Ethereum\u2019s calldata, Ethscriptions allows users to inscribe non-financial data under 96 kilobytes in size, primarily images at present, directly onto the Ethereum main chain.\n\nText Ethscriptions\n\n\n\nCurrently the https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS tool only allows you to ethscribe images.\n\n\n\nBut the protocol itself allows all data URIs!\n\n\n\nEg, you can do text like this \"data:,middlemarch\".\n\n\n\nTrivia: the shortest possible Ethscription is \"data:,\" pic.twitter.com/IhjR6APKkE \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s the literary equivalent of etching a message in stone\u2014a message that will remain etched in the vast digital landscape of Ethereum.\n\nWith an overwhelming response from the community, close to 30,000 Ethscriptions were created within 18 hours of the protocol\u2019s launch. This dynamic debut echoes the launch of Ordinals on Bitcoin, marking another pivotal moment in the blockchain world.\n\nWith almost 30k Ethscriptions in <18 hours, the launch was a huge success!\n\n\n\nThank you for seeing the massive potential here!\n\n\n\nI am on Ethscriptions 24/7, but I need your help!\n\n\n\nDM @proroketh to join our protocol Twitter chat. Ideas, bug reports, NO alpha, NO trading, NERDS ONLY! pic.twitter.com/udKdsVT0L8 \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nEthscriptions vs. Ordinals: a tale of two protocols\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Ordinals and Ethereum\u2019s Ethscriptions were born from a shared vision: to expand blockchain beyond mere financial transactions.\n\nWhile Ordinals marked the Bitcoin network\u2019s foray into the world of non-financial data inscriptions, Ethscriptions, albeit similar, bring a fresh perspective to the Ethereum network.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin Ordinals upgrade addresses \u2018cursed inscriptions\u2019 issue\n\nWhile both protocols reflect innovation, the community\u2019s response is a stark difference. The introduction of Ordinals faced pushback from some Bitcoin maximalists, resistant to deviating from Bitcoin\u2019s primary function as a financial asset.\n\nIt appears that there's an \"attack\" on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ordinal gang/ Big blockers? Are pushing random inscriptions and pay high fees.\n\nThey clog the mempool and increase overall fees to include a transaction in the block.\n\n\n\nWhat is unclear is, what is the purpose?\n\nThey are, at this\u2026 \u2014 Toma B (@Toma_7_32) May 7, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum community embraced Ethscriptions with open arms. Ethereum\u2019s culture of innovation and experimentation could explain this acceptance, as it has always positioned itself as a \u2018world computer\u2019 and a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) rather than just a currency.\n\nOrdinals and Ethscriptions use different methods to inscribe data. Ordinals rely on Bitcoin\u2019s transaction data, whereas Ethscriptions leverages Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccalldata.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s approach is seen as more decentralized and cost-effective than using contract storage, a significant point of difference.\n\nIt's cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\n\n\nAlso protocol guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions!\n\n\n\nPlus it's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nOrdinals allow various inscriptions, including artwork, profile pictures, and playable games. Ethscriptions, although currently limited to image-only inscriptions, intends to expand to accommodate different file types, potentially leading to broader applications.\n\nA notable implication of both protocols is the potential rise in transaction costs. Bitcoin saw an increase in transaction fees with the advent of Ordinals, a likely scenario for Ethereum with Ethscriptions, especially given Ethereum\u2019s already high transaction fees.\n\nThe community response and potential implications\n\nAn undeniable indicator of the community\u2019s excitement about this groundbreaking venture is the launch of Ethereum Punks, a collection of non-contract punks similar to those on the Bitcoin network. All 10,000 inscriptions were claimed almost immediately post-launch.\n\nHowever, this high activity level resulted in occasional downtime and necessitated Lehman\u2019s assurances to the community about the project\u2019s technical stability.\n\nEthereum\u2019s innovation doesn\u2019t come without implications. The launch of Ethscriptions could result in an upswing in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees.\n\nBut do not let this dissuade you. Increased transaction fees incentivize miners to sustain their efforts, ultimately fortifying the security of the decentralized platforms.\n\nThis measure is crucial, considering Ethereum tops the chart as the most expensive chain for transactions and development.\n\nFuture of Ethscriptions\n\nThe narrative of Ethscriptions may have just begun, but its potential ramifications are colossal. Users can only inscribe images, but Lehman hints at a future where different file types could be uploaded.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of Ethscriptions illuminates the continued push for innovation and the endless quest for improved functionalities within the blockchain universe.\n\nWhile some argue that similar technologies have existed for years, Ethscriptions\u2019 swift adoption and awareness underline a newfound appreciation for such initiatives.\n\nWhether Ethscriptions will continue to make waves or become a transient ripple in the blockchain pond depends on the ongoing community engagement and adoption.\n\nFor now, Ethereum\u2019s innovative spirit remains undeterred, continuously seeking new territories to explore in the expansive universe of blockchain.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Web3 usernames may see greater adoption due to recent advancements - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ever since the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) was launched in 2017, Web3 users have been able to replace the long strings of characters that make up a crypto address with a more easily memorized blockchain username or Web3 domain name. For example, Ethereum users can now send crypto to the network\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, at his username, vitalik.eth, without knowing that his address is 0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045.\n\nBut despite this advancement making it much easier to identify users, hardly anyone has taken advantage of it. There are over 200 million unique addresses on Ethereum, yet only 2.2 million .eth names were registered as of January. This means that at least 97% of Ethereum addresses are not associated with an ENS username.\n\nThis lack of usernames creates user experience problems in the Web3 ecosystem. Just imagine if early email addresses had consisted of long strings of characters that looked like 0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428 or 0x3A7937851d67Ee2f51C959663749093Dc87D9C9a. If this had been the case, email may not have survived as a practice.\n\nBut despite this initial lack of adoption, there is some evidence that the tide may be turning in favor of Web3 usernames. A few recent advancements in wallet and messaging apps may onboard more users than ever before.\n\nOne of these advancements is better wallet integration with free usernames.\n\nWallet integration and free usernames\n\nWallets have had the ability to understand Web3 names for a long time. According to MetaMask\u2019s changelog, it introduced the ability to send to a .eth name in October 2017, right after ENS launched. Other wallets have followed suit with this feature, including Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet and others. Some of these wallets have also integrated with ENS rivals Unstoppable Domains, Space ID, Bonfida and others.\n\nHowever, these wallets still show a crypto address to users by default, as new users don\u2019t typically receive names automatically.\n\nUnstoppable Domains interface. Source: Unstoppable Domains\n\nFor a user to receive crypto via their Web3 name, they need to first register a username with a particular name provider. This means figuring out which provider to use, navigating to the provider\u2019s interface and going through the registration process.\n\nTo make matters worse, names can be expensive. ENS names typically cost $5 and expire after a year, while Unstoppable Domains names that do not need to be renewed typically cost from $20\u2013$40. Compare this with how easy it is to sign up for an email address for free using Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo, and it\u2019s easy to see why most crypto users don\u2019t have a Web3 username.\n\nA few wallet apps have been trying to solve this problem by giving away free domain names to their users. For example, Coinbase Wallet allows new users to register a single .cb.id username for free once per year, and Kresus wallet offers its users a free .kresus username of up to eight characters.\n\nThis practice of giving out free usernames has begun only recently. And some popular wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask still don\u2019t offer the feature. But as more users onboard to the Web3 ecosystem, this may lead to greater adoption of Web3 usernames over time.\n\nAnother recent advancement is instant messaging integration.\n\nChat messaging with Web3 usernames\n\nSome messaging apps have begun implementing Web3 names as usernames, increasing these names\u2019 utility beyond the payments use case. One example is Blockscan Chat, which allows users to send instant messages to any Ethereum address or ENS username.\n\nBlockscan Chat interface. Source: Blockscan\n\nMessages that are sent using Blockscan Chat produce alerts on the Etherscan block explorer. If the recipient sees the alert and logs into the app, they can read it. The app\u2019s developer claims that all of its messages are end-to-encrypted. So, although anyone can see if a particular user has received a message, only the sender and recipient can read it.\n\nWeb3 usernames aren\u2019t an absolute necessity for using Blockscan Chat, as it does allow users to send messages to crypto addresses. But names do make it much easier for users to find each other in the app.\n\nGrill.chat interface showing .eth names. Source: Grill.chat\n\nAnother example is Grill.chat, a messaging app running on the Subsocial network. When a user first signs up for it, they are assigned a random username. But they can optionally attach an Ethereum wallet to their account. If they do this, the app automatically converts their random username into their .eth username.\n\nBeing able to find other users to chat with via their Web3 usernames is arguably a more useful feature than being able to send crypto with them.\n\nAfter all, the crypto community is still small. If a crypto user needs money from friends or family, they may be better off using traditional Web2 apps like Venmo or Apple Pay, as their friends and family may not know how to use a Web3 wallet. But if a person wants to chat specifically about crypto and Web3 apps, being able to look them up by their username could turn out to be a huge advantage. This added use case may entice more users to adopt Web3 names in the future.\n\nAnother recent advancement in Web3 names is cross-chain names.\n\nCross-chain Web3 names\n\nWhen Web3 names were first invented, ENS was the only protocol that could be used to create them, and it could only be used on Ethereum.\n\nBut the Web3 ecosystem has since grown to encompass many different chains. And as the number of chains has grown, so has the number of naming protocols. Users can now register Polygon usernames from Unstoppable Domains, Solana ones from Bonfida, and both Arbitrum One and BNB Chain names from Space ID.\n\nThis fragmentation across chains can make integration difficult for wallets and block explorers, and confuse users. For example, suppose a person\u2019s Polygon username is newton.crypto. But when they go to register the same name on BNB Chain, they find that newton.bnb is already taken, so they register einstein.bnb instead. When a user looks at this person\u2019s address on a block explorer, either name could appear, depending on which one the developer of the block explorer has chosen to display. And regardless of which one is displayed, it could confuse users.\n\nIn this case, for example, if a user wants to send crypto to newton.crypto via BNB Chain, they may easily send it to newton.bnb instead, which will turn out to be the wrong recipient.\n\nA few Web3 companies are trying to fix this problem by creating a single name for each identity across multiple chains. For example, the Redefined app allows users to register for a username on Arbitrum One and use it to receive funds on Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Bitcoin, Moonbeam, Near, or any EVM-compatible chain.\n\nTo make this feature possible, the Redefined app lets the user write an address or username for each network into the Arbitrum smart contract through a \u201cmanage\u201d tab within the app. Once the addresses are listed in the contract, any person can initiate a transaction to the correct address using a \u201csend\u201d function within the app. To send funds, the sender only needs to know the recipient\u2019s Redefined username, not the recipient\u2019s name or address on any particular chain.\n\nRedefined usernames begin with an @ and do not have extensions. For example, @newton and @einstein are possible Redefined usernames. The protocol also features an aggregator SDK that wallets and other apps can use to integrate with these usernames.\n\nDid.id, also called \u201c.bit,\u201d is a similar project that runs on the Nervos Network. It allows users to register for a .bit username that works across 39 different networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, Internet Computer and many others. Registration can be done directly with a Nervos Network wallet or indirectly using Polygon.\n\nDid.id doesn\u2019t feature a user interface with a \u201csend\u201d function. However, it is integrated with nine different wallet apps, including imToken, Tokenpocket, MathWallet, Huobi Wallet, Bitkeep, HyperPay, AlphaWallet, ViaWallet, and MIBAO. So it\u2019s available to senders who use these wallets.\n\nCross-chain usernames are yet another new development that may spur greater adoption of Web3 usernames over time.\n\nWhen will usernames catch on?\n\nDespite these advancements, it\u2019s still not clear how long mass adoption of Web3 usernames will take. Right now, over 90% of Web3 addresses are not associated with any username. So there is a huge hill to climb in terms of adoption. And in the meantime, users still need to cut and paste a complicated string of characters to find a person\u2019s Web3 identity.\n\nThere is also still plenty of friction left for users, including the continuing high cost of registering a name for users of most wallet apps.\n\nEven so, these advancements may pave the way for the mass adoption of Web3 usernames at some point in the future."

        "content": "A zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup designed to scale Ethereum, Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era, is experiencing rapid growth in terms of capital. According to L2Beat data, the total value locked (TVL) on zkSync Era surpassed $500 million on Monday, marking a 12% increase within a week.\n\nzkSync Era\u2019s TVL hits new record high above $500 million (L2Beat)\n\nzKsync Era is the third-largest rollup in terms of total value locked, trailing behind Arbitrum and Optimism. It provides scalability to Ethereum while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual machine(EVM) and supporting native account abstraction.\n\nAs of now, zkSyne has locked over 220,000 ether (ETH) worth approximately $378.3 million around 121 million USDC (a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar), and 14.43 million MUTE tokens valued at $7.53 million. MUTE is the native cryptocurrency of Mute, a decentralized exchange based on ZkRollup.\n\nThe number of daily active addresses on zkSync has been steadily increasing since May, averaging 175,000 over the past four weeks. zkSync was launched in March 2023.\n\nRecently, Rocketpool, a liquidity-staking solution, went live on zkSync Era, joining the growing list of decentralized applications migrating to the layer 2 platforms. The rising demand for rollups can be attributed to Ethereum core developers\u2019 focus on implementing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, as noted by Galaxy Digital.\n\nEIP 4844 introduced a new transaction type to Ethereum that accepts data \u201cblobs,\u201d aiming to reduce transaction fees on rollups. The prioritization of EIP 7844 in Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Cancun/Deneb upgrade, expected to activate in the Fall or Winter next year. Dapps built on Ethereum are expected to gradually migrate the majority of their operations to more cost-effective rollups.\n\nAlex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital, highlighted this in a newsletter dated June 2, emphasizing the importance of rollups for Ethereum\u2019s scalability and the need for dapps to adapt to a more cost-effective solution."

        "content": "On June 19, Ethereum block explorer and analytics platform Etherscan launched a new tool dubbed \u201cCode Reader\u201d that utilizes artificial intelligence to retrieve and interpret the source code of a specific contract address. After a user inputs a prompt, Code Reader generates a response via OpenAI\u2019s large language model, providing insight into the contract\u2019s source code files. The tool\u2019s tutorial page reads:\n\n\u201cTo use the tool, you need a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. This tool does not store your API keys.\u201d\n\nCode Reader\u2019s use cases include gaining deeper insight into contracts\u2019 code via AI-generated explanations, obtaining comprehensive lists of smart contract functions related to Ethereum data, and understanding how the underlying contract interacts with decentralized applications. \u201cOnce the contract files are retrieved, you can choose a specific source code file to read through. Additionally, you may modify the source code directly inside the UI before sharing it with the AI,\u201d the page says.\n\nA demonstration of the Code Reader tool. Source: Etherscan\n\nAmid an AI boom, some experts have cautioned on the feasibility of current AI models. According to a recent report published by Singaporean venture capital firm Foresight Ventures, \u201ccomputing power resources will be the next big battlefield for the coming decade.\u201d That said, despite growing demand for training large AI models in decentralized distributed computing power networks, researchers say current prototypes face significant constraints such as complex data synchronization, network optimization, data privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn one example, the Foresight researchers noted that the training of a large model with 175 billion parameters with single-precision floating-point representation would require around 700 gigabytes. However, distributed training requires these parameters to be frequently transmitted and updated between computing nodes. In the case of 100 computing nodes and each node needing to update all parameters at each unit step, the model would require transmitting 70 terabytes of data per second, far exceeding the capacity of most networks. The researchers summarized:\n\n\u201cIn most scenarios, small AI models are still a more feasible choice, and should not be overlooked too early in the tide of FOMO [fear of missing out] on large models.\u201d"

        "content": "From the primeval swamps of the crypto landscape, a new king has been crowned: the DigiToad. As investors diversify their portfolios, they are leaping into the DigiToads (TOADS) ecosystem with unparalleled enthusiasm. The presale of this deflationary meme-coin was a roaring success, raising more than $4.8 million and selling over 306 million tokens, translating to a staggering 89.92% of the available TOADS.\n\nWhat draws investors to the DigiToads? The allure lies in the unique blend of gamification, community-building, and forward-thinking economics, designed to empower holders and enrich the ecosystem as a whole. At the heart of the DigiToads initiative is the commitment to resourcefulness, symbolized by the resilient toad.\n\nToad Economics plays an essential role in the project\u2019s appeal. The total supply of 585 million $TOADS tokens has been meticulously allocated to ensure the sustainable growth and long-term prosperity of the ecosystem. This includes a provision for community bonuses, project launch, liquidity pool, development, and team tokens.\n\nThe DigiToads platform incentivizes long-term holding through a novel tax system, which applies to transactions entering and leaving the ecosystem. A 7% buy and sell tax contributes to a token burn, an NFT staking pool, a liquidity pool, and the treasury, creating a constant stimulus for the ecosystem\u2019s circulation.\n\nThe staking of DigiToads NFTs presents a lucrative opportunity for investors. Staking allows holders to earn a percentage of the staking pool, fostering both dedication and loyalty among toad \u2018aficionados\u2019. The token price currently stands at $0.042, an attractive entry point for both seasoned and novice investors seeking to ride the wave of this burgeoning ecosystem.\n\nThe token burn integrated into DigiToads introduces an innate deflationary factor. This means that the fixed max supply becomes a perpetually reducing circulating supply, creating a scarcity effect on the number of TOADS tokens. Such a system offers a significant upside for long-term holders of the token, potentially leading to significant returns on investment.\n\nMoreover, DigiToads extends beyond the financial realm into environmental responsibility. They are pledging 2.5% of all profits to charities that help in the replantation of trees and homes for Amazonian species, tying in financial prosperity with global conservation.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) vs Crypto Incumbents\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, SHIB, and Dogecoin have been crypto frontrunners for years, but even they carry significant weaknesses that DigiToads has successfully addressed. Bitcoin\u2019s high energy consumption, transaction fees, and slow processing speeds can often deter potential investors. Ethereum, despite its smart contract capabilities, suffers from scalability issues and high gas fees. Ripple has faced legal issues and lacks decentralization. SHIB, while popular, has limited utility, and Dogecoin\u2019s unlimited supply introduces inflationary risks.\n\nIn contrast, DigiToads\u2019 deflationary model addresses these issues head-on, offering a sustainable alternative. The DigiToads ecosystem is designed to be self-sustaining and self-propagating, fueled by a deflationary tokenomics model that ensures a constantly decreasing circulating supply.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nWrapping Up\n\nDigiToads is proving to be a force to be reckoned with in the crypto world. Its successful presale, innovative economic model, engaging NFT staking system, and commitment to environmental conservation put it on a promising trajectory. It seamlessly intertwines financial growth with community-building and ecological responsibility, thus outshining Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, SHIB, and Dogecoin.\n\nWith over 89.92% of its tokens already sold, this outstanding level of initial support demonstrates a vibrant and enthusiastic community that believes in the mission and potential of DigiToads. This is not just a digital currency or an NFT collection \u2013 it\u2019s a promising ecosystem underpinned by a compelling narrative, high potential for returns, and a community-driven approach, well poised to disrupt the crypto landscape. This is the dawn of the Toad\u2019s reign in the crypto swamp, and you don\u2019t want to be left out!\n\nFor more information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum users are being given a fresh way to create nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets on the blockchain following the launch of a new protocol called \"Ethscriptions.\"\n\nLaunched on June 17 by music website Genius.com's co-founder Tom Lehman, Ethscriptions aims to revolutionize Ethereum-based digital asset creation and was quickly met with a high degree of enthusiasm, generating almost 30,000 Ethscriptions within the first 18 hours.\n\nTaking inspiration from the popular Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals protocol \u2014 where assets are known as \u201cinscriptions\u201d \u2014 Ethscriptions promises to enhance the way digital assets are minted on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Protocol: Leveraging Ethereum's Calldata for Improved Minting\n\nLehman, who is also known by the pseudonym Middlemarch on Twitter, declared the project a \"huge success.\" Ethscriptions employs Ethereum's \"calldata,\" which refers to the data held within a smart contract, to allow for a \"cheaper\" and \"more decentralized\" minting process compared to conventional smart contract-based methods.\n\nAt present, the protocol limits users to image-only inscriptions, but Lehman assures that Ethscriptions will accommodate different file types in the future. Current protocol specifications permit users to \"ethscribe\" any image provided it's less than 96 kilobytes in size.\n\nLehman\u2019s first project on the Ethscriptions protocol, the \"Ethereum Punks,\" witnessed a significantly positive response from the community. All 10,000 assets were claimed almost instantaneously, reinforcing the positive acceptance of the protocol by the community.\n\nChallenges and Potential: Navigating the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nDespite the initial success, the project's launch caused so much user activity that the API interface for the official Ethscriptions website temporarily crashed, indicating possible infrastructure challenges.\n\nGiven the existing infrastructure that enables the creation of NFTs and other digital assets on the Ethereum network, it remains uncertain whether Ethscriptions will achieve the same level of popularity as Bitcoin Ordinals. Within six months, the total number of Ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin skyrocketed from zero to 10 million, driven primarily by users' fascination with minting assets and the novelty of minting entirely new tokens through the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe launch of the Ethscriptions protocol on Ethereum presents a significant development for digital asset creation on the blockchain. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and innovate, and it becomes clearer over this period that initiatives like Ethscriptions could potentially introduce new dynamics and possibilities. While the immediate impact is promising, the long-term success of this novel approach to asset creation remains to be seen.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTether, the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, has minted the second 1 billion token on the Ethereum blockchain in less than two months.\n\nThe stablecoin issuer has said that the new mint is part of its \"inventory replenish\" program to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains. In other crypto developments, Tradecurve has been building momentum as investors flock to the new trading platform that has the potential to rekindle interest in the DeFi space.\n\nTether Mints Additional 1 Billion USDT\n\nTether\u2019s treasury has announced the minting of 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain just two months after a separate 1 billion USDT token was minted. So far in 2023, the stablecoin issuer has now minted over $16 billion worth of USDT tokens. Tether remains the most dominant USD-pegged stablecoin with a market cap of $83 billion.\n\nAnnouncing the latest mint, Tether\u2019s CTO Paolo Ardoino, explained that the tokens were minted for chain swap and not due to a rising interest in the purchase of digital assets. Chain swap refers to the process of sending digital assets (in this case USDT) from one blockchain network to another \u2013 bridging assets across multiple blockchains.\n\nAfter the mint, on-chain data showed that Tether\u2019s Treasury sent $750 million worth of USDT in a chain swap transaction to Binance. According to Arkham Intelligence, the popular blockchain analytical firm, the Tether Treasury sent the funds in three separate batches of $250 million transactions after an initial $10 test transaction.\n\nThe analytical firm later reported that of the $1 billion new tokens minted, only $146 million remains on the Ethereum blockchain as the others have been swapped for USDT on other chains.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Price Set to Hit $0.018\n\nAlong with the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin sectors, Tradecurve has enjoyed increasing attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tradecurve is building the first DeFi platform where its users will have the opportunity to trade both cryptocurrencies and derivatives (like stocks, forex, options, and commodities) from a single account.\n\nExperts are bullish that the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) could easily jump above its current $0.018 price because of the magnitude of the derivatives markets. The Bank for International Settlements reports that in June 2022, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market rose to $632 trillion.\n\nThe bullish predictions for the price of Tradecurve come from the platform\u2019s potential to connect the crypto market with the global derivatives market.\n\nExperts believe the Tradecurve platform could rekindle interest in the DeFi space as crypto traders would no longer need to open more than one account to trade global financial instruments. As more traders enter into the Tradecurve ecosystem, experts predict that the price of TCRV could jump from $0.018 to as high as $1.5 by the end of 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nXRP price has increased 6% over the weekend, reversing some of the losses seen last week, once traders digested the contents of the Hinman documents.\n\nCrypto fund manager Thomas Kralow set a bullish target of $30 for XRP, citing the altcoin\u2019s potential for higher market activity.\n\nXRP has seen 200% gain in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020.\n\nXRP price recovered over the weekend after the release of the Hinman documents led to a broad sell-off of Ripple\u2019s token last week, as increasing uncertainty on how these papers can help the payment giant in its lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) weighed on the asset.\n\nThe token trades at $0.4870, early on Monday, up 5.8% from Friday\u2019s low of $0.4601, but still under the $0.53 region it moved before the release of the Hinman documents.\n\nSpeculation surrounding the release of the Hinman documents could push XRP price up to the $30 bullish target in the short term, Kralow Capital founder and manager Thomas Kralow says in an interview, few months ahead of a key ruling which is set to determine the fate of Ripple\u2019s token.\n\nThe release of Hinman documents on June 13, a key element in the legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, as well as the reaction of the company\u2019s legal team has fueled speculation among XRP holders. Moreover, some of altcoin's on-chain indicators show that XRP is undervalued at the current price, $0.4870 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP losses mount as traders digest Hinman documents\n\nXRP gains 200% in value against Bitcoin\n\nXRP price has declined significantly from its June 13 peak of $0.5661. The altcoin wiped out its gains as holders digested the contents of Hinman documents release. XRP holders are awaiting a ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case and the outcome could make or break the altcoin\u2019s price trend.\n\nHowever, XRP has gained 200% in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020. This development fuels a bullish thesis for XRP price recovery and hints at likely bullish trend reversal in the asset in the short term.\n\nXRP/BTC price chart\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the next key support is at $0.4518, a level that represents its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s price has sustained above the $0.4500 level for over a month. If recent history repeats, XRP is likely to experience a rebound and recover from support at $0.4518.\n\nCrypto fund manager sets $30 target for XRP price\n\nXRP price is largely influenced by the SEC lawsuit against payment giant Ripple. The XRP holder community therefore closely watches the updates to determine the direction in which the altcoin is headed.\n\nIn response to the release of the Hinman documents, the contents of which are key to Ripple\u2019s defense against the SEC, XRP price rallied to $0.5649 on Tuesday. However, XRP price has settled below $0.4853 since then, wiping out its weekly gains.\n\nFind out more about Hinman documents here.\n\nThe three main factors fueling speculative narratives for XRP are: contents of the Hinman documents \u2013 internal messages and email exchanges among executives of the agency \u2013, SEC former Director William Hinman\u2019s comments on Ethereum in his 2018 speech and the regulator\u2019s stance on XRP as a security.\n\nThomas Kralow, crypto hedge fund manager at Kralow Capital, said to FXStreet that these factors could fuel further speculation, driving XRP price higher within the next three to four months.\n\nKralow weighed in on the rising interest among crypto market participants. Based on data from Google trends, searches for XRP have doubled in the last month, signaling an increase in interest among traders worldwide.\n\nKrakow told FXStreet:\n\nCurrently, we observe huge speculative narratives around Ripple, which could potentially lead to a significant price increase for XRP in the next three to four months, pushing its value to anywhere between $10 and $30.\n\nOver the past thirty days, XRP price climbed 15.32%, from $0.4190 to $0.4832 on Binance. Data from Google trends reveals further potential for market activity, Kralow says, setting a bullish target of $30 per token within the next three to four months.\n\nThe manager and founder of Kralow Capital identified two factors that could make or break XRP\u2019s rally within the next three months.\n\nRipple\u2019s IPO: Ripple and its executives have shared their desire to take the payment remittance firm public from time to time during the lawsuit. Ripple\u2019s IPO could act as a key milestone and a bullish catalyst for XRP price given the token is native to the giant\u2019s XRPLedger.\n\nRipple\u2019s win against the SEC: Ripple\u2019s win against the SEC, or a settlement between the two parties, drawing the conclusion that XRP isn\u2019t a security could propel the altcoin to a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to crypto influencers and Ripple proponents closely following the lawsuit, a ruling is expected before September 30 this year. XRP holders could expect an increase in demand closer to the ruling.\n\nKralow set a minimum of $10 and a cap of $30 as price targets for XRP ahead of the ruling.\n\nOn-chain metric signals XRP is undervalued\n\nThe Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is an on-chain metric that shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of a certain asset. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more profitable it is to sell the token at the current market price, giving an idea of how overvalued or undervalued an asset is.\n\nMVRV chart for XRP\n\nWith an MVRV ratio of -2.8% on Monday, XRP is undervalued at a price of $0.4870, implying there is bullish potential in XRP."

Crypto is also much harder to steal, so once your money is with the casino, there\u2019s hardly any chance it\u2019ll get lost. Because of this, we evaluate sites that accept more cryptos better, as you\u2019ll have less reason to use fiat. Also see our guide to Bitcoin poker sites.\n\nRange of Poker Games\n\nThe more distinct poker games a site has, the higher the chances you\u2019ll find your perfect game. We\u2019ve prioritized sites that offer a balance between the different kinds of online poker games out there. Naturally, we\u2019ve looked at the quality, payouts, and popularity of these games. After all, the best multiplayer poker games might as well not exist if nobody\u2019s playing.\n\nFast Deposits & Withdrawals\n\nWhen you win at a game, you want to be able to collect your winnings as quickly as possible. Similarly, nobody wants to wait hours for a deposit to clear, because of this, we gave priority to sites known for quick withdrawals and deposits.\n\nCrypto Bonuses & Promos\n\nOne of the benefits of crypto betting is getting to reap all kinds of benefits and promotions that come with depositing crypto. These include welcome bonuses, special cryptocurrency promotions, and more. Naturally, sites that rewarded its users with more digital currency and better benefits placed higher on our list.\n\nLow Crypto Banking Fees\n\nSome sites will charge relatively high fees for crypto deposits. Since crypto is an all-round superior and more efficient way to pay than fiat, we\u2019ve prioritized sites with little to no crypto banking fees.\n\nEthereum Video Poker vs Live Poker\n\nNewer players might be confused on what the difference is in playing on one of the best Ethereum video poker sites or playing a live game. Truth be told, there are fairly few similarities between the two. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\nMost video poker games are more similar to poker-themed slots than live poker. As a singleplayer endeavor, video poker is designed so that the house will win over the long haul. This means that machines are configured to a so-called \u201cpayback percentage\u201d of your expected returns with perfect play, so a 10 ETH deposit at a 95% playback percentage will return 9.5 ETH.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a lot of variation in video poker games, most of them consist of the machine dealing 5 cards to the player and then discarding any number of them to make their hand better. However, most games are tuned to a sub-100% payback percentage, meaning you\u2019ll be losing money with perfect play. However, certain kinds like Deuces Wild will sometimes have a payback percentage over 100%, meaning you\u2019ll make money with perfect play.\n\nThe skills used in either game are also different. Live poker relies heavily on bluffing, reading other players etc. and your method of making money is to outskill them. Meanwhile, in video poker, the main skill you need to have is the ability to gauge the mathematically optimal play, as there are no other live players. All in all, live poker and video poker are entirely different beasts, although both of them are extremely fun to play.\n\n>>>Claim Your Bonuses Now<<<\n\nBest Ethereum Poker Games\n\nNow that you know the difference between video poker and live poker, let\u2019s go over some of the most popular video poker variations you can play on the best Ethereum video poker sites.\n\nJacks or Better\n\nJacks or Better is the simplest and most beginner-friendly form of video poker. Its payback percentage is usually around 99.5%, and the lowest paid hand is its namesake- Jacks or Better, meaning a set of at least 2 Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces. Bets are paid out evenly, meaning that if your hand has jacks or better at the end, you get winnings equal to your bet.\n\nOftentimes, Jacks or Better variations will let you participate in a bonus game at the end of each hand, giving you 5 cards, 1 of which is face up, and the rest face down. If you guess which of the 4 face down cards has a higher value than the revealed one, you double your winnings.\n\nDeuces Wild\n\nDeuces Wild is one of the most common video poker options you can play profitably. Much like Jacks or Better, it comes in a lot of different forms and takes advantage of a 52-card single deck. The most interesting gimmick with this style of video poker game is well, the Deuces or two. They can be used to complete any winning hand by replacing any card dealt. The lowest hand in this kind of video poker is three of a kind, and is paid out evenly, a four of a kind is paid out at 5 times the bet, and a five of a kind gets you 15 times your bet.\n\nProgressive Jackpot Video Poker\n\nProgressive jackpot poker is another interesting kind of video poker. Here, a winning hand doesn\u2019t have a fixed payout, but rather a raising jackpot. A percentage of each bet is added to the jackpot pool, and the pool is reset once the jackpot is won. This is one of the harder kinds of video poker to calculate a payback percentage for and play optimally, however, if you\u2019re able to do it, payback percentages over 100% aren\u2019t too rare.\n\nBonus Poker\n\nBonus poker is a Jacks or Better variation where payouts for some four of a kind hands, like four Aces, gets a higher payout. The lowest paying hand is still two Jacks, and the rest are ranked similarly to Jacks or Better, with some four of a kind hands getting paid out at 4x or even 8x. Usually, the payback percentage for this kind of game is around 99%, however, occasionally you\u2019ll find variations paying over 100%.\n\nJoker Poker\n\nJoker poker is fairly similar to deuces wild, in that there\u2019s a wildcard, however, it comes in addition to your hand, making it possible to form five of a kind hands. The lowest paying hand is adjusted accordingly, being a pair of Kings or better. This kind of video poker usually has a payback percentage around 98-99%, however, some variations pay out over 100% with completely optimal play.\n\nEthereum Poker Site Betting Bonuses\n\nThere are a variety of different betting bonuses you can get on the best Ethereum poker sites. Let\u2019s go over the biggest ones.\n\nMatch Bonuses\n\nMatch bonuses are present at many online casinos, and some of the best Ethereum poker sites will use this kind of bonus. A match bonus is one of the best kinds of bonuses for poker players, as you don\u2019t have to spend time playing slots or similar games, and can just focus on poker.\n\nFree Bets\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to play some free Ethereum poker, then you\u2019ll be best off looking to play at casinos offering free bets as part of their welcome bonus. Some would also consider Ethereum poker freeroll tournaments to be a form of free bets, as you can get into freeroll tournaments for free and earn money. Our best Ethereum poker site \u2013 CoinPoker, hosts these on the regular.\n\nFree Spins\n\nOne of the most common forms of bonus are free spin bonuses, these bonuses will give you several free spins on a casino\u2019s slots games of choice. Occasionally, these free spins will have a limit on the earnings you can collect form them, and might expire after some time, so make sure to check the casino\u2019s terms and conditions before using them.\n\nPoker Chips\n\nSome crypto casinos might offer poker chips directly as a welcome bonus. However, this is fairly rare, and is in many cases inferior to a match bonus, as a match bonus is flexible with how much you want to invest into poker. On the other hand, poker chip bonuses are fairly rigid, with you getting the same amount of chips for 1 mBTC and 1 BTC.\n\nNo Deposit Bonuses\n\nTo redeem bonuses at most crypto casinos, you\u2019ll need to deposit crypto into the casino. This way, the casino only gives you a bonus once you\u2019ve deposited your funds into it. No deposit bonuses are, like the name suggests, a kind of bonus where you don\u2019t need to deposit anything before getting access to your bonus. Sometimes, casinos will even let you use this bonus before depositing to gamble on their games.\n\n>>>Claim Your Bonuses Now<<<\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet for Poker\n\nTo play Ethereum poker, you\u2019ll need to have a wallet that can hold your Ethereum.

For instance, although players are offered a 100% matched deposit bonus, the highest reward available is only $100. This is accompanied by 100 free spins that can be used on slot games.\n\nHowever, when considering that the minimum deposit is only $20, Hell Spin might be preferred by players who want to start with modest amounts. After the first deposit, each crypto payment made to the platform will earn a reload bonus of 50%, up to $200.\n\nPros\n\n? Welcome package offers free spins and a matched deposit bonus\n\n? Reload bonuses for returning players\n\n? Fun and friendly interface\n\nCons\n\n?

This is where Thunderpick shines the most.\n\nPlayers can also find betting available for a wide range of tournaments and markets across a host of eSports titles. This includes Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty, League of Legends, and more. Its casino section also comes with a huge selection of over 1,000 slot titles, as well as card and table games.\n\nHowever, Thunderpick\u2019s welcome is not as attractive as other Ethereum gambling sites in this space.

It allows players to place wagers on live and virtual sporting events using crypto.\n\nPlatforms such as BC.Game, Cloudbet, and Thunderpick support sports betting across a wide range of popular leagues and championships.\n\nCasino Gambling\n\nCasino games encompass varieties such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, pachinko, and many others. All of the best Ethereum casino sites discussed today support this kind of casino game category.\n\nHowever, the varieties offered will vary from one platform to the next. BC.Game, for example, offers more than 2,700 games including slots and live table games such as poker and blackjack with real dealers.\n\nLottery Gambling\n\nMany new Ethereum gambing platforms have also started adding crypto lotteries to their offerings.\n\nUnlike the traditional kind, crypto lotteries are run based on blockchain technology, which means that the outcome is secured and provably fair.\n\nTo play, users can simply buy a ticket and choose their favorite numbers. And if the same numbers come up during the draw, the player will win a prize.\n\nPoker Gambling\n\nAlthough a card game based largely on skill, poker still falls under the category of gambling. And as such, there are many Ethereum gambling sites that feature video poker games.\n\nAdditionally, some Ethereum gambing platforms also host live poker tournaments.\n\nDice Gambling\n\nIn dice gambling games, players try to predict whether they will roll a number higher or lower than the previous one. In most cases, the best Ethereum gambling sites offer dice games that are backed by provably fair.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nHow we Select the Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nWondering how we selected and ranked the best Ethereum gambling sites for this guide?\n\nRead on to learn about our methodology and what we look for in a crypto-centric casino site\n\nSecure Crypto Payments\n\nNeedless to say, security was our primary concern when choosing the top Ethereum betting platforms for this comparison guide.\n\nAll of the platforms we reviewed today offer secure payment options, not only for digital tokens such as Ethereum but also for fiat currency deposits.\n\nMoreover, when making crypto payments, users do not need to go through any KYC process \u2013 which can be an advantage for many.\n\nFast Deposits & Withdrawals\n\nWhen using an Ethereum casino, players can expect instant deposits, which is one of the main advantages when compared to traditional providers.\n\nPlayers can deposit cryptocurrencies using their digital wallet and can complete the transaction in a matter of minutes. All of the providers discussed today also process withdrawals swiftly.\n\nBC.Game has no withdrawal fees or limits, $1 deposits and ETH is paid in just five minutes.\n\nCrypto Bonuses & Promos\n\nAll the Ethereum online casinos we discussed on this page offer a variety of gambling bonuses. New players can expect a welcome bonus when they sign up on the platform.\n\nThis mostly comes in the form of a matched deposit bonus.\n\nIn addition to marching bonuses, players can also expect to receive free spins, poker chips, and even cash prizes when joining an Ethereum casino for the first time.\n\nLow Crypto Banking Fees\n\nFiat currency payments to an online casino will invariably come with charges. However, with cryptocurrencies, users only have to cover the network fee.\n\nThe providers we reviewed above do not charge any deposit fees to process cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nFair Deposit & Withdrawal Limits\n\nDeposits and withdrawal limits also change from one blockchain gambling site to another. We have ensured that our top picks allow players to get started at small amounts.\n\nFor instance, many Ethereum casino sites on our list require a minimum deposit of just $20. Similarly, we have also ensured low withdrawal limits, so that players can cash out their winnings easily.\n\nWide Range of Crypto Betting Markets\n\nThe selection of Dogecoin gambling sites we listed above do not limit their scope to a few generic games. Instead, they list a broad range of titles, from classic slots and table games to live dealers to sports betting markets.\n\nTop platforms continue to partner with leading game developers in order to expand their range of slots and live games. In other words, the best Ethereum gambling sites ensure that players are constantly engaged with new games and products.\n\nGood Betting Features & Resources\n\nApart from offering games, what other features can an Ethereum gambling site offer?\n\nWell, as we have covered in our earlier Ethereum casino reviews, a majority of these sites host tournaments and races, which offer players access to additional rewards.\n\nThis means that in addition to winning, players will get to unlock exclusive rewards \u2013 which could be in the form of cash prizes or free bets.\n\nIn addition to this, many online casinos have launched VIP programs to reward their most loyal customers \u2013 which is another incentive for players to stick with one provider.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nEthereum Gambling Bonuses\n\nFor those new to the crypto gambling space, it might be confusing to figure out which promotional offers are worth paying attention to.\n\nBelow, we provide a brief explanation of the most common types of bonuses offered by Ethereum gambling sites.\n\nDeposit Match Bonuses\n\nMatched deposit bonuses are the most popular types of reward offered by crypto casinos these days. Suppose a crypto casino offers a 150% matched deposit bonus.\n\nThis means that if a player deposits $1,000, they will start with a balance of $2,500. However, players will have to meet some wagering requirements in order to withdraw the bonus deposit.\n\nFree Bets\n\nFree bets are widely offered by Ethereum gambling platforms to draw in customers. These are typically found on platforms that facilitate sports and eSports betting. This way, players can place bets with free money.\n\nFree Spins\n\nEthereum gambling sites that support crypto slots might also offer free spins to their players. Simply put, players get a predetermined number of free spins that they can use on a certain slot game.\n\nPoker Chips\n\nLike free spins, chips enable players to bet on poker games without having to use their own cash. However, when using free chips, players might have to place a certain number of bets in order to be able to access their winnings.\n\nNo Deposit Bonuses\n\nSometimes, it is also possible to play online casino games without making any initial deposit. This feature is available on Ethereum casinos that offer no deposit bonuses.\n\nEssentially, this means that players receive a bonus simply for signing up on the platform to help them start placing bets right away.\n\nBear in mind that on some Ethereum gambling sites, users might need to enter a code when depositing funds to access these bonuses.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nWhat is the best Ethereum gambling site?\n\nWhile there are dozens of Ethereum gambling sites in the market today, we particularly like the looks of BC.Game.

It allows users to buy Ethereum from a minimum of $10 \u2013 with a debit/credit card, e-wallet, or bank wire. Moreover, the fee for buying cryptocurrencies is only 1%.\n\nAlthough investors will have to account for the spread, this is also highly competitive when compared to the market average. Crucially, eToro comes with its own digital wallet that can be used to store cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\neToro supports not only cryptocurrencies but also stocks, indices, ETFs, metals, and agricultural products. It is also regulated by the SEC, FCA, ASIC, and CySEC. We also like eToro for its exclusive features \u2013 such as Copy Trading and Smart Portfolios, which allow users to invest in different asset classes passively.\n\n>>>Buy Cryptos<<<\n\nConclusion \u2013 Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nToday, there are plenty of choices for those who wish to use Ethereum for online gambling purposes.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, failed to show notable movement over the weekend. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Solana (SOL) \u2014 saw a mix of minor dips and gains across the board. KuCoin Token (KCS), which was the top gainer last Friday, emerged to be the top loser today, with a 24-hour dip of over 7 percent. KAVA became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of nearly 4 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.07 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.25 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $26,405.80, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.37 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 23.69 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $1,724.42, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.17 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.54 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour jump of 0.20 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.06202. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 5.48.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour gain of 0.10 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $77.24.

The failure of bears to keep BTC below $25,000 likely attracted bullish investors aiming to initiate a recovery. Nevertheless, the overall trend still favours the bears. BTC's support is currently at $26,386, with resistance at $26,633. Similarly, Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin's performance and is currently trading above the $1,720 threshold.\"\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cCrypto markets traded in a tight range over the weekend, and in the last 24 hours. Global crypto market capitalisation is currently $1.11 trillion, down 0.1 percent. The crypto fear and index continued to stand below 50 for the last 10 days; currently at 47, down 2 points from yesterday. The fact that market capitalisation and BTC prices continue to remain above $1.1 trillion and $25,000, respectively, hints towards slight resilience building amongst investors after last week.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \"APAC is enticing digital asset businesses, with Hong Kong having released its latest set of regulations. The unchanged price hike by the US Fed could see Bitcoin\u2019s price go further down.\"\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cToday's Bitcoin price is $26,429.20 with a 24-hour trading volume of $9.67 billion. BTC is -0.15 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -1.56 percent away from its 7-day high of $26,848.12 and 6.14 percent away from its 7-day low of $24,900.76. Ethereum price today is $1,727.31 with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.88 billion. ETH is +0.09 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -1.91 percent away from its 7-day high of $1,760.91 and 6.06 percent away from its 7-day low of $1,628.66. The price of BNB today is $243.69 with a 24-hour trading volume of $374.73 million. BNB is -0.44 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -3.43 percent away from its 7-day high of $252.34 and 9.83% away from its 7-day low of $221.87.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto market remained flat during the last 24 hours as the rate hike pause by the US Fed failed to cheer the market. The interest rates are already high due to the continuous hike for almost a year and the market is expecting a rate cut which will spark economic activity and boost liquidity in the market. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market volume reached $20.73 billion, marking a 12.36 percent decrease. Within this landscape, the DeFi sector stands strong with a total volume of $1.4 billion, accounting for 6.74 percent of the market's 24-hour volume.

instead, the developers aim to create a massive community of investors and internet enthusiasts using the power of memes and social media culture.\n\nThis aim has already created an enormous buzz around Wall Street Memes, with thousands of people joining the official Telegram channel to learn more about the project.\n\nChatGPT is also buzzed about Wall Street Memes\u2019 prospects, speculating that the $WSM token could hit $0.065 by the end of 2023.\n\nShould this occur, it would represent a 120% increase from the current presale price of $0.0295.\n\nThis potential for growth underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the exciting opportunities presented by projects like Wall Street Memes.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nMAGIC Transforms NFT Landscape and Catches ChatGPT\u2019s Attention\n\nAnother crypto that ChatGPT is heavily bullish on is MAGIC ($MAGIC).\n\n$MAGIC is the native token of the Treasure ecosystem, which is commonly referred to as a \u201cdecentralized games console.\u201d\n\nThis ecosystem is built around NFTs and crypto gaming, with $MAGIC used to turn NFTs into yield-bearing assets within the Treasure world.\n\nMoreover, members of the Treasure ecosystem can earn $MAGIC tokens by participating in various gameplay elements, providing an immersive way to generate a recurring crypto income stream.\n\nThis setup has prompted a wave of interest in $MAGIC \u2013 and ChatGPT believes this interest could catapult the token forward in the coming months.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, $MAGIC could increase to around $1.10 by the end of the year, driven by the vast potential of NFTs and Web3 tokens.\n\nAs more users join the Treasure ecosystem, the demand for $MAGIC will continue growing \u2013 helping propel its value to ChatGPT\u2019s forecasted heights.\n\nAvalanche Poised for Promising Future According to ChatGPT\n\nFinally, Avalanche ($AVAX) is the third token that ChatGPT believes could pump in the coming months, alongside Ethereum.\n\nAvalanche is a blockchain network that aims to solve the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d through a unique Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThe network was launched in 2020 and supports smart contracts, meaning decentralized application (dApp) developers can build and run their creations on Avalanche.\n\nSince Avalanche focuses on speed and scalability, many believe it\u2019s a better option than Ethereum for high-throughput dApps.\n\nPer CoinMarketCap, the price of $AVAX, Avalanche\u2019s native utility token, is now just $11.24 \u2013 down over 20% in the past 30 days.\n\nHowever, the good news for $AVAX holders is that ChatGPT believes things could be about to take a positive turn.\n\nAs predicted by ChatGPT, the $AVAX price could head to $16.50 by the end of the year \u2013 which would be 47% higher than it currently is.\n\nIf this growth trajectory occurs, Avalanche could become one of the most prominent gainers in the latter half of 2023."

        "title": "Inscriptions for NFT coming to Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Inscriptions are landing also on the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the launch of the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol, which allows users to mint NFTs at a lower cost and in a more decentralized manner than classic data storage on smart contracts.\n\nThe new protocol, which was inspired by Ordinals, is seen by the community as a great innovation, but at the same time already obsolete.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the details together.\n\nA new way to create NFTs on Ethereum: the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol\n\nFollowing the success of Ordinals on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, here come NFT inscriptions on Ethereum thanks to the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol.\n\nThe new protocol, launched on 17 June by Tom Lehman , co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, allows users to inscribe images less than 96KB in size on the Ethereum network, creating digital artifacts similar to NFTs.\n\nLehman, also known as Middlemarch on Twitter, announced that soon the functionality of \u201cEthscription\u201d will expand to allow the inscription of other file types.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1669822912579223552\n\nThe process is based primarily on the use of Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccalldata,\u201d or the data within a call to a smart contract.\n\nThe advantage, compared to classical storage solutions directly on smart contracts, is a lower cost in terms of gas fees and greater decentralization.\n\nIn just under 18 hours since the protocol was launched, about 30,000 ethscriptions have been registered, a number that prompted Lehman to call it \u201ca real success.\u201d\n\nMany users expressed enthusiasm about an innovation that has attracted much interest among the community, while others did not like the fact that calldata has been utilized by Ethereum developers for several years already.\n\nits not new, people have been storing custom data/art in calldata since 2016, examples are Deafbeef, 0xmon, Eulerbeats..\n\n\n\nethscription functionally is worse than state data, ethereum is more composable at the token level\n\n\n\nbut i bought some out of spite of ordinals \u2014 Clouted (@CloutedMind) June 18, 2023\n\nIn addition, although no real smart contracts exist on Bitcoin yet, and Ordinalscriptions are a necessity for minting NFTs, there are better performing solutions using smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nEthscriptions are therefore seen as already obsolete by one part of the community, while the other side claims the launch of the protocol as an alternative method for minting NFTs that will be a total game changer.\n\nMany users have embraced the idea of inscriptions on Ethereum to such an extent that they have temporarily blocked the API interface of the Ethscriptions website because of such a large volume in terms of traffic.\n\nData from the first NFT collections on Ethereum minted with \u201cEthscriptions\u201d\n\nThe Ethscriptions protocol immediately gained the attention of the web3 audience by recording a large amount of NFT minting on the Ethereum network.\n\nJust as the advent of Ordinals triggered a mad rush to find the yet-to-be-inscribed element on the Bitcoin blockchain, the same occurred with Ethereum with users rushing to create their own unique digital artifact.\n\nThe first collection that has been created through this innovative process is that of the \u201cEthereum Punks\u201d effectively recreating one of the most famous collections in NFT history, the \u201cCrypto Punks.\u201d\n\nThe floor price of the latest version of the Punks, being highly variable at this stage, ranges between 0.0099 and 0.015 ETH.\n\nAccording to data from Blur, a decentralized marketplace for exchanging non-fungible tokens, the Ethscriptions phenomenon captured a volume of 77.57 ETH in the last day.\n\nIf we instead consider the number of exchanges as of Saturday, the day the protocol was launched, this figure comes to 195.19 ETH.\n\nMost likely, given the frenzy seen on social media about this new fad, the trading volume will easily reach 1000 ETH in the coming days.\n\nFor now we can count 1237 owners of Ordinals-style digital artefacts on the Ethereum network, and an NFT supply of 3665 pieces.\n\nIt will be interesting to observe in the coming days whether more famous collections from the NFT world will be minted and whether this trend will continue for the next few months or die out in a few days.\n\nIn addition, after the first wave of inscriptions involving only image files, many expect to see more complex inscriptions.\n\nFor example, we may soon see experimentation with fungible tokens on the Ethereum network in the style of BRC-20, without the use of a smart contracts.\n\nWhile conceptually this may be decidedly interesting, it does not represent progress for the Ethereum ecosystem, but only a step backward from the functionality that the blockchain, described by Vitalik as a \u201cglobal computer for the world,\u201d can offer.\n\nMiddlemarch is not of the same opinion, who, excited about the launch of his protocol that guarantees the global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions, mentioned in a tweet:\n\n\u201cthe protocol is skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.\u201d\n\nHow are inscriptions on Bitcoin progressing?\n\nWhile Ethscriptions are starting to become popular in the world of NFTs on Ethereum, the universe of inscriptions on Bitcoin has already reached the height of its popularity.\n\nActivity on the Ordinals protocol of data on individual satoshis continues apace, so much so that some 222,000 inscriptions were registered yesterday.\n\nThe number, while higher than the average for the first few days of June, still results in a decrease in interest in the protocol compared to May, where a high of 400,000 inscriptions were reached in a single day.\n\nIn any case, there are still many users who use Ordinals on a daily basis, either to mint NFT-like digital artefacts or to create fungible tokens via the BRC-20 standard. Primarily, inscriptions are performed with text files (90.3%), and png images (5.3%)\n\nIn total, 12.8 million inscriptions have been executed as of February, which have \u201cgifted\u201d miners tx fees of 1745 BTC, equivalent to $46.1 million.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mempool continues to have some minor difficulties in including transactions in blocks quickly given the pressure from users to the Ordinals protocol.\n\nRight now for example there are about 300 thousand transactions waiting to be confirmed and added to a new block.\n\nIt is interesting to note that although inscriptions continue to swarm the Bitcoin ecosystem, the fees paid to miners are dropping quite a bit compared to the early days of May.\n\nThese now represent about 3% of total miner revenue: a figure still higher than in the July 2022 \u2013 February 2023 period, but down sharply from the top of 42% recorded on 8 May 2023."

        "content": "The European Investment Bank (EIB), a triple-A-rated credit institution secured by the European Union (EU), is under attack. In a tweet on June 19, the long-term lending arm of the EU said they were facing a cyber-attack that had affected the availability of some of its key websites.\n\nWhile some of the bank\u2019s sites have been rendered inaccessible, possibly inconveniencing some of its clientele base, Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency networks, have proven immune to cyber-attacks and continue to operate with nearly 100% reliability and uptime.\n\nEuropean Investment Bank Under Attack\n\n\n\nIt could not be immediately ascertained why the EIB was being targeted. However, what\u2019s evident is that the lender plays a vital role in the European Union\u2019s financial infrastructure.\n\nThe bank is one of the largest multi-lateral lenders in the world and one of the top financiers of efforts to combat climate change. Besides, the EIB plays a critical role in rolling out loans, guarantees, and equity to projects involved in sustainable development within the European Union.\n\nSpecifically, the bank is involved in financial operations revolving around climate action, funneling over $82 billion to projects fighting climate change in the last eight years. At the same time, the bank finances platform enhances connectivity and innovation in the zone.\n\nBorrowers can have confidence in the financial institution because the European Union budget guarantees it. As such, clients enjoy low-risk loans while investors remain confident that the bank won\u2019t go bust.\n\nWith the bank now targeted by hackers, EIB has acknowledged that the eib.org and eif.org websites have been affected. The eib.org platform provides information about the bank\u2019s latest activities and investments.\n\nMeanwhile, eif.org offers details about the bank\u2019s fund activities and investments. It is where users can also learn about the strategy used by the bank when building their portfolios and financing projects.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum Are Resilient\n\nWhile the bank didn\u2019t specifically mention the type of attack they were facing, the inconvenience can be a source of concern. It also points out the fragilities in the traditional finance ecosystem, most of which operate using centralized systems.\n\nThese centralized networks are prone to outages and attacks, as currently witnessed with the EIB. For now, it is unclear whether funds have been lost or the personal information of any of their executives, projects, and others leaked.\n\nThe EIB attack highlights the advantages distributed and decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum have. As regulation evolves in the European Union, Bitcoin, and Ethereum remain resilient and process millions of dollars worth of transactions daily.\n\nRecently, the EU implemented the Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) rules. With this, EU member states can regulate the issuance, trading, and crypto assets. Under MiCA, the EU offers businesses guidance on licensing, KYC and AML requirements, consumer protection rules, and more.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView"

        "content": "During the past week, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a downturn characterized by a bearish trend. However, as the week drew to a close, the bullish momentum began to overpower the bears, resulting in a positive turn to conclude the week. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum managed to regain some of their value.\n\nLast week, there was a notable market crash caused by a slight deviation of Tether\u2019s USDT from its pegged value to the United States dollar. Interestingly, this event occurred simultaneously with the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office releasing substantial information to CoinDesk.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, Bakkt, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, decided to delist prominent altcoins Solana, Polygon, and Cardano due to regulatory uncertainties.\n\nAltcoins, the alternative cryptocurrencies, experienced a significant decline on the weekly chart, but only for a short duration. However, towards the end of the week, they were able to recover some of the losses, although a few still showed negative trends on both the weekly and daily charts.\n\nKuCoin Token (KCS) is at the top of the list of 60 altcoins experiencing significant gains this week, followed by Uniswap (UNI) and Maker (MKR), second and third place, respectively.\n\nKuCoin Token (KCS) experienced a notable increase of 22% over the course of the past seven days; however, it has managed to make a slight recovery, according to the daily chart. As of now, KCS is being traded at $7.23, reflecting a 0.15% rise within the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nThe rise can be attributed to the announcement that IMVU, a digital veteran, launched a new metaverse product on KuCoin Spotlight. KuCoin users can get VCORE allocations by holding KCS.\n\nKuCoin Spotlight is a platform to support promising crypto projects through early token purchases. Previous participants include Lukso (LYXe), Chromia (CHR), and Sui Network (SUI).\n\nMeanwhile, Uniswap (UNI) is also gaining attention as a second weekly gainer. Over the past week, UNI has experienced a significant gain of approximately 11%.\n\nCurrently, UNI is trading at $4.48, reaching a high of $4.6599 and closing the week at $4.4780 after starting the week at $4.0565. These figures indicate a notable downturn in performance.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the token has experienced a 0.87% decrease, while its trading volume has also decreased by 16.99% in the same time period.\n\nThe price surge can be attributed to the news that Uniswap Labs has unveiled the code draft for Uniswap v4, introducing custom liquidity pools through \u201chooks.\u201d This decentralized crypto exchange is the biggest in terms of volume and recently launched v3 on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe upcoming v4 will enable developers to implement on-chain limit orders, automatic deposits to lending protocols, auto-compounded LP fees, and other innovations.\n\nAdditionally, Maker (MKR) has also gained significant attention due to its weekly performance and notable increase of about 10%.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nMoreover, some popular coins are experiencing gains in weekly charts, including SHIB at 9%, ICP at 9%, and FIL, with an increase of 7.96%, according to the data from CoinMarketcap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nDuring the preceding week, Bitcoin, the well-known digital currency, experienced a significant drop as it reached a critical support level of approximately $24,700. This occurrence sparked worries among investors and market watchers. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remained confined to a narrow trading range throughout the week.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIn the past week, the analytics firm Santiment has reported that the exchange supply of Bitcoin has reached its lowest point since February 2018. This decline can be attributed to traders opting to move their Bitcoin holdings to self-custody amidst the ongoing uncertainty surrounding major platforms such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThe prevailing trend of transferring Bitcoin to personal wallets is expected to persist as long as the legal actions initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remain unresolved.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum, another prominent cryptocurrency, experienced a tight range of trading similar to Bitcoin. The price of Ethereum dropped to a low point of $1,624.14, causing concern among investors and traders.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,376.51, with a 1.90% increase over the past seven days and a 0.33% decrease in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, ETH is being traded at $1,723.63, experiencing a 0.02% decrease in the past 24 hours and 1.36% over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | USDT, TUSD, and DJED Holders Moving Capital To Innovative InQubeta Presale"

        "content": "To enhance efficiency and address operational challenges faced by larger node operators, Ethereum\u2019s core developers are engaged in a heated debate over increasing the validator balance limit.\n\nCurrently, validators are restricted to holding a maximum of 32 ETH, but proponents argue that raising the threshold to 2,048 ETH would offer numerous advantages for the network.\n\nThe existing limit was initially implemented to promote decentralization. However, it has inadvertently led to an exponential growth in the number of validators. With over 600,000 validators currently online and an additional 90,000 waiting to be activated, the strain on the network is becoming apparent.\n\nMichael Neuder, a prominent researcher and advocate for the proposed modification, asserts that increasing the validator limit would curb the active validator set\u2019s explosive growth and expedite the network\u2019s ability to reach finality within a single Ethereum slot. By allowing validators to accumulate more significant amounts of ETH, the proposed change would pave the way for auto-compounding validator awards.\n\nAny rewards exceeding 32 ETH must be redistributed before staking profits can be realized. However, removing and increasing the limit would enable validators to compound their earnings, maximizing their staking returns rapidly.\n\nThe adjustment would particularly benefit major node operators like exchanges, Coinbase being a notable example, who currently manage tens of thousands of validators due to the 32 ETH limit per validator.\n\nBy increasing the maximum effective validator balance, these operators could streamline their operations and handle fewer validators with more enormous stakes, reducing complexity and resource requirements.\n\nWhile the proposal presents enticing prospects, Neuder also warns of potential risks, such as heightened penalties for inadvertent multiple attestations or proposals, commonly called \u201cslashing.\u201d Striking a delicate balance between facilitating efficiency and maintaining network security is a critical challenge that the Ethereum core developers must navigate.\n\nThe debate surrounding the increase in the validator balance limit continues to gain momentum. To gather insights and opinions from the broader Ethereum community, the core developers have extended the discussion to social media platforms like ETHMagicians and Discord.\n\nAs stakeholders eagerly await a consensus, the potential impact of this decision on Ethereum\u2019s future and its ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism remains a topic of great interest and speculation."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Ethereum How Long Does it Take to Send Ethereum? EthereumJournal How Long Does it Take to Send Ethereum? Torsten Hartmann\n\nEthereum has established itself as a cornerstone of the crypto market. One of the most frequently asked questions by both new and seasoned investors alike is, \u2018how long does an Ethereum transaction take?\u2019 The answer, as with many things in the crypto world, is not as straightforward as one might hope.\n\nEthereum transaction time can vary significantly depending on several factors. Whether you\u2019re transferring ETH between wallets or from your wallet to an exchange, the time can range from a few seconds to several minutes. The type of wallet you\u2019re using, the current network congestion, and the number of confirmations required by the receiving platform all play a role in the ETH transfer time.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the intricacies of Ethereum transactions, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of what influences the speed of ETH transfers. We\u2019ll explore the difference between hot and cold wallets, the concept of \u2018gas\u2019 in the Ethereum network, and how network congestion can impact your transaction time. This article will serve as a guide to comprehending the factors that determine how long an ETH transfer takes. So, let\u2019s dive into the world of Ethereum and demystify the process behind ETH transaction times.\u201d\n\nQuick summary \ud83d\udcda Topic \ud83d\udcdd Summary \ud83d\udd52 Ethereum Transfer Time Depending on the type of transaction and the state of the network, Ethereum transfers can take anywhere from 15 seconds to 5 minutes. Factors such as network congestion, gas price, and the type of wallet (hot or cold) can influence the transfer time. \ud83d\udd04 Wallet to Wallet Transfer Wallet to wallet transfer times can vary. If the coins are already online, then transfer times to another wallet are reasonably fast, taking anywhere between 16 seconds to 5 minutes. Transferring coins from a cold wallet will take slightly longer due to additional security measures. \ud83d\udcb1 Wallet to Exchange Transfer Transfers to exchanges can take longer than a wallet to wallet transfer because exchange platforms often require more confirmations for the transaction to be completed. This adds more security and protects the exchange from double spending. \ud83d\udcdd Confirmations in Ethereum Network When you send Ethereum from one wallet address to another, you submit a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction is then added to the blockchain by miners (or validators). Before the Ethereum appears in the other wallet, it has to complete a set number of confirmations. More confirmations mean a greater chance your transaction is done and irreversible. \ud83c\udfe6 Transfer ETH to Bank Account Transferring Ether tokens from a wallet to an exchange like Coinbase should take around 10 mins, given that Coinbase requires 30 confirmations. The next step is to sell your ETH on Coinbase for fiat. You can then withdraw the cash to your bank account. This transfer time will depend on the exchange platform you are using. Some platforms will allow you to make an instant withdrawal, whereas some will take 3-5 business days to send the money. \ud83d\udcb0 Ethereum Transfer Fees Each Ethereum transfer requires what is known as gas, paid in ETH. These gas fees help keep the Ethereum network safe and secure. Transaction fees prevent spam on the network and increase the speed of legitimate transactions. \ud83d\ude80 Ethereum 2.0 Impact The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is expected to improve transaction speeds significantly. It will transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, which is expected to increase the speed capability from 13-15 transactions per second (TPS) to an estimated 100 TPS.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer Ethereum from One Wallet to Another?\n\nWallet to wallet transfer times can vary depending on if you\u2019re using a hot wallet (Online Wallet) or a cold wallet (Offline Wallet).\n\nIf your coins are already online, then transfer times to another wallet are reasonably fast.\n\nTransfer times will differ depending on how many confirmations the transaction requires; transferring Ether from one hot wallet to another will take anywhere between 16 seconds to 5 minutes.\n\nTransferring coins from a cold wallet will take slightly longer as you will need to deal with the additional security required to complete a transfer.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer Ethereum from Wallet to Exchange and Vice Versa?\n\nTransfers to exchanges can take a little longer than a wallet to wallet transfer; this is because exchange platforms often require more confirmations for the transaction to be completed; this adds more security and protects the exchange from double spend\n\nWhat are Confirmations?\n\nWhen you send Ethereum from one wallet address to another, you submit a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction is then added to the Blockchainblockchain by miners (or validators).\n\nBefore the Ethereum appears in the other wallet, it has to complete a set number of confirmations; the number of confirmations required can differ depending on where you are sending your Ether.\n\nYour transaction is said to have completed one confirmation after it adds to the blockchain. Each additional block added after the initial confirmation is a further confirmation for your transaction.\n\nMore confirmations mean, the greater the chance your transaction is done and irreversible.\n\nBlockchain confirmations are essential as they are a way of verifying information that will then become permanent. If a transaction is fraudulent, the blockchain will not accept it: zero blockchain confirmations means zero transactions.\n\nHow Long Do Confirmations Take?\n\nConfirmations on the Ethereum blockchain take around 16 seconds. For an up to date, figure see here, which shows the average confirmation time over the last x figure.\n\nRead also:\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer ETH to My Bank Account?\n\nAgain, it depends on several factors.\n\nFor starters, whether you\u2019re using a cold or a hot wallet.\n\nUsing a cold wallet will take longer as you need to complete additional security measures in order to transfer your coins online.\n\nSay, if you want to transfer ETH from your wallet to Coinbase to sell it, the transaction speed will depend on how many confirmations Coinbase requires the transaction to complete.\n\nCoinbase requires 30 confirmations. This means transferring Ether tokens from a wallet to Coinbase should take around 10 mins.\n\nThe next step is to sell your Eth on Coinbase for fiat. You can then withdraw the cash to your bank account. This Eth transfer time will depend on the exchange platform you are using, some exchange platforms will allow you to make an instant withdrawal, whereas some will take 3-5 business days to send the money.\n\nAre There Any Fees?\n\nThere are fees with Eth transfers. Each transfer requires what is known as gas, pay a small amount of Ether to make a transaction.\n\nGas fees help keep the Ethereum network safe and secure. Transaction fees prevent spam on the network and increase the speed of legitimate transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, Ethereum transactions are generally quite fast; however, the actual transaction time will vary depending on where you are sending your Ether.\n\nAll Ethereum transactions require a set number of confirmations before the transaction is completed. The more confirmations required, the longer the transaction will take. The good news is that confirmations on the Ethereum network take only around 16 seconds, so most transfers will be completed in just a few minutes.\n\nFor users wishing to sell their Ethereum for cash in their bank account, wait times are typically longer and can be anywhere from a few minutes to 5 days, depending on which exchange platform is used"

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nDespite facing recent challenges due to enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the crypto market has demonstrated resilience by recording a 0.69% gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, have capitalized on the current bullish trend. This is evidenced by the emergence of a golden cross between Ethereum\u2019s 50-week and 200-week moving averages.\n\nCould this be an optimal time to buy the asset, as the forms suggest that Ethereum may experience a significant surge in the coming months?\n\nEthereum Price Surges Along With the Market Rally\n\nAt press time, the $ETH token is trading at $1,729.42, with a rise of 0.38% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith a trading volume of $5 billion in the last 24 hours, the Ethereum network\u2019s coin is currently experiencing a bullish trend. The asset shows a slight 0.02% upward movement in the last hour, signaling an ongoing rally.\n\nHowever, a closer look at $ETH\u2019s performance over a shorter period reveals some weaknesses as it strives to recover from recent declines.\n\nIn the past seven days, its price has experienced a decrease of 0.71%, and within the last month, it has witnessed a 4.90% decline.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) performance remains positive, with a healthy increase of 44.65%.\n\nBased on the technical charts, the recent uptrend has not yet had a significant impact on the price of $ETH.\n\nThe current price of the digital asset falls slightly below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1,729.67 for the short term, while its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1,731.14 for the long term.\n\nWhile there is a possibility of a continued decline in the value of $ETH, investors should anticipate price fluctuations between the 50-day and 200-day SMA.\n\nTechnical analysis shows that $ETH encountered resistance at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,729.24. However, if the bullish trend persists, there is potential for the asset to surpass this point and move toward new price levels.\n\nDespite this resistance, $ETH demonstrates strength in its oscillators. The relative strength index (RSI), currently at 27.26, indicates an oversold position, suggesting a potential recovery in the near future.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) displays a weak sell view.\n\n$ETH Chart Reveals Golden Cross Formation\n\nAnalysts have observed a recent bullish signal in the market, with Ethereum ($ETH) forming a weekly golden cross.\n\nThis signifies a positive trend where the short-term moving average surpasses the long-term average, a situation not witnessed since 2019.\n\nNotably, this golden cross follows a previous death cross, reversing a long-term sell signal into a buy signal.\n\nA golden cross occurs in a two-moving average system when a buy signal emerges due to the intersection of the shorter timeframe with the longer timeframe. On the contrary, when the opposite crossover occurs, it is referred to as a death cross.\n\nWith all the noise in the market right now, everyone has entirely missed the fact #Ethereum has formed a weekly golden cross pic.twitter.com/ylNwp3DEUI \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) June 12, 2023\n\nIn a chart shared by crypto analyst Tony \u201cThe Bull on Twitter, the golden cross formation clearly illustrates a significant development, with the short-term average of $ETH surpassing its long-term average after a prolonged period.\n\nThis occurrence indicates that the altcoin is in the early stages of a new bullish cycle. However, considering the ongoing regulatory turbulence affecting the market, it might take several months before this anticipated cycle becomes evident.\n\nAs a result, investors currently have an opportunity to purchase $ETH at a substantial discount before it enters another phase of consistent growth.\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals, significant surges in its price are expected soon.\n\nHistorical data shows that the appearance of the golden cross has led to Ethereum\u2019s price soaring by an additional 680% before reaching its peak.\n\nFor instance, when $ETH last surpassed both moving averages in 2020, it experienced a rally of over 1,700%.\n\nExplore Utility-Driven $ECOTERRA Token as $ETH Alternative\n\nFollowing the legal conflicts between the SEC and popular cryptocurrencies, investor attention is shifting towards $ECOTERRA, the ecoterra platform\u2019s utility token, as a viable substitute for $ETH.\n\nEcoterra is a green initiative that utilizes the recycle-to-earn (R2E) system, providing opportunities for individuals and businesses to earn rewards through recycling activities.\n\nThe platform encompasses various components, including a carbon offsetting marketplace, a marketplace for recycled materials, and a traceable impact profile.\n\nBy leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, ecoterra ensures the secure and transparent implementation of the Recycle 2 Earn concept on a large scale.\n\nWe have successfully reached the impressive milestone of $5.2 MILLION! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 Thank you to everyone who has supported us, and let's continue to make a positive impact together \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc9ahttps://t.co/1fYkPOsPYG#MilestoneAchieved #Presale #CryptoPresale #Presale #CryptocurrencyNews pic.twitter.com/84ThCoH8Sm \u2014 ecoterra (@ecoterraio) June 20, 2023\n\nIts $ECOTERRA token serves multiple purposes, such as distributing rewards, facilitating staking, and more.\n\nThe digital asset has reached a milestone in its presale of the native, surpassing over $5.23 million.

        "title": "Proposal Seeks Ethereum Validator Balance to Reach 2048 ETH - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) network went through its highly anticipated Merge upgrade in September last year. The transition from proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) was among the biggest upgrades across the crypto and blockchain industry. Following the update, the Ethereum network validators were bound to stake an amount of 32 ETH. Now, the maximum validator balance is said to go up to 2,048 ETH.\n\nIncreasing Upper Cap to Help Ethereum Validators\n\nIn an Ethereum Core Developers Consensus Meeting which took place on Friday, June 16, the proposal was pushed forward. As per the proposal, core developers are considering to increase the maximum validator fees ceiling to 2,048 ETH maximum. At present, one needs to stake at least 32 ETH minimum and maximum, in order to become a validator over the smart contract blockchain network.\n\nResearcher at Ethereum Foundation, who also happens to act as one among to propose the change over network, Michael Neuder, stated the current limitation of validator fees as an upper cap will result in inflation of the set of validators.\n\nPushing the validator staking amount ceiling will result in the expanding set of active validators. It will lead to improved efficiency of the network when the block finally would take in a single slot over the Ethereum network.\n\nThough the lower threshold helps the network to remain decentralized given the maximum participation of validators, the large-scale validators face some difficulties. Currently, the large-scale operations need to employ multiple validators in order to raise maximum yields. Large-scale validators, willing to earn more yield by staking more ETH, can get a chance to scale up their earning by lining up their multiple validators to the minimum.\n\nThe certain and lower staking amount resulted in a significant number of validators over the network. Over 600,000 active validators are there on the network, while approx 90,000 more are in the queue waiting to take active participation in the validating transaction process.\n\nConcerns Around Lifting the Staking Limit\n\nValidator rewards are also expected to get better with the auto-compounding. Rewards more than the limit of 32 ETH used to redirect and generate staking yield. However, with the limit to raise to the bigger number, the cap to get raised, the said rewards could get compounded and validators will have an option to to earn more.\n\nLarger validator node operators like Coinbase, have to carry out operations while keeping thousands of validators to hit their goal. The heightened ceiling would help in keeping the high stake validators in minimum number of them,\n\nHowever, the plan is not perfect and fool-proof. It also has shortcomings. On the flip side of maximum profits, the penalties on mistakes like double attestation, during validation of transaction, would also rise. The discussion is still on the proposal yet to see the signals for further developments."

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers plan to increase the minimum amount of staked Ether required to become a validator by 64 times its original value.\n\nAccording to the proposal, validators will hold a minimum of 2048 ETH tokens as opposed to the current value of 32 ETH. Ethereum migrated from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism in 2022 during the Ethereum Merge.\n\nThis upgrade introduced validators to replace miners in confirming and securing transactions while staking a minimum of 32 ETH. However, this new proposal will likely meet mixed reactions from the current validators on the network due to its increased requirements.\n\nEthereum Validators Propose Hike In Validator Fees\n\nEthereum core developers made this proposal on June 15 in a consensus meeting with Ethereum Foundation researcher Micheal Neuder.\n\nNeuder stated that the current limit of 32 ETH creates more inclusivity in Ethereum\u2019s validators and makes the network more decentralized.\n\nHowever, its leads to inflation in the number of validators on the network. He believes that a large increase in the ETH tokens required will improve Ethereum Network\u2019s efficiency over time.\n\nAlso, Neuer advocated for the auto-compounding of validator rewards. He believes this feature will enable validators to earn more rewards on their staked ETH tokens.\n\nTo generate any staking income, rewards received that exceed the current limit of 32 ETH must move to another account. Neuder stated that raising the benchmark for validators will lead to rapid compounding of rewards.\n\nAdditionally, Neuder believes the current proposal will benefit large node operators like exchanges that currently manage numerous validators. However, this proposal received mixed reactions from the crypto community as they believe it will make the network more centralized.\n\nA centralized network will ultimately defeat the core principles of cryptocurrency, which is a largely decentralized, anonymous, and scalable network.\n\nThe recent developments on Ethereum\u2019s network could be boosting its current price recovery as it increased from the $1,600 price level on June 14 to $1,700 on June 15, where it currently trades.\n\nJP Morgan Analyses Impact Of Hinman\u2019s Documents On Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nIn a new development, JP Morgan shared insights on the recently released Hinman documents and their impact on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nDespite the US. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Efforts to keep the documents hidden, they were finally released to the public view. The documents revealed that William Hinman, in his now infamous speech in 2018, stated that Ether did not fall under securities.\n\nJP Morgan believes these recent developments will reshape the crypto landscape and align other projects with Ethereum\u2019s operating model.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that this action would elevate Ether in the crypto market and shield the project from unnecessary regulatory pressure. Ethereum still retains its second-ranked position in the crypto market behind market leader Bitcoin.\n\nRead more:"

        "content": "Home \u00bb De-Fi Sent BEP20 To ERC20 Address (on TrustWallet, MetaMask)? How To Recover The Funds? De-FiJournalWallets Sent BEP20 To ERC20 Address (on TrustWallet, MetaMask)? How To Recover The Funds? Sarah Wurfel\n\nWHAT ARE BEP20 AND ERC20 TOKENS?\n\nhe BEP20 and ERC20 token standards have emerged as key players. These two token standards, native to the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchain respectively, are often at the center of many transactions. But what happens when you accidentally send BEP20 tokens to an ERC20 address? Is there a way to recover these funds?\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive guide on how to recover BEP20 tokens sent to an ERC20 address. We delve into the specifics of these token standards, explaining what happens when such a transaction occurs and, most importantly, how you can retrieve your funds. Whether you\u2019re using a private key, a non-BSC-compatible wallet, or even a custodial wallet or exchange, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nThese connotations denote token standards on which a particular cryptocurrency is based. They are like blueprints that explain how a token is used, who can spend it, and other rules that influence its function and overall usage. Thus an ERC20 token is one that was created on the Ethereum blockchain and which utilizes Ethereum for gas fee payments, while a BEP20 token runs on the Binance Smart Chain and uses BNB for gas fee payments.\n\nQuick summary \ud83d\udcdd Key Steps \ud83d\udcda Description \ud83d\udcd6 Understanding BEP20 and ERC20 Tokens BEP20 and ERC20 are token standards on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchain respectively. If you send BEP20 tokens to an Ethereum address, the tokens are not lost but won\u2019t be useful since they are not in the token standard of the receiving blockchain. \ud83d\udd11 Importing a Private Key If you have sent BEP20 tokens to an ERC20 wallet that doesn\u2019t support BEP20 tokens, you can import your private key into a wallet that supports BEP20 tokens, like Trustwallet. This merges two wallets into one, allowing you to access the funds on that private key using another wallet. \ud83d\udd04 Retrieving Your Funds To retrieve your funds, you need to import your wallet into Trustwallet. Write down the recovery phrase of your wallet, open the settings on Trustwallet, click the \u2018+\u2019 sign on the \u2018Wallets\u2019 page, select \u2018I already have a wallet,\u2019 then \u2018Ethereum,\u2019 give your wallet a name, enter the recovery phrase, and click \u2018Done.\u2019 \ud83c\udfe6 Recovering from a Custodial Wallet or Exchange If you sent your tokens from a custodial wallet or exchange, you will need to contact their customer service. They may help you retrieve your tokens for a fee, but this is not always guaranteed. \ud83d\udd04 Recovering BEP20 Tokens from Non-BSC-Compatible Wallets If your wallet is not compatible with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), you may need to add the BSC to your wallet if it\u2019s allowed. If not, you may need to transfer your tokens to a BSC-compatible wallet.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SEND BEP20 TOKENS TO ERC20 ADDRESS?\n\nBecause the Bep20 and Erc20 token standards are similar in code structure and function with only a few differences, coins sent interchangeably to them are not gone forever; they can still be retrieved. Thus if you send Bep20 tokens to an Ethereum address, and the receiving wallet supports both Bep20 and Erc20 tokens, they will be there but won\u2019t be useful since they are not in the token standard of the receiving blockchain. You would have to send it back to the correct blockchain to be able to use it.\n\nHOW TO RECOVER YOUR FUNDS:\n\nImporting a private key\n\nThis option is for those who have sent Bep20 tokens to an Erc20 wallet that doesn\u2019t support Bep20 tokens. Importing your private key into another wallet is a way of merging two wallets into one such that you can access the funds on that private key using another wallet.\n\nNot all wallets offer this function, but prominent ones like Metamask, Trustwallet, Safepal, etc., offer this function. Thus, if you sent Bep20 tokens to Metamask, for example, you would need to import your Metamask private keys into a wallet that supports Bep20 tokens, like Trustwallet, to access them. How can you do that?\n\nRetrieving your funds\n\nSo, you have mistakenly sent Bep20 tokens to your Metamask address. Follow the steps below to import your Metamask wallet into Trustwallet:\n\nWrite down the recovery phrase of your Metamask wallet. Do not screenshot; write it down.\n\nOpen the settings button on your Trustwallet.\n\nClick the \u2018+\u2019 sign on the \u2018Wallets\u2019 page\n\nSelect \u2018I already have a wallet,\u2019 and then \u2018Ethereum.\u2019\n\nGive your wallet a name to make it easier to recognize.\n\nEnter the recovery phrase and click \u2018Done.\u2019\n\nYou can now access your funds in your Trustwallet.\n\nRECOVERING FROM A CUSTODIAL WALLET OR EXCHANGE\n\nThis is usually trickier and more difficult because you will have to contact the customer care of the wallet. They can then choose to help you retrieve it for a fee. That is usually few and far between, though. Most custodial wallets and exchanges will not be able to recover your funds for you, unfortunately.\n\nHOW TO RECOVER MY BEP20 TOKENS FROM NON-BSC-COMPATIBLE WALLETS?\n\nTo do that, you would have to add the Binance Smart Chain to such a wallet, if it is allowed. If that is not possible, then you may need to transfer your tokens to a wallet that is compatible with BSC.\n\nRead also:"

        "content": "On June 19, Etherscan, a popular Ethereum block explorer and analytics platform, unveiled a new tool called \u201cCode Reader,\u201d which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and interpret the source code of a specific contract address. By utilizing OpenAI\u2019s large language model (LLM), Code Reader generates comprehensive responses, offering valuable insights into the contract\u2019s source code files. The developers at Etherscan emphasized that to utilize the tool, users must possess a valid OpenAI API Key and have sufficient OpenAI usage limits, assuring that the tool does not store users\u2019 API keys.\n\n\u201cTo use the tool, you need a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. This tool does not store your API keys.\u201d\n\nCode Reader presents numerous use cases that benefit users seeking a deeper understanding of smart contract code through AI-generated explanations. The tool enables users to obtain extensive lists of functions associated with Ethereum data, facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of how the underlying contract interacts with decentralized applications (dApps). Once the contract files are retrieved, users have the option to choose a specific source code file to peruse. Moreover, the tool permits users to modify the source code directly within the user interface before sharing it with the AI, empowering them to experiment and iterate on the code effectively.\n\nEtherscan vs AI\n\nAs the field of AI continues to experience exponential growth, some experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of current AI models. In a recent report published by Singaporean venture capital firm Foresight Ventures, it was suggested that computing power resources would be a pivotal battleground in the coming decade. While there is a rising demand for training large AI models within decentralized distributed computing power networks, researchers have identified significant constraints that hinder their development. These challenges include complex data synchronization, network optimization, and concerns regarding data privacy and security.\n\nForesight Ventures highlighted a specific example to illustrate the limitations faced by large AI models. The report stated that training a model with a staggering 175 billion parameters, utilizing single-precision floating-point representation, would necessitate approximately 700 gigabytes of storage. However, distributed training mandates frequent transmission and updates of these parameters between computing nodes.\n\nIn a scenario involving 100 computing nodes, with each node requiring updates to all parameters at each unit step, the model would demand the transmission of a colossal 70 terabytes of data per second. This requirement far surpasses the capacity of most existing networks, illustrating the immense challenges in implementing distributed training for large AI models.\n\n\u201cIn most scenarios, small AI models are still a more feasible choice, and should not be overlooked too early in the tide of FOMO on large models.\u201d\n\nIn light of these constraints, researchers suggest that in many scenarios, smaller AI models remain a more viable choice. It is crucial not to overlook the potential of smaller models amidst the current frenzy surrounding large models. As the AI landscape evolves, advancements in computing power and network infrastructure will likely address some of these limitations. Nonetheless, for the time being, smaller AI models can still deliver substantial value and should not be prematurely dismissed in the pursuit of larger, more complex models."
