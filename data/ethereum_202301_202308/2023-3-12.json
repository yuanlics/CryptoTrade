        "title": "What Is Ethereum? Blockchain's Future of Finance Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest crypto by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin (BTC). While Bitcoin is undeniably revolutionary, Ethereum has reimagined the real-world use cases of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, Ethereum takes things further. Fully decentralized and open-source, the Ethereum network aims to liberate millions of people worldwide from the grip of centralized entities.\n\nSimple dApps within the ecosystem give you complete control of your assets and empower users to manage their finances through lending, borrowing, and trading. You can play engaging games and even collect provably unique digital art and store it on secure decentralized servers.\n\nHow does the Ethereum blockchain make all this possible? What exactly is a smart contract, and why are they so important?\n\nIntroducing Ethereum, the future of finance and the next generation of the internet.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain network that gives users full custody of their assets and hosts apps, organizations, and peer-to-peer transactions on a publicly verifiable network. The Ethereum mainnet has no centralized owner. Instead, it\u2019s governed by a community of users and powered by Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the network.\n\nAnyone can build an application or use the network at any time. The Ethereum blockchain is permissionless, meaning that no centralized body can stop me if I want to send cryptocurrency to a friend, trade tokens on a decentralized exchange, or store data on-chain. Even the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that helps develop and guide Ethereum\u2019s growth, doesn\u2019t have the power to censor how the network is used.\n\nLike Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain offers anonymity. No invasive KYC procedures need to be completed before using the network, and you don\u2019t need to provide any personal details before storing your funds securely on-chain.\n\nHow does a network with no owner operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interference or a centralized service managing everything?\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nThe Ethereum network is a public blockchain supported by thousands of independent computers worldwide. Each participant is called a \u2018Node\u2019 and helps secure the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized system is more stable and reliable than centralized systems because a single point of failure does not threaten it.\n\nFor example, take the diagram below. If the central piece of the centralized network suffers an outage, none of the other participants can communicate with each other. In a decentralized system, plenty of other interconnected nodes will step up and support the network if any nodes fail.\n\nDuring The Merge, a network upgrade completed in September 2022, Ethereum migrated to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism randomly selects validators to produce new blocks and secure the network. This is a more energy-efficient model than its original Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which demands high computational power.\n\nNode operators are responsible for securing the Ethereum mainnet, processing transactions, and creating new blocks. As a reward for their services, these validators earn Ether tokens. Ether is valuable because users need it to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network. However, ETH can also be sold on the crypto market in exchange for fiat currencies, like USD.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking; this sounds remarkably similar to Bitcoin or XRP. However, one key difference gives the Ethereum blockchain a greater variety of use cases than its predecessor.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computational state that manages the network. Essentially, the environment houses all accounts and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Most Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, the network\u2019s dominant programming language.\n\nPut simply, a smart contract is a line of code stored in blockchain programs and applications that execute when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts automate agreements between users in permissionless, anonymous environments, leading to greater trust and security on the network.\n\nThe easiest way to understand smart contracts is to imagine a vending machine. I enter an automated contract if I want a drink from the machine.\n\nI provide money and choose my drink, providing my side of our agreement .\n\n. The vending machine accepts my money and automatically dispenses my drink, providing its side of our agreement.\n\nSmart contracts allow Ethereum users to manage their cryptocurrencies more efficiently. They remove the need for intermediaries to oversee transactions. There is no room for human bias or error. Moreover, anyone can view the contract and verify its safety. In many ways, smart contracts add a layer of law and order to blockchain\u2019s private and anonymous world.\n\nWhy is this important? What does Ethereum offer that traditional services cannot?\n\nWhat Can I Do On The Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nThe Ethereum network is home to a rapidly expanding suite of apps and programs. Innovation and creativity are fully displayed in Web3, with new use cases being discovered and unveiled daily.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nFirst and foremost, the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is one of the most widespread use cases of the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi apps like Uniswap allow traders to swap ERC-20 crypto tokens with liquidity pools on-chain instantly. This not only gives traders access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies, but it also gives emerging Web3 startups a place to list their tokens without needing to pay a centralized exchange costly listing fees.\n\nLending and borrowing platforms like AAVE let DeFi users maximize their crypto holdings. In the same way, property owners can take out a loan against their house, apps like AAVE let holders get instant access to funds without selling their crypto. On the other hand, lenders can loan out their ETH and other cryptos to earn interest on their holdings in real-time.\n\nImagine trying to do any of this in traditional finance. Getting approved for a loan can take months and come with high fees from intermediaries like banks. Human bias also comes into play, and you have no way of knowing whether your loan will be approved. DeFi on Ethereum fixes this and levels the playing field. Anyone can access financial tools regardless of their funds, credit, or status.\n\nNFTs\n\nNon-fungible tokens have come a long way. While originally, NFTs were considered to be nothing more than flexes and digital art pieces, NFT utilities are evolving in earnest. Some of the world\u2019s biggest brands, like Adidas and Porsche, are incorporating NFT technology into their businesses. TravelX, a Latin American travel company, is developing NFT flight ticketing services.\n\nEthereum is the home of NFT culture. The network allows anyone to mint an NFT, whether a document containing important information or a unique masterpiece of digital art. Creator royalties on NFT collections mean that artists will receive ongoing fair value for their work, even years after it was originally sold.\n\nData Storage & Decentralized Governance\n\nStoring data on the Ethereum blockchain is a solution for users wanting decentralized and immutable storage options. Data stored on Ethereum is distributed across a network of computers, making it more resistant to hacking. Moreover, once data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain it\u2019s immutable. It cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof data record.\n\nEthereum data can be accessed and used by other decentralized applications within the ecosystem, enabling seamless integration between different Ethereum-based applications and programs.\n\nBy tokenizing assets on Ethereum, groups of individuals can form a DAO or a decentralized autonomous organization. Many decentralized platforms are governed by DAOs, who vote on development proposals and the community decisions that shape the protocol\u2019s future.\n\nEthereum itself is governed in this way. Every decision that influences the future development of Ethereum is voted on by its community of Ether holders.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nThe idea of Ethereum was first conceived by Vitalik Buterin when he was just a teenager. At the time, Buterin was a talented computer programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin envisioned greater utility for blockchain technology beyond what Bitcoin could.\n\nHe published the first Ethereum whitepaper in 2014, which attracted the attention of other industry big brains like Gavin Wood and Charles Hoskinson.\n\nIn 2014, Buterin brought his idea for the world\u2019s first smart contract-capable blockchain to the Bitcoin conference in Miami. The concept was met with enthusiasm, and the Ethereum founders hosted an ICO (initial coin offering), raising over $18 million in BTC.\n\nThe first iteration of the Ethereum mainnet, Frontier, officially went live in July 2015.\n\nEthereum 2.0 (Serenity)\n\nWhile Ethereum is in itself a revolutionary technology, it is not without its flaws. Ethereum\u2019s biggest issue is undoubtedly its scalability. The Ethereum network has congestion issues, like slow transaction speeds and high gas fees.\n\nTo address these problems, Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed a series of upgrades to the network. These Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aim to reinvent the network into a more scalable and secure blockchain. While it\u2019s most commonly referred to as ETH 2.0, the official name for the upgraded network is Ethereum Serenity.\n\nThere have been plenty of Ethereum upgrades over the years. However, the most important have been listed below.\n\nBeacon Chain\n\nEthereum was originally a Proof-of-Work blockchain. Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed migrating to a Proof-of-Stake consensus to achieve true scalability and reduce energy consumption.\n\nFollowing the approval of the proposal by the community, Vitalik, and the Ethereum foundation deployed the Beacon Chain in December 2020. Essentially, the Beacon Chain ran alongside the Ethereum main chain, testing how the PoS consensus would work within Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and laying a foundation for the Merge.\n\nLondon Hard Fork (EIP 1559)\n\nThe London Hard Fork is a significant milestone for the Ethereum ecosystem. It introduced a deflationary mechanism that burned a small percentage of Ethereum transaction fees. This was introduced to counteract Ether\u2019s inflationary validator rewards system.\n\nSource: UltraSoundMoney\n\nSince the London Hard Fork, over 46,000 ETH has been burnt. This represents over $71 million at the current ETH price. Investors expect that the ongoing effects of the London upgrade will be positive for Ethereum price as the token supply becomes more scarce.\n\nThe Merge\n\nPerhaps the biggest upgrade Ethereum ever witnessed occurred in September 2022. As the name would suggest, the Merge represented the key moment when Ethereum\u2019s existing PoW chain merged with the Beacon Chain, Ethereum\u2019s preparatory PoS chain.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nFollowing The Merge, Ethereum became a far more energy-efficient network. The upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95% and the earth\u2019s total usage by around 1%. The transition to a PoS consensus has also enabled the network to implement Sharding, a scaling solution that will increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput and processing speeds.\n\nShanghai Upgrade (EIP 4985)\n\nAs part of the earlier Beacon Chain and Merge upgrades, Ethereum holders staked their ETH in locked contracts to help secure the network during the transition. Scheduled for early 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will release the staked ETH back to providers over time and aims to reduce transaction fees on the network.\n\nIt is expected that over 17 million ETH will be unlocked in the weeks following the Shanghai Hard Fork.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nSince Ethereum first launched back in 2015, many other \u2018Ethereum-Killer\u2019 blockchains have emerged to compete with the market leader. These include popular networks like Cardano, BNB Chain, and Solana.\n\nWhile these competitors haven\u2019t been able to reach ETH in terms of market cap, they have proven themselves as faster and more affordable alternatives.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s first blockchain that supports smart contracts and introduced concepts like DeFi and NFTs to the masses. It\u2019s by far the most adopted Layer 1 blockchain in the industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Crypto advocacy group Coin Center spelling out why it believes Ethereum (ETH) is not a security, despite claims to the contrary coming from New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James.\n\nIn a new lawsuit against the crypto exchange Kucoin, Attorney General James argues Ethereum is a security that relies on the efforts of third-party developers to generate profits for its holders.\n\nThe Attorney General calls ETH \u201ca speculative asset\u201d and placed the leading smart contract platform in a group with the collapsed crypto project Terra (LUNA) and its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST).\n\nCoin Center\u2019s director of communications Neeraj Agrawal refutes the NYAG\u2019s assertions and says the think tank\u2019s view on Ethereum remains unchanged.\n\n\u201cObviously, we disagree with the NYAG\u2019s argument that ETH is a security. Coin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Coin Center published a blog post explaining why it believes Ethereum is not a security. The group argued that while Ethereum may have met one of the prongs of the Howey test when it was issued in 2014, ETH in its current form today is not a security.\n\nUnder the Howey framework, a transaction represents an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d if a person \u201cinvests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter, sponsor or other third party.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coin Center, Ethereum in its current iteration is \u201ctoo useful and too decentralized\u201d and that ETH\u2019s value does not rely on the efforts of a discernible third party to generate profits.\n\n\u201cThe value of Ether and the functionality of the Ethereum network is not reliant on the [Ethereum] Foundation, rather it flows from the efforts of thousands of unaffiliated developers, miners, and users\u2026\n\nConflating the pre-sale and the running network is confused analysis that could be misunderstanding the tech or the law or both.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,466.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $4,000 Again? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Although it might feel like eons, it was just a year and a half ago when Ethereum (ETH 1.46%) reached its all-time high of $4,644.33. Since then, a brutal crypto winter has left its mark on the industry as the entire landscape has changed dramatically. In the midst of this bear market, Ethereum lost more than 75% of its value at one point. Despite this drastic pullback, there is plenty of reason to believe that Ethereum could once again return to those previous all-time highs.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I believe Ethereum has what it takes to reclaim the $4,000 mark is a series of upgrades implemented in the blockchain over the last year and a half.\n\nUpgrades help Ethereum grow\n\nIf you recall, The Merge occurred in the fall of 2022 and effectively transitioned Ethereum from the bulky and power intensive proof-of-work to a more streamlined and efficient proof-of-stake blockchain. While this upgrade was highly publicized, and for good reason due to its magnitude, I believe there is another upgrade that will ultimately have a greater influence on Ethereum's future price ascension.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was launched in the summer of 2021 and laid the foundation for The Merge. In preparation for miners becoming obsolete, the London hard fork introduced a new mechanism for handling the network's fees. Previously, transaction fees were sent to Ethereum miners as an incentive for morning. After the London fork, the fees are actually \"burned\" or removed from circulation.\n\nWhile on proof-of-work, miners added blocks to the blockchain. As a reward for their efforts, they would receive a fee which was included in every transaction on Ethereum. But instead of getting rid of the miner fee altogether, Ethereum developers implemented the burn feature that would permanently destroy the fee previously allocated to miners. In doing so, Ethereum essentially became a deflationary asset, a crucial quality for an asset to maintain and increase its value over time. By creating scarcity in the supply of Ethereum, the burn feature can increase demand and drive up the price.\n\nA new beginning\n\nBefore The Merge and the London hard fork, Ethereum's annual inflation rate hovered around 3.5%. But with both of these upgrades now implemented, the number of total ether in circulation has decreased and thus Ethereum has entered a deflationary stage. Today it boasts a deflation rate of -0.088%.\n\nThe inner workings are a little complex, but the combination of these upgrades makes it so that the more transactions that occur on the network, the more ether is burned. It took some time for this phenomenon to materialize due to the current bear market dampening the number of transactions, but toward the end of Q4 2022 and the first few months of 2023, Ethereum finally began to reap the benefits that came out of the London hard fork and The Merge.\n\nThe number of transactions occurring on Ethereum has been rising steadily since the beginning of 2023 and is just shy of levels not seen since it reached its previous all-time high. As a result of this increase in activity, the total number of ether has actually decreased since The Merge as the burn mechanism from the London hard fork has begun to take effect.\n\nFor Ethereum investors, this is nearly a perfect scenario. Over the coming years, as demand (hopefully) picks back up to levels seen in the last bull market, it could lead to explosive growth in Ethereum's price as it becomes truly subject to the pressures of limited supply and increased demand. Should this play out, it could not only send Ethereum past the $4,000 mark, but likely to a new all-time high."

        "title": "Ethereum is a security\u2014CFTC is wrong - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has clarified that, in his view, ETH is an unregistered security\u2014as are most other tokens in the digital currency industry.\n\nOn March 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam expressed a different perspective. In his view, ETH is a commodity and thus falls under the regulatory purview of the CFTC. Noting that ETH had been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, he said, \u201cwe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, New York Attorney General Letitia James weighed in late last week with a lawsuit against KuCoin, accusing it of selling unregistered securities, specifically ETH.\n\nSo, who\u2019s right? Is ETH a security? According to the Howey Test, it absolutely is.\n\nETH is a security according to the Howey Test\n\nFirst, let\u2019s begin with a simple explainer of what The Howey Test is and why it matters. This will be crucial to understanding why ETH is a security.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, \u201cThe Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the Howey Test, an investment contract exists if there is an \u201cinvestment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the Howey Test is used to determine what is and isn\u2019t a security in the United States. It\u2019s a well-known term within the digital currency industry as it has been brought up in relation to high-profile cases like SEC vs. Ripple.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the Howey Test further. In order to qualify as an investment contract, there has to be:\n\nInvestment of money.\n\nIn a common enterprise.\n\nWith a reasonable expectation of profits.\n\nWith those profits being derived from the effort of others.\n\nAstute observers will immediately see that, in all likelihood, the Ethereum ICO from 2014 meets all four criteria. During the sale, more than 7 million ETH tokens were sold in the first 12 hours alone, with coins sent to a wallet controlled by ETHSuisse, a company based in Switzerland.\n\nSo, under the guise of a \u2018decentralized\u2019 ICO, we have:\n\n1. The investment of money. Everyone who sent BTC to the Ethereum ICO wallet address will attest to that.\n\n2. In a common enterprise, in this case, EthSuisse. This was a company based in Zug, Switzerland. This firm has since been dissolved, and the Ethereum Foundation has taken control.\n\n3. With a reasonable expectation of profits. Why else does anyone buy into ICOs? The hype around Ethereum was insane including by its main pitchman Vitalik Buterin.\n\n4. With the profits being derived from the efforts of those who had developed the Ethereum blockchain and would develop it in the future.\n\nI\u2019m not a securities expert, but I possess basic powers of logical deduction, and based on those four simple criteria that make up the Howey Test, ETH is a cut-and-dry security. That the common enterprise that accepted the cash has since been dissolved does not change anything. All four criteria of the Howey Test have been met.\n\nWhat defines a commodity? According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, commodities are \u201cgoods that can be freely sold to the public. It can be agriculture, fuel, or metals.\u201d It\u2019s much more difficult to see how the argument that ETH tokens fit this definition would hold up in court.\n\nMost ICO tokens are worthless and will go away\n\nAccording to the legal opinion of both the Chairman of the SEC and the New York Attorney General, and according to the logic above, Ethereum, and most other tokens sold via ICO, are unregistered securities.\n\nThat means the people involved in the entities that sold them are legally liable for doing so, and most tokens will share the fate of KIN after the SEC wins its lawsuit against Kik Interactive. Not only do we have qualified opinions and logic to go on, but legal precedent favors the notion that ETH and most other ICO tokens are securities, too.\n\nAll of this should cause readers to radically reassess what the future of the industry might look like. Whereas Satoshi\u2019s original Bitcoin is in the clear, according to Gensler and others, almost everything else can and will be targeted.\n\nThe next few years are going to change everything. Smart developers should switch to a \u2018set in stone\u2018 protocol that scales infinitely and utilizes tokens not issued in any ICO or offering\u2014the original Bitcoin, BSV.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Ethereum: Shanghai withdrawals and recent updates for ETH holders - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, the $28 billion worth of staked ether will start to become available in a few weeks.\n\nDue to the high yield, around 17.5 million ETH have been invested in self-hosted or staking-as-a-service validators.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the $28 billion worth of staked ether (ETH) will start to become available thanks to Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThis supply, which is now unavailable for withdrawal and cannot be sold, will gradually be restored to the public markets and have an impact on the price of Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum website, Shanghai may become live in the first half of 2023. According to some analysts, the change might go into effect as soon as April 15, which is U.S. tax day. Staking into Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain hasn\u2019t permitted ETH withdrawals since late 2020.\n\nEthereum guaranteed participants in its proof-of-stake validation a variable 3-12% annualized yield as payment for their multi-month pledge to refrain from selling.\n\nAround 17.5 million ETH have been invested in self-hosted or staking-as-a-service validators as a result of that high yield.\n\nShanghai update staking reward\n\nThe future updates consist of two simultaneous upgrades that have been combined to cover every aspect of the upgrade.\n\nShanghai alludes to modifications made to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, primarily making it possible to deposit staked ETH to execution layer wallets. The Beacon Chain, now known as Capella, must adapt concurrently with the Shanghai upgrading.\n\nA lot of investors might be preparing for a large exodus of ETH, which would be bad for pricing or less secure for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Nevertheless, the new upgrade has restrictions that prevent customers from withdrawing all of their staked ETH at once.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade to Ethereum distinguishes staking payouts from the 32 ETH minimum requirement formerly necessary to activate Proof-of-Stake validator keys.\n\nIn summary, withdrawing validators\u2019 incentives is much simpler and quicker than withdrawing the greater 32 ETH amount from validator activation. Around 18 months will pass before all prizes and the first 32 ETH can be fully withdrawn.\n\nThe post-Shanghai method will permit around 1,800 validators to withdraw their entire initial deposit plus rewards each day. This function deftly restricts the daily withdrawal of ETH.\n\nEthereum chooses 1,800 at random and gives no technical justification; the quota is just eight complete withdrawals every epoch and is meant to reduce sell pressure on ETH.\n\nEthereum developers made staking easy and withdrawing difficult\n\nThe Ethereum developers made stakes simple and withdrawals challenging. Instead of the typically preferred 0x00 prefix, validators will need to alter their credential prefixes to 0x01 before withdrawing.\n\nA withdrawal address must be manually specified by validators because, for some reason, it can only be done so once. Any error could prevent a validator from withdrawing in the future.\n\nOnly after the validator has a withdrawal address set and moves up in the long queue to become eligible for withdrawal can withdrawals take place."

However, recent events have led to the capitulation of several crypto-friendly banks \u2014 Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature \u2014 and have affected confidence in some stablecoins.\n\nU.S. regulators took control of these crypto-friendly banks citing systemic risks to the broader financial landscape.

Discover SCENE\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, responded to the latest drama around the USDC stablecoin by converting the remainder of its $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds into Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other digital currencies.\n\n\u201cGiven the changes in stablecoins and banks, Binance will convert the remaining of the 1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including BTC, BNB, and ETH,\u201d Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao wrote in a tweet early Monday.\n\nBinance launched its crypto industry \u201cRecovery Fund\u201d in November 2022 following the collapse of the FTX exchange. The initiative was aimed \u201c to help projects who are otherwise strong but in a liquidity crisis.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the changes in stable coins and banks, #Binance will convert the remaining of the $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including #BTC, #BNB and ETH. Some fund movements will occur on-chain. Transparency. \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) March 13, 2023\n\nThe move also comes in the wake of Paxos, BUSD's owner and issuer, being hit by a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the agency claiming last month that the firm violated investor protection laws. Paxos announced it would halt BUSD minting and \"end its relationship with Binance,\" for the stablecoin.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how much money from Binance's fund has been converted or is earmarked to be converted into the mentioned coins.\n\nThe ETH address shared by CZ shows some substantial transfers over the past few hours, with the original wallet almost emptied at the time of this writing. Transactions are continuing to be executed at the time of writing.\n\nIt's worth noting that last September Binance began auto-converting USDC deposits into its native BUSD\u2014effectively delisting the rival stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt reached out to Binance for additional comments but was yet to hear back by press time.\n\nUSDC regains USD peg\n\nFurthermore, Binance's decision comes hot on the heels of the USDC stablecoin depegging from its intended $1 price.\n\nThe depegging event was triggered by the ongoing crisis surrounding the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SBV), where the firm holds about $3.3 billion.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was among the 20 largest banks in the U.S. when it failed Friday after a bank run by customers. California state regulators placed the bank under the control of the FDIC, which in turn created a new entity\u2014the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara\u2014through which the remaining assets will be managed.\n\nUSDC plummeted to an all-time low of $0.87 on Friday night.\n\nThe collapse of SBV, preceded by the meltdown of the Silvergate Bank, also sent shockwaves through the stock market, while the crypto industry saw a depressing drop as well, with Bitcoin crashing below $20,000 for the first time since mid-January.\n\nIn a separate move, the Federal Reserve moved to shut down the Signature Bank on Monday morning, another crypto-friendly bank with total assets of around $117 billion as of the end of last year.\n\nThe scare, at least for now, appears to be short-lived though: according to a joint statement from the Fed, U.S. Treasury, and FDIC on Sunday, all depositors of now-shuttered Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank will be able to get their funds out on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Circle is now out of the woods, which is a huge positive for the crypto world,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.\n\nCircle has meanwhile stated that it will \u201ccover any shortfall\u201d caused as a result of the $3.3 billion in its funds held by the collapsed SBV.\n\nThe Boston-based company also reiterated that USDC is 100% collateralized with cash and U.S. Treasuries.\n\nAccording to the firm, \u201cUSDC is currently collateralized 77% ($32.4B) with U.S. Treasury Bills (with a three month or less maturation period), and 23% ($9.7B) with cash held at a variety of institutions, of which SVB is only one.\u201d\n\nThe latest news helped the broader crypto market flip green again, with Bitcoin trading around $22,280 by press time, up 9.1% over the day.\n\nUSDC is changing hands at $0.989, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Ethereum Blasts Off With New ERC-4337 Token Standard\n\nOn March 1st at ETHDenver, Ethereum announced its latest upgrade to the NFT token standard \u2013 the ERC-4337. This new standard is designed to enhance the interoperability and user-friendliness of NFTs on the Ethereum network, the world\u2019s leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps), making it more accessible to non-crypto natives.\n\nProposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others in September 2021, the ERC-4337 standard builds on the widely-used ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens. Essentially, focusing on improving accessibility by providing benefits like lost key recovery, the ability to opt-out of seed phrases, and gasless transactions. It\u2019s designed to make it easier for buyers and sellers to create wallets, thereby making it more attractive to a mainstream audience. With the new standard\u2019s launch, Ethereum is again demonstrating its commitment to innovation and leadership in the blockchain space.\n\nWith the ability to provide a new and easier level of usability for digital collectibles, ERC-4337 is set to become the new standard for high-value NFTs on the Ethereum network. As the NFT market continues to grow and evolve, it is clear that standards like ERC-4337 will play an increasingly important role in integrating mass adoption of this exciting new market.\n\nERC-4337: What does it bring to Web3?\n\nOne of the key features of ERC-4337 is its ability to recover lost private keys through a \u201csocial recovery system.\u201d This method significantly improves wallet creation and management by allowing designated users to restore access to a wallet if private keys are lost.\n\nAdditionally, ERC-4337 supports secure wallets that don\u2019t rely on seed phrases, which can be challenging for some users to remember and keep safe. This option provides a more user-friendly way of storing tokens, improving the overall usability of NFTs in the general market.\n\nAutomated trading is another important feature of ERC-4337, allowing NFT owners to trade their tokens without manual intervention. This is achieved through smart contracts, which can be programmed to execute trades automatically based on predetermined conditions making it more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users, such as monthly spend limits, AI trading, and yield farming positions\n\nLastly, ERC-4337 supports gasless transactions, allowing NFT collections and their DAOs to sponsor gas fees for users. This feature reduces the load on the network, increases the speed of transactions, and eliminates the need for users to pay gas fees in ether. This is particularly important for NFTs, as gas fees for executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can be prohibitively expensive.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "An investor who correctly called the 2022 crypto bottom says that Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are ahead of the curve when it comes to pulling in more users.\n\nIn a new interview on Real VIsion with macro guru Raoul Pal, Chris Burniske, a partner at venture capital firm Placeholder, says that crypto assets competing with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have less potential in terms of harnessing network effects.\n\nAccording to Burniske, even though interoperable blockchains like Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM) made more \u201clogical\u201d design choices, they\u2019re not as attractive as Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201c[Polkadot] is still a top-20 network, and I don\u2019t think it goes away, but it\u2019s important for people to pay attention to the differences in crypto asset design and use, because that\u2019s a big one. That\u2019s where I see ETH and SOL as quite similar, and some of the other designs. They made more rational or logical decisions I would say, but they\u2019re less explosive or less exposed to network effects.\u201d\n\nBurniske goes on to say that he and his company are interested in investing into the future infrastructure of blockchains as well as crypto projects focused on creating decentralized applications (DApps).\n\n\u201cIn the public markets, it has been buying the distressed, important infrastructure of the next expansion\u2026 They\u2019re big teams, they\u2019re well-financed, they\u2019re liquid. It\u2019s a little bit like being able to buy Microsoft and Amazon and those types of names after the dot-com crash\u2026\n\nRight now, at least at the venture stage, because again, I have all this infrastructure exposure in the public markets, venture stage, I\u2019m drawn more toward application stuff, and so it would be things like Tensor, which is built on Solana. So it\u2019s a NFT [non-fungible token] exchange built on Solana, really native experience. It\u2019s kind of like the TradingView or Bloomberg of NFTs\u2026\n\n[Another example would be] Vault. Vaults are basically programmable environments for artists to launch experiences for their top fans. They start with the music industry because the music industry has lost a lot of revenue because the top fans can\u2019t interact with artists like they used to be able to and Vault is trying to create that in a digital environment.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Cash outperformed Litecoin and Ethereum Classic in this category - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash ranks higher in decentralization than Litecoin and Ethereum Classic.\n\nBCH whales have been reaccumulating during the recent crash.\n\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] has been overshadowed by its more popular counterparts for the major part. Nevertheless, it has managed to retain a sizable following, and it is perhaps the most underrated cryptocurrency as far as decentralization is concerned.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Cash Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin Cash happens to be doing quite well on the decentralization front. A higher hash rate is often considered a good measure of decentralization for PoW networks, and it also translates to higher network security.\n\nBCH\u2019s hash rate has been above the 1 EH/s level for the last three months. Its hash rate at press time was as high as 1.78 EH/S.\n\nFor context, 1 EH/S is a million times more than 1 TH/S. Litecoin\u2019s latest hash rate figure came in at 716.06 TH/S while ETC\u2019s hash rate was 107.13 TH/s at press time.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash outperformed Litecoin and Ethereum Classic in terms of hash rate. Despite these findings, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s hash rate is lower than Bitcoin\u2019s 355.37 EH/S hash rate, hence BTC is still king in that regard.\n\nEven so, Bitcoin Cash does have a higher block size than BTC, and this facilitates a higher TPS. This is why, for some, BCH is a more preferable option as a peer-to-peer payment than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash price action\n\nBCH is still heavily undervalued compared to BTC yet both have a similar circulation and maximum supply.\n\nBitcoin Cash traded at $114.16 at press time, which represented a 25% discount from February highs. Nevertheless, it still showed a bit of an upside from its current weekly low of $105.05.\n\nBCH\u2019s price action reflects movements in the overall crypto market. But is Bitcoin Cash more likely to achieve a sizable bounce back? So far the recent pivot was underpinned by significant whale accumulation.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BCHs worth today?\n\nWhales in the highest address category holding over 1 million BCH have been adding to their balances. The same applies to addresses within the 1,000 to 100,000 BCH category. These addresses increased their holdings since 9 March, hence buying the dip.\n\nDespite the accumulation, addresses within the 100,000 to 1 million BCH category have been contributing to some selling pressure.\n\nThis may explain the limited upside. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s dormant circulation metric indicates that a significant amount of the cryptocurrency exchanged hands during the recent selloff.\n\nOn the other hand, the transaction volume indicated a surge in activity on 9 March. This observation confirmed the influx of buying activity observed when the price bottomed out."

        "content": "Crypto markets are flying as banks and traditional finance stocks get hammered by investors grappling with the collapse of several large banking institutions.\n\nAs a new trading week begins, bank stocks are proving to be the biggest losers, with some of them suffering as much as 75% in losses mere hours into the open.\n\nA look at Yahoo Finance\u2019s list of top losers shows a long list of banking stocks bleeding out badly.\n\nFollowing the recent closure of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, fears of a spreading banking contagion have rocked the sector as investors look to see who could be next on the chopping block. At time of writing, First Republic Bank (FRC) and Western Alliance (WAL) are taking the worst hits from the market turmoil, both down roughly 60%.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) bull and head of ARK Invest Cathie Wood warns that if the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t pivot on interest rates, more banks will be destroyed.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed continues to focus on lagging indicators like the CPI, and does not pivot in response to the deflationary forces telegraphed by the inverted yield curve, then this crisis will devour more regional banks and further centralize, if not nationalize, the US banking system.\n\nAs a result, [ARK Invest is] not surprised that BTC and ETH appreciated as US regional bank stocks imploded. Their blockchains are decentralized, transparent, and auditable. Banks are not and, in the last few days, have become less so.\u201d\n\nBitMEX founder and crypto veteran Arthur Hayes is also expecting the Fed to flip dovish again and print more money, presumably boosting risk assets like crypto.\n\nThat\u2019s a\u2026 savage move in the 2yr. In case you think this is something other than what it is. The bond market is saying it\u2019s back to print dat money mode. Don\u2019t fight the Fed!!!!\u201d\n\nBanking giant Goldman Sachs has reportedly forecasted that due to the crisis, the Fed will pause rate hikes this month rather than go ahead with the previously expected 25 basis point rise.\n\nSays Goldman economist Jan Hatzius,\n\n\u201cIn light of the stress in the banking system, we no longer expect the FOMC to deliver a rate hike at its next meeting on March 22.\u201d\n\nWith the banking issues that plagued crypto as of late no longer on center stage, Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and altcoin markets are rallying hard.\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $24,220, up 20% in the last 24 hours, while ETH is priced at $1,685, up 15% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAltcoins are also ripping, with many well above 30% in the last day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this week, the global cryptocurrency market experienced a decline as most digital assets saw a decrease in value due to various factors. Bitcoin , which began trading at the US$22,000 level on Monday, dropped to its lowest point since January 2021, reaching US$19,000. Similarly, Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a drop, falling to the US$1,300 level. As a result, both of these cryptocurrencies experienced significant losses in their weekly gains.However, following the release of the US jobs data on Friday, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced a rebound, as the US added 311,000 jobs in February, surpassing predictions. Over the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin and Ethereum gained 3%.Investors and traders reacted to the recent statement by US Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential interest rate hikes, resulting in sell-offs and increased concerns over aggressive interest rate policies. However, the decline in the crypto market may also be attributed to uncertainties surrounding Silvergate Bank broadly this week.In November, the bank faced significant withdrawals of $8.1 billion from investors following the FTX incident, leading to a chain reaction of negative consequences, including the sale of debt at a loss of $718 million. The bank's latest financial report showed staggering losses of $1 billion for Q4 and $949 million for the entire year of 2022, in contrast to the $76 million profit recorded in 2021. The bank's announcement of liquidation this week has also significantly impacted the crypto market.On the other hand, during early trading, the stock of Signature Bank (SBNY) experienced a decline of up to 30% due to the impact of Silvergate Bank's collapse on the wider banking industry. Nevertheless, SBNY is recovering from this sudden drop in a volatile market, and now its decline has been reduced to 22%.In an interesting turn of events, according to reports, Amazon is set to launch its own NFT marketplace next month. The marketplace will reportedly be accessible as a tab on Amazon's main website, under the name \"Amazon Digital Marketplace\".Meanwhile, the highly anticipated Shanghai hard fork update for the Ethereum blockchain has been delayed by approximately two weeks. Originally slated for a late March launch, it is now expected to be implemented in early April.The Ethereum network has recently introduced a new feature called account abstraction, which will assist users in recovering their cryptocurrencies in the event that they lose their wallet's private keys. This is just one of several upgrades to the ETH network.Regarding the price action, here is an overview of the best and worst-performing cryptocurrencies among the top 100 by market capitalization during the previous week:Top 5 crypto gainers during the week:1. Kava is up by 18%2. Bone ShibaSwap is up by 8%3. PAX Gold is up by 2%4. UNUS SED LEO is up by 1%5. KuCoin Token is up by 0.53%Top 5 crypto losers this week:1. Dash is down by 28%2. SingularityNET is down by 27%3. Stacks is down by 26%4. Frax Share is down by 25%5. Mina is down by 25%(The author, Edul Patel, is CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex , a global crypto investing platform)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Launches Vault Pin; Bitcoin, Ethereum Continue to Plunge - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), one of the newest cat meme tokens in the crypto space, recently launched its vault pin as a part of its presale. This coin is perhaps one of the best ways to take a break from the volatile market as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) dip further, causing all altcoins to turn red in the market.\n\nBIG Cat Crew Grab Free Loot Boxes\n\nBig Eyes recently introduced the vault pin, where investors are able to get a free Loot Box depending on the amount they spend.\n\nWhen buyers go to Big Eyes\u2019 website to purchase tokens, they can enter the vault pin 819 and get their reward, providing that they spend over $100.\n\nIf the user spends $100, they will get a Saver Tin which contains $1000 worth of BIG, as the biggest prize possible. For users who have spent $1000 they will receive a Cute Box, which may help them win up to $10,000 worth of BIG. Meanwhile, those who have spent $5000 can get a Kitty Vault, where they can win up to $25,000 worth of BIG.\n\nInvestors can also get the top two biggest Loot Boxes, depending on how much they have spent. If investors spend $10,000 and $100,000, they will get a Super Saiyan Box and Excali-Paw Chest, respectively. The Super Saiyan Box allows token holders to win up to $100,000 worth of BIG, while the Excali-Paw Chest contains a prize of up to $1 million worth of BIG!\n\nTherefore, the more users spend money on Loot Boxes, the bigger the box they will receive.\n\nBitcoin Takes a Nosedive Due to Looming Inflation\n\nBitcoin continues to have a bad month following Silvergate woes and macroeconomic impact. To make things worse, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that inflation could go higher than previously thought.\n\nAfter Powell\u2019s statement before the US Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, BTC fell by 1.6%, with its price down to $22,000.\n\nWith FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) spreading throughout the crypto market, Bitcoin investors are turning their backs on BTC and flocking to tokens with smart contract functionality.\n\nAs of now, crypto enthusiasts have every reason to invest in other altcoins or even new tokens. However, buying presale coins might be a better option to take a break from market volatility.\n\nEthereum Volume Has Been Down by 90% since 2020\n\nEthereum\u2019s price saw a recovery of 78% since June 2022, but it does not necessarily mean that it guarantees success. Looking at the digital asset\u2019s volume profile, it highly suggests a major crypto market correction.\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, Ether\u2019s volume profile showed a greater selling volume than the buying volume when there was about 160 million ETH across the $85-$270 price range. This was quickly replaced with a higher buying volume, with 64.25 million trades across the $270-$450 range from July to November 2020.\n\nWhen 2022 came, fewer investors participated in the coin\u2019s potential bottom compared to the start of the bull market in 2020. However, we are seeing a rising volume during the current ETH price rebound.\n\nRecently in March 2023, 65% of Ethereum was bought at a lower price, which means securing profits might still remain high even if a significant price drop looms ahead.\n\nThe crypto market has always been volatile, but if you want to rest from market volatility, consider investing in Big Eyes Coin today!

        "title": "Crypto Is Recovering Slowly: 2 Cryptos to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a stellar January and February, the crypto market has pulled back since the beginning of March. Even with the recent decline, the collective market cap of crypto is still up about 20% in 2023 and optimists are hopeful that the strong start to the year might signal an end to a brutal bear market that has gripped crypto since late 2021.\n\nThe exact timing of when this bear market will end is uncertain, but eventually this crypto winter will probably thaw just like those in the past. In preparation for a potential crypto spring, there are two cryptocurrencies to buy today.\n\nWhat these two might lack in originality is made up for in their track records of innovation, history of weathering multiple bear markets, and the continuing ability to disrupt the status quo. For these reasons, and many others, Bitcoin (BTC 1.02%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.43%) are recognized as the top assets in their class.\n\nThe original cryptocurrency\n\nFor Bitcoin, one of the main reasons it is the most valuable cryptocurrency is simply because it was the first, dating to 2009. Although this head start has receded in significance in recent years as other cryptocurrencies have jockeyed for market share, Bitcoin has remained at the top due to its inherent characteristics, which make it an attractive long-term investment. In the past five years it has returned more than 140% and over the decade it has notched a 44,300% return.\n\nTo many, Bitcoin is viewed as an asset that preserves wealth. Ingrained into Bitcoin's code is a feature that ensures it will become increasingly scarce, because only 21 million bitcoins will ever enter circulation. In addition, the rate of new coin creation is dwindling. Today, there are about 19.25 million coins in circulation, and the remaining 1.75 million will enter the supply gradually until 2140, when the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nIn addition to being completely decentralized and highly secure, Bitcoin does something that fiat currencies have failed to do -- protect purchasing power. Unlike currencies such as the U.S. dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and many others, Bitcoin's supply rate is growing extremely slowly. The central banks that control fiat currencies are able to inflate the supply in hopes of accomplishing a host of objectives. Whether the central banks achieve those objectives is a topic for another day, but what inevitably does happen through this process is a decrease in purchasing power. Bitcoin aims to resolve this by offering holders a way to increase their purchasing power with time as supply growth dwindles and demand increases.\n\nA groundbreaking invention\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is viewed by many as a store of value, Ethereum derives its value from its seemingly infinite number of use cases. When Ethereum came into existence in 2015 it completely changed the crypto economy. With the arrival of Ethereum, developers could now use computer code to cause specific actions to take place when particular criteria were met. Known as a smart contract, this code essentially turned Ethereum into programmable internet money that didn't require any one person or entity to oversee transactions.\n\nThis innovation laid the foundation for an entirely new and lucrative sector -- decentralized finance (DeFi). With these fancy new smart contracts, developers could optimize existing traditional financial processes, such as lending, because there's no need for a bank. Terms -- such as the loan's value, interest rate, and duration -- are all written into the smart contract. Outside of finance, smart contracts have the potential to even revolutionize industries such as real estate, supply chain management, and healthcare. As a result of this long term potential, Ethereum has treated investors to generous returns. Despite being newer than Bitcoin, Ethereum has actually outperformed the original cryptocurrency over the past five years and is up more than 180%.\n\nAll you need are these two\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in the way they are used, both serve a unique purpose. As a result, they a make up a majority of the value of the cryptocurrency asset class -- roughly 60%, with Bitcoin at 41% and Ethereum at 19%.\n\nBecause Bitcoin and Ethereum are so big, as they go, so goes the rest of the market. For this reason, they offer investors the simplest and most effective means to prepare for crypto's recovery. Rather than trying to find an obscure, unproven cryptocurrency, keep it simple. Investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum has treated investors well in years past and likely will for years to come."

        "content": "Privacy-oriented blockchain platform Aztec is preparing to shut down Aztec Connect, the network\u2019s privacy infrastructure serving as the encryption layer for Ethereum.\n\nAztec Network officially announced the upcoming closure of Aztec Connect, and plans to disable Aztec Connect deposits from front-ends like zk.money and zkpay.finance on March 17.\n\nAccording to a blog post by Aztec, users will be able to withdraw their funds from Aztec Connect with no fees for one year. \u201cWhile withdrawals will always be possible, they will become significantly more burdensome after March 21, 2024,\u201d Aztec said, recommending users withdraw funds as soon as possible. Since it launched in July 2022, Aztec Connect has amassed more than 100,000 users, the announcement notes.\n\nFrom March 2024, Aztec will no longer run a sequencer, meaning the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions. \u201cContract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be ceased,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nAs Aztec has fully open-sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol, the firm encourages the Aztec community to fork, deploy and operate a new version of the system. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it,\u201d Aztec said.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the shutdown of Aztec Connect marks a milestone in the development of a decentralized general-use encrypted blockchain. Before launching Aztec Connect in July 2022, Aztec first experimented with using a zk-Rollup with Aztec 1, which was \u201cslow, inefficient, costly\u201d and limited in functionality to \u201cbasic private transfers.\u201d\n\nSource: Aztec\n\nAztec emphasized that the research made with Aztec Connect will be usable and critical to the development of a next-generation blockchain, providing a basis for a fully programmable version of encrypted rollups, adding:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It\u2019s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted blockchain.\u201d\n\nAfter closing Aztec Connect, Aztec plans to focus on developing the universal zero-knowledge language known as Noir and the next-generation encrypted blockchain.\n\nRelated: Crypto projects respond to privacy coin ban in Dubai\n\nThe news comes amid ConsenSys preparing to release its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup on a public testnet on March 28. The launch will follow more than four years of research, potentially enabling faster transactions, higher throughput and better security of settlements on the Ethereum blockchain."

        "content": "The week hasn\u2019t been one of roses and sunshine for investors betting on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for Big Eyes Coin lovers, the honeymoon phase has only just begun.\n\nOn a whole, the market has not been doing well all week, with more reds than greens in what people are describing as a delayed reaction to the series of news affecting the crypto scene of late. Bitcoin has fallen back to $22k after much anticipation that it would hit $25k by the end of this quarter, and Ethereum hasn\u2019t fared much better with its current price of $1.5k.\n\nBIG, on the other hand, is unaffected as it continues to enjoy a successful presale journey and expand on its popularity and appeal.\n\nBig Eyes Sets A New Pre-sale Record\n\nBig Eyes has a large and unified following, contributing to the presale sales of $31.24 million. The coin has achieved the most amazing presale in the last two years, making history in the process. Due to the success of its presale, the team is offering intriguing rewards.\n\nIn addition to the exciting loot boxes that have been released, the meme coin has just introduced a vault pin that allows users to get up to 5,000% extra BIG tokens when they buy a loot box. When making a purchase, one is required to enter the pin, which is 819.\n\nThe Excali-Paw Chest, which costs $100,000, was just revealed one week ago as a new loot box that may enable one to win up to $1 million worth of Prizes.\n\nThe other boxes are the Saver tin, which costs $100, the Cute Box goes for $1,000, the Kitty Vault \u2013 $5,000; and the Saiyan box for $10,000.\n\nThe loot boxes are safe compared to any dangerous endeavour because everyone is guaranteed to receive at least a portion of what they put in. Less is not an option; only equal to or greater is.\n\nHas Bitcoin Hit A Wall?\n\nThroughout the previous 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has remained stable at just above $22,000. Despite this, the largest digital asset is still up by roughly one-third in 2023 thanks to its early-year gain, but Bitcoin has already dropped below its recent peak of $25,000.\n\nThe $23,000 to $24,000 area, which had reigned for all of February, was also decisively thrown in the rear-view by a severe selloff this week, wiping out optimistic traders who were relying on Bitcoin\u2019s recovery into a new bull market after a terrible 2022.\n\nWhile investors try to stay optimistic, many are wondering if BTC hasn\u2019t hit a wall in its ascent and is unable to push through.\n\nEthereum price goes down\n\nSince June 2022, the value of Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, has increased by 78%. Yet, this does not ensure additional gains, especially given that dropping trade volumes indicate a strong likelihood of a significant correction.\n\nThe trading volume tracks activities around the buying and selling of the coin. This is usually an indication of how well the coin is doing or not doing. In the last 24 hours, ETH fell by 0.42%, and this has been the consistent pattern all week.\n\nIt is currently selling for $1,556.43 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $6,769,307,144 USD as of the time of this writing.\n\nIt still remains number 2 on the crypto chart with a live market cap of $190,465,827,618 USD.\n\nClick below for more on Big Eyes Coin:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

It\u2019s a project worth keeping an eye on, especially if you\u2019re looking for a low-risk investment that could pay off big.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nThe crypto market can be daunting, but by taking advantage of the bear market and holding onto your investments for the long term, you could see significant gains. And if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, give SignupToken a shot. It\u2019s free to sign up, and who knows \u2013 you might just become one of the 1 million millionaires they\u2019re aiming to create!\n\nFollow the Link For More Information on Sign Up Token!\n\nWebsite: www.signuptoken.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets have been abuzz over the past few days as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB have seen a dramatic uptick in value. But, while the market has been experiencing some upswing, one digital asset is prepping for an even bigger push forward. DigiToads is a brand-new addition to the Ethereum chain, and its presale is attracting investors all around. Let\u2019s discuss what you could expect in the coming months.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\nDigiToads and its presale performance\n\nDigiToads is a new project in the cryptocurrency market that has been gaining attention for its innovative features. It is a P2E gaming, deflationary, staking reward token, and meme coin all rolled into one. The project also plans to launch a Metaverse called \u201cThe Swamp\u201d with a DAO Treasury and a toad NFT Collection.\n\nThe current stage of its presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in on the ground floor and see substantial returns on their investments.\n\nDigiTaods presale is divided into ten separate phases, and each one starts with the increased price. This dynamic model stimulates adoption and hype to get as early as possible to gain higher rewards once the project launches.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of how DigiToads price is scheduled to update over the presale phases:\n\nStage Price Stage 1 $0.01 Stage 2 $0.012 Stage 3 $0.016 Stage 4 $0.02 Stage 5 $0.024 Stage 6 $0.027 Stage 7 $0.036 Stage 8 $0.042 Stage 9 $0.047 Stage 10 $0.05 Launch $0.055\n\nThis model suggests that the earliest TOADS adopters can increase their initial deposits by 900% at the debut, which will grow even further thanks to the project\u2019s fascinating potential.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\nIs Bitcoin bouncing back?\n\nBitcoin is the first and most broadly utilized decentralized digital currency, enabling instantaneous, borderless, and anonymous payments to and from anybody globally. It was quite a trip for BTC, with the price hitting about $70,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, the last year has been a massive letdown for BTC enthusiasts, with the price falling to as low as around $15,000. The year 2023 started splendidly for Bitcoin, with a price increase of almost 50%. Regaining momentum in Bitcoin prices is an encouraging sign for the market as a whole and an indication that Bulls are preparing to reclaim control.\n\nIs Ethereum going up?\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has also had a rough year. Experts, however, are optimistic because the price had a stellar January, rising by about 33% and setting a new monthly high not seen since July 2022.\n\nBNB overview\n\nBNB is the native coin of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. BNB has a lot of practical applications, and its popularity is growing as the exchange does. But BNB has had its share of difficulties as well. There was mounting anxiety among investors about the transparency of major crypto exchange platforms, particularly because of last year\u2019s collapse of the FTX exchange.\n\nHowever, BNB started to see a resurgence of support from bulls after breaking $300 in January 2023\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nTo sum up, DigiToads Presale is an exciting opportunity to diversify your portfolios and potentially see substantial returns. The project\u2019s innovative features, including its deflationary nature and staking rewards, make it a well-rounded investment that stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe recent bounce back in the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin is a positive sign for the overall market and provides a tailwind for projects like DigiToads to gain traction and succeed.\n\nVisit The Website: https://digitoads.me/cgp\n\nPresale Registration: https://digitoads.me/buycgp\n\nJoin The Community: Linktr.ee/digitoads"

Thus, bringing down the banking and crypto sectors.\n\nSignature was the only viable option for most crypto companies after Silvergate shut its shop and on Sunday the U.S. said adieu to it as well.\n\nCrypto firms reveal their exposure to Signature\n\nSeveral crypto companies including Coinbase, Paxos, and Celsius have come forward to disclose their exposure to the bank.\n\n\u201cAs of close of business Friday March 10 Coinbase had an approximately $240m balance in corporate cash at Signature,\u201d the exchange announced on Twitter.\n\nAs of close of business Friday March 10 Coinbase had an approximately $240m balance in corporate cash at Signature. As stated by the FDIC, we expect to fully recover these funds. https://t.co/XY5L7m4RMs \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) March 12, 2023\n\nBlockchain company Paxos said (at press time) it held $250 million at the bank while Celsius admitted that Signature held their funds without disclosing the amount.\n\nThe companies shared hope that they will be able to recover the funds following the joint statement from different U.S. regulators. \u201cAll depositors of this institution will be made whole,\u201d the regulators said in relation to the Signature bank context.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe crypto market, eventually, recovered on 13 March. Most of the cryptocurrencies registered positive gains and investors were seen returning back to their trading activities. However, the question remains- Is this recovery just a calm before the storm?\n\nCrypto companies will now have to transfer their funds elsewhere with the demise of these banks. Circle has already moved its funds from SVB to BNY Mellon and others will soon follow suit.\n\nNotably, the collapse of these lenders will also affect crypto liquidity. The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and Signature\u2019s Signet were real-time payment platforms that allowed users to conduct transactions 24*7.\n\nNow that they are gone, investors might have to limit their payments to banking hours unlike earlier. It looks like crypto liquidity will be affected in the absence of these platforms unless an alternate system comes up."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market suffered a huge loss in value in 2022 which was undoubtedly a terrible year for cryptocurrencies, perhaps even an understatement. The FTX crash in November last year plummeted the prices of cryptocurrencies across the board and its effects are still felt in the industry which has prompted governments around the world to draft legislation to regulate crypto.\n\nThe FTX controversy has left a cloud of uncertainty causing the industry to trade in an alarmingly volatile state. What was once an industry with a global market capitalization of $2.86 trillion in 2021, now stands at $931.71 billion, a decrease of 6.58% from the previous day. The latest crumble comes as Silvergate Capital, a high profile US-based crypto-friendly bank announced its closure after failing to recover from the FTX crash.\n\nDespite the woes, however, many believe that 2023 will be successful and cryptocurrencies are on the road to recovery. Given their features of being fast and secure, cryptocurrencies have made the process of transferring money across borders a lot easier. But regardless that the cryptocurrency market is open 24/7, guessing the right timing means a lot and for new crypto investors it is a far more complicated environment to understand.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com offers holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as well as new investors a haven to store, secure, and control their assets for a period of time.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com \u2013 Buy, Store, and Lock Your Crypto Assets\n\nLockyourcrypto.com is a platform to store and transfer cryptocurrencies in a more secure and reliable way. The sole purpose of the platform is to give new crypto users control of their assets with the opportunity to lock up their funds for a period of time to eliminate the chances of buying and selling too early or too late.\n\nThe platform offers investors the option of storing their funds for 6 and 12 months as well as custom time periods. And once the transaction is confirmed the crypto holder will receive a contract or certificate which will serve as proof of ownership and can be used for future reference.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com employs industry-standard security measures, including high-level encryption, and secure storage practices, assuring crypto holders that their data and funds will remain secure for the duration of the chosen period.\n\nThe platform offers a simple process, which can be completed within just a few clicks, and Lockyourcrypto.com will not allow any withdrawals or transfers before the confirmed holding period has lapsed, except in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 The Inevitable Crash\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is having its worst week since November 2022 as its price crashed below the $20,000 mark to trade at $19,918.07 after declining by roughly 8% overnight and a weekly downward movement of 11.06%.\n\nThe industry\u2019s oldest and most powerful currency has been in an extremely volatile state since the beginning of March as an equity selloff, fear over higher interest rates and an escalating US regulatory crackdown on crypto combine to hurt investor sentiment.\n\nBitcoin has seen its 24-hour trading volume spike by over 73% to $37.5 billion as its market capitalization, at the time of writing, had dropped by 8.03% to $384 billion.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Impending Price Crash Below $1350?\n\nEthereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s second most powerful cryptocurrency, fell sharply below the $1500 mark for the first time since January this year as its price slumped overnight by 8.24% to trade at $1,408.78 continuing its weekly downward decline of 10.27%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price crash and the persistent downward trend are the aftermaths of Bitcoin\u2019s downward movement as analysts now suggest that a failure to close below a key level could result in Ethereum\u2019s price to dip below $1350.\n\nThe price slump comes after the Chair of Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, recently called Ethereum a commodity in front of US senators and SEC Chair Garry Gensler tightens the screws around cryptocurrencies, terming them \u2018unregistered securities\u2019.\n\nFore more information, visit:\n\nWebsite: https://lockyourcrypto.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

As a result, Bitcoin has surged past the $22,000 mark after hitting its lowest point since January. Within a day, the cryptocurrency has gained nearly 10 percent. Ethereum has also followed a similar trajectory and is trading above the $1,600 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin has seen a modest increase over the last 24 hours after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and USDC issuer, Circle announced its support to protect Silicon Valley Bank investors. Large-scale borrowing by small banks in the US, which are the major partners of tech companies, is experiencing high volatility as a domino effect. With funding figures not looking up anytime soon, more tech startups are expected to withdraw their existing reserves further impacting the market. This might also affect Crypto prices in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin has a price target of $18,400 with the possibility of visiting the $21,800 region before the expected decline. For Ethereum, a key support level remains at $1,423 and a break below this level could lead to a retest of last November's lows. The key resistance to watch out for is around $1,460, which represents the February lows. MATIC is currently trading around $1.08, Solana around $17.99 and TRX around $0.05938.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cTwo major US financial institutions have made headlines this week, as both Silicon Valley Bank and Circle faced significant challenges. Silicon Valley Bank's depositors were granted full access to their funds on Monday, following restrictions on withdrawals and transfers due to concerns about the bank's liquidity position. Meanwhile, Circle has been grappling with the aftermath of the failure of its key banking partner, Signature Bank, which has highlighted the dependency of the stablecoin ecosystem on some centralized entities.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market cap is back above the $1 trillion mark and BTC has surged by over 8 percent in the last 24 hours and is trading above the $22,300 mark. ETH which follows the BTC trajectory jumped by over 7 percent during the same period. The positive mood of the market is mainly due to the federal regulators hinting towards recovering Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s customer deposits. The news has uplifted investor sentiment with a promise of more liquidity in the market. The momentum will depend on the further regulatory recourse of SVB fallout.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has been able to restore some of its calm following the release of a mixed US employment data for February, which saw it briefly go below the $1,400 mark for the first time in nearly two months earlier in the session.\n\nWhen US wage growth came in lower than anticipated and following a surprising increase to 3.6% in the US unemployment rate, ETH, the cryptocurrency that drives the smart-contract enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last trading close to $1,425.\n\nAs a result, Ether is still down about 1% for the day and nearly 7% for the past 24 hours.\n\nThe price of ETH plummeted from the mid-$1,500 range due to worries about the failure of cryptocurrency-friendly Silvergate Bank and a rising liquidity crisis at another cryptocurrency-friendly bank, SVB Financial.\n\nOnce the New York Attorney General referred to Ether as a security in its ongoing lawsuit against KuCoin, sell pressure increased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly considering a crackdown on Ether on the grounds that it is an unregistered security, which has caused concern in the crypto markets in recent weeks.\n\nSome have also said that the next budget from the Biden administration, which aims to crack down on crypto tax loss harvesting, may have a negative impact on prices.\n\nToday\u2019s Ethereum Price\n\nDATE ETC USD Today 01 $ 1,452.70 Ethereum Price Prediction As long as ETH is able to maintain above $1,400, there hasn\u2019t been a sustained, convincing break below the critical $1,423 level of the 200-Day Moving Average. The 200DMA has been hailed as a crucial support level for 2023 and served as strong resistance in 2022. A sustained break above the 200DMA (as seen earlier this year) is considered as a vital indicator of a favorable shift in the market\u2019s medium-term momentum, hence a break below it would be a devastating blow to the medium-term bullish ETH thesis. It might be argued that this momentum would have vanished if ETH drops back below $1,400. Next week\u2019s important US CPI inflation data release will be closely watched. ETH bulls will be looking for a downside surprise in the data that causes markets to further discount the possibility of a 50 basis point rate hike from the Fed later this month. Bulls will also be looking for some quiet over the issues US banks that support cryptocurrencies are having. Advertisement If ETH does bounce, key resistance in the form of the February lows is located around $1,460 to watch out for. Bears will be watching for a retest of $1,350 as support on the downside. A breach below this level might lead to a retest of the lows from last November under $1,100. This is a crucial region of support, according to DeFi Llama, who used on-chain statistics, because a break below it would result in a large $68 million in liquidations of long bets put out on decentralised exchanges (DEX). DeFi Llama advises traders to keep an eye on the price around $1,240, where $30 million in DEX long positions could be lost.

        "content": "Market left in shock after an Ethereum whale moved billions in Shiba Inu worth a staggering $2.6 million, for a transaction fee of only $2.\n\nShytoshi Kusama makes a key statement regarding the recent launch of the bate version of the holy anticipated Shibarium upgrade.\n\nAn Ethereum whale have reportedly moved a significant amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB), following the launch of Shibarium beta. According to data from the blockchain-tracker service Etherscan, a crypto whale has left the entire market in shock after moving billions in Shiba Inu.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the whale transferred a whopping 258,837,671,569 SHIB to Shiba Inu\u2019s smart contract. The funds can either be burned or utilized for the network\u2019s ongoing projects. The Shiba Inu tokens moved were worth over $2.64 million as at when the transaction was carried out.\n\nNotably, the transaction, despite being a staggering sim, only cost the whale around $2 in fees, to successfully process the transfer. It is also worth noting that the whale in question still has an even larger amount of Shiba Inu tokens in its possession. The transfer has left no holes in the whale\u2019s account, as the whale still reportedly holds a mouth-watering 4,925,361,871,313 Shiba Inu, which is worth more than $50.23 at report time. Shib is up 2.54% at this time, with prices sitting at $0.00001053.\n\nThe whale account also holds $11.97 million worth of Polygon (MATIC), $5.55 million worth of Chainlink (LINK), $2.17 million worth of AAVE (AAVE), and $2.63 worth of Compound (COMP).\n\nThe beta version of the Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution is live, here\u2019s what to know\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu community is still in celebratory mode, after the network successfully launched the beta version of the highly anticipated layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead shiba inu developer revealed that the testnet is now available to beta testers for use.\n\n\u201c\u2026today we begin the EARLY Beta Test of the Shibarium Network which we call PUPPYNET! As we\u2019ve mentioned many times, Shibarium is a layer 2 blockchain that allows anyone to build DAPPS, integrate into IRL businesses, and power projects with it. It is low cost, burns Shib in the process, and is being adjusted as the beta test continues over the next few months.\u201d Kusama noted in a recent blogpost.\n\nIn a recent blogpost detailing the entirety of the launch, and everything developers and users need to look out for, Kusama stated that Shib burns will on tokens in the network. Developers will be able to see the amount of burnt Shib in a running chart on a burn portal.\n\nHe also warned that all Puppynets are not real and that users should not spend their Shib tokens on them despite intense shilling from other market players. He goes on to emphasize the importance of doing your own research (DYOR) to avoid falling for scams.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
