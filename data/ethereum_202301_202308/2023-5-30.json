        "title": "100000 Addresses Are Helping Ethereum Scale \u2014 You Can Too - Blockworks",
        "content": "To scale Ethereum, researchers came up with a plan to make storing data from layer-2 rollups much cheaper. The first phase entails the introduction of EIP-4844 \u2014 known as proto-danksharding \u2014 to Ethereum mainnet, anticipated to happen with the Dencun upgrade by year\u2019s end.\n\nBut to do that, they needed some entropy \u2014 random data, or \u201csecrets\u201d if you will \u2014 and preferably lots of it.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce a new \u201cblob-carrying transaction\u201d \u2014 a temporary data storage mechanism for layer-2\u2019s to pass data to Ethereum mainnet validators.\n\nBlockspace on Ethereum is at a premium, so to cut down on the requirements for verifying layer-2 data, Ethereum will use a polynomial commitment scheme known as KZG commitments, which is necessary for data availability sampling under proto-danksharding.\n\nKZG commitments, in turn, require a \u201ctrusted setup\u201d \u2014 a way to generate a common set of parameters that provers and verifiers use to function. For the setup to be trusted, there needs to be a set of random values used as inputs that nobody knows. When done improperly, it can compromise the proof system, as famously happened to Zcash in 2018.\n\nWithout getting too deep into the technical nuances of Merkle Trees and Kate proofs (the \u201cK\u201d in \u201cKZG\u201d), it\u2019s important to know just one thing:\n\nYou only need one honest participant to guarantee the validity of the trusted setup for everyone.\n\nEthereum researchers devised a way to let anyone with an Ethereum address participate, with some history of using the network required to join in. It\u2019s a goodwill gesture \u2014 you get nothing in return except for peace of mind.\n\nAs a participant, you only need to trust yourself and no one else, because each contribution contributes to the randomness of the system \u2014 effectively guaranteeing that there can be no collusion in the trusted setup. It\u2019s easy and takes just a minute of work and some waiting at ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nWhen opened to the public on April 17, contributions were limited to Ethereum users with a lot of transaction history to cut down on the wait time. But those limits were gradually reduced such that today you can contribute with only 16 transactions.\n\nThat lowered bar is one reason why the number of total contributions has been on the up and up, recently passing 100,000 unique contributions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 100,000 individuals \u2014 one person can have more than one address \u2014 but only one contribution per address is allowed, and each one contributes a small measure of security to the rollup-centered future of Ethereum.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh rally if it clears the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a substantial decline if it breaks the $1,870 support.\n\nEthereum Price Reaches Key Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. ETH corrected lower below the $1,900 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. However, the bulls were active above the $1,870 support zone. There is also a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels might send Ether toward $2,000. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,120. Any more gains above the $2,120 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,250 resistance. An intermediate resistance might be $2,200.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,890 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,780 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,870\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,920\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This transfer process is irreversible.\n\nThe launch of the BRC-721E standard occurred on the same day as a significant milestone for Ordinals, an iteration of NFTs on the Bitcoin network, as it surpassed its 10 millionth inscription, according to data from analytics platform Dune Analytics.\n\n\u201cThe enabling of non-fungibility on Bitcoin with Ordinal theory is opening up a wide array of NFT use cases that we have seen develop on Ethereum from 2018-2022,\u201d said Yohann Calpu, chief marketing officer of Forkast Labs. \u201cMany Ethereum NFT holders buy into the Bitcoin concept of increased decentralization, immutability and scarcity.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin fell 18.50% to US$4.09 million, in the 24 hours leading up to 8:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum NFT sales surged 16.7% in the same period.\n\n\n\nThe sales spike has not translated into an overall uplift for the Ethereum NFT market. The Forkast ETH NFT Composite, an index designed to track the performance of the Ethereum NFT market, is down 0.26% over the past day and 6.21% on the month.

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) investor and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed that Ethereum, not Bitcoin, will be responsible for driving the bulk of new users towards crypto.\n\nOn a May 31 episode of the Show Me The Crypto podcast, Ver \u2014 labeled \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his early Bitcoin advocacy \u2014 said that despite Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues and the other layer-one \u201cclones\u201d that have popped up in its wake, the Ethereum ecosystem is still where the action is:\n\n\u201cEven though Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.\u201d\n\nVer praised the rise of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon (MATIC) that can help share some of the load away from the main chain.\n\nVer provides an account of the \u201ccivil war\u201d that occurred in the early days of Bitcoin between Etheruem\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin core developers.\n\nDisagreements over the use of smart contracts and moving away from the idea of blockchains being used purely as currency or stores of value eventually drove Buterin to develop Ethereum, Ver noted:\n\n\u201cAll of that would have been built on top of Bitcoin if not for the scaling civil war that happened. These Bitcoin core developers hate Vitalik, and they basically drove him from the project to go and create Ethereum, and more power to him for that.\u201d\n\nVer also spoke on the recent Ledger debate, calling the controversial Recover service \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The service allows users to store their encrypted seed phase with external custodians to safeguard against loss; Ver said that while it\u2019s fine for people to have custodial accounts and choose to recover their keys if they wish, the ethos of crypto is centered on having full control of your assets at all times.\n\nRelated: Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum\n\nIn January, Ver was sued by a trading unit of the crypto lending firm Genesis for failing to pay some $20.8 million in unsettled crypto options.\n\nVer claimed in a January Reddit post that he had \u201csufficient funds\u201d to pay the outstanding sum but argued that because Genesis was no longer solvent, he was not legally required to uphold his end of the deal.\n\nLast year, Ver made headlines for allegations of defaulting on a debt. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed Ver owed the firm $47 million USD Coin (USDC) and was bound by a written contract. On June 28, Ver denied these claims without directly mentioning the company.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let\u2019s get into what\u2019s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n9c5633eec1494d4082106924f68b42e7\n\n6cb7e0d5822d4f94890b7c0403522c78\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by \u201cburning\u201d the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nStory continues\n\na4599e0a4dd145aeb61cc2d24f2dd35b\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain\u2019s DMarket, and ImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained are any indication of what\u2019s to come (they are), we\u2019re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\n2a9870b110894ef6afe55c2126bd4afc\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what\u2019s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nd8d1482d3ccc4c458ecb33ecf14db76e\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fascinated to see who Bitcoin\u2019s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren\u2019t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you\u2019ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers\u2019 art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\n5c6fad5d8fee4767872aa5e437fb3e7f\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant NFT platform in terms of trading volume and overall value, Bitcoin has undoubtedly swallowed up much of the buzz in the NFT space via the recent rise of the Ordinals protocol. And for Ethereum NFT holders who\u2019d rather be on Bitcoin, there\u2019s now a migration solution\u2014but it\u2019s a one-way trip.\n\nBitcoin Miladys, an NFT project that offers derivatives of the Ethereum-based Milady Maker profile picture (PFP) project, launched a bridge in partnership with marketplace Ordinals Market and the Xverse Bitcoin wallet. The BRC-721E token standard, as it\u2019s called, enables the bridge to migrate artwork and data over to Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nThe bridge lets holders of Ethereum NFTs\u2014defined by the ERC-721 token standard\u2014effectively move the asset to the Bitcoin blockchain via a burn-and-mint process. The original Ethereum NFT is sent to an inaccessible \u201cburn\u201d address, which means it\u2019s essentially destroyed on the chain, but then the asset is recreated on Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Miladys were initially minted on Ethereum, so the bridge was initially designed to let its holders bring them over to Bitcoin. But as the Ordinals Market page describes, the BRC-721E token standard and bridge can work with any compatible Ethereum NFT.\n\nSome cross-chain bridges use an escrow wallet in the middle and hold the original NFT or asset, then create a new version on the target chain. That makes it possible to reclaim the original asset on the original chain by burning the secondary version.\n\nIt\u2019s a one way bridge by the way\ud83e\udd2d pic.twitter.com/vTCj8paFV6 \u2014 Bitcoin Miladys\ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf4a\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf38 (@BitcoinMiladys) May 28, 2023\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible with NFTs migrated to Bitcoin via the BRC-721E process. As mentioned, it\u2019s a one-way journey, and the original NFT is essentially destroyed in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe process may still prove appealing to Bitcoin aficionados, or perhaps NFT holders who believe that the buzzy rise of Ordinals will give their migrated NFT more value. However, there are potential risks to switching blockchains.\n\nFor example, back in February, a Bored Ape Yacht Club owner burned his original Ethereum NFT and minted a new version on Bitcoin via Ordinals. Soon after, one of the Bored Ape co-creators at Yuga Labs tweeted that the holder had \u201ceffectively given up\u201d the license to the myriad benefits and perks tied to Bored Ape NFT ownership.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, launched in January, creates a way for people to \u201cinscribe\u201d digital media like artwork, PFPs, and even functional apps and games to the Bitcoin blockchain. Each \u201cdigital artifact\u201d is inscribed to a single satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000 of a full Bitcoin.\n\nMore than 10 million inscriptions have been made to date, with that milestone reached on Monday. The month began with just 3 million total inscriptions, and the latest surge has been fueled primarily by the rise of the BRC-20 standard, which uses Ordinals inscriptions to let users mint fungible tokens on Bitcoin\u2014such as meme tokens."

        "content": "What Is Arbitrum (ARB)?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 9 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum offer faster and cheaper transactions to solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling problem.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Arbitrum uses the optimistic rollup technology to batch transactions, execute them off the main Ethereum chain, and store the confirmation on the main chain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Compared to other Layer 2 solutions like zkSync, it offers a more established ecosystem of dApps and complex smart contracts due to its Virtual Machine.\n\nWhile the Ethereum network is the smart contract network of choice for many, it can be slow and expensive at specific times and for certain uses. In cases of high activity, the limitations of Ethereum become apparent, with transactions getting stuck and news headlines featuring 3-figure gas fees. Furthermore, when attempting to solve the problem of scalability, a blockchain\u2019s decentralization and security are impacted too. This is what\u2019s known as the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions are the solution to this problem. Without getting too technical, layer two solutions offer ways to use Layer 1 blockchains in a way the mainnet\u2019s technology would not allow. Basically, they help users enjoy the security of Ethereum without paying an arm and a leg to use it. One such solution is Arbitrum.\n\nIn this article, Ledger Academy will unpack what Arbitrum is: From its ARB token and how it works to how it differs from their Layer 2 solutions like Optimism. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nWhat Is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that powers fast smart contract transactions while reducing transaction costs.\n\nLayer 2 solutions can scale the base Layer 1 blockchain by delegating complex computational tasks, such as transaction processing and data storage to the second chain. In short, the Layer 2 blockchain executes the smart contract, and the Layer 1 blockchain stores the data. If you want to know more about how the mainnet works, check out our article on what is Ethereum.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, Arbitrum handles blockchain transaction processing and batching, reducing congestion and cost from the main network.\n\nFor instance, DeFi projects like Sushiswap and Aave use Arbitrum in the hood to offer efficient swaps with lower gas fees.\n\nHow Does Arbitrum Work?\n\nAbritrum\u2019s Layer 2 solution uses blockchain rollups to achieve efficient transaction processing. Rollups use a 2-layer architecture to process transactions off-chain before settling them on-chain. The benefit is that the blockchain no longer needs to validate separate transactions \u2013 it can directly confirm a \u201crolled up\u201d batch of transactions.\n\nThis scaling solution differs from other Layer 2s, such as sidechains, since rollups typically derive their security from the main blockchain.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s scaling solution uses a particular type of roll-up called optimistic rollups.\n\nWhat Is an Optimistic Rollup?\n\nOptimistic rollups process transactions off-chain like other roll-ups but add compression techniques while bundling the transactions. This compression helps reduce gas fees and optimizes block space, by storing only necessary data on the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, optimistic rollups allow the main chain to process more transactions while requiring less space.\n\nOptimistic rollups rely on an optimistic assumption that most transactions are valid. They only execute a costly verification process when there is a dispute. Network participants can raise disputes for faulty blocks in a week. If any faulty blocks are present, the validator that approved them loses their collateral. However, this complex fraud detection process also means processing withdrawals from the chain needs a week.\n\nArbitrum Ecosystem\u2019s Features\n\nAccording to the 2023 Developer Report, the Arbitrum chain is one of the fastest-growing Layer 2 solutions, with over 50% YoY growth in developer headcount. Due to this exponential growth in development, the Arbitrum ecosystem now comprises many different elements. Let\u2019s look at the major products \u2014 Arbitrum, Nitro, and Nova \u2014 and how they differ.\n\nWhat is Arbitrum One?\n\nLaunched on August 31st, 2021, Arbitrum One is the official mainnet of the Arbitrum crypto ecosystem. It powers the entire ecosystem and processes transactions on the Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM), an extension compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe team behind Arbitrum, Offchain Labs, is a New-York based Ethereum startup, co-founded in 2018. To further it;s growth, it secured $120 million in a Series B funding round in September 2021. Some of their notable investors include Alameda Research, Pantera Capital, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nWhat Is Arbitrum Nitro?\n\nArbitrum Nitro is a major technical upgrade to the underlying tech of Arbitrum One\u2019s ecosystem. With Nitro, it becomes faster, more EVM-compatible, and cheaper. Nitro achieves this by introducing interactive proofs that run over the WASM code used by Arbitrum.\n\nWith Nitro, developers can also use standardized EVM-compatible languages and run unmodified EVM contracts. This has opened up the development scope on it and attracted more developers.\n\nArbitrum One officially migrated to Nitro on August 31st 2022, one year after its public launch.\n\nWhat Is Arbitrum Nova?\n\nArbitrum Nova is a new chain focusing on reducing individual transaction costs by reducing the data storage on the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction data is available with third parties on the \u201cdata availability committee\u201d \u2014 a handful of storage providers such as Infura and Google Cloud.\n\nIn contrast to Arbitrum One, which stores full transaction data on Ethereum, Nova only uses Ethereum to store data signatures from these companies. This, of course, makes Nova more centralized. Thus, Nova sacrifices some of the security of the Ethereum blockchain to reduce transaction fees and increase scalability.\n\nArbitrum Nova is especially useful for games and social dApps with higher volume of transactions but low individual transaction value. One example is Reddit\u2019s community points program which uses Nova to reward community participation.\n\nArbitrum Token: What is ARB?\n\nThe Arbitrum token, $ARB, is the native ERC-20 compatible governance token for the Arbitrum blockchain. You can use $ARB to transfer value, as an investment, or to vote on governance decisions.\n\nOne of the most anticipated airdrops of 2023, $ARB had strict eligibility criteria to qualify \u201cactive\u201d users. You had to fulfill at least 3 of these 6 conditions to claim $ARB ERC token:\n\nBridge assets to either Arbitrum One or Nova Perform transactions on Arbitrum regularly at least two months before the snapshot in February 2023 Interact with at least 4 Arbitrum smart contracts or perform 4 transactions on the network Overall transaction value should be least $10,000 Deposit a minimum of $10,000 on Arbitrum One Use the social chain, Arbitrum Nova for at least 3 transactions\n\nTo find out more about airdrops, check out the Ledger Academy article on what is an airdrop.\n\nARB Tokenomics\n\nThe initial supply for the $ARB launch is 10 billion, with a 2% yearly inflation rate. In March 2023, 12.75% of this total supply was split between eligible users and DAOs. This equates to a rough circulating supply of about 1.275 billion $ARB.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete breakdown of the current token allocation for $ARB:\n\nInvestors receive 17.53%\n\nDAOs in the Arbitrum Ecosystem receive 1.13%\n\nIndividual Wallets receive 11.62%\n\nDAO Treasury receives 42.78%\n\nTeam and Future Team + Advisors receive 26.94%.\n\nNote: The Arbitrum DAO, or the decentralized governance body for it, can change these allocation numbers by voting on them.\n\nToken Utility\n\nApart from being used to transfer value on the Arbitrum blockchain, $ARB token grants you a seat at the governance table of the Arbitrum DAO. The DAO makes crucial decisions on the protocols\u2019 working, such as how they should allocate funds, investments in the ecosystem, and even technical changes.\n\nThe network makes these decisions through proposals on an open forum like Snapshot.org where users can connect their wallets and cast their votes. For instance, treasury proposals outline exactly when and why the team needs the funds and their entire plan. Then, if the proposal passes, on-chain smart contracts automatically execute the necessary transactions.\n\nApart from governance decisions, $ARB holders can also vote on electing members for the Security Council \u2014 a 12-member team in charge of the treasury wallet.\n\nHow Does Arbitrum Compare To Other Chains?\n\nThe race to build the best scaling solution for Ethereum is heating up \u2014 with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Metis emerging as top contenders. Although most of these solutions operate with the same goal \u2014 reducing transaction fees and times \u2014 they accomplish it with different mechanisms. In this section, let\u2019s look at what makes it unique from other solutions.\n\nArbitrum vs. Other Layer 2s: What\u2019s the difference\n\nTwo of the most popular Ethereum layer two scaling solutions so far include optimistic roll-ups and ZK-rollups. Developers and ecosystem projects currently prefer optimistic roll-ups like Arbitrum but ZK-rollups like zkSync are quickly catching up.\n\nArbitrum offers a more established ecosystem of dApps and complex smart contracts due to its Virtual Machine.\n\nOn the other hand, ZK rollups use zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs. With these proofs, you can guarantee the validity of all cryptocurrency transactions without any optimistic assumptions. In other words, the network verifies every block hash to confirm it is right. While the up-front computation is more with zk-rollups, confirmation times are way faster. Popular ZK rollup projects include ZkSync and Starkware.\n\nZkSync offers stronger privacy guarantees and faster withdrawal times. Other zk-rollups like Starkware, have similar benefits, such as ZkSync but differ in proof size, verification or prover time etc.\n\nArbitrum Vs Optimism: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nWhile Arbitrum and Optimism are optimistic rollups focusing on finding faulty blocks, they implement the technology slightly differently. Optimistic rollups mainly depend on the Ethereum chain for security while Arbitrum has its own. It has its own Virtual Machine, while Optimism uses Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine partly.\n\nAnother key difference is that Optimism relies on a single \u201cfraud proof\u201d which makes it fast but can be easier to fake. Arbitrum, on the other hand, requires multiple proofs to confirm valid transactions.\n\nHow To Use Arbitrum Network Securely\n\nNow, you can safely send and recieve ARB directly through Ledger Live. This makes transferring your ARB assets easy and secure.\n\nHowever, to use many apps in Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem, you\u2019ll need to connect via a third-party wallet such as Metamask. For the full guide, read this support article on how to use Arbitrum One via a Ledger. But these are the steps in shorthand:\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a wallet, install Metamask to your browser and create a new wallet. Connect your physical Ledger wallet to your Metamask account through the \u201cconnect hardware wallet option\u201d Make sure you follow the steps correctly, as if you accidentally import your Ledger wallet into metamask, your funds will be at stake. Go to your Ledger wallet on Metamask and click \u201cAdd Network\u201d Select Arbitrum One. Approve it and you\u2019re ready to interact with the network!\n\nHowever, before interacting with the network, you might want some ARB.\n\nHow to Buy ARB\n\nBuying ARB on a decentralized exchange is pretty straightforward.\n\nThe first step is to send your $ETH from the Layer 1 blockchain, Ethereum to Arbitrum via a bridge. Once you bridge your assets to it, you can use Sushiswap, an Arbitrum-based exchange, to convert your Ethereum to $ARB via its user-friendly swap interface.\n\nNote: You can technically bridge any cryptocurrency present on the Arbitrum network to buy $ARB, such as $USDC etc, but you\u2019ll still need some $ETH to pay the transaction fees.\n\nHowever, you need to understand that buying new cryptocurrencies like $ARB (well, actually any cryptocurrency) can be volatile.\n\nNew cryptocurrencies typically have fewer backers \u2014 which means a single person with a large amount of $ARB can greatly impact the price. Further, newer cryptocurrencies are prone to speculation and uncertainty \u2014 causing sudden price changes that can be difficult to predict.\n\nIt\u2019s important to do your research while buying any cryptocurrency \u2014 pay close attention to the team\u2019s track record, use cases of the currency, and the risk-to-reward ratio for buying a newer currency.\n\nStaying Secure While Navigating the Arbitrum Network\n\nWhile Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum are very exciting, remember they are also very new. Bridging from one network to another introduces more blockchain and third-party touchpoints \u2014 which hackers can target.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s a good idea to always add an extra layer of safety for your funds with a hardware wallet like Ledger. Ledger\u2019s devices ensure that your private key is always protected while you explore the exciting world of Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nChoose security, choose Ledger."

        "content": "Economist and crypto trader Alex Kr\u00fcger is turning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), predicting they will finish the year strong.\n\nKr\u00fcger tells his 153,900 Twitter followers that the Federal Reserve is likely near the end of raising interest rates to tame inflation, and will likely pivot in December.\n\nHe believes the markets will anticipate the Fed\u2019s pivot and start rallying as early as August.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has delivered 20 x 25bps (basis points) rate hikes in its fastest and most aggressive hiking cycle in history. Which means at least 90% of the Fed hikes are behind (if not all). That to me is all that matters, and makes it easy to stay long. This has been my view all year.\n\nMy base case is a December pivot and a bull market gearing up in early August to front run this. Why? The economy is cooling and inflation is falling. The Fed is forced to overshoot (hiking) due to its past errors \u2026 which increases odds of it pivoting when data rolls over.\u201d\n\nKr\u00fcger says even if inflation proves more sticky and the Fed does not pivot in December, he still believes the markets will end 2023 higher than they are trading at today.\n\n\u201cIf core inflation remains sticky there will be no pivot in 2023, but with the Fed at least 90% done regardless (and the AI revolution) upside into year end still is a good bet.\u201d\n\nThe crypto trader also says he is taking long positions on both BTC and ETH, betting on them having big moves to the upside.\n\nAccording to Kr\u00fcger, Bitcoin is having a challenging time crossing the key $30,000 level because investors are selling on rallies and volume.\n\nKr\u00fcger says that if Bitcoin can cross the $30,000 level and fails to form a head and shoulders pattern, which is used in technical analysis to determine a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal, it will likely soar.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, on BTC land it\u2019s been hard to push higher as everyone has been emboldened to sell rips and vol. But if by chance the market manages to get above $30,000, then TA (technical analysis) says that\u2019s a major failed [head and shoulders] bear trap [and] high odds of a strong rip.\n\nI am decently long BTC and ETH via spot and calls, and ready to get more aggressive later in the year.\u201d\n\nHowever, the crypto trader warns that if Bitcoin retests $26,000, the digital asset may show further weakness.\n\n\u201cOn the downside, if BTC pushes back down to $26,000, chart to me says should see a decent flush on a stops run (good spot to de-risk if very long).\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $27,702 at time of writing, while Ethereum is worth $1,904.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "XRP could reach a $5 price in the foreseeable future, according to Versluis who highlighted that it is the only asset to have surpassed ETH in market cap.\n\nMason Versluis, notable crypto podcaster and the founder of Gold Squad, remains bullish on XRP. The crypto influencer recently implied that the asset has the potential to hit $5 in the foreseeable future. Versluis\u2019 confidence in this assertion is compounded by the fact that XRP remains the only asset to have ever surpassed Ethereum in terms of market cap.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Versluis acknowledged that it is easy to ridicule crypto proponents who forecast a $5 price target for XRP. This is likely because XRP would need to surge by 900% from its current price in order to hit $5. Some investors may harbor doubts about the asset\u2019s capacity to rally by such an extent.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to laugh at someone when they say $XRP will hit $5. Do NOT underestimate one of the only coins to ever surpass $ETH in market cap ?\u200d??? \u2014 MASON VERSLUIS ?? (@MasonVersluis) May 29, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, the crypto influencer emphasized that the community should not underestimate the potential of XRP, as it remains the only asset to have surpassed Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization. This feat is a testament of XRP\u2019s capacity to register astronomical gains. The asset is also known for staging periodic solo rallies.\n\nNotably, XRP has surpassed Ethereum\u2019s market cap on numerous occasions in the past. The first time this happened was on May 8, 2017 when XRP hit a valuation of $8.347 billion with ETH standing at $8.341 billion. This made XRP the second largest crypto asset. The asset achieved this feat two more times in December 2017 and also in September 2018.\n\nIs XRP Undervalued?\n\nPresently, most investors believe XRP is immensely undervalued at its current price. These investors point to the long-standing litigation between Ripple and the US SEC as the major factor behind the pressure on XRP\u2019s price. They assert that an end to the legal dispute would lead to a price surge, with the asset potentially hitting $5.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCertain individuals have presented several models for determining XRP\u2019s fair market value, as they believe the asset\u2019s current market price is way below its intrinsic value. As The Crypto Basic recently reported, Matt Hamilton, a former Ripple Director, cast doubts on the latest of these models.\n\nIn January, Versluis also highlighted XRP\u2019s hidden potential due to its utility as an efficient bridge currency for fast and effective cross-border transactions. \u201cXRP solves a MULTI-TRILLION dollar problem,\u201d Versluis said. He noted that the asset should at least be trading at $5.\n\nIt is important to note that several analysts have forecasted a looming XRP pump. Particularly, Egrag, a notable chartist, recently emphasized that the asset\u2019s next trajectory could either take it to $3.3 or $250. Meanwhile, XRP is currently trading for $0.5005, up 3.67% in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals have received fresh utility with the introduction of a new token standard aimed at facilitating the migration of Ethereum-based NFTs onto Bitcoin.\n\nDubbed BRC-721E, the new standard permits the transformation of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 NFTs into Ordinals \u2014 which allow for text, images and code to be \u201cinscribed\u201d on a single satoshi.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn other words, users can send their favorite digital collectibles straight to Bitcoin from Ethereum by initiating a bridging contract acting as a single on-chain inscription request.\n\nBRC-721E is a collaboration between NFT collection Milady Maker and Ordinals Market \u2014 a marketplace dedicated to the buying and selling of Ordinals.\n\nThe process involves transferring a user\u2019s NFT to a burn address, effectively rendering their NFT unusable on Ethereum thereafter. Once burned, users can inscribe valid BRC-721E data onto Bitcoin.\n\nThe burn process prompts an on-chain inscription request where Ethereum transaction data is then parsed to find and record any uninscribed burns, according to the marketplace\u2019s webpage.\n\nAfter a successful burn and inscription, the migrated NFT appears on the Ordinals Market collection page with its accompanying metadata.\n\nWhile the BRC-721E standard does not initially store metadata directly on the Bitcoin network, it does have the capacity for this to change and evolve over time, the creators said.\n\nStill, the point regarding the NFTs provenance is an important one. As such, Milady Maker and Ordinals Market offer solutions while the protocol adapts.\n\nAccording to the creators that involves either:\n\nPreserving a less detailed version of the image directly on the blockchain, and incorporating a link to the original Ethereum token within the primary image data\n\nEmploying a combined structure of BRC-721 and BRC-721E to provide on-chain information, complete with evidence of the asset\u2019s \u2018burning\u2019 or transfer process\n\nPreserving data with multiple components directly on the blockchain, where one of these components is a valid BRC-721E JSON format data\n\nLeveraging established methods like \u2018teleburn\u2019, which requires users to record information beforehand and direct it to an unconventional \u2018burn\u2019 address\n\nIn other words, these strategies suggest ways to embed lower-quality images and key information about digital items on Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, attempting to shore up their accessibility and visibility while preserving a link to their original details.\n\nBRC-721E\u2019s execution follows the launch of the Ordinal Inscriptions protocol on Jan. 21, amid fanfare, that sought to introduce digital art use cases for the first time to the aging Bitcoin network.\n\nThe approach has been well-received so far. Earlier this month, the Bitcoin network hit a record by processing the highest number of transactions in a single day, largely due to Ordinals.\n\nOthers still are attempting to emulate that success across different blockchains.\n\nLast week, the Interchain Foundation in collaboration with blockchain development company Bianjie introduced the ICS-721 NFT token standard on Cosmos. The hope is that the application will enhance interoperability across chains without the need for a bridge.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Graphic designers have an old saying: \u201cYour project can be fast, cheap or good \u2014 pick two.\u201d It\u2019s a classic trilemma. Rushing to create something might mean it\u2019ll be delivered quickly, and therefore less expensive. Then again, the end product could be disappointing. If customers go the \u201ccheap and good\u201d route instead, they\u2019re willing to wait a while \u2014 it\u2019s going to take time, and projects that pay better will be prioritized.\n\nFor years, there\u2019s also been a lot of talk in the blockchain world about a trilemma in terms of decentralization, security and scalability: decentralized networks can only provide two of the three benefits at any given time.\n\nExperts argue that scalability requires a trade-off with security. In this case, a network can handle more transactions, but the risk of an exploit increases.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the case. Right now, developers are working on layer-2 solutions to help increase the capacity of the Ethereum network following its ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIntroducing hybrid rollups\n\nThere is one solution allowing developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) \u2014 and this is hybrid rollups, which combine two different architectures and can cope with high levels of traffic, making Ethereum a compelling blockchain for building the next generation of the internet.\n\nThe first element involves optimistic rollups, where transactions are processed off-chain to reduce network congestion and cut gas costs \u2014 another key hurdle on the road to adoption. According to the developers, this has the potential to increase scalability by up to 100 times, while records are then updated on the mainnet.\n\nThe second ingredient is zero-knowledge rollups, which provide security and fast finality. This technology can reduce the time it takes to complete transactions from seven days to as little as four hours \u2014 all without the need for additional data processing. In the real world, this is the equivalent of packing more clothes in a suitcase. Even better, trustless cryptographic mechanisms ensure the blockchain is resilient against exploits.\n\nBringing both types of rollups together makes sense, as each of these architectures has its limitations. A hybrid approach takes advantage of both, while providing the best possible experience for users and developers alike.\n\nOther advantages\n\nHybrid rollups are the brainchild of Metis, an Ethereum-based layer-2 solution provider. According to the project, the benefits don\u2019t end there.\n\nSource: Metis\n\nFull compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) means developers get an easy-to-code-in blockchain. There are also benefits for users, especially considering they have the freedom to withdraw funds from layer-2 protocols without delay.\n\nWhile there have long been concerns about the creeping tide of centralization, Metis says its model encourages decentralization, with transactions processed in parallel.\n\nThe team behind Metis shared:\n\n\u201cOne of our goals is to solve the scalability trilemma by combining the transcendent scalability of optimistic rollups with the security and fast finality of zero-knowledge rollups. Thus, we create a developer-friendly layer-2 allowing Ethereum developers to deploy all kinds of decentralized applications. The deeper Web3 dives into DeFi, the deeper builders must go to enable the highest security standards possible \u2014 and zero-knowledge proofs will do precisely that.\u201d\n\nMetis says it\u2019s determined to increase the potential use cases for blockchain technology, and reducing finality times is key. Optimistic rollups derive their name from the fact that it\u2019s assumed that all transactions are valid, with a seven-day window in place to prevent fraud. Meanwhile, zero-knowledge proofs significantly reduce this time and could be the silver bullet for enticing businesses to join the Web3 revolution.\n\nWhy this technology is needed\n\nScalability concerns on the Ethereum network have been long documented and affect gas fees. Vitalik Buterin himself has admitted that costs need to come down for crypto transactions to be economically viable for consumers in emerging economies.\n\nInnovation is key to bridging the gap between scalability and security and delivering long-term growth for this thriving sector. A robust blockchain that can process transactions quickly and cheaply has the potential to transform businesses around the world and\u200c lead to the creation of a new wave of decentralized autonomous companies (DACs), where a corporation can be self-governed and controlled by shareholders through democratic votes.\n\nMetis\u2019 argument is crystal clear: The Ethereum blockchain can be fast, cheap and good, and hybrid rollups \u2014 which are being built right now and open-sourced for the benefit of all crypto users \u2014 are set to make this a reality.\n\nLearn more about Metis"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNotlarvalabs founder and pseudonymous Twitter influencer Pauly has received more than $1 million worth of crypto in exchange for nothing, literally, as meme coin mania takes a new, bizarre turn.\n\nWhat started out as fervor for PepeCoin, the frog-themed meme coin that leapt to dizzying heights at the start of May, eventually gave way to people trading tokens based on common names, such as Ben or Jeff. Now degens are handing over their hard-earned Ethereum to random Twitter users who post their wallets promising exclusive token \"presales\"\u2014and even someone who\u2019s promised them no returns or tokens at all.\n\nIn a Twitter post on Tuesday, Pauly listed a wallet address and said, \u201cSend ETH here.\u201d The statement was accompanied by a gif captioned, \u201cYou Get Nothing.\u201d It was a riff on a fundraising trend that's gripped Crypto Twitter since at least early May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA day later, the wallet registered as yougetnothing.eth via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) received more than 626 Ethereum worth over $1.1 million, according to Etherscan. And amid an avalanche of nothing-related memes, Pauly has reiterated the wallet is not related to the launch of a new token.\n\n\u201cThere is no presale,\u201d Pauly said, responding to a Twitter user who claimed he was playing with people\u2019s emotions for financial speculation. \u201cLiterally nothing is being sold.\u201d\n\nThere is no presale how is this person so delusional? Literally nothing is being sold. \u2014 PAULY (@Pauly0x) May 31, 2023\n\nOn Wednesday, as funds continued to pour into Pauly\u2019s wallet, he hosted a talk on Twitter Spaces, where he, unsurprisingly, said nothing.\n\nThe development comes as Crypto Twitter is deep in the throes of meme coin mania, a wave of speculation sparked by PepeCoin. No matter how nascent or obscure, traders continue to dive headfirst into tokens based on little more than vibes and hopes of lucrative gains. And that\u2019s despite the lack of utility many meme coins offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStop sending your funds to blatant meme coin presale scams like @miladyerc20 The account previously had the usernames @0thecoin @itachycoin before the latest scam. Can not believe they got 63 ETH ($116k) in just 1 hr. pic.twitter.com/XoY19qCR1C \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 10, 2023\n\nMany of these coins are outright scams. On May 10, a Twitter account called \"Milady Coin\" raised $116,000 in ETH by posting a wallet address and offering a token presale for what was later discovered to be a non-existent project, as chronicled by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. Another token called \"JARED\" followed the same playbook. It claimed to be affiliated with famed MEV bot \"jaredfromsubway\"\u2014it wasn't.\n\nPrior, this trend had spawned tokens like BEN and PSYOP, created by a Twitter user named ben.eth. And as recognizable crypto characters like YouTuber Ben \u201cBitboy\u201d Armstrong have drawn close to the coin, the phenomenon has been captured by established digital artists like Beeple.\n\n\u201cI am not in any way affiliated with any of these dumbass coins or the grifters running them,\u201d he said on Tuesday, showcasing some of his recent work.\n\nugh, here's daily reminder i am not in ANY WAY affiliated with any of these dumbass coins or the grifters running them.... if you interpret these artworks as ENDORESMENTS in any way, i dunno what to tell you... #ngmi pic.twitter.com/9GLtA66g2D \u2014 beeple (@beeple) May 30, 2023\n\nThe market capitalization of BEN has grown to $46 million since it launched, yet the token has fallen more than 47% over the past week, according to CoinGecko. Another recent meme coin called JEFF has found popularity, but the token plummeted more than 52% over the past 24 hours on Wednesday, as of this writing.\n\nWhile Pauly\u2019s wallet has turned heads on Twitter for the attention and funds it has received thus far, the influencer described \u201cYou Get Nothing\u201d as akin to performance art.\n\n\u201cIt is almost as if this is some kind of mass psychological experiment,\u201d Pauly said, describing yougetnothing.eth as \u201ca case study\u201d and \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum represents over 98% of the funds sent to yougetnothing.eth, but Pauly\u2019s wallet has received a variety of other tokens, such as $12,500 worth of PepeCoin and nearly $4,000 worth of the stablecoin Tether, according to data from Nansen.\n\nPeople are also sending obscure meme tokens to the address. For example, yougetnothing.eth has received over 203 million BEN tokens worth just over $21, and 333 JEFF tokens worth $0.73, according to Nansen.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pauly recognized that his wallet contained a panoply of \u200b\u200bpeculiar assets, telling his followers that they should ignore its contents.\n\n\u201cPeople are desperately trying to push these shitcoins based on nothing,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe way they do this is by sending tokens out to wallets like mine, to make it look like I have bought the tokens. I have not bought any of this crap.\u201d\n\nThe smattering of tokens that Pauly has received is reminiscent of Budweiser\u2019s embrace of NFTs in 2021. After it announced it had registered beer.eth as an ENS domain, the beer brand\u2019s wallet was hit with a wave of oddball NFTs\u2014like a \u201cMinimalistic Cock\u201d drawing and an NFT from PeePeeBoy."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals are the latest layer-2 solution enabling decentralized storage of digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals will now allow users to migrate their Ethereum ERC-721-based nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to the Bitcoin blockchain with the launch of the BRC-721E standard.\n\nThe BRC-721E standard was jointly launched by the Ordinals market \u2014 an Ordinals-based marketplace \u2014 and the Bitcoin Miladys NFT collection. The new BRC-721E standard enables the conversion of immutable, verifiable ERC-721 NFTs to Ordinals. Initially, metadata is not stored on-chain, but users can store a lower-quality preview image and include a reference to the Ether (ETH) burn in the raw image data.\n\nThe migration process starts by burning the ERC-721 NFT with an ETH call function. The burning of the NFT is an irreversible process and acts as an on-chain inscription method. To claim the ETH burn on Bitcoin, the user must inscribe valid BRC-721E data, after which the bridged NFT will appear on a custom Ordinals market collection page with complete metadata.\n\nThe indexers that check the burned NFT data inscriptions ensure that a token has no more than one valid inscription and that the genesis address matches the burn transaction call data.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals surpass 10M inscriptions as creator Rodarmor steps down\n\nThe Ordinals market claimed the fundamental principles of BRC-721E and the flexibility of the indexers allow for the protocol to evolve over time, despite the fact that metadata is initially not stored on-chain.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals has attracted widespread reaction from the crypto community since its launch in January 2023. The launch of the BRC-20 token standard in March created an experimental fungible token standard designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain. The combination of BRC-20 with Ordinals opened new gates for minting tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, with the crypto community seeing the emergence of many popular BRC-20 tokens, such as Ordinals (ORDI), Vmpx (VMPX) and Pepecoin (PEPE).\n\nThe number of BRC-20 tokens has skyrocketed from a few hundred in its first week to over 25,000 at the time of publication. However, the rise of Ordinals and the new token minting era has not been unanimously well-received, with many Bitcoin (BTC) proponents criticizing the new method as inefficient and wasteful.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "As Bitcoin Ordinals are gaining traction, developers created the BRC-721E standard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT dominance may come into question.\n\nOwners of individual high-profile NFTs already migrated to Bitcoin.\n\nAs Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction, a new development puts Ethereum\u2019s NFT market squarely in its sights. A new protocol allows users to transfer Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin\u2019s Network.\n\nOn Monday, May 29, the Ordinals market and the Bitcoin Miladys NFT project jointly launched the BRC-721E standard. The technology enables the conversion of ERC-721 NFTs to Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nA Potential Shift in NFT Dominance\n\nThe advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and the BRC-721E standard could signal a seismic shift in the NFT landscape. So far, Ethereum has been the go-to platform for NFTs, but if high-profile NFT collections move to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s dominance could be in jeopardy.\n\nFor instance, in February 2023, one Bored Ape (BAYC) owner burned his Ethereum-based Ape to transfer it to Bitcoin\u2019s network. Specifically, the BAYC owner called Bitcoin \u201cthe world\u2019s scarcest and most secure chain\u201d and said it brought true scarcity to NFTs.\n\nThe NFT community is moving to BTC, where Ordinals have brought true scarcity to collectibles.\n\n\n\nI forever inscribed \u201cThe Blonde Don\u201d BAYC #1626 on the world's scarcest and most secure chain burning him off ETH forever using TeleBurn.\n\n\n\nIt's done. Over. Not coming back to ETH. pic.twitter.com/jmKpSSPybm \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 12, 2023\n\nIf more Ethereum NFT owners move to Bitcoin, this will make Bitcoin a more attractive platform for creating new NFTs, threatening Ethereum\u2019s position in the market.\n\nWhat Is BRC-721E?\n\nThe BRC-721E standard is a protocol for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), known as Ordinals, on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol allows users to convert their Ethereum-based ERC-721 NFTs into Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nThe process involves sending ERC-721 NFTs to a burn address, which remains inaccessible. The users must then pay the gas fees to inscribe the NFT onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nInitially, the BRC-721E standard doesn\u2019t store metadata directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, users can store a lower-resolution preview image on-chain and include a reference to the original Ethereum NFT.\n\nThis approach represents a potential game-changer for the NFT space, enabling assets to transition between Ethereum and Bitcoin while maintaining their unique properties and provenance.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile the BRC-721E standard is an exciting development for Bitcoin, it is still in its early stages. The long-term feasibility of extensive NFT operations on Bitcoin remains to be tested.\n\nOrdinals have already led to a major spike in fees on the Bitcoin Network. This fact highlights potentially insurmountable scalability issues for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe BRC-721E standard signifies an exciting development for Bitcoin\u2019s NFT landscape. However, it also raises serious concerns about the scalability of the network.\n\nRead about the BAYC holder moving his Ape to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain:\n\nBored Ape (BAYC) Holder Tries Out Bitcoin NFTs, Burns BAYC 1626 in the Process\n\nRead more about Bitcoin ordinals:\n\nBitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal?"

Though this looked encouraging, investors might have reasons for concern, as a few metrics suggested that TRX\u2019s price pump could soon come to a halt.\n\nWhat caused the rise\n\nA few on-chain metrics revealed the reason behind Tron\u2019s meteoric rise. Notably, as per Artemis\u2019 data, TRX\u2019s daily active addresses spiked and reached 2.3 million earlier in May.\n\nThe network\u2019s daily transactions also surpassed 9.6 million in the same time frame.\n\nInvestors seemed to have been actively trading the token, as its DEX volume also registered an uptick. Additionally, TRONSCAN\u2019s data revealed that TRX\u2019s total addresses crossed 162 million, reflecting increased adoption of the blockchain across the globe.\n\nApart from these, another positive update was related to Tron\u2019s DeFi performance. DeFiLlama\u2019s data revealed that TRX\u2019s TVL had increased by more than 1.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket sentiment was unaffected\n\nThough the aforementioned metrics looked promising, they could not turn market sentiment in TRX\u2019s favor.

At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.07766 with a market capitalization of over $7 billion.\n\nBut the days might get colder, as a few datasets were bearish.

Though the bulls were still ahead, the MACD displayed the possibility of a bearish crossover soon.\n\nTron\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) was also resting right near the overbought zone, which further suggested a price correction. Nonetheless, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon continued to support the bulls."

Late last night it was trading for $27,626.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest digital asset, was also down, trading for $1,868, a 2.3% drop in the past day.\n\nNearly all the top coins and tokens shed value today, with Solana, Polygon, and Dogecoin all experiencing significant sell-offs.\n\nAnd meme coin mania seems to have died down: Pepe, a new token launched at the end of April which experienced astronomical gains, dropped by 9% in 24 hours.\n\nSui, a highly-anticipated layer-1 blockchain which launched last month, has also been hit particularly hard, trading at a 24-hour loss of over 6% for $0.96.\n\nThe sharp drop in prices comes as the U.S. Congress races to carve out a debt-limit deal to avoid a default in the world's biggest economy.

While some used the money for bills and to boost their savings, others chose to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere's a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; December 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021 for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top Stories\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away from the U.S. government.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on December 29, 2020 and $57,996 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Bitcoin would have been able to purchase a total of 0.219 BTC.\n\nBased on a price of $27,719.72 for Bitcoin today, that $3,200 would now be worth $6,070.62.\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here\u2019s how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on December 29, 2020 and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Dogecoin would have been able to purchase 754,996 DOGE. Based on a price of $0.07243 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $56,043.35.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here\u2019s a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on December 29, 2020 and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021. A person who put the $3,200 into Ethereum would have been able to purchase 9.02 ETH. Based on a price of $1,905.18 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $17,184.72 today.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH. The three cryptocurrencies would be worth $25,969.95 today based on equal investments from the three stimulus checks.\n\nRead Next: How To Buy Cryptocurrencies\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons, freepngimg.com."

        "title": "How to Migrate Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin Using BRC-721E - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin is gearing up to catch Ethereum.\n\nDevelopers have published a new token standard that allows users to migrate their Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new token standard is a game-changer for the NFT industry.\n\nEthereum\u2019s undisputed dominance in the NFT industry has remained unchallenged since the inception of the digital asset. Many competitors have emerged over the years, offering exciting solutions, yet none have been able to dethrone Ethereum from its reign. However, with Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence in the NFT sector, Ethereum\u2019s supremacy could be under threat.\n\nBitcoin, the reigning king of cryptocurrencies, has swiftly ascended the ranks, securing the second spot in the market within a few months. Now, the network is set on overthrowing Ethereum\u2019s long-standing supremacy in the NFT industry.\n\nHow is it planning to do so? By enabling the migration of Ethereum NFTs into its network.\n\nA Seismic Shift\n\nOn Friday, May 30, Ordinals Market, the largest Bitcoin NFT market, in collaboration with NFT collection Miladys, jointly published the BRC-721E standard allowing users to migrate ERC-721 NFTs to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new protocol is a game-changer and could signal a seismic shift in the NFT landscape by allowing Bitcoin to reign supreme. However, before Bitcoin can do that, it\u2019s important to note the BRC-712E protocol is still in its early stages.\n\nNevertheless, NFTs on Bitcoin have been spreading like wildfire. According to Dune Analytics, users have inscribed over ten million ordinals on the network and have generated over $44 million in fees \u2013 a 200% increase since the first week of May.\n\nAs more users jump on board the hype train, learning how to migrate an Ethereum NFT to Bitcoin could be helpful.\n\nHow Does BRC-721E Work?\n\nThe BRC-721E token standard allows users to convert their Ethereum-based ERC-721 NFTs into Bitcoin Ordinals by using a bridge between both networks.\n\nThe process involves sending ERC-721 NFTs to a burn address to trigger an on-chain inscription request. The token standard then encodes the metadata directly onto a burn transaction, which nominates a Bitcoin address to receive the inscription.\n\nBy doing so, the BRC-721E protocol doesn\u2019t store metadata directly on the Bitcoin but instead points to the original Ethereum NFT using the burn transaction and an indexer.\n\n\ud83d\udd38How is this different?\ud83d\udd38\n\n\n\nTeleburn requires you to know the inscription ID in advance of burning the ETH NFT.\n\n\n\nBRC-721E allows the burn to take place before inscribing. Meaning the burn TX acts as an on-chain inscription request!\n\n\n\nUsers can also receive airdrops using this. \u2014 kiwidream.eth (@kiwi_dream) May 29, 2023\n\nAdditionally, since inscriptions are limited to 100 bytes, and high-quality images can be 10,000 times the size, this mechanism significantly reduces the costs of inscribing an image. It allows rich, dynamic meta on Bitcoin without taking up block space.\n\nBRC-721E is undoubtedly a significant achievement for the NFT space because it enables assets to transition between Ethereum and Bitcoin while maintaining their unique properties and provenance.\n\nHow to Migrate Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin\n\nBefore you follow this tutorial, it\u2019s important to note that every action is irreversible due to the immutable nature of blockchains, and there\u2019s no way to undo it once it\u2019s set in stone. Therefore, it\u2019s highly advised to be careful and double-check everything before you do anything permanent.\n\nAdditionally, this tutorial requires you to know how to make an ETH call, inscribe Ordinals, and retrieve information like your ETH and Bitcoin address, token ID, and more.\n\nHere are a few tutorials on how to deploy Ethereum smart contracts and how to inscribe Ordinals.\n\nThe first step is to Burn your ERC-721 NFT by using the following ETH call.\n\nBRC-721E ETH Burn call. Source: Ordinals.Market\n\nReplace the ETH address with your address, the Token ID with the NFT\u2019s token ID, and the receiving BTC address with your Bitcoin address.\n\nThis call triggers the on-chain inscription request mentioned earlier.\n\nAfter your ERC-721 NFT has transferred to the burn address, you must inscribe the following BRC-721E JSON code on Bitcoin to claim your ETH burn on Bitcoin.\n\nBRC-721E JSON code inscription. Source: Ordinals.Market\n\nBe sure to replace the token_id and contract parameters with that of your NFT. Once the code is inscribed, your bridged NFT will appear on a custom Ordinal marketplace collection page with its full metadata.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nGoingParabolic, the owner of BAYC 1626, one of the most valuable Bored Ape NFTs, inscribed his BAYC on Bitcoin using TeleBurn, a creator platform for making Bitcoin NFTs using ordinals.\n\n300,000 Transactions still sit in limbo on Bitcoin\u2019s mempool, awaiting confirmation because of the Ordinals craze.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nBRC-721E could be the edge Bitcoin needs to gain ground over Ethereum and end its reign. However, the new standard could hinder the network\u2019s scalability given Bitcoin\u2019s recent struggles with BRC-20 memecoins and Ordinals.\n\nRead more about BRC-721E:\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Threaten Ethereum NFTs With New BRC-721E Standard.\n\nRead why Bitcoin is trading a discount in Australia:\n\nWhy Bitcoin Is Trading at a $5k Discount on Binance Australia"

        "title": "Aave Review 2024: What To Know About The Pros, Cons, Features - Milk Road",
        "content": "What Is Aave?\n\nAave is a decentralized crypto lending platform that supports ERC-20 tokens such as ETH, MATIC, WBTC, and others. Decentralized lenders don\u2019t require identity verification. They also don\u2019t come with consumer protections you\u2019d expect from traditional lenders.\n\nVersion 2 of Aave is still active and supports the Ethereum network as well as Polygon and Avalanche. Aave Version 3 now supports Ethereum but expands the list of Ethereum-compatible networks to include Arbitrum, Optimism, and more. Version 3 is the default and brings enhanced risk management as well as a broader range of networks and tokens.\n\nAave\u2019s platform is non-custodial, meaning you control transactions from your own crypto wallet. However, when supplying on Aave, you deposit your tokens into a smart contract which can liquidate your (collateral) tokens if needed to repay a loan.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t have complete control over your tokens, you can withdraw at any time (if your tokens aren\u2019t used as collateral for a loan).\n\nExpert Review: Aave In Action\n\nI took Aave for a spin, testing its features, pushing and prodding to see what breaks. Nothing broke, although some of Aave\u2019s features (flash loans) may remain out of reach for traders without coding chops.\n\nI found Aave\u2019s basic features, such as lending and borrowing, easy to use. Most questions I had were answered in the vast documentation. Aave\u2019s Discord channel helped as well.\n\nWallet Connection And Supported Networks\n\nAave Version 3 supports Ethereum several Ethereum-compatible networks that also work with MetaMask, a popular decentralized crypto wallet.\n\nAave V3 supported networks:\n\nEthereum\n\nArbitrum\n\nAvalanche\n\nFantom\n\nHarmony\n\nOptimism\n\nPolygon\n\nI connected Aave to MetaMask to explore, choosing the fast and affordable Polygon network to perform transactions.\n\nFunding\n\nAave supports 20 crypto assets for deposit on Polygon, but other networks offer fewer choices. For example, I could only choose from nine types of crypto to deposit on Arbitrum.\n\nIf needed, you can buy tokens through a third party on Aave. I was offered Transak in my region. Transak didn\u2019t support all tokens on Aave, however.\n\nHere are the purchase fees for WETH (wrapped Ethereum):\n\nPurchase Amount Base Fees Card Fees $100 2.75% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay $500 1.5% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay $1000 0.95% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay\n\nTo fund my account, I chose MATIC I bought on Coinbase. A click on the \u201csupply\u201d button let me choose an amount of MATIC to deposit and then whisked me away to an approval page in MetaMask.\n\nDeposit values are shown in token quantities and USD market values. Aave uses an oracle, a link to the outside world, to get up-to-date pricing from exchanges. A fallback in the code sources token prices from Uniswap.\n\nLending\n\nEvery token you can supply on Aave pays a yield (except for the Aave token itself).\n\nMost yields range from under 1% to 2.5%. The MATIC token I initially deposited paid 1.47% APY (annual percentage yield). A sortable list of supported tokens made it easy for me to choose a token with a higher yield.\n\nAave\u2019s protocol sets rates by supply and demand. Supplied tokens go into a pool. As borrowers access a larger percentage of the pool, borrowing APYs increase. This increase in rates benefits suppliers for that token. Only a portion of your supplied tokens will be borrowed, however, so you\u2019ll see a gap between the Borrow APY and the APY yield you earn.\n\nCRV and SUSHI tokens were in high demand at the time, so I swapped MATIC to CRV and SUSHI. CRV was paying over 50% APY.\n\nIn the background, Aave replaces your tokens with an Aave-specific equivalent token, such as aWMATIC (Aave wrapped MATIC) or aCRV (Aave CRV). When swapping, Aave offered to add the new tokens to my MetaMask wallet.\n\nWhen supplying (lending), your token balance increases to reflect your earnings while the per-token price updates in real time.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to find a report to view earnings, however. A visit to the Discord channel suggested that many investors track the starting and ending token quantities on a spreadsheet. Take notes when you start a position.\n\nBorrowing\n\nThe tokens you supply on Aave become collateral for borrowing if you take a loan. Most assets can be used as collateral, but some are restricted, including Tether (USDT).\n\nWhen borrowing, I could choose from stable APY rates (which can still fluctuate) or variable APY rates (which can vary considerably). When a small percentage of the pool is borrowed, variable rates are lower than stable rates. But when the utilization rate exceeds the optimal level, rates can spike, as seen in the example below for CRV.\n\nA low-interest rate might not stay low, and variable borrower rates of up to 100 APY% or more are possible.\n\nCollateral requirements for Aave loans depend on the collateral you supply. For example, when I supply DAI, the DAI position will be liquidated when the debt value equals 80% of the collateral value. However, when I supply SUSHI as collateral, liquidation takes place when the debt value reaches just 45% of the collateral value.\n\nUsing volatile assets as collateral is riskier because your collateral may be liquidated due to changes in market price, which then results in a liquidation penalty of 5% to 10%.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) limits also differ from token to token. The Max LTV for DAI is 75%, whereas the Max LTV is only 20% for SUSHI.\n\nI borrowed DAI, and Aave gave me the option of a stable rate or variable rate. You can change this selection throughout the course of the loan. The new loan appeared at the top of the dashboard, along with an update to my \u201chealth factor.\u201d\n\nAave assigns a health factor to accounts with loan balances based on the LTV and liquidation risk.\n\nMy \u201cnet worth\u201d also decreased by the amount of the loan.\n\nLoan repayments are intuitive, and Aave gave me the option of paying my loan with the borrowed asset or with collateral.\n\nYou can repay in full or in part, or not at all. Interest on the loan accrues according to the utilization rate for the token you borrow. There\u2019s no fixed repayment schedule, but interest will chew away at your LTV until you repay or the collateral is liquidated.\n\nStaking\n\nIf I had to choose my least favorite part of Aave, it\u2019s staking.\n\nBy staking the Aave token, you can earn a variable yield based on how much Aave is staked. But you have to stake on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum blockchain bases fees on the complexity of the transaction. Aave\u2019s staking smart contract is complex, resulting in higher gas fees and making Aave staking a pricey proposition if you aren\u2019t staking large amounts.\n\nStaking in Aave\u2019s \u201cSafety Module\u201d helps cover deficits if the market moves too fast to liquidate collateral for positions. Staked amounts can be slashed by up to 30% if needed to cover shortfall events.\n\nStaking on Aave acts like a type of insurance. The stakers become insurers and make money \u2013 until there\u2019s a loss. Staked amounts can be slashed to cover shortfalls on Aave.\n\nThere\u2019s also a 10-day cooldown period, after which you have 48 hours to unstake before you have to start the process again.\n\nFlash Loans\n\nAave was first to market with flash loans, which are loans in which the borrowing, transactions, and repayment all take place during one block (about 12 seconds on average).In theory, I could borrow millions of dollars if the Ethereum network calculates that I could repay the loan within the same block, including fees. One common use for these loans is for arbitrage on decentralized exchanges. Most flash loans are written in code (Solidity) and executed by calls to Aave within the code.\n\nThere\u2019s no GUI interface on Aave to take a flash loan. However, platforms like Furucombo offer a GUI to build a flash loan. I fiddled with Furucombo\u2019s block-builder app but couldn\u2019t find any arbitrage opportunities to make me rich (and still repay the loan). I guess I still have to work tomorrow.\n\nSwaps\n\nAave\u2019s swaps are powered by ParaSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that finds the best exchange rates from several DEXs. A preview panel for each swap allowed me to adjust the quantity and slippage (price range). The estimated fees for the swap matched the cost in my MetaMask wallet closely.\n\nSwaps are limited to the assets supported by Aave on the blockchain you choose. Expect a narrow selection.\n\nWithdraw\n\nAfter a long day of chasing unsustainable yields, I wanted to withdraw my new-found riches. The process was simple. When withdrawing CRV, Aave automatically converted aCRV to CRV, depositing the CRV tokens into my MetaMask wallet.\n\nBut it may make sense to swap your high-yield tokens for tokens you want to hold before you withdraw, especially if you wandered into the weird-token weeds like I did.\n\nAave Vs. Centralized Lenders\n\nAave is similar to centralized crypto lenders in that you still have to deposit your tokens. Instead of depositing into a custodial wallet like you would with a centralized lender, you put tokens into a smart contract.\n\nBoth approaches bring risks.\n\nCentralized lenders might gamble your money away on risky bets.\n\nmight gamble your money away on risky bets. Decentralized protocols may have bugs, get hacked, or just disappear (rug pull).\n\nBut Aave is easier to use, doesn\u2019t require ID, and brings more transparency. The source code is available for scrutiny; you can peek under the hood to see the mechanics.\n\nBy contrast, centralized lenders require a leap of faith. In 2022, centralized crypto lending titans Celsius and BlockFi both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, locking user deposits indefinitely.\n\nAave Support\n\nIn addition to extensive documentation, Aave offers three ways to get support:\n\nDiscord\n\nChat\n\nEmail\n\nChat and email are both available from Aave.com and aren\u2019t visible when you\u2019re in the Aave app. I reached out by email using the contact link to ask a question about the wide chasm between the supply APY and the borrow APY.\n\nI received a friendly response within two hours, explaining that the large gap in APYs was due to the percentage of the pool that was borrowed (less than 100%) as well as a 10% reserve factor.\n\nThe reserve factor is used to promote Aave\u2019s growth.\n\nAave Notable Features\n\nSupply (lending) When supplying tokens to Aave, your tokens go into a pool that earns interest as others borrow from the pool. Borrowing Taking a loan couldn\u2019t be easier, but Aave uses overcollateralized loans. If the market swoons, your collateral may be liquidated. Flash Loans With flash loans, you can borrow millions, but you\u2019ll have to pay the loan back in the same block. Staking Aave lets you stake the AAVE Token or Aave Balancer Pool Token (ABPT) to earn a yield of up to 14% (ABPT). Swaps Easily swap your tokens if you find a better yield opportunity on Aave.\n\nAave Fees\n\nUnless you\u2019re borrowing, most fees on Aave are network fees. You\u2019ll pay a network fee to supply or to swap tokens, the latter of which may come with swap fees as well (paid to other protocols). On the Polygon network, these fees are low. On the Ethereum network (Aave V2 and staking), gas fees can prevent smaller positions from achieving a profit.\n\nStaking Network fees (smart contract) Supply Tokens Network fees only Borrow Tokens 1% up to 100% or higher plus network fees Swap Tokens DEX fees, typically under 0.3%, plus network fees Buy Tokens Up to 3.99% plus spread Flash Loans 0.09% one-time fee plus network fees\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nAave Version 3 offers a powerful way to lend or borrow, but the protocol\u2019s liquidation process asks that you borrow responsibly. With a liquidation penalty of up to 10%, more than the loan balance is at risk. On the supply side, you\u2019ll find a wide assortment of tokens paying varied yields, with the ability to swap to another token in a few clicks.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Aave CEFI Or DeFi? Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Decisions on the future of the platform are determined by the community. Holders of the AAVE token can participate in governance by voting. Is Aave Open Source? Yes. Aave is open-source. The code is available for review here. What Is The Aave Token? The AAVE token is a governance token that enables token holders to vote on changes to the protocol. Token holders can also stake the AAVE token to earn a yield. Staking acts as a type of insurance for shortfall events. Are There Risks To Using Aave? Yes. Bugs or hacks are risks with any DeFi protocol. There\u2019s also a risk in borrowing. Market price changes for your collateral can lead to unexpected liquidations. On Aave, a liquidation also comes with a penalty of 5% to 10% Does Aave Provide Tax Reports? No. You\u2019ll have to track your gains and losses or use a crypto tax service that can access your wallet activity to calculate your gains and losses.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "content": "Deutsche Telekom is a validator on the Polygon network\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS provides staking services to support Polygon\u2019s Supernets\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS relies on Polygon to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n\u00a9 Deutsche Telekom / Polygon Labs\n\nDeutsche Telekom, one of the world's leading integrated telecommunications companies, is a validator on Polygon, the leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform, expanding its activities in the field of blockchain technology and signaling support for the network\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nFollowing Q, Flow, Celo, Chainlink, and Ethereum, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS, extends its validation nodes to Polygon, providing staking and validation services for the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network and Polygon\u2019s Supernets solutions. Deutsche Telekom MMS is one of only 100 validators on the Polygon (PoS) network.\n\n\u201cThe Polygon ecosystem is very developer-friendly and resource-efficient. It is based on the highest security standards of the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d noted Dirk R\u00f6der, Head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom. \u201cThe collaboration with Polygon is an important step for Deutsche Telekom MMS to fully exploit the potential of blockchain technology and enable applications suitable for mass deployment. Deutsche Telekom MMS also supports Polygon staking, contributing to the security and decentralization of the blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to have Deutsche Telekom, one of the world\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, become a validator on the Polygon network,\u201d said Michael Blank, Chief Operating Officer at Polygon Labs. \u201cThis collaboration will pave the way for more businesses to embrace blockchain technology through Polygon and empower consumers by unlocking the ownership and autonomy that web3 technology offers.\u201d\n\nValidators play key role in operating and securing blockchains\n\nDeveloped by Polygon Labs, Polygon\u2019s development and growth team, the Polygon ecosystem offers a growing suite of protocols for developers to gain easy access to major scaling solutions, including zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains, app-specific chains, and data availability protocols. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom MMS will help secure Polygon's PoS sidechain and Supernets app-chains, contributing to their security, governance, and decentralization by running a full node, producing blocks, validating and participating in consensus, and committing checkpoints on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nToday, Polygon\u2019s PoS chain already hosts tens of thousands of decentralized applications, more than three million daily transactions, and $1.2 billion in Total Value Locked. Polygon Supernets allows builders to create high-performing, customizable app chains with flexible implementation options quickly and seamlessly so that projects can focus on their business model and user strategies. Supernets allow projects to define their own throughput, gas currency, gas limit requirements, and much more.\n\nBoth solutions operate in conjunction with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing them to process transactions quickly, economically, and securely. Changes are then replicated on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Though the correlation between the traditional entity and ETH remained negative, they closed in on each other.\n\nThe altcoin might maintain its recent recovery.\n\nThe correlation between Ethereum [ETH] and the Nasdaq composite index continues to exit the distant position they have had in recent times.\n\nWith a maximum value of 1, the correlation between entities in the crypto sector, and the traditional counterpart is determined by assessing the price movement and performance over a period of time.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTwo on the same path\n\nWhen the correlation coefficient is positive, it means that both assets are moving in a very similar direction. But a close correlation to the negative region indicates that the two assets are moving in opposite directions.\n\nAccording to the IntoTheBlock Capital Markets data, ETH\u2019s 90-day correlation coefficient with Nasdaq was -0.25.\n\nAlthough negative, the data showed that the correlation had improved. Lately, ETH, like Bitcoin [BTC] significantly outperformed the Nasdaq equity index earlier in the year.\n\nWhile the crypto market landscape has changed, the closeness in correspondence could be connected to ETH\u2019s recent performance which has left his 30-day performance in a 0.31% uptick.\n\nBullseye yet?\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has been able to recover from its previous journey into the red zone. At press time, the metric was 4.308%.\n\nThe MVRV ratio serves as a measure of the undervalued or overvalued state of an asset. It also indicates the rate of profits gained by holders.\n\nTherefore, the increase suggested that ETH holders have had some recovery lately, especially with the 3.18% uptick in the last 24 hours.\n\nOn the technical side, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed that the altcoin could soon overthrow the dominance of sellers.\n\nAt the time of writing, the trend-following momentum indicator revealed that the blue dynamic line had risen above the orange line. A situation like this infers that buyers had gained command of the jurisdiction.\n\nSo, there is a chance that ETH maintains the bullish streak for some time. In terms of the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), the daily chart showed that the indicator had increased to 0.16.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe indicator uses a 21-day period to measure the volume-weighted average accumulation and distribution.\n\nSince the CMF was positive and nearing the closing price, it suggested that more accumulation had taken place. Therefore, there could be more strength backing the ETH uptick."

The new standard allows individual ERC-721 NFT holders to inscribe their NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals have become some of the most popular NFTs amid the bear market. Since launching in January 2023, more than 10.2 million NFTs have been inscribed on Ordinals.\n\nSource: @dataalways/Dune Analytics\n\nSubsequently, the fees spent inscribing have risen to about $44.2 million cumulatively, after spiking earlier this month after Binance launched its marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nPreviously, Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden also launched its Ordinals NFT marketplace, expanding its multichain ecosystem to the Bitcoin blockchain, while leading NFT company Yuga Labs jumped on the Bitcoin NFT train with a limited edition TwleveFold NFT collection, which raised $16.5 million from the auction.\n\nNFTs on Ordinals marketplaces use the BRC_20 token standard, which allows token transfers between buyers and sellers within the Ordinals network.\n\nHowever, with the BRC-721E standard individuals will be able to transfer their ERC-721 tokens to Ordinals. The migration process starts by permanently burning ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum, making it irreversible. It concludes with users reclaiming the recreated version of the tokens on Bitcoin as BRC-721E.\n\nBurned NFTs appear on marketplaces automatically and traders can inscribe as few as 100 bytes (JSON) when fees are low.\n\nThe Bitcoin Miladys NFT collection has 91 items listed on Ordinals while the original ETH version on OpenSea indicates it is comprised of 10,000 generative PFP NFTs.\n\n****\n\nStay up to date:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum - Collateral Network Set For Bullish Growth Q2 in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. But which is a better investment? In the last month, both projects have decreased in price following a rally, though given its recent upgrade, Ethereum is looking to become the more popular option. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum compete, Collateral Network (COLT) is offering higher returns and dominating the presale space.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nInvestors Believe Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Could Be Over\n\nBitcoin has been one of the most profitable assets in the world in 2023. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin (BTC) increased in value from $16,500 to over $30,000. However, Bitcoin is now on the decline. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased in price by 12.1%, with one Bitcoin (BTC) selling for $26,364 at the time of writing.\n\nGiven its steady decline in recent weeks, Bitcoin trading volume is also down as investors look to recoup their losses with alternative investments. Furthermore, some investors believe that Bitcoin is only accessible to crypto whales. Given its huge price tag, very few investors can buy an entire Bitcoin. As a result, only investors with large portfolios can truly profit from its growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Trading Activity Rises Despite Price Collapse\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent upgrade has been a huge win for the Ethereum community. Trading volume is up, and more investors staked Ethereum in the final two weeks of April than in the whole of March. During this upgrade, over $30 billion worth of staked everything was unlocked, and any liquidity doubts were put to bed.\n\nHowever, much like Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has decreased in the last month. Ethereum (ETH) is down by 5.71%, with one Ether selling for $1,765.06. Nonetheless, investors believe that Ethereum (ETH) could be the better long-term alternative due to its influence throughout the DeFi market.\n\nDespite being a newer project in the market, Collateral Network is looking to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2023. Collateral Network is a completely unique DeFi project set to revolutionize the lending process by helping borrowers unlock liquidity from real-world assets.\n\nThis is done by minting the physical assets as fractionalized NFTs and selling these fractions to multiple investors. The physical assets, which can be properties, vintage cars, fine wines, jewelry, and watches, act as collateral for liquidity. In the process, borrowers can raise funds in 24 hours without impacting their credit rating. Lenders are rewarded with a weekly interest, which will be paid passively for the duration of the loan.\n\nCollateral Network simplifies the lending process offering greater levels of transparency through the use of AI, more convenience with smart contracts, and outstanding privacy with data being stored on the blockchain.\n\nCollateral Network is powered by COLT tokens. These will be used for governance rights and will reward holders with staking bonuses and exclusive access to auctions for distressed assets. Tokens are selling fast during stage one of the Collateral Network (COLT), with one token available for $0.014.\n\nIn the next six months, COLT is expected to hit $0.35, offering a 3500% return from its original price, a significantly larger gain than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), which has made it one of the most popular assets in the presale market. Furthermore, once the token hits major exchanges, it is expected to surge by 100x. Therefore, the best moment to acquire those tokens is now, when early investors can benefit from a 40% deposit bonus.\n\nFor more information on Collateral Network, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Thinking about buying cryptocurrency?\n\nYour first question may have to do with how to know which cryptocurrency to buy. How to know what crypto to buy starts by understanding what cryptocurrency is and what to look for when buying cryptocurrency. When you finish reading this article, you\u2019ll understand the basics of crypto, how to analyze different cryptocurrencies, which cryptocurrencies are evergreen choices for every investor and how to research and buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Crypto\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that exists as an encrypted set of transactions on a digital ledger known as a blockchain. A bank or government entity issues the currency and maintains a ledger of transactions with standard fiat currencies.\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency, a computer algorithm performs both tasks. This highlights two defining features of cryptocurrency: the concept of blockchain and cryptography.\n\nA blockchain is a digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions. Each transaction represents a \"block\" of data strung together to form a chain that theoretically makes all cryptocurrency transactions available to all owners. The data for every transaction is encrypted using cryptography.\n\nCryptocurrencies share common characteristics, including the following:\n\nDigital form: Cryptocurrency does not have a physical equivalent like coins or paper money. The currency is code that exists inside of computers. Peer-to-peer form: A transaction only goes from one person to another online. There is no intermediary person or institution. Borderless and frictionless: There is no exchange rate for cryptocurrency being traded in the U.S., Germany or Japan. It is a currency like gold and other precious metals that trades freely across countries and borders. Encrypted: Cryptocurrency owners are completely anonymous because each user has a public key (similar to a username) and a private key (like a password). Decentralized: This means there are no banks. An owner\u2019s private key allows them access to their digital wallet, which carries some risk. If the owner loses the private key, no bank can back them up. Operate in a zero-trust environment: This means that all cryptocurrencies are built and verified on a blockchain by computers based on a series of algorithms.\n\nHow to Analyze Crypto to Buy\n\nHow do you know what to look for when buying cryptocurrency? The best new cryptocurrency to buy can seem like a stumbling block for most investors. That\u2019s because cryptocurrency is not a physical currency and cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t companies with revenue and earnings. The rules that investors would use to analyze stocks don\u2019t apply to cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t evaluate cryptocurrency. Take a look at some ways to analyze a cryptocurrency that you may want to buy. First, it\u2019s important to understand the differences between types of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStep 1: Consider tokens vs. altcoins.\n\nCryptocurrencies are categorized as coins (also called alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoins) and tokens. Altcoins are an alternative to Bitcoin. All altcoins have their own independent blockchain. These can be derived from Bitcoin's open-source protocol. They can also create their own blockchain and protocol for their native currency.\n\nTokens operate on top of an existing blockchain and allow the creation of more decentralized applications (called DApps), which is the future of cryptocurrency. Tokens are created using smart contracts, programmable computer codes that are completely self-executing. Tokens can represent any tradable asset. DApps can be thought of as similar to an interface that allows smart contracts to interact with the blockchain. Ethereum is the most popular digital application.\n\nStep 2: Understand the project.\n\nNext, understand the use case (the project) for the DApp:\n\nReview the project\u2019s white paper . Most cryptocurrency projects produce a white paper summarizing the objectives and how the cryptocurrency will help achieve those objectives. The white paper should also spell out the long-term vision as well as the timeline for the project. These white papers can be highly technical in nature as is the cryptocurrency itself. If you don\u2019t understand what the project is trying to accomplish, you may want to find a different cryptocurrency to analyze. Research the development team and project leadership. Some of this information should be readily supplied by the company on its \u201cAbout\u201d page. Prospective investors should be concerned if it\u2019s unclear who the founders or developers are. Research the \u201ccommunity.\u201d Cryptocurrencies can be very fraternal. This means that many altcoins have a passionate group of followers, which is essential for a currency to gain adoption. The value of cryptocurrency depends on the basic rules of supply and demand. A cryptocurrency that nobody wants to buy or trade will be worthless. A coin that is in high demand but with limited supply will be priceless.\n\nStep 3: Analyze market capitalization.\n\nAnalyzing cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t follow the same rules as investors use to analyze a company or its stock so you might wonder how the words \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d or market cap apply to cryptocurrency. Many investors may think that assigning a market cap to cryptocurrency but market capitalization commonly used cryptocurrency metric defined as:\n\n\n\nTotal Circulation Supply x Price\n\nIn other words, a coin with a total circulation of 300,000 coins and a price of one cent would have a market cap of 3,000 (300,000 x 0.01).\n\nBecause of the volatility of cryptocurrency, however, market caps can change suddenly and significantly. In this regard, crypto investors can apply some of the same logic as with stocks. That is, cryptocurrencies with a larger market cap tend to be less volatile than the ones with a smaller market cap.\n\nStep 4: Review the \u201ctokenomics.\u201d\n\nIn addition to knowing the relationship between a cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and its market cap, it\u2019s critical to understand the distribution, circulation and total supply of a cryptocurrency, also called \u201ctokenomics,\u201d which affects the price of cryptocurrency over time.\n\nTokenomics is based on the relationship between a coin\u2019s circulating supply, which is the amount of the coin currently in the market and its total supply, which is the amount of the currency after all the available tokens have been unlocked and distributed. It is also based on the coin\u2019s maximum supply, which is the total amount of the coin there will ever be.\n\nBitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million, which means at some point, there will never be any new Bitcoin mined. This is an indicator that the price of Bitcoin will rise significantly in the future because each individual bitcoin (or fraction of a Bitcoin) will become much more valuable.\n\nStep 5: Look for trusted sources.\n\nMany investors want to do the research for themselves but cryptocurrency can get very technical in nature. You can access many online sources to assist you. For example, MarketBeat provides a cryptocurrency screener in addition to a daily cryptocurrency newsletter. Other reliable sources include Messari, Glassnode and CoinGecko.\n\n5 of the Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now\n\nThe first and most commonly recognized platform is the Bitcoin network. However, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies available. Here is a list of five of the best cryptocurrencies to buy as of this writing.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin remains the largest of the cryptocurrencies. As of October 2022, it has a $350 billion market cap. One of the key arguments for owning bitcoin is the idea of scarcity. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be \u201cmined\u201d and over 19 million are already in circulation.\n\nBitcoin has also become widely accepted as a medium of exchange. Payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard allow Bitcoin to be used in transactions, which creates more institutional interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is also controversial because of its proof-of-work (PoW) validation mechanism. While users appreciate it for its safety and security, it draws the ire of environmental advocates who are concerned about the amount of electricity used in bitcoin mining.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nEthereum is right behind Bitcoin in terms of market cap. Ethereum launched in 2015, about six years after Bitcoin. The coin is used as the payment or \u201cgas\u201d behind the platform, which is known for executing smart contracts. This has made Ethereum one of the go-to coins for developers, particularly those interested in creating nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis popularity has come with a cost. As digital networks go, Ethereum has become kind of slow. But that is likely to change with \u201cthe merge\u201d that happened in September 2022. It transitioned Ethereum from a PoW protocol to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. This makes the network faster and lowers the gas fees for developers. It will make Ethereum a more environmentally friendly token as well.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano is another PoS project. Cardano was the first coin launched with that mechanism in place. Cardano is popular among developers. As of September 2022, 1,000 projects were created on the platform\u2019s blockchain, which gives credence to the idea that it may be a buy-and-hold coin for the long term.\n\nThe founders take a staged, measured approach to rolling out the entire Cardano platform. Each stage has brought new functionality to the platform. Cardano trades with the symbol ADA and recently released its rewards token, ADACash, to much fanfare.\n\n4. Ripple\n\nRipple is a blockchain project used to facilitate fast and inexpensive cross-border transactions. Think about what has to happen to send money to a friend or relative overseas using the current SWIFT system. The funds have to leave your account in dollars and are delivered to the receiving country\u2019s bank, where the funds are subject to exchange rates. It\u2019s a project that\u2019s not timely and inefficient.\n\nThe Ripple token takes the place of the currency. You buy Ripple, send it to the receiving party who receives the funds as Ripple and then convert them into their native currency. All of this happens in seconds or minutes (as opposed to days).\n\nRipple remains engaged in a court case with the SEC. Although Ripple is confident it will win, the outcome is still unclear at the time of this writing. The issue is whether or not Ripple should be treated as a security.\n\nLearn more: What is an SEC filing and how does it relate to market indexes?\n\n5. Polygon\n\nPolygon is an offshoot of the Ethereum blockchain. The platform\u2019s goal is to improve the scalability and infrastructure of Ethereum. It accomplishes this with a \u201clayer two\u201d concept that expands the Ethereum blockchain into multiple chains. This allows faster transaction speeds.\n\nThe platform supports the Tether (USDT) stablecoin and is making investments in carbon neutrality. Meta Platforms and Stripe have adopted Polygon, which will likely help facilitate the coin\u2019s adoption.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some steps to buy cryptocurrency.\n\nStep 1: Determine your future goals.\n\nFiguring out your future goals isn\u2019t as cut-and-dried as it may seem. Cryptocurrency can serve many purposes. Many individuals buy cryptocurrency as an investment that they believe will increase in value over time. The most common way to make money with cryptocurrencies involves using a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nSome investors want to have a supply of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, such as Dogecoin. Dogecoin doesn\u2019t have any particular utility aside from as a medium of exchange. One of the most publicized use cases for Dogecoin was when billionaire and owner of the National Basketball Association\u2019s Dallas Mavericks said Dogecoin would be accepted as payment for some purchases. The same is true of AMC Entertainment, which accepts Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nStill others want to own cryptocurrency as a store of value. Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold and Ethereum as digital silver. As of this writing, there\u2019s no evidence that cryptocurrency is an inflation hedge or a hedge against fiat currency. There are many who believe that will ultimately be the greatest reason to own cryptocurrency.\n\nStep 2: Find an online crypto exchange and open your account.\n\nYou may be surprised to know how many crypto exchanges exist. Some of the more popular exchanges include Coinbase and eToro. A growing number of brokerage houses give their clients the option to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nOnce you find an exchange to trade on, you\u2019re ready to open your account. Because cryptocurrency is decentralized, the only time you need to use fiat currency is to fund your trading account. You\u2019ll need to make sure you have the required tools:\n\nDigital wallet (cryptocurrency wallet): Cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet. The digital wallet is software that makes it possible for the blockchain to recognize the owner.\n\nPublic key: The public key is similar to a username that allows balances to be transferred from one account to another.\n\nPrivate key : The private key is a password that allows the user to confirm the transaction.\n\nStep 3: Practice diversification.\n\nSimilar to investing in stocks, it\u2019s a good idea to carefully divide your cryptocurrency investments among several coins to mitigate risk. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and it\u2019s not surprising to see the price of a coin more 5% to 10% in a single direction in a day. Unlike the stock market, the crypto market never sleeps. Crypto exchanges are open 24/7, 365 days a year. You\u2019ll have to monitor your accounts a bit more frequently than you might check your stocks.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to crypto or have a limited amount of funds available to purchase crypto assets, many analysts say it\u2019s best to stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum as the best crypto to buy now. These two stalwart names will survive whatever shakeup happens as a result of potential regulation. Plus, these are the coins that institutional investors buy."

        "title": "From cricket to crypto: AB de Villiers ventures into Web3 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "AB de Villiers is a household name in the world of cricket, renowned for his swashbuckling batting style and records in the shorter formats of the game. Perhaps less well known is his involvement in the Web3 and cryptocurrency space as he moves on from an illustrious sports career.\n\nThe 39-year-old South African sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Cointelegraph as he shifts his attention to the world of Web3. From his love affair with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to an ambassadorship with a Web3 investment platform, De Villiers has familiarized himself with the ins and outs of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs the South African explained in the first episode of Crypto and Sport, his personal experience navigating the crypto ecosystem has tossed up some testing deliveries to bat away. It has also led him to become an ambassador for a new Ethereum-based Web3 investment platform looking to open up retail investor access to opportunities in promising new start-ups.\n\nHands off my Mutant Ape!\n\nDe Villiers admits that he kept the crypto space at an arms\u2019 length for a number of years despite the best efforts of Web3 savvy friends and family to compel him to explore the industry as early as 2017.\n\nRelated: Planet of the Bored Apes: BAYC\u2019s success morphs into ecosystem\n\nWhile his brothers pressed him to invest in Ripple\u2019s native XRP in those early days, De Villiers remained skeptical of the crypto ecosystem and kept his distance, until he started exploring trading more seriously after downloading Trading View:\n\n\u201cI started to follow some of my favorite stuff. Obviously, the markets as well, gold, commodities, the Nasdaq and S&P 500. I just found a bit of interest, started reading a little bit about the markets around the world and then obviously also crypto, Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP were my first interests.\u201d\n\nA couple of years later, NFTs took off with collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club scoring hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. De Villiers brushed up on the intricacies of the space with the help of a friend working in the industry.\n\nA variety of Mutant Apes listed on NFT marketplace OpenSea. With a current floor price of around 9.5 ETH, each avatar of the 20,000-strong collection is valued at over $18,000.\n\nGetting to grips with MetaMask and its various wallet and network connections, token swaps and blockchain bridges, De Villiers quickly became enamored with collecting NFTs. Describing his experience as being littered with highs and lows, the former Proteas captain was particularly proud of being a Mutant Ape owner, which also happened to be his first NFT trade.\n\n\u201cI think I started off with an amazing bang. I bought an M2 mutant ape. Amazing as a first investment. I went straight for the big one. Obviously, it\u2019s not overboard, but still, an M2 is a biggie.\u201d\n\nHis dose of NFT dabbling went on for some time, with De Villiers estimating that his NFT trophy cabinet held over 300 digital collectibles before an unfortunate incident left him scrambling. Enticed by a malicious NFT masquerading as a new Pudgy Penguin drop, De Villiers inadvertently gave a hacker access to his wallet by signing a malicious contract more than a year ago:\n\n\u201cI tapped on it, it looked very legit. There was a $1 gas fee. The minute I hit that gas fee, it stalled. I hit it about five times, which ultimately meant that I gave this guy access to my whole wallet.\u201d\n\nDe Villiers ended up losing a portion of his collection before sending the remainder of his NFTs to another wallet for safekeeping. He admitted that the experience had made him recognize some of the challenges of navigating Web3 for newcomers:\n\n\u201cI made a couple of mistakes, and it cost me dearly, but that is something I really want to talk about. For anyone who wants to invest in NFTs, blockchain or Web3, it\u2019s all new, and it\u2019s complicated, or it can be unless you simplify it as much as possible.\u201d\n\nLeveling the investment playing field\n\nThe experience also led him to get involved with Common Wealth as an ambassador. The Ethereum-powered Web3 investment platform aims to give retail investors early access to startups that are traditionally stonewalled for conventional venture capital investors. It \u201clevels the playing field\u201d for retail investors to invest in high-potential early-stage Web3 projects, as De Villiers tells Cointelegraph.\n\nReady to level up your investment game? With Common Wealth, you can invest in private VC deals that were once reserved for the few, not the many. Let\u2019s level up the playing field. pic.twitter.com/nJR2G2SC5B \u2014 Common Wealth (@joincommonwlth) May 31, 2023\n\nThe platform allows the average investor access to early stage projects and companies at seed and private sale rounds. Users are able to invest in a variety of funds with crypto to access tokenized shares issued as genesis NFTs .\n\nCommunity investors decide which projects to back through different funds, with voting power proportionate to their investment in a respective fund. Fund NFTs can be sold, traded or fractionalized on the platform or other marketplaces, which affords access to capital that is typically locked up for long time frames in conventional seed investment rounds.\n\nFor De Villiers, giving the everyday investor access to an easy to use platform with a low financial barrier to entry to traditionally exclusive early fundraising rounds resonated with his views on financial inclusivity.\n\nHe draws parallels to the socio economic landscape in South Africa, with its multitude of cultures and a regrettably large disparity of wealth, and the potential for projects like Common Wealth to tackle inequality:\n\n\u201cI love the fact that the common person, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Common Wealth, can get an opportunity alongside the most wealthy person out there, the guy who has been involved with this space for ten years, who knows all the tricks, the ins and outs, this just gives you a level playing field.\u201d\n\nWith some 9.5 million followers on Twitter and more than double that on Instagram, De Villiers added that his alignment with the project was assured by the pedigree of individuals behind Common Wealth. Prominent team members include alumni from Google, Activision Blizzard, Intel, Cardano and Facebook that have built the Ethereum-powered mobile-optimized platform.\n\nDe Villiers continues to adjust to life after an illustrious cricket career that saw him named ICC One Day International player of the year three times. Broadcast work is in the cards for the 39-year-old, while he admits that he\u2019d like to continue exploring the Web3 industry in various capacities, whether it is apportioning investments into Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), NFTs and other promising Web3 projects.\n\nThat comes with the usual caveat of caution when investing in the cryptocurrency space, given a long history of market volatility and other criticisms of the nascent sector.\n\nMagazine: Crypto scoring big with European football"

        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE), Polygon (MATIC), and Sythentix (SNX) are three of the top altcoins to buy right now. All three are predicted to enjoy significant growth while many cryptocurrencies struggle to rebound from the 2022 lows.\n\nInQubeta expected to have phenomenal year\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) solves a problem many potential investors face: not having access to traditional investments due to entry barriers like high minimum deposits many people can\u2019t afford. InQubeta\u2019s platform bypasses these barriers, making it possible for anyone to invest in promising AI startups.\n\nArtificial intelligence has generated lots of buzz in the past decade as it slowly transitions from being an interesting concept to reality. AI software now helps financial institutions to detect fraud, and self-learning assembly line robots are already being used by many companies.\n\nMany technology experts predict AI will be the next big tech revolution, and the increasing investments in the sector are congruent with their analyses, with the total investment in the AI industry jumping from $12.75 billion in 2015 to $93.5 billion in 2021. That number is expected to keep growing as InQubeta\u2019s platform allows more investors to be part of AI\u2019s rise.\n\nStartups can raise capital for their AI projects by minting ERC-20 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the InQubeta blockchain, which is built on Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) platform. Once fractionalized these NFTs represent equity in these companies and other rewards.\n\nEach company\u2019s NFTs are listed on the InQubeta marketplace once approved. There, investors can browse companies and read about their projects before purchasing tokens of companies they find interesting. Investors get to choose and pick which companies they want to bet on.\n\nPurchases are made with the platform\u2019s native currency, $QUBE. The token is deflationary by design, with a 2% tax on marketplace transactions that\u2019s sent to a burn wallet, and a 5% tax used to fund a reward pool for those who stake their $QUBE tokens. These tokens also give them access to participate in the platform\u2019s governance.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) recovering well\n\nPolygon has been one of the few altcoins that have grown steadily since the 2022 crash, with prices rising by over 100% in 2023. Polygon is a cryptocurrency that connects blockchains and improves their scalability. The platform runs on Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) blockchain and provides improved interoperability and flexibility while enjoying the structure of ETH\u2019s network.\n\nMATIC is the platform\u2019s native currency, and it\u2019s an ERC-20 token. It is used for transaction fees, to secure the network, and to give investors access to the platform\u2019s governance.\n\nSynthetix (SNX) poised for growth\n\nSynthetix prices haven\u2019t increased as much as Polygon\u2019s, but some cryptocurrency experts predict it will see significant growth later in the year. Its platform provides a liquidity provisioning protocol that other protocols can tap into.\n\nThe Synthetix platform offers low fees and deep liquidity. The network serves as a backend for many protocols on the Ethereum and Optimism networks. Synthetix\u2019s goal is to widen the cryptocurrency ecosystem by introducing non-blockchain assets.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta, Polygon, and Synthetix are three of the top altcoins to buy as all three are projected to experience significant growth. InQubeta has the most potential out of the trio by bringing investors and artificial intelligence startups together.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Pauly0x earns nearly $1M through unconventional Ethereum transfers - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Crypto influencer Pauly0x has unexpectedly made nearly $1 million by demanding Ethereum transfers to his yougetnothing.eth wallet. With a tweet calling the Bitcoin sector \u201can absolute joke,\u201d this experiment drew much attention and more than $1 million in just seven minutes. The episode demonstrates the crypto sphere\u2019s quirkiness and unpredictability.\n\nPauly0x swoops $1 million in Ethereum transfers\n\nAccording to media reports, a crypto influencer named Pauly0x made close to $1 million after requesting Ethereum transfers from fans to his yougetnothing.eth wallet. In response, the social media influencer called the cryptocurrency industry \u201can absolute joke\u201d on Twitter.\n\nPauly0x made a public Ethereum address available to the public on May 30. A GIF of the \u201cYou Get Nothing!\u201d a scene from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was attached to it.\n\nPeople have sent Pauly0x $437,077 to his wallet\n\n\n\nContext:\n\nPauly is a crypto influencer who posted his wallet, and said you'll get nothing pic.twitter.com/gXlw4iV9WM \u2014 xero \ud83c\udfae (@xerocooleth) May 30, 2023\n\nAfter the first seven minutes, Pauly stated that the account had received about $80 in Ethereum. The tweet received 1.2 million views in a single day, helping the total to surpass $1 million. Etherscan shows more than 579 ETH in the wallet at the time of publication.\n\nOn Twitter, Pauly congratulated those who joined the \u201cmillion dollar club\u201d on May 31, adding that they will \u201cliterally receive nothing.\u201d He stated,\n\nIf there is anything you learn from following this account,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope you should never take any of these literal A**CLOWNS seriously. PaulyOX\n\nUsers of the Pepe community responded to the announcement by using Pepe the Frog, the mascot of the infamous PEPE meme coin, as a pump.\n\nHarrison, an on-chain auditor, discovered that the address received about $600,000 from 3,000 transactions. Even the balance of 43 wallets, greater than 0.5 ETH, was transmitted. It is fascinating that various sums are repeated throughout the transfers, even if these are just hypotheses. Three addresses sent 10 ETH, while the other ten sent between 5 and 7 ETH. 42 addresses sent one ETH, while six addresses sent between three and four.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, one of the addresses that sent 10 ETH was first active on May 22. Oddly, the first transaction to that wallet was 544 ETH from the crypto loan exchange MEXC.\n\nEthereum market faces investor holdings drop\n\nRecent research indicates that the Ethereum market is currently experiencing severe difficulties. Data from the on-chain analytics company Glassnode suggest a significant drop in prominent investors\u2019 holdings.\n\nAccording to data, the whales, or Ethereum addresses with 1,000 or more tokens, have dropped to a 10-month low of 6,268. This low was previously recorded in November 2022, when a total of 6,270 was marginally higher.\n\nNotably, the value of whale holdings is falling, which is usually a bearish sign, implying that institutional investors may be losing faith in the near-term prospects of Ethereum. According to analysts, such a change in the attitudes of large investors frequently has a discernible effect on the market.\n\nThe whales play a vital role since the size of their transactions might affect the price of Ethereum. Ethereum has moved closer to the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) simultaneously.\n\nTechnically speaking, the second-largest cryptocurrency might consolidate at this level. Analysts contend that the declining trade volume may, nonetheless, have an impact on the stability of Ethereum\u2019s price. Numerous causes may have contributed to these changes among whale investors.\n\nDespite a decline in the number of Ethereum whale addresses, holdings have continued to grow quickly. This suggests that even though some investors decide to sell their assets, some are optimistic about the asset. Another factor to consider is that some whales may be reallocating their assets in response to market trends, while others may be collecting profits after Ethereum\u2019s recent surges.\n\nAnalysts speculate that some whales may be reducing their holdings because of worries about the scalability of Ethereum and its high transaction costs. It is crucial to note that Ethereum is about to undergo a significant update to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\nInvestor sentiment may be impacted by this upgrade as the potential risks and advantages of the change become more apparent. Some investors may be concerned by whales\u2019 declining Ethereum holdings since it may be a harbinger of investor dissent or a decline in the market. The ownership of Ethereum is one of many issues to be aware of right now, though."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency space constantly evolves, and Ethereum (ETH) is no exception. With the recent price surge, experts are looking at alternative ways to increase their profits with ETH.\n\nTwo of the most promising projects that have caught the attention of investors are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and HedgeUp (HDUP). Both projects offer an innovative approach to increasing profit potential while providing a secure platform for trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet\u2019s explore why experts are so confident in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and HedgeUp (HDUP) when it comes to predicting Ethereum\u2019s price movements. What are their unique features, how do they work, and what makes them stand out from similar platforms?\n\n>> Buy HedgeUp Now <<\n\nWhy does ETH price matter?\n\nThe price of Ether is essential because it helps to establish the value of Ethereum as a platform and its currency, ETH. If demand for ETH increases, then its value will also increase.\n\nAdditionally, if traders can make more money from trading ETH than they would with other currencies or assets, then more people may be tempted to invest in ETH.\n\nMany other assets follow the price of BTC and ETH. If they both go up, everything else tends to pump. If both drop, other assets will start dumping as people retreat into stables.\n\n>> Buy HedgeUp Now <<\n\nWhy are experts confident in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and HedgeUp (HDUP)?\n\nBoth Shiba Inu and HedgeUp (HDUP) are exciting projects that have caught the attention of crypto experts. They offer an innovative approach to making money. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a major player in the meme token game, while HedgeUp (HDUP) is trying to change the world, starting with its unique NFT marketplace.\n\nMeme coins have no real value or use case. Most of the price action is influenced by social media people trying to ride the rollercoaster long enough to make life-changing money, then use new users as exit liquidity.\n\nThis is the current state of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other assets in this class. However, the community is strong, and many think it can make a comeback and take over as the top token in the meme world.\n\nMeanwhile, HedgeUp\u2019s (HDUP) NFT marketplace is just the beginning of the team\u2019s ambitious roadmap. While buying physical assets with crypto isn\u2019t a new concept, purchasing a different type of asset class altogether with crypto makes the protocol a class all by itself.\n\nPair this idea with incredible DeFi tokenomics and a long-term vision that includes building its own banking system, and the HDUP team is looking to essentially create its own ecosystem.\n\n>> Buy HedgeUp Now <<\n\nWill ETH prices impact HDUP?\n\nETH prices tend to impact most DeFi projects. However, the volatility has not affected the HDUP presale, which is still amassing startup capital. HedgeUp\u2019s price will move with ETH but will correlate with BNB. This is good news, as BNB tends to be less volatile.\n\nEven though experts are confident in their predictions, they always advise traders to only invest what they can afford to lose. Always do your own research and carefully weigh the risks before investing in ETH.\n\nThe future looks bright for Ethereum and HedgeUp (HDUP). If the market turns around, meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) may also still have some time to shine.\n\nClick the links below for more information about HedgeUp (HDUP) presale:"
