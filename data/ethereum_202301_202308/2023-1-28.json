        "title": "Anticipation for Ethereum [ETH] 2.0 rises as metric reaches all-time high - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) total value staked has surpassed 15.9 million.\n\nThe increase in the value of ETH might be a major contributor to the increase in stake inflow.\n\nSince the merge, validators have been able to contribute to network security by staking their Ethereum [ETH]. However, the total amount of ETH that has been staked has increased and now stands at a record high. Is there any reason to expect more stake increases, and what could be driving the current ones?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nTotal value staked hit record-high\n\nThe second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, reached a significant new milestone on 27 January, nearly four months after it transitioned to a proof-of-stake network. According to Crypto Quant, over 15.9 million ETH have been staked on the Ethereum Beacon Chain.\n\nThe total number of ETH staked has reached a new all-time high of 15,9 million \u2022 Accounting for more than 13% of the total ETH supply. 1/6 ?? pic.twitter.com/wesx84E2hK \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 27, 2023\n\nAt press time, the total amount staked is over $25.3 billion, and this also represented over 13% of the total ether supply. This is about two years after the launch of Ethereum\u2019s staking contract in 2020, when the network\u2019s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain was introduced.\n\nETH Staking Inflow and New Depositors see constant activities\n\nAdditional examination of several other charts, such as the Staking Inflow Total chart, revealed some intriguing findings. The documented staking influx increased at the beginning of the week. It reached over 69,000, the most significant level since November 2022.\n\nJanuary has had a higher stake inflow than December of the prior year overall.\n\nEven though there were no spikes, a peek at the New Depositors chart provided further information about Ethereum staking. As of the time of this writing, 46 new depositors were listed for 27 January. Even while this may not be a large amount, the chart demonstrated a steady stream of new depositors. With this in mind, one could wonder why stakes are constantly entering the network.\n\nPossible reasons for an increased stake\n\nEthereum was trading at about $1,590 at the time of this writing. Since the beginning of January, the asset\u2019s worth has increased by 33%, as shown by the current price level. One cause of the rise in staking may be a price surge similar to the one Ethereum recently saw.\n\nThis was paired with the perception that the Shanghai Upgrade, which would allow the withdrawal of staked ETH, is imminent. To provide incentives, staking payouts will rise in response to a significant ETH withdrawal when the withdrawal feature is activated.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nStaking rewards for ETH decrease as more of the cryptocurrency is staked. Until the merge\u2019s completion, Ethereum validators have an APY of roughly 5%. However, APY is highest for individuals running their validator nodes.\n\nStaking ETH through a centralized exchange or a staking pool would likely result in reduced earnings because of the validator fees that will be paid. The only time this is different is when centralized exchanges use promotional strategies to increase their reward APYs above on-chain rates to attract staking market share."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to the blockchain analytics platform Nansen, 55% of Ethereum (ETH) exchange holdings are held on Coinbase and Binance crypto exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a chart provided by the blockchain analytics platform, 35% of Ethereum balances on exchanges are held on Coinbase Exchange, while those held on Binance accounted for 20%. Together, both exchanges account for 55% of the Ethereum balances held on exchanges.\n\nWhere do you keep your $ETH?\n\n\n\n55% of the 24.9M ETH exchange holdings are on Coinbase and Binance\n\n\n\nTop 5 ETH Balances:\n\n\n\nCoinbase: 8.72M\n\nBinance: 4.94M\n\nKraken: 1.97M\n\nBitfinex: 1.82M\n\nOKX: 1.25M pic.twitter.com/r4ORRmpeKG \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) January 29, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum balance on Kraken's crypto exchange accounted for 7.89%, while Bitfinex accounted for 7.31%. That held on the OKX and Gemini exchanges accounts for 5.02% and 4.66% of the total, respectively.\n\nCumulatively, 24.9 million ETH are held on exchanges. This implies that 55% of the total ETH exchange holdings are on Coinbase and Binance.\n\nNansen gives a breakdown of the top five ETH balances: 8.72 million ETH are held on Coinbase; Binance's crypto exchange retains a holding of 4.94 million ETH; Kraken, Bitfinex and OKX account for balances of 1.97 million, 1.82 million and 1.25 million, respectively.\n\nEthereum small addresses increase\n\nFollowing the mid-September Merge update, which transitioned the ETH network from proof of work to proof of stake, the number of small-sized Ethereum holders has increased.\n\nIn Q4, 2022, the number of over-one-ETH addresses climbed from 1.57 million to 1.73 million, an increase of 10.4% QoQ.\n\nThe comparatively greater percentage growth for addresses holding more than one ETH could be attributed to optimism following Ethereum's successful Merge in September and anticipation for its planned Shanghai upgrade.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethereum engineers revealed that they had made significant advancements toward the network's expected Shanghai update, which is scheduled for around March. Stakeholders will be able to withdraw their ETH and accrued rewards after the Shanghai update."

        "content": "An analyst who correctly called this year\u2019s crypto turnaround and bought Bitcoin and Ethereum in November says his bullish stance on the market will change if BTC falls below a key support level.\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 46,800 YouTube subscribers that he while Bitcoin\u2019s rally from 2022\u2019s low is significant, the bull case for the king crypto could be invalidated if the top crypto asset by market cap falls below the $19,000 level.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin is] up 50% since the low [~ $15,500], which is quite significant\u2026 [It is] chilling above areas that it has to be above. And as long as we don\u2019t lose $18,000/$19,000, nothing changes. I\u2019m going to be bullish until we lose $19,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $23,044 at time of writing, a fractional gain during the last 24 hours. According to the trader, Bitcoin could even plunge below its 2022 low of $15,500 if the $19,000 support level crumbles.\n\n\u201cIf you go down to $19,000\u2026 then you\u2019d make new lows.\u201d\n\nDonAlt says he\u2019s holding onto his positions and believes the current crypto rally is not over yet.\n\nHowever, If Bitcoin continues an upward trend, DonAlt says his preferred level to take profits is around the $32,000 price tag.\n\n\u201cJust makes sense to be bullish. But I don\u2019t know where to buy pullbacks and I don\u2019t know where to take profits other than $32,000, just based on the fact that I wouldn\u2019t want to sell into [the] $24,000 level. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like any monthly level either unless it\u2019s like $35,000, which is roughly in the area of $32,000 as well.\u201d\n\nAs for Ethereum, the trader says he remains bullish although ETH has under-performed compared to Bitcoin in recent days.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see much resistance until the second-largest crypto asset reaches the $2,200 area.\n\n\u201cMy thesis is basically we retested the monthly support at $1,100 and there\u2019s no real level that I like between $1,100 and $2,2200 \u2013 so let\u2019s go to $2,200.\u201d\n\nOverall, DonAlt says he\u2019s mainly watching Bitcoin to ensure it holds its key support level, and he will make decisions on altocins based on how it performs.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While the price of Ethereum declined for the majority of the previous year, one statistic was increasing and just reached an all-time high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nPositive addresses surge in number\n\nThroughout the years, the number of Ethereum addresses has grown dramatically. Glassnode reports that the current number of addresses exceeds 92 million, a new record. More significantly, though, is the rising trend in the total number of addresses where the balance is anything other than zero.\n\nThe \u201cnumber of addresses with a Non-Zero balance\u201d measures the proportion of all addresses on the blockchain with a positive value, indicating that they have at least some Ether (ETH).\n\nInvestors are beginning to liquidate their holdings and exit the market when this statistic drops in value. Following a steep decline in cryptocurrency prices, this pattern may become apparent.\n\nAs the indicator rises, however, it suggests that new investors are filling their wallets. The move might be signaling the beginning of a bull market.\n\nSeveral variables may be responsible for the recent surge in address activity, but two stand out as particularly plausible explanations. For the greater part of the past year, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been declining.\n\nNew and seasoned investors could increase their holdings or enter the market. In addition, ETH now had a new utility thanks to the Ethereum merge last year. Following the merge, a new type of investor was created, thanks to the staking feature.\n\nPercent supply in profit increases\n\nLooking at another important indicator could provide further information about the state of Ethereum (ETH), given the metric\u2019s accumulation trend.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the circulating supply of Ethereum was over 122 million. More than 50% of the supply, as measured by the percent supply in profit, was profitable. The percent supply in profit was just over 68% as of the time of writing.\n\nETH price is in decline, but\u2026\n\nAs of this writing, the daily trading price of Ethereum was around $1567. A decline in value was also seen within the time frame that was analyzed. Its value had dropped by almost 2%, bringing the total drop in the previous 48 hours to roughly 3%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe same-period analysis of the Relative Strength Index revealed that the market was now in a downturn. With a further price decline, the RSI, which was at 60, might decline further. But according to the RSI line, it was still in a bull trend despite the decline."

        "content": "The functionality of a cryptocurrency is important to help it stand out in a packed industry sector. By having numerous enticing features, cryptocurrencies can appeal to and attract a large number of investors. Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin and Ethereum are three cryptocurrencies currently appealing to investors with a myriad of exciting and distinctive features.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 New ROI Calculator Feature Impresses Investors\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is the new meme coin, making a big impact in the fast-paced crypto world. The coin has a number of notable features, including its charity wallet, NFT space and its newest ROI calculator feature, which is attracting investors by the score.\n\nThis calculator allows users to visualise what returns they could make on their investments. For instance, users can see how much they would make if Big Eyes Coin hits $1. If someone purchased $385 worth, then that could be worth a huge $1 million if the coin reached a price of $1.\n\nFrom donating to a number of important charities to holding a charity wallet containing 5% of tokens, one thing is for sure; Big Eyes Coin is a cryptocurrency with morals.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 And The Rest Was History\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralised digital currency, ranking as the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalisation, name recognition and often desirability for new investors. The coin launched in 2009 and has left its mark on the finance industry, starting a new beginning in the digital world.\n\nBitcoin operates with no central control, banks or governments. Each transaction is noted by a public ledger, meaning copies can be held on servers all over.\n\nEvery transaction is shared between nodes after being publicly broadcast to the network. After mere minutes transactions are collected by miners into a block and added to the blockchain for eternity. This is known as Bitcoin\u2019s account book.\n\nBitcoins\u2019 success is impressive and enduring, and the crypto giant helped pave the way for a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Decentralised Crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) is largely considered to be the second most popular cryptocurrency. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has some well-known founding members, including industry giants Microsoft, Intel and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nEthereum encompasses many features and applications, helping to differentiate it from its biggest rival Bitcoin. The Ethereum platform enables the creation of decentralised applications and is not run by any centralised authority.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, having excellent functionality is an important part of standing out from the crowd and attracting investors. Big Eyes Coin has created a platform where you can visualise predicted gains, helping new investors gain a better understanding of profitability and potential return on investment.\n\nHaving already raised $18 million in its presale, Big Eyes Coin is set for big things. Early investors can take advantage of its attractive 200% launch bonus offer using the code LAUNCHBIGEYES200. Every token purchased will receive a bonus of 2 extra tokens at no extra cost, effectively trebling an initial stake.\n\nFor More On Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
