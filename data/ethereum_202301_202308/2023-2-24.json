        "title": "The Rise of DeFi: How Ethereum Is Leading the Way - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a rapidly expanding sector of the blockchain industry with the potential to transform traditional financial systems. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is leading this charge. In this article, we'll look at what DeFi is, why it matters, and how Ethereum is leading the charge.\n\nWhat Is DeFi?\n\nDeFi refers to a set of financial applications built on blockchain technology that are decentralized, open, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nThese applications seek to provide financial services and products without the involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as banks or other financial institutions.\n\nDeFi protocols are built on blockchain networks like Ethereum and employ smart contracts to execute transactions and automate financial processes.\n\nKeep Reading Social Media Reward Coins: A Catalyst for Widespread Crypto Adoption\n\nThese protocols offer a variety of financial services, such as lending and borrowing, trading, asset management, and insurance.\n\nWhat Is the Significance of DeFi?\n\nDeFi has the potential to transform traditional financial systems by making financial services more accessible, efficient, and transparent. DeFi can reduce transaction fees, increase speed and security, and provide greater access to financial services for underserved populations by eliminating intermediaries and utilizing blockchain technology.\n\nBecause anyone can create and launch a new DeFi protocol, DeFi has the potential to enable new forms of financial innovation and experimentation. This has resulted in a proliferation of DeFi projects, with new protocols and applications being released on a nearly daily basis.\n\nHow Is Ethereum Setting the Standard?\n\nThe majority of DeFi protocols and applications are built on Ethereum, the leading blockchain network for DeFi. Developers can use Ethereum's smart contract functionality to create complex financial protocols that can be executed automatically and without the use of intermediaries.\n\nThe use of decentralized exchanges is a key feature of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem (DEXs). DEXs enable users to trade cryptocurrencies without requiring a centralized exchange or intermediary. This reduces fees while giving users more control and transparency.\n\nUniswap is a popular Ethereum DEX that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for an order book or centralized exchange.\n\nTo determine prices, Uniswap employs an automated market maker (AMM) system, which is based on a mathematical formula rather than supply and demand.\n\nCompound is another popular DeFi protocol on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without the use of intermediaries.\n\nTo provide users with the best possible returns, Compound employs an algorithmic interest rate system that adjusts based on supply and demand.\n\nStablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of a fiat currency such as the US dollar, are also part of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoins allow users to protect themselves against cryptocurrency volatility and provide a more stable medium of exchange. Tether (USDT), the most popular stablecoin on Ethereum, has a market capitalization of more than $60 billion.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of the Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem?\n\nUsers benefit from Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem in a variety of ways, including:\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum DeFi protocols are decentralized, which means they are not controlled by a central authority. This increases transparency and reduces the possibility of fraud or manipulation.\n\nAccessibility: Anyone with an internet connection, regardless of location or financial status, can use Ethereum's DeFi protocols. This increases the financial inclusion of underserved populations.\n\nEfficiency: On Ethereum, DeFi protocols are automated and executed via smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency.\n\nBecause anyone can create and launch a new DeFi protocol, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem enables new forms of financial innovation and experimentation.\n\nWhat Are the Challenges That Ethereum\u2019s DeFi Ecosystem Is Facing?\n\nWhile Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem has many advantages, it also has some drawbacks. Scalability is one of the most difficult challenges, as Ethereum's current infrastructure can only handle a limited number of transactions per second.\n\nThis has resulted in network congestion and high transaction fees during periods of high demand.\n\nSecurity is another issue confronting Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, as smart contracts can be vulnerable to hacks and exploits.\n\nThis has resulted in a number of high-profile incidents, including the 2016 hack of the DAO, which resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.\n\nFinally, because DeFi protocols and applications are largely unregulated, the regulatory environment surrounding DeFi remains unclear. This has raised concerns about investor protection and future regulatory crackdowns.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi Ecosystem?\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is growing and evolving. The launch of Ethereum 2.0, which will introduce several upgrades to the Ethereum network, including a shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus and increased scalability, is one of the key developments on the horizon.\n\nOther upcoming developments include the release of layer 2 scaling solutions, which will allow for more transactions to be processed on the Ethereum network, as well as the continued growth and evolution of DeFi protocols and applications.\n\nCan Ethereum 2.0 Topple Bitcoin?\n\nThere is a lot of hype around ETH 2.0, but can it topple BTC and become the number 1 cryptocurrency?\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of its features and find out.\n\nThe Beacon Chain\n\nThe beacon chain is a proof of stake mega blockchain which while not being able to handle transactions or smart contracts will be the heart of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIt runs side by side with the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that it exists separately until the change is made to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe beacon chain takes responsibility for coordinating the entire Ethereum network.\n\nSharding\n\nThe main idea behind sharding is to create more ways (64) in which information can travel within the blockchain.\n\nBy creating shards, the infrastructure of the blockchain can effectively be split into smaller pieces and, in the process, the shares will allow an easier way of storing and accessing data, meaning that each one of them will be able to operate independently of one another and, consequently, achieve the underlying goal of network scalability.\n\nThinking long term, what will eventually happen is something called docking, a process in which the current Ethereum blockchain will simply become one of the 64 shards, meaning that we will have 63 other blockchains to use.\n\nScalability\n\nEthereum can only handle around 15 transactions a second and, whenever the network gets very busy, that means that the cost of each transaction is bound to get higher and higher as they are all competing against one another.\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0, capabilities for achieving at least 100.000 transactions per second are to be expected, and, in turn, making them cheaper.\n\nAdded Security\n\nWith added security, it will be much harder to attack the network or attempt to harm it in any way.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is at the forefront of a rapidly growing sector of the blockchain industry: decentralized finance. Users benefit from Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem in a variety of ways, including decentralization, accessibility, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nHowever, it does face a number of challenges, including scalability, security, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite these obstacles, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years."

        "title": "Along came Polygon: The blockchain doing serious business with big names including Starbucks and Mastercard - Fortune",
        "content": "It\u2019s been a brutal 12 months for crypto, with prices plummeting, companies collapsing, and one-time industry leaders heading to prison. But amid the negative noise, blockchain firm Polygon has quietly thrived and persuaded some of the biggest names in business to take up its technology.\n\nThose include Mastercard, which is using Polygon to help fledgling music artists mint their own NFTs, and Starbucks, which is running a rewards program on the platform. The company also cut partnership deals with Meta, Disney, and the NFL. Meanwhile over 6 million Redditors have used Polygon to create custom blockchain avatars.\n\nOne of several blockchains built to complement Ethereum by bringing it to scale, Polygon is a success story as it bucks the brutal forces of Crypto Winter. Yet even with millions in the bank and a major upgrade set for March, it must overcome doubts about its security and break free from a well-funded pack of competitors.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nThe first thing to understand about Polygon is that it doesn\u2019t work on its own\u2014it needs Ethereum.\n\nThat\u2019s fine, because Ethereum doesn\u2019t really work on its own either, at least not when demand is high. The Ethereum blockchain, built to be a decentralized global computer quickly, can get bogged down at times of high demand. It slows to a crawl and so-called gas fees soar if the network is flooded by transactions from NFT owners, gamers, DeFi traders, and others.\n\nHence the need for services like Polygon, which acts as a sidechain that relieves congestion by connecting to Ethereum and letting users process transactions on it. Just as subways and buses increase the number of people who can travel through a city at once, scaling solutions such as Polygon allow more transactions on Ethereum\u2014and they\u2019re faster and cheaper.\n\nScaling Ethereum has become its own industry. Polygon alone raked in a staggering $450 million in funding in February 2022 at a valuation of $20 billion. Meanwhile, competitors Optimism and Matter Labs (makers of zkSync), both of which count Andreessen Horowitz as a lead investor, last year raised $150 million and $200 million, respectively.\n\nPolygon competes with so-called layer-2 blockchains that sit atop Ethereum. These layer-2s use different rollup approaches to scaling\u2014putting transactions in batches and then processing them on their own chain before stamping a summary of those transactions on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOne such approach, known as zero-knowledge or zk-rollups, is employed by the likes of Starknet and zkSync. This approach relies on a cryptographic proof that is super lightweight in data terms but not especially fast.\n\nThe other main approach is known as Optimistic rollups. Used by outfits like Optimism and Arbitrum, this approach is cheap and speedy because it assumes transactions are valid unless proven otherwise.\n\nDespite their differences, these layer-2s all inherit the stringent security standards of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s sidechain doesn\u2019t; it has prioritized onboarding users while maintaining its own, lower security standards\u2014though that\u2019s set to change.\n\nAll the deals\n\nOut of all the scaling solutions on the market, Polygon, founded in 2017, is the one consistently attracting big-name partners with in-built customer bases. The first reason for that is being among the first to the game.\n\n\u201cWe have been in Ethereum scaling research since, I would say, day one,\u201d says Polygon cofounder Mihailo Bjelic. Polygon\u2019s first-mover status and early decision to create its own token gave the project momentum. As of publication, the market cap of its MATIC token is $11.2 billion, the eighth-highest of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPolygon is also stimulating demand for decentralized computing by building on its own network projects in gaming, NFTs, and the metaverse. That creates a natural landing space for Web2 businesses looking to move into Web3. That effort is helmed by Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt, who last year was poached from his role as YouTube gaming head.\n\nWyatt credits a hiring strategy that has targeted traditional tech veterans like himself to round out Polygon\u2019s team of Web3 natives and speak directly to Fortune 500 execs.\n\n\u201cWe knew from the Big Tech side what these companies like a Starbucks or Nike or Meta are looking for, from the point of first outreach and conversation all the way through the tech integration, authentically landing it in the space, implementation, [and] go-to-market.\u201d\n\nSome companies, he says, have a \u201ccrystal clear vision\u201d of how they want to use Web3, pointing to Starbucks\u2019s NFT-based membership rewards program. Polygon Labs works with other companies to flesh out ideas and push them beyond simple use cases, such as the NFT profile pictures that spread like a virus across social media during the pandemic.\n\nStill other companies have started using the chain without any involvement from Polygon Labs. \u201cI think last week I saw Doritos launched on Polygon doing something,\u201d says Wyatt. (It was a giveaway for digital wearables in the Decentraland metaverse.) \u201cWe never even worked with them. They come right in, they know how to use the protocol, they know how to deploy [and] build off of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still early\n\nThe business partnerships double as marketing and onboarding campaigns. While they cost Polygon nothing in dollar terms, they nonetheless represent a massive investment in building up the ecosystem\u2014though one that has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAccording to data from Messari, the company brought in $4.2 million in revenue in Q3, its lowest total since Q3 2021. Messari told Fortune that figure in Q4 slipped below $4 million. Nick Garcia, a Messari research analyst, said that fr Polygon to take the next step, \u201cThey\u2019ve got to see some adoption. That\u2019s kind of the crux of it.\u201d\n\nDespite the users onboarded via Reddit and other partnerships, Polygon remains in a battle with other scaling platforms. According to analytics site DeFi Llama, there\u2019s more value (in dollar terms) floating around on the Arbitrum network than on Polygon, and Optimism is nipping at its heels.\n\nThis lack of a profitable business strategy has also led Polygon to join other big crypto names in tightening its belt. It announced this week it was laying off 100 employees, about 20% of its workforce, as part of a plan to consolidate business units.\n\nBut Polygon has the funding and temperament to win the war, with a company representative telling Fortune that it has \u201chundreds of millions of dollars on hand after last year\u2019s fundraise and over $1 billion in treasury.\u201d The latter figure is in MATIC tokens but Bjelic says that even if the token went to near $0\u2014implausible but not outside the realm of possibility in crypto\u2014its dollar holdings would be enough to handle company operations \u201cfor several years.\u201d Polygon declined to provide specifics about its burn rate or operational budget.\n\nSecurity and centralization\n\nPolygon\u2019s ample fundraising rounds from venture capital will help it ride out the current crypto winter. But that funding, along with the company\u2019s operational structure, have fueled a long-running critique of the network: that it\u2019s overly centralized.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin stated in 2021 that, as part of the tradeoff for faster, cheaper transactions, Polygon remains centralized compared to Ethereum. Messari\u2019s Garcia, though he\u2019s very bullish on Polygon, admits its sidechain is \u201cvery centralized.\u201d According to him, you\u2019d only need to take over four validators\u2014the computers that run the blockchain and process transactions\u2014to take over the entire network, at which point you could theoretically drain it of value. Such concerns were heightened this week after hiccups with some of Polygon\u2019s validators led to unfounded reports on Twitter that the network had collapsed or vanished.\n\nBjelic downplays those concerns, noting that the economics render it impractical. \u201cIt only makes sense if you can do some huge exploit,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think, as we know, nowadays it\u2019s practically impossible to cash out that amount of stolen tokens.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Polygon is taking security threats seriously. During the pandemic, it dipped into its massive treasury to buy a rollup project and fund efforts that would make Polygon more secure.\n\nThe result is the Polygon zkEVM, which it recently announced will be released in beta in March. This \u201czero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine\u201d replicates much of Ethereum\u2019s current setup for executing transactions but makes it even more hospitable for zk-rollups. Bjelic even suggests that it could be integrated directly with the Polygon sidechain, providing instant gains to security without much friction for users.\n\nEven with zkEVM on the horizon, it won\u2019t be easy to hold a lead on the technology side given how competitive the rollup space is. \u201cThe zkEVM is going to be behind the eight ball,\u201d says Garcia.\n\nNonetheless, Bjelic believes there\u2019s plenty of room for everyone. \u201cThe cake is so big, and what we are aiming to disrupt is so big, that just fighting over the current cake doesn\u2019t really make too much sense. We have this grand vision and we\u2019re working toward it.\u201d"

        "content": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian was tipped off to the impending launch of Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether, in a meeting with crypto exchange Coinbase back in 2014.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ohanian said he spent $15,000 to buy 50,000 ETH (average price: $3.33) in 2014, which is now worth $82.4 million.\n\nEther was purchasable for bitcoin in 2014 during the project\u2019s presale, but the Ethereum blockchain only went live on July 30, 2015. This meant the first ether holders had to wait until the blockchain\u2019s launch to move or utilize their tokens.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have,\u201d Ohanian told Forbes. Ether was last trading around $1,650, and is up 38% in the year-to-date period, according to Blockworks Research, and 49,500% above Ohanian\u2019s initial purchase price.\n\nOhanian\u2019s openness to decentralized and uncensorable currency comes from knowledge about his family\u2019s traumatic history, where some of his relatives were killed during the Armenian genocide of 1915. Their inherited heirloom rugs were seized by Turkish soldiers.\n\nThe idea of persecution, especially by a state, \u201cmakes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive,\u201d he said.\n\nThat observation makes up one of Ohanian\u2019s core investment strategies. The tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist has made a total of 164 investments, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nAmong those, 29 are blockchain-related. And In February last year, his VC firm Seven Seven Six raised $500 million to focus on more such startups.\n\nOhanian also made an early investment in Coinbase, from which he reportedly gained $50 million. Part of those proceeds went into buying a 17-carat diamond engagement ring for his tennis superstar wife Serena Williams.\n\nBitcoin led Reddit co-founder to ether\n\nOhanian was already taken by bitcoin\u2019s complexity as a technically unseizable financial instrument.\n\nSo, Ethereum was considered an equally good investment opportunity. He recognized the underlying blockchain\u2019s potential for developing additional unseizable assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that now have far-reaching use cases in several different industries.\n\nOhanian reportedly personally owns about 700 NFTs stored on a marketplace, some of which give him early access to one of his VC investments, Islands.\n\nAdditionally, he holds NFTs giving him ownership rights to real estate property in Georgia and to the Ethereum Naming Service.\n\nIn August 2021, about a year after stepping down from the Reddit board, Ohanian spent ether which would be worth $550,000 today on seven NFTs that he believed resembled his wife, including CryptoPunks.\n\nUpdated Feb. 24, 2022 at 9:53 am ET: Corrected reference to Ohanian\u2019s family history.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 Staking on Exchange vs. Creating Your Node: What You Need to Know - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The Ethereum Network recently saw the official launch of the Beacon Chain, which is a stepping stone to the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, aiming to improve network speed, efficiency, and scalability. It\u2019s a move by the Ethereum foundation to abandon the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm for the energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. On top of that, we have to change terminology from having miners to having validators.\n\nEthereum 2.0 hopes to improve transaction processing speed to new heights, satisfying the demand of DeFi users.\n\nThe most significant change to facilitate improved transaction handling is the use of sharding technology. The term sharding comes from database terminology where we break up a single database into smaller parts that can be processed more quickly. In other words, not every node has to be a supercomputer capable of storing and searching terabytes of data. Even a small node can participate in the network and store a particular shard.\n\nOf course, every shard is stored on multiple nodes to guarantee redundancy in case many nodes crash. We don\u2019t want to lose a valuable piece of blockchain data because it happens that all nodes containing a particular piece of data fail.\n\nNow, enough about ETH2.0 improvements. This upgrade gives crypto enthusiasts and investors a new opportunity to become part of the Ethereum Network through staking while earning ETH passively.\n\nBut what are your options? First of all, how does Ethereum 2.0 staking work?\n\nEthereum 2.0 Staking: Do You Have 32 ETH?\n\nStaking is mandatory to secure a PoS-based blockchain. Ethereum requires every validator to stake a minimum of 32 ETH or more to run a validator node.\n\nValidators who have staked 32 ETH or more with the Ethereum Network can validate transactions. For doing so, they will receive rewards that come from gas fees. At this point, it\u2019s not clear yet what the expected APR will be for Ethereum staking. They added a rough estimate for the first year of Ethereum staking.\n\nAt this time, the exact size of an annual reward for Ethereum stakers is still unknown. However, according to the project roadmap, this value will vary between 1.56% and 18.1% and will be inversely proportional to the total number of validators: When the network increases, the rewards will contract.\n\nEven though Ethereum promises an attractive reward ratio, there are obvious risks attached. The Ethereum 2.0 staking page puts an important disclaimer.\n\nAlthough you can earn rewards for doing work that benefits the network, you can lose ETH for malicious actions, going offline, and failing to validate.\n\nHowever, you can pool your resources by joining a staking pool. In this case, there\u2019s no need to own the full amount of 32 Ether. If you only have one or two Ether, you can still join a staking pool.\n\nThe following section will give you a detailed breakdown of the pros and cons of using an exchange-based staking pool over running your validator node, staking 32 Ether.\n\nExchange-Based Staking: The Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nHands-Off Approach\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take care of the commitment of running and maintaining an Ethereum 2.0 node for years. Many things can happen in three years.\n\nSome exchanges might allow you to withdraw your stake after a fixed period or even allow flexible staking. This functionality depends on the popularity of the feature.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Need 32 ETH\n\nAn obvious benefit is that you can participate in the process without committing the entire 32 ETH required to become a validator. This allows users with smaller investments to earn passively on their ETH without any further commitments.\n\nYou\u2019re also not going to be concerned with any technicalities because everything you would need to do on most exchanges is stake your ETH without any further actions.\n\nCons\n\nLimited Control\n\nYou don\u2019t have any control over how the exchange maintains the validator node(s). Anyone can make mistakes, even an exchange. It\u2019s impossible to revert a slashing event. So, when an exchange-based node gets slashed, all exchange-based stakers are hurt.\n\nHowever, the slashing event will likely be less harsh as the exchange can spread the slash over all of its pooled stakers. Perhaps, they can tap into a reserve pool to cover the loss.\n\nThe Risk of a Halt\n\nAdditionally, an inherent risk of keeping your funds locked in an exchange is that of a potential hack or an attack by regulators, for example. If something happens to that exchange, your funds are also at risk.\n\nPotential Fees\n\nSome exchanges charge fees to maintain a validator node. You may wonder why? Exchanges charge fees to cover their costs to maintain nodes. This added cost can remove some of your earnings from staking. Always check the details when picking an exchange.\n\nYet, most exchanges choose to distribute the full earnings to their users. Binance distributes 100% of on-chain staking income among its users. Kraken Eth2.0 staking, however, doesn\u2019t mention any costs.\n\nYou can take a look at some of the most popular exchanges that support Ethereum 2.0 in our list here. Now, let\u2019s have a look at the pros and cons of running a validator node on your own.\n\nRunning a Validator Node: Pros and Cons\n\nWhile it might be more interesting to run your validator node to collect passive income from validating transactions, the risks are measurably higher.\n\nPros\n\nLet\u2019s also take a look at the pros.\n\nMore control over your funds\n\nYou use your Ethereum wallet to stake the 32 ETH. In other words, the common phrase \u201cYour wallet, your keys\u201d applies here. When using an exchange-based staking pool, the exchange will still send your ETH to the Depositor contract that handles staking. It means that the exchange doesn\u2019t hold the ETH in their wallets, as explained above.\n\nEarning full rewards\n\nYou earn the full rewards for your stake while running a validator node. Remember that you\u2019ll have to spend some of your funds on maintenance, such as covering cloud costs when running a node with a cloud provider.\n\nCons\n\nHere are the disadvantages of running your validator node.\n\nNot everyone has the required capital of 32 ETH.\n\nTechnical Understanding is Necessary\n\nSome technical know-how is required to run but also maintain a validator node. If done incorrectly, such as failing to validate transactions or going offline, you can lose part of your stake. This event is called slashing, a well-known concept among the Cosmos and Polkadot community. This mechanism incentivizes validators to act honestly and maintain their nodes correctly.\n\nIndefinite Lockup Period\n\nYour staked Ether will be locked up for an indefinite period. It\u2019s not possible to use this locked ETH in any of the existing DeFi protocols. The sole purpose of your stake is to secure the Ethereum Network.\n\nHere, it\u2019s important to note that your ETH will also be locked indefinitely if you choose to use an exchange to stake. However, most exchanges mint a synthetic token in a 1:1 peg with the ETH you stake. This token is then listed for trading. You will be receiving your rewards based on the number of synthetic tokens you own, but if you decide that you don\u2019t want to go on with staking, you can sell it and use the capital for something else.\n\nConclusion: Which Option is Best?\n\nAs with many areas of cryptocurrency, a core decision is whether to give up your control over assets. In the end, exchange-based staking still sends your funds to the Depositor contract. However, you put your trust with an exchange to maintain a validator node correctly.\n\nRemember that both staking options are subject to Ethereum\u2019s volatility. It\u2019s impossible to withdraw funds if Ethereum\u2019s price experiences extreme volatility. Therefore, it\u2019s a big commitment to stake with the Ethereum Network.\n\nHowever, the underlying goal is fascinating. With the right amount of stakers, Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to reach 100,000 transactions per second. And you can become part of the network to realize this ambitious goal of becoming a \u201cworld computer.\u201d\n\nYet, Ethereum 2.0 staking offers better rates than centralized finance. On top of that, if you choose the exchange-based staking option, you will also get a synthetic asset. This opens up new ways to experiment with DeFi.\n\nIn short, if you don\u2019t have the technical know-how or don\u2019t have 32 ETH to commit long-term, it\u2019s probably better to opt for an exchange-based staking option."

        "content": "Flare Network, a mainnet seeking to connect Offchain sources and other layer-1s, recently demonstrated that its users can trustlessly purchase Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using coins from other networks.\n\nTesting Flare Network\u2019s interoperability function\n\nIn a press release, Flare Network showed that one could buy ERC-721 NFTs on its network using Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger. These coins are not inherently compatible with Ethereum and are yet to be integrated with the Flare Network.\n\nThis demonstration was done on Flare Network\u2019s Songbird. In this testnet environment, developers can deploy dApps before launching them on the interoperable, scalable mainnet. This purchase was executed through Flare Network\u2019s State Connector and Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO). The State Connector links the Flare Network with smart contracts and Offchain sources. At the same time, the FTSO is a decentralized oracle that verifiably delivers on-chain smart contracts with reliably proven price and data feeds, including those of NFTs, from external sources.\n\nCommenting, Hugo Philion, the Flare CEO and co-founder, said:\n\n\u201cThis demo highlights Flare\u2019s ability to provide more secure, decentralized data on-chain to power new functionality and potential use cases for the industry. The NFT demo is one example of the web3 utility Flare can unlock for legacy tokens, enabling them to be used trustlessly in DApps on the network. We are excited to see what other applications engineers can develop, harnessing the capabilities of Flare\u2019s native interoperability protocols.\u201d\n\nBy illustrating this interoperability functionality currently in beta, Flare Network assured the broader community that it is possible to acquire NFTs launched on its rails using diverse tokens and coins, including DOGE and XRP. These coins are some of the world\u2019s most liquid and are currently perched in the top 10 by market capitalization.\n\nExpanding non-EVM coins\u2019 use cases\n\nBecause of interoperability, the Flare Network opens up new use cases for supported tokens. DOGE, for example, can now be used to acquire valuable NFTs, not just for trading purposes or speculation.\n\nOver the years, DOGE has been rising to new valuations with backing from Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and one of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP, for example, has retained its value despite the ongoing court case versus the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The XRPL also supports smart contracting, a net positive for XRP and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn January, the Flare Network partnered with FYEO, a blockchain security specialist. The firm will audit the platform\u2019s code bases and support safer smart contract development.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

The new Coinbase product is open source but is still somewhat centralized, though Coinbase said Base would be decentralized progressively.\n\nCoinbase stressed that Base would not have a token of its own.\n\n1/ Today, Coinbase is launching @BuildOnBase, an Ethereum layer 2 that will help improve scalability and usability of crypto, so we can bring economic freedom to 1B+ people. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 23, 2023\n\nJesse Pollak, the engineer responsible for protocols at Coinbase, said that Base would be home to Coinbase\u2019s onchain products and serve as an open platform for anyone to build.\n\n\u201cOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard one billion users into the cryptoeconomy. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase\u2019s onchain products and an open ecosystem where anyone can build.\u201d\n\nWhile Coinbase had thought about launching its own chain twice in the past, it decided not to do it. However, the company said yes to Base because it believes it will accelerate the development of Coinbase\u2019s onchain products, bring the exchange\u2019s customers into the cryptoeconomy, and increase its investment in core crypto infrastructure.\n\nBase is currently in testnet. The team behind the blockchain will share more information about its roadmap in the weeks ahead.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCoinbase provided no information on when Base will launch.\n\nSince Coinbase is a public and regulated company, the launch of Base may attract regulatory pressure and scrutiny for Coinbase.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCoinbase is one of the most involved centralized crypto companies in the world. The company\u2019s decision to fork Optimism and launch a Layer-2 network to scale Ethereum is a huge milestone for overall Ethereum scaling and crypto. Users can use Base to access and use Ethereum with cheap transactions.\n\nLearn more about Coinbase\u2019s financial results for Q4 2022:\n\nCoinbase Posts Another Quarterly Loss Amid Regulator Crackdown"

The move is part of Uniswap\u2019s efforts to gain a share of the NFT market, which has been dominated by OpenSea and, more recently, Blur.\n\nNFT traders will find this a welcome move since there are many restrictions involved in buying non-fungible tokens on various marketplaces. For instance, some are quite specific about the kind of token required before user can complete a transaction.\n\nUniswap\u2019s new feature allows NFT traders to use any token supported by the Ethereum blockchain to make a purchase using its simplified interface. This goes for stablecoins such as USDC and USDT and even meme coins like Shiba Inu.\n\n1/ Have you purchased an NFT with any ERC20 token yet? On the surface, your transaction will display like you are buying an NFT with any token in your wallet. But dig into the code, and things get a little more interesting: pic.twitter.com/CQuaCTeSfY \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) February 23, 2023\n\nAccording to Uniswap, the new Universal Router contract will find \u201cthe most cost-efficient route\u201d to swap any Ethereum-based token into the required token for the NFT sale to happen. Then it will push that crypto to OpenSea\u2019s Seaport protocol, where the transaction will be finalized.\n\nThe new integration is a godsend for NFT buyers, who at times need to swap one crypto for another before completing a purchase. Moving forward, there are also plans to support the purchase of a single NFT using multiple cryptocurrencies. For example, if the NFT costs 2 ETH, buyers could pay with a mix of tokens as long as the full value is met.\n\nUniswap Hopes To Spark Trading On Its NFT Marketplace\n\nNow, Uniswap hopes this new feature will spark some life into its NFT marketplace. Since adding NFT trading capabilities to its platform last November, the protocol has seen fewer than 10,000 transactions in total. This roughly translates to about $7.6 million in total volume traded.\n\nData from Dune Analytics shows that the platform has about 16,600 total sellers and 5,400 total buyers. These numbers don\u2019t reflect very well on a protocol that boasts over 4.8 million users. It\u2019s clear Uniswap hasn\u2019t been able to transfer the popularity of its core offering to its NFT marketplace. However, with the new integration, things might change soon.\n\nWant more?

Historically, in cases where some do not fall into the fray, others still join those with the most sales volume and transactions.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBut on 23 February, BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club [MAYC], Otherdeed, and Azuki recorded massive declines as attention moved to other collections. According to CryptoSlam, MAYC still led the volume ranking, but it was only because of the NFT\u2019s high floor prices.\n\nAt press time, the MAYC sales volume was $14.88 million \u2014 8.41% down from the previous 24 hours. Transactions were also down to 564, with reduced involvement of buyers and sellers. In BAYC\u2019s case, it went down to the fifth position. However, it suffered a more tremendous decline than its Yuga Labs\u2019 counterpart.\n\nFrom the image above, BAYC dumped 52.31% in volume, with double-digit decreases in transactions, buyers, and sellers. So, which collection has outperformed the usual suspects?\n\nPenguins, Valhalla, and KILLABEARS NFTs\n\nIn a surprising move, the Pudgy Penguins collection broke into the top 10. Launched in 2021, Pudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based collection comprising 8,888 penguin NFTs. The project was also an instant hit during the season when profile picture projects (PFP) were the center of attraction.\n\nAt press time, Pudgy Penguins\u2019 sales volume was $2.43 million in the last 24 hours. This represented a 41% increase within the said timeframe. However, data from the NFT aggregator revealed that an incredible increase in buyer and seller participation was vital to the landmark. All in all, 297 transactions led to the rise.\n\nHowever, Pudgy Penguins was only one of many Ethereum NFTs with such a performance. KILLABEARS registered $1.128 million in sales despite being the 16th. However, the most notable surge out of the lots was the Valhalla collection.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe collection, which is a crypto-native brand for gamers, increased 483%, thereby making its 24-hour sales volume $2.43 million.\n\nDespite the giant strides recorded by these collections, sales of the Ethereum NFT ecosystem were still down. At the time of writing, the overall sales volume was $82.12 million \u2014 a 28.53% decline. Nonetheless, the decline in the blue-chip collections volume might only last a while."

Crypto enthusiasts view non-custodial wallets as the gold standard in the space as they remove third-party custodians like centralised exchanges and give users complete control over their crypto.\n\n\u201cIt will be a huge distribution funnel for users into DeFi,\u201d Bentley said, because users will be able to \u201cswap, lend, and borrow their crypto assets on protocols like Uniswap and Euler at low cost without the need to trust a third-party custodian.\u201d\n\nNick Almond, founder of DAO infrastructure platform FactoryDAO, also said Base will help bring more users on-chain and using DeFi protocols. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast user base on Coinbase and the majority of those people will have never done anything on-chain. So the Base launch should tempt users over to DeFi, dApps and DAOs,\u201d he said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBase is not the first time a centralised exchange has launched its own blockchain. In September 2020, exchange giant Binance made inroads on-chain with its Ethereum-compatible Binance Smart Chain. Then in November 2021, the Crypto.com exchange launched its own chain called Cronos. However, Coinbase\u2019s Base is the first time an exchange has built a new chain directly on top of Ethereum.\n\nNOW READ: How Coinbase used Slack to sniff out its insider trader\n\nAccording to Almond, Coinbase won\u2019t be the last crypto company to create its own blockchain either. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that most major entities in the space will have their own blockchains sooner or later,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be layer 2s, using Ethereum as a base layer for security and borrowing from existing architectures like Coinbase have done with Optimism.\u201d\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed \u201cOP Stack,\u201d a shared, open-source development stack that powers fellow Ethereum layer 2 chain Optimism. Blockchains built using the OP Stack will form what Optimism calls \u201cThe Superchain\u201d \u2013 a mesh of interoperable blockchains that share Ethereum\u2019s security and can communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cBase, if anything, is a validation of Optimism\u2019s \u2018Superchain\u2019 thesis,\u201d Sebastien Guillemot, CTO and co-founder of Ethereum layer 2 Milkomeda, told DL News. \u201cThe fact that Coinbase not only is willing to sign up to Optimism\u2019s superchain vision but also pay for it shows their vision may be viable beyond small OP Stack-based app-chains.\u201d\n\nOptimism\u2019s native OP token rose 16% on the Base announcement. It has since cooled off but is still trading close to all-time highs at the time of writing."

        "title": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler Indirectly Declares Ether Is A Security - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler has seemingly given an answer on whether or not Ethereum (ETH) is a security. Although he did not mention ether directly, he hinted that all other cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin have all the hallmarks of a security and should therefore be under the SEC\u2019s purview.\n\nGary Gensler Somehow Addresses Ethereum\u2019s Security Status\n\nSEC boss Gary Gensler has recently addressed one of crypto\u2019s most hotly contested issues. Almost eight years after Ethereum started producing blocks, the debate over whether ETH, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, should be labelled a security rages on.\n\nSpeaking during a recent interview with New York Magazine, Gensler noted that all cryptocurrencies in circulation except bitcoin are normally created by a group of entrepreneurs who mostly set up their headquarters in tax haven offshored, and they might also have a foundation. According to the SEC boss, the teams behind these cryptos use various intricate and opaque techniques to promote their tokens and lure investors.\n\n\u201cThey might drop their tokens overseas at first and contend or pretend that it\u2019s going to take six months before they come back to the U.S.,\u201d Gary posited. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d he continued, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d\n\nGensler insisted that, as a legal matter, such cryptocurrencies fall within the jurisdiction of his commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEther Wasn\u2019t A Security Before, But It Could Be Now\n\nPrior to Ethereum\u2019s launch back in July 2015, the network sold its native ether token via an initial coin offering (ICO) in exchange for Bitcoin. Over 49 million ETH were sold during the public ICO sale, earning the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit created to steward the blockchain\u2019s growth, more than $17 million.\n\nIn ETH\u2019s infancy, most crypto market participants argued that the token met the SEC\u2019s so-called Howey Test as it entailed an investment of money in a common enterprise from which there was an expectation of profit based on that enterprise\u2019s efforts.\n\nDespite ambiguity over Ethereum\u2019s status as a security plaguing its early years, the SEC previously weighed in on the network\u2019s status. William Hinman, the former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, said in June 2018 he believed Ethereum had become sufficiently decentralized like bitcoin and was then therefore, not a security.\n\nBut the SEC of today, under Gensler, might take a harsh stance. The former investment banker suggested that Ethereum, following the historic Merge upgrade, could be considered a security in the regulator\u2019s eyes.\n\nNotably, the SEC has already targeted Ripple in a suit that accuses the blockchain payments company of selling the XRP token as an unregistered security. That case remains in court, and the eventual ruling is bound to send shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, whichever way it goes."

        "content": "Ethereum News: Ethereum plans to launch a new testnet named \u201cHolli\u201d (or Holesovice) later this year. Ethereum core developers plan to transition from old testnets to new testnet and solve the ETH supply issues. The testnet will be the first long-standing, merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet.\n\nEthereum core developer Tim Beiko in a tweet on February 24 announced that the team plans to launch the Holli testnet near September 15, 2023. The plan to launch a new testnet has been in process since the Merge upgrade last September.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new testnet, Holli, is planned to launch later this year, and hopefully we can figure out these things before then! I've made two suggestions on the repo, and would love to hear from application layer devs about how we could better approach this! \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) February 23, 2023\n\nHe said old testnets end up being a problem for clients and node operators because it takes more time and space to sync. The Sepolia testnet addressed the supply issue by using a mintable ERC20 token for its beacon chain, instead of sepETH. This allowed validators to effectively mint SepETH, post-Shapella, and solve the supply issue.\n\nUnfortunately, Sepolia isn\u2019t open to permisionless validators, but Goerli is. The Goerli uses the Ethereum client GoETH for its beacon chain. So, over the past few months, an effort has started to create recurring ephemeral testnets for stakers and shadow forks to quickly test upgrades without running a testnet.\n\nTherefore, before Holli testnet launch, Ethereum developers plan to get application developers easy access to testnet ETH tokens. Testnets help three distinct groups of users: client developers, application developers, and node operators/stakers/miners. However, the needs of each group are quite diverse.\n\nEthereum Developer\u2019s Plan To Solve Problems With Testnet\n\nTim Beiko gave two suggestions to solve the problems. First, add each ETH address where the contract is deployed on the mainnet, Goerli, or Sepolia to the genesis file. Second, coordinate with major contract and infrastructure developers to launch on the network shortly after genesis.\n\nTim Beiko is currently seeking input from application layer developers on how to resolve this issue. Moreover, the name \u201cHolli\u201d is not final, it could be changed to Holesky or Holesovice.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum prepares to enable the withdrawal of Ethereum staked on the Beacon chain with the Shanghai upgrade in March. Ethereum price currently trades at $1,653.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price To Suffer? IMF Issues Crypto Action Plan"

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has become one of the most talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency world due to its explosive growth and numerous high-profile partnerships. The project has gained traction and made significant progress in the scaling and adoption of blockchain technology in recent years. Its success has led many to wonder if MATIC can outpace Ether as the go-to blockchain for corporations and the mainstream audience.\n\nBitboy Crypto, the popular YouTube channel run by Ben Armstrong, recently highlighted Polygon\u2019s massive momentum and wind underneath its wings, leading to speculation that it could outpace Ethereum in the near future.\n\nExplosive Growth on the Horizon\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, Polygon has settled on March 27 as the launch date for its much-anticipated ZK EVM mainnet beta network. ZK EVM is a groundbreaking technology that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their cost.\n\nIt generates cryptographic proofs to process transactions faster before those transactions are sent back to layer 1 networks, in this case, Ethereum. This technology is similar to that used by Polygon\u2019s rivals, Solana and XRP, which have faster transaction speeds and unparalleled centralization. The adoption of ZK EVM by Polygon could help it to overtake Ethereum in the near future.\n\nPartnerships Galore\n\nPolygon has already signed partnerships with Dolce and Gabbana, Disney, and Stripe, among other major corporations. Instagram\u2019s recent announcement that it would be using Polygon for its upcoming in-app NFT minting feature is another major endorsement.\n\nInstagram has over two billion monthly users, which means lots of potential traffic for the Polygon network. Nike has also joined the bandwagon, with its Web3 Studio kicking off with Polygon NFTs. DraftKings and the PGA Tour have also jumped on the Polygon train, with their NFT player cards being built on the platform.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Stellar Performance\n\nPolygon has been performing exceptionally well, with its daily active addresses recently surpassing those of Ethereum. Daily active users on Polygon have surpassed those on Ethereum, with the blockchain coming in second behind BNB Chain, which is known for being set up for a bunch of rug pulls. Polygon\u2019s NFT sales on Open Sea have also beaten Ethereum for the second straight month. These low-cost assets are popular with investors and traders alike.\n\nMATIC Price\n\nThe price of MATIC has risen dramatically over the previous two days, reaching the $1.25 threshold. Speed was gained, and MATIC is now clearly above the $1.30 resistance area. The price surged beyond the $1.50 barrier, an increase of roughly 25%.\n\nA peak was set close to $1.568, and a subsequent downward correction has begun, mirroring that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a break from the $1.40 and $1.42 support levels, indicating more weakness in the market."

        "title": "Arbitrum Scaling Solution: Everything You Need to Know - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Arbitrum is a layer 2 (L2) chain built on Ethereum that helps solve the congestion problem on the Ethereum main net. The network was developed by a New-York based company called Offchain labs.\n\nThe Arbitrum chain is a scaling solution used to confirm transactions on the main Ethereum network. The chain does this by recording Ethereum transactions and then relaying them to the Ethereum main chain at a later point. By doing this, it solves the congestion problem on the main net.\n\nHistory of Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum was founded by Offchain Labs in 2018. Offchain Labs itself was founded in 2018 by Ed Felten, Harry Kalodner, and Steven Goldfeder.\n\nFelten was a Computer Science and Public Relations professor at Princeton before he started building Offchain Labs. He also served as the Deputy Chief Technology officer of the White House between 2015 and 2017. After leaving his position at the White House, Felten went on to found Offchain Labs.\n\nAccording to Felten, the idea behind Offchain Labs came to him while he was an academic at Princeton. He says that he\u2019d started working on it back then, and only started doing it full-time after leaving his White House position.\n\nSince Felten started Offchain Labs, the company has received a lot of support. It has gotten investment from crypto juggernauts such as Coinbase Ventures, Panthera, and Blocknation since its inception.\n\nBut what is Arbitrium, and how does it work?\n\nHow Does Arbitrum Work?\n\nA big problem of the Ethereum blockchain is speed. The blockchain can only facilitate a certain number of transactions at a time, and when this number is exceeded, other transactions form a queue. This could lead to some inconvenient situations.\n\nFor example, some dApps, such as Farmers World require transactions to be completed in real-time. If these transactions aren\u2019t completed in real-time (or a close approximation), they could render the dApp worthless. The congestion on Ethereum means that these transactions could be delayed by a considerable period of time.\n\nSuch dApps now have to endure that delay because of Ethereum\u2019s popularity. There are more dApps on Ethereum now, and transaction delays have only grown. That means more transactions are being loaded into the chain, and it\u2019s taking even more time for these transactions to be completed.\n\nThere are two proposed solutions for this congestion problem on the Ethereum chain. The first solution to this problem is to embrace sharding. That is, the Ethereum chain will be split into multiple shards, which should theoretically increase the capacity of the chain to complete transactions.\n\nHowever, sharding the Ethereum network is a long and complicated process. While it already exists right now, it\u2019s not yet at a scale where it will necessarily impact transaction time. This means that dApps that want faster transaction time need to look for another immediate solution.\n\nThe second solution for this decongestion is off-chain data confirmation. This means relaying the smart contracts to an off-chain solution that confirms it and then adds it to the Ethereum chain at a later date.\n\nThis method of confirming transactions is called roll-up. According to Ethereum, rollup solutions perform transactions outside the Ethereum blockchain and then post the data to the chain where consensus is reached.\n\nThis means that certain transactions can be confirmed in real-time, while consensus over the transaction will be reached on the Ethereum main chain at a later point. Since the transaction data is included in the layer 1 blocks, the transactions retain an equal level of safety as directly confirmed transactions.\n\nThese rollups are performed by layer 2 chains, and Arbitrum is one such chain.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge and Gas Fees\n\nIn late 2022, Ethereum took a huge step towards sharding by completing the Ethereum merge. This merge was theoretically supposed to reduce congestion on the Ethereum chain and make it easier to confirm transactions through it. However, Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem has remained despite the merge. This means that Arbitrum and layers like it will probably become even more popular.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t just solve the decongestion problem on Ethereum, it also solves the gas fees problem too. The bigger the congestion on the ETH network, the higher the gas fee one has to pay for quick transactions. However, Arbitrum solves that problem because contracts are now validated in batches.\n\nThe Optimistic Arbitrum\n\nThere are two types of transaction rollup chains, and they differ because of their security models.\n\nThe first is the zero-knowledge rollups. The zero-knowledge rollups perform the computation of transactions off-chain and then submit it to the layer 1 chain through a validity proof. The summary data submitted to the chain from the rollup only defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and cryptographic proof that those changes are correct and valid.\n\nOptimistic rollups, on the other hand, submits the data assuming it is correct by default. Hence, the validity of the data is only double-checked if there\u2019s someone challenges it. To ascertain the validity of the transaction, a fraud-proof is automatically run on the changed data.\n\nArbitrum is an optimistic rollup chain, which means that data is submitted with the assumption that it is valid by default. Because of Arbitrum\u2019s optimistic data outlook, it has important advantages over zero-knowledge layer 2 chains.\n\nFor one, optimistic rollups are cheaper than zero-knowledge solutions. The gas fees are often lower per transaction batch, and the network also has lower off-chain computation costs.\n\nSecondly, optimistic rollups are directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that even layer 1 applications can easily connect to Arbitrum and enjoy faster confirmation times.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coin?\n\nLayer 2 solutions usually have native coins that are used to compensate validators. However, Arbitrum doesn\u2019t have a native coin. According to Ed Felten, the co-founder of Offchain labs, there is no plan to launch a separate Arbitrum token.\n\nThis means there is no direct way to invest in Arbitrum. However, there\u2019s been a few changes to the position of Offchain Labs when it comes to minting an Arbitrum Coin. In April 2022, a cofounder of Offchain labs, Steven Goldfeder, posted a tweet that insinuated that an \u201cArbi\u201d coin is in the works. This tweet was most likely a response to Arbitrum\u2019s competitor, Optimism, releasing an OP token.\n\nHowever, it may not be advisable for Arbitrum to drop a token right now. The bear market is still ravaging the crypto ecosystem despite Bitcoin\u2019s recent recovery, and things are still a bit uncertain. While no one can say what Offchain Labs will do for sure, it\u2019s likely that they hold off any potential token drop until the market recovers.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nVitalik Buterin has argued that layer 2 chains may be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problems, rather than a stopgap.\n\nArbitrum doesn\u2019t have a token. This means that it\u2019s impossible for small retail investors to invest in it.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nLayer 2 chains like Arbitrum are one of the most exciting developments in crypto in recent times. This is because they could be the permanent solution to Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem. Since Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem is a big stumbling block to crypto adoption, solving it could be big news for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "3 Underdog Cryptos to Buy to Win Big in 2023 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "To paraphrase a famous Mark Twain quote, reports of the death of cryptocurrencies have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, crypto has been on a red-hot run so far in 2023, outperforming most other asset classes, including stocks. In 2023, the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 40%. At the start of December, following the spectacular $8 billion implosion of FTX, a crypto exchange, Bitcoin was trading under $16,000; now it\u2019s changing hands for just over $23,000. Other digital coins and tokens have also had strong rallies since the start of January. While some market observers attempt to dismiss the current bull run, others say it is a clear sign that investors\u2019 appetite for risk has returned and that cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. In fact, many analysts see the rebound of digital coins and tokens as a clear sign of their resiliency in the wake of an industry shakeout during the second half of 2022. Whatever the reason, there\u2019s no denying that cryptocurrencies are once again marching higher. Here are three underdog cryptos to buy to win big in 2023.\n\nETH Ethereum $1,617 ADA Cardano 35.9 cents TRX Tron 6.9 cents\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nA concept image of mining an Ethereum (ETH) token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is typically thought of as the other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin. The second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum often plays second fiddle to the larger BTC, which tends to serve as a bellwether for the entire market of digital coins and tokens. Yet many crypto bulls claim that Ethereum has a brighter future than Bitcoin and that it is ETH that will prove to be the long-term winner when it comes to the future of the sector.\n\nMany crypto purists favor Ethereum because, they say, it helps to facilitate decentralized financial (DeFi) transactions and has more utility than Bitcoin. They also point to the fact that ETH is now more environmentally friendly than BTC after it underwent a transformation last September to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol. Today mining for Ethereum takes a fraction of the energy consumed when mining for Bitcoin and other cryptos. This, say Ethereum fans, will make all the difference moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore upgrades and enhancements to Ethereum are scheduled for this year. And those enhancements could serve as a catalyst for ETH. Over the past year, Ethereum\u2019s price has declined 43%. However, the crypto has been on a run so far in 2023, rising over 30%.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nA concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother crypto that has been ripping higher this year is Cardano (ADA-USD). Through almost two months of the year, ADA has gained 46%. While the current price is far below Cardano\u2019s market peak of $2.85 reached in August 2021, its recovery so far this year has been cheered by investors and analysts, many of whom see Cardano as a dark horse in the race for crypto supremacy.\n\nCardano competes head-to-head against Ethereum in the realm of DeFi and smart contracts. Cardano\u2019s underlying blockchain technology was given a boost in late 2021 when it completed the Alonzo hard fork. Fans say that the hard-fork upgrade puts Cardano on equal footing with Ethereum, though investors can purchase ADA for a fraction of the cost of a single ETH token. Proponents of Cardano recently cheered news that the crypto had surpassed 60 million blockchain transactions.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nDigital data flow on road with motion blur to create vision of fast speed transfer. Concept of future digital transformation, disruptive innovation and agile business methodology. LTRX stock\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose looking for a cryptocurrency that continues to float largely under the radar should consider TRON (TRX-USD). Founded in 2014 by Justin Sun, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who was born in China, Tron contains many of the best attributes of both ETH and ADA.\n\nLike those cryptos, TRX has smart contract functionality and operates on an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake protocol. However, Tron also runs on a decentralized, open-source blockchain operating system.\n\nTron is viewed as a favorite among smaller, lesser-known cryptocurrencies. TRX has risen 25% in 2023. It\u2019s also one of the few digital coins or tokens whose price is up over the past 12 months.\n\nIn the last year, Tron has gained 17%.

        "content": "Meta has joined fellow tech giants in the AI space by introducing LLaMA, its artificial intelligence language model.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the AI product on Facebook and Instagram earlier today.\n\nAI has been a hot space in the tech industry lately and has seen participation from industry giants like Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe announcement has sent crypto tokens related to artificial intelligence soaring.\n\nTechnology giant Meta has officially made its artificial intelligence debut with the introduction of Large Language Model Meta AI or LLaMA, its state-of-the-art foundational large language model (LLM) designed to aid researchers in advancing their work in this subfield of AI.\n\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA to rival Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT\n\nAccording to a blog post by Meta, LLaMA will be made available in several sizes, which will include 7 billion, 13 billion, 33 billion, and 65 billion parameters. The firm claimed that smaller foundation models such as LLaMA will require comparatively less computing power and resources to test new approaches, explore new use cases, and validate others\u2019 work.\n\n\u201cLLMs have shown a lot of promise in generating text, having conversations, summarizing written material, and more complicated tasks like solving math theorems or predicting protein structures. Meta is committed to this open model of research and we\u2019ll make our new model available to the AI research community.\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nWith the launch of LLaMA, Meta has joined the likes of Microsoft and Google, who have aggressively pursued the artificial intelligence trend that started with the launch of OpenAI\u2019s Chat GPT late last year. Microsoft invested a whopping $10 billion in OpenAI last month to extend its relationship with the firm and integrate ChatGPT in the Bing search engine. Earlier this month, Google announced its own AI service named Bard, which is powered by their Language Model for Dialogue Applications.\n\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement sent crypto tokens related to artificial intelligence soaring. SingularityNET\u2019s AGIX has surged more than 6% since the announcement of LLaMA. Fetch.ai\u2019s FET was close behind, gaining more than 4.5%."

        "title": "What is 'BASE'? Here is What We Know So Far About the L2 Project Being Built by Coinbase - Securities.io",
        "content": "This week, the publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase unveiled its own Ethereum layer-2 network called Base and advised the crypto community to stay tuned for the upcoming mainnet launch.\n\nThe Base chain will be home to Coinbase's on-chain products as well as an open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps (dApps), said the leading cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps. Our goal with Base is to make on-chain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the crypto economy,\u201d Coinbase said on Twitter.\n\nCoinbase Senior Director of Engineering Jesse Pollak shared that while the platform was only announced on Thursday, a testnet for Base has actually been live since the start of the month.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bet that we can help enable the next million dapps, which are going to bring in the next billion users. We think that will happen on a five- to 10-year horizon, and this is our contribution to making that happen sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nThe goal of Base is to bring about phase 4 of Coinbase's \u2018secret master plan,' which is to create an open financial system and onboard the next wave of users to the crypto economy. With this move, Coinbase has become the first publicly traded company to launch an Ethereum Layer 2.\n\nLayer 2 networks help make transactions faster and cheaper than the underlying blockchain, such as Ethereum, by processing batches of transactions on a separate chain and then sending receipts back to the mainnet.\n\nClick here to know all about investing in crypto.\n\nEntering a Crowded Sector\n\nCoinbase's Base is just one of many Ethereum Layer 2s; others in the space include Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, and Starknet, to name a few.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, there is currently more than $6 billion worth of ETH on these layer 2s, which is a 17% growth from a month ago. This website tracks 26 different Ethereum scaling networks and notes that Arbitrum One accounts for the majority (53%) of the L2 market share, while Optimism has captured 31% of this segment.\n\nHowever, unlike these L2s, Base will not be launching a network token, which is used on other networks to pay gas fees and incentivize development.\n\nAccording to Coinbase, \u201ctokens are not the only way to drive activity,\u201d instead, it believes \u201cbuilding great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nIt's interesting to note that both Arbitrum and Optimism launched their networks without tokens initially. However, Optimism has since airdropped its governance token to early adopters of its network. This was done in order to distribute governance power to the community and fund development proposals through its DAO. There have been rumors that Arbitrum has been planning something similar for a long time, but no token has yet been released.\n\nHowever, Base's entry into the market may not be as competitive for Optimism. According to Coinbase's announcement, Base will be \u201ca rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism.\u201d\n\nThe base will also return a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective. \u201cThis move furthers the Collective's vision for a sustainable future where Impact = Profit,\u201d tweeted Optimism on Thursday.\n\nFollowing the Coinbase announcement, Optimism's native token, OP, recorded a jump in price. The $668 million market cap coin is up 11% in the past 24 hours and nearly 240% YTD, as per CoinGecko. Launched in May 2022, just earlier this month, OP hit an ATH of $3.19.\n\nEarlier this month, Optimism revealed its plans to upgrade its network next month, which is a \u201cstep towards a multi-chain future.\u201d Dubbed \u201cBedrock,\u201d the upgrade aims to lower fees, increase transfer speed, and enhance compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nTo address the issues of speed and cost associated with layer-1 blockchains, Optimism uses \u201crollups,\u201d which involve processing transactions on a separate chain and then settling them on the mainnet in batches.\n\nDecentralized Over Time\n\nThe Base chain is launched with dozens of partners who have committed to building in and supporting the ecosystem. Some of these include Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, oracle network Chainlink, DeFi protocol Aave, Animoca Bands, and SushiSwap.\n\nCoinbase said it intends for Base governance to be fully decentralized, but it won't be that way initially. Instead, it would happen rather progressively in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is going to gradually transition into a role where we're a contributor to Base, we provide services and products that are built on top of Base, and we are not the decision maker for everything in the Base network \u2014 that's being done through more decentralized governance,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nAnd to best achieve its goals, Coinbase has decided to join Optimism as a core developer on the open-source OP Stack. They have also decided to keep the core team really lean so that \u201cwe can have an outsized impact if we're building on-chain,\u201d said Pollak.\n\nThe exchange explained in the official blog post that by leveraging Optimism's OP Stack and collaborating with Optimism, Base will act as \u201can open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the crypto economy scale.\u201d\n\nSo, Coinbase will have more control over Base at first with the vision to make Base fully permissionless eventually. And according to the announcement, Base will progress from its current Stage 0 to the next stage rollup this year alone, with the Stage 2 rollup to be achieved in 2024.\n\nWhile Base will be a separate network, it will still be powered by the underlying blockchain, that is, Ethereum. It will use Ethereum's security infrastructure, but it won't be limited to Ethereum; rather will also provide easy and secure access to other layer 2 networks, such as Optimism, as well as other blockchains ecosystems, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\n\u201cBase offers full EVM equivalence at a fraction of the cost and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform,\u201d explains Coinbase's blog post on the L2 Base.\n\nCoinbase further plans to integrate the Base chain across its exchange, wallet, NFT marketplace, and developer products.\n\nAlong with the new chain, Coinbase also announced the launch of a Base Ecosystem Fund to support early-stage projects working with Base as long as they meet the company's investment criteria.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Optimism.\n\nCOIN Gaining Strength\n\nWhile in its announcement, Coinbase made it clear that it has \u201cno plans to issue a new network token,\u201d degen traders were quick to find an alternative.\n\nSome degen crypto traders piled into an unrelated token called BASE following Coinbase's layer-2 announcement. The native token of Base Protocol, BASE saw its price soar about 350% in a few hours to almost its ATH before falling down hard to its previous levels.\n\nSome have suggested that insider trading may have occurred, as the BASE token began to move long before the Coinbase announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase (COIN) prices are up 16% since early last week but down 29% since early February highs. COIN is a $14.43 billion market cap stock trading at $62.36 at the time of writing.\n\nIn 2023, along with the broad crypto market green, COIN prices also recovered, having started the year under $32. Still, the stock is nowhere near its all-time high (ATH) of $430 hit when it first started trading on Nasdaq under the COIN ticker in April 2021. The COIN stock prices have only been down since currently 85.5% off their peak.\n\nAmidst the positive price movement, Cathie Wood's investment management firm ARK added around $13.2 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) shares, per an investor email on Thursday.\n\nARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) added 181,972 shares ($11.4 million) of Coinbase. This was the fund's biggest COIN order of the year, surpassing the $9.2 million order earlier this month. Meanwhile, 31,547 COIN shares ($1.93 million) were added to Ark's Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nThese purchases came after Coinbase reported its Q4 2022 earnings this Tuesday, which beat analyst expectations.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $605 million, up 5% from $590 million in the third quarter. Subscription and service revenues grew 34% to $283 million in Q4, accounting for almost 50% of Coinbase's overall revenue in the quarter, which was primarily due to interest income that came in at $162.2 million. Transaction volume, however, fell 12% quarter over quarter to $322 million on lower overall trading volume.\n\nIn its shareholder letter, Coinbase said crypto markets have improved in Q1 2023 compared to Q4 2022, helping it generate $120 million in transaction revenue in January 2023.\n\nHowever, during the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong cautioned retail investors \u201cnot to extrapolate those results forward,\u201d pointing out that last year revealed just how volatile the crypto market can be.\n\nCoinbase expects increased crypto regulation globally in the coming years and anticipates benefiting from it. The company also criticized the fragmented approach of the United States to regulating crypto but continues to work towards more consistent policies.\n\n\u201cPolicy is my top priority this year,\u201d said Armstrong, adding that he's been spending a lot of time in Washington, D.C. \u201cThere is a lot of excitement about the potential of this technology, and there is a lot of desire for people to have this built here in America.\u201d"

        "title": "Coinbase launches its very own Layer 2 Network; why it matters - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Coinbase announced the launch of its own Layer 2 Ethereum Network called \u201cBase\u201d. Nairametrics understands that the network was built on what is known as the \u201cOptimistic Rollup technology\u201d and was designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum users.\n\nCoinbase also announced a partnership with the Optimism Foundation, a non-profit organization, that writes software codes to scale the Ethereum technology, as the core developer for the new network. Base is also built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack.\n\nThe technology being implemented is known as the \u201cSuperchain.\u201d It is a layer 2 scaling solution that allows multiple transactions to be processed off-chain and then batched together and submitted to the Ethereum blockchain as a single transaction. This will allow for faster and cheaper transactions while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.\n\nMore details about Base: The reasoning behind launching Base falls within Coinbase\u2019s mission statement. Coinbase believes on-chain is the next online and will help onboard over a billion users into the cryptocurrency space. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products and an open ecosystem where anyone can build.\n\nThe announcement said: \u201cTo bring in billions of users to the cryptoeconomy, dapps need to be easier, cheaper, and safer to interact with. For this to happen, we need to make it even easier for developers to build these dapps.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, Base is built with the security and scalability you need to power your decentralized apps. It leverages the underlying security of Ethereum, along with Coinbase\u2019s best practices, to enable you to confidently onramp into Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.\n\nBase is also expected to make it easier to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Per the announcement, Base makes it easy to build decentralized apps with access to Coinbase\u2019s products, users, and tools. Users are expected to enjoy seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools, which will enable developers to serve the existing 110 million verified users on Coinbase who all have over $80 billion in assets on the platform.\n\nBase is also expected to reduce Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee charges, especially during times of high activity on the network. The announcement explains that Base will offer a full EVM equivalence at a fraction of the cost and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform.\n\nDevelopers, for example, will be able to set up gasless transactions for their dapps with easy developer APIs for account abstraction, and securely build multichain applications with easy-to-use bridges.\n\nWhat the Industry is Saying: The Ethereum community appears to have taken a bullish view of Coinbase\u2019s Base. A prominent member of the crypto community and host of the Bankless Show, Ryan Sean Adams, said the move \u201cis a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum,\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that this could set a precedent for cryptocurrency companies and financial institutions to use Ethereum as the settlement layer of choice. He said:\n\n\u201cThey choose Ethereum instead of launching their own L2. This is a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum. This sets precedent that other crypto companies will follow, then Fintechs, then banks. Eventually the world will use Ethereum as a settlement and property rights system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sebastien Guillemot, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm dcSpark, suggested that Coinbase made a wise decision to go with a layer 2 as opposed to an independent sidechain, noting that \u201calmost all\u201d cryptocurrency transactions and value locked on Ethereum resides on layer 2s these days.\n\nBut there has also been some criticisms. Gabriel Shapiro, the general counsel of investment firm Delphi Labs, explained in a February 23 Twitter post that launching a centralized layer-2 network \u201copens the door\u201d to unwanted SEC scrutiny.\n\nWhat you should know: Coinbase has approximately 110 million verified users and has partnered with 245,000 companies in over 100 countries since it was founded in 2012. Its cryptocurrency exchange is the second largest in terms of trading volume, behind Binance according to CoinGecko. Adams added, \u201cIf Coinbase converts 20% of its 110m verified users to Layer 2 users in the coming years, this alone will 10x the total number of crypto native users.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he explained that the layer-2 network is currently in its testnet phase."

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin have started 2023 in the green \u2013 what crypto holders should expect next? - South Florida Caribbean News",
        "content": "The biggest digital currencies by market cap have climbed slightly over the last few days, and specialists are optimistic they\u2019ll perform better in 2023 than in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has entered the new year registering modest gains, but even if it barely moved over the last months, it\u2019s crucial to note that it grew by 1% in the first week of January. A look at exchange platforms shows that the oldest cryptocurrency is trading at over $16,500, slowly increasing in value. In January 2022, Bitcoin was trading over 60% higher than it\u2019s now, but let\u2019s stay positive and remember that it remained the biggest digital coin in the sector, despite the bear market.\n\nEthereum was also up at the end of 2022 and entered 2023 with a growth of 1,9%. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap had some terrible periods before and after the Merge. Let\u2019s remember that in November, it plunged to around $1,100 due to the shift from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake protocol. But in December, it registered an increase in value and remained almost flat over the first week of January 2023.\n\nInvestors interested to buy Ethereum online should have a quick look at Binance to have a clear picture of the coin\u2019s evolution in 2022 and the first month of 2023. According to the Ethereum Foundation, ETH holders will have an interesting 2023 because the blockchain will introduce Proto Danksharding in the following period, and it won\u2019t be the only update of the ecosystem. The introduction of withdrawals will definitely make waves in the sector. Testing for the feature starts in January, but stakeholders will benefit from it by the end of March.\n\nHowever, even if cryptocurrencies had some catastrophic months, experts believe they\u2019ll bounce back. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that digital currencies have been in a freefall over the last few months due to the negative events in the worldwide economy. The average value of cryptocurrencies dropped, based on statistics from exchange platforms. Then came the implosion of FTX, which also had a negative impact on the sector. Crypto investors have several reasons to be pessimistic about digital coins\u2019 evolution in 2023, but analysts believe it\u2019s important to keep their faith. Despite the events from last year, the overall crypto ecosystem has potential because its decentralised nature allows it to bounce back. The sector has good survival instincts, to say so.\n\nThe crypto market seems to always bounce back\n\n2022 wasn\u2019t the first time the market entered a bear phase. Bitcoin registered some dramatic drops in price in 2014, when the returns decreased by 58%, and its value remained depressed until 2017. Then in 2018, it plunged in value for over 18 months. And we all remember that it survived crypto winters and came back stronger every time.\n\nEthereum also went through similar stages over the years, experiencing some steep declines, followed by sharp spikes in price. Crypto specialists often compare Bitcoin and Ethereum with cockroaches that just don\u2019t want to die. They continue to survive the most challenging instances because they\u2019re largely decentralised systems. Besides, the collapse of FTX has triggered an increased adoption of DeFi, which is powered by cryptocurrencies and is predicted to become a bright spot for the sector.\n\nDeFi\u2019s rise\n\nThe crash of FTX had no impact on DeFi\u2019s evolution, and finance experts believe that investors will most likely shift towards digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin to benefit from their application-based ecosystems.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain houses several crypto applications like commerce, decentralised social media, and NFT-based gaming. Applications use the Ethereum blockchain because it enables them to use or build ETH currencies and complete transactions. Even if at the moment, only 5% of the overall number of internet users take advantage of crypto, it\u2019s expected their number to grow due to these applications.\n\nIt also seems like value in the market will move from speculative digital assets to application-driven and utility ecosystems like Ethereum.\n\nMarket regulation\n\nAs the news announced for some time, the market will face regulation in the near future, which isn\u2019t a bad thing because it could benefit it in the long term. Investors usually deride moves to regulate the space. The blockchain and the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) came to life as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. Crypto enthusiasts have visions of switching from controlled traditional finance to a more decentralised one. However, not that digital currencies are moving into the mainstream, and more and more people demand regulation. The fall of FTX also triggered an increase in the number of investors requiring a formal framework.\n\nFinance analysts state that regulation will definitely bring some adjustments in the industry, but the policies aim to create a more sustainable ecosystem and attract more institutional investors.\n\nConsidering the above, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the crypto market has strong potential to grow, especially as people consider digital currencies as speculative assets they can add to their portfolios to gain income.\n\nWhat does 2023 bring for Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s competitors?\n\n2022 was a bad year not only for Ethereum and Bitcoin but for all the other altcoins. The bear market caused drops in prices for all cryptocurrencies, and few disappeared completely from the market.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts bet on projects linked to scalability on the Ethereum blockchain, like Arbitrum and Polygon, to trigger market growth. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that other altcoins won\u2019t have their place in the spotlight in 2023. Even if they still have some challenges to overcome, Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana are expected to perform well in 2023.\n\nCardano passed the 4,000 smart contracts mark and has one of the best-developed networks in the sector, so investors will maintain their interest in it.\n\nSolana registered growth in the NFT sector, despite the bear market and remained a leader in the market due to its low fees and fast network.\n\nAvalanche continued to invest in upgrading the network despite the crypto winter and made some important partnerships with Ethereum\u2019s competitors."

        "title": "Solana (SOL) vs Ethereum (ETH); Which is the Best Altcoin? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) has boomed over the past years picking up an exponential growth since the mid 2020. As it gears up to take on the centralized banking and finance sector, two of the largest blockchains for decentralized activity and non-fungible tokens (NFT) \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) vs Solana (SOL) are at loggerheads to grab the trophy for the best altcoin.\n\nBoth the digital tokens have racked up a substantial valuation among the top cryptocurrencies with several upgrades lined up on their respective roadmaps. While Ethereum has been one of the oldest and most used blockchain platforms, it is the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), Solana has been touted as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d, providing faster and better transactions for the users.\n\nLet us delve in a little further to find out if Solana is better than Ethereum or the other way around.\n\nMain differences between Solana and Ethereum\n\nAmidst a constant conflict for the title of the best altcoin, it is becoming increasingly common to hear investors and developers weighing in their options between Solana vs Ethereum. Although both Ethereum and Solana are powerful blockchains, each platform has some major advantages as well as disadvantages that help the platform to stand out. In order to compare Solana vs Ethereum, let us segregate both the platforms under some basic features.\n\nDecentralization\n\nSolana is a high-performance decentralized blockchain built with the goal to enable the scalability of decentralized applications (dApps). It is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the world, with thousands of projects including DeFi, NFTs and Web3.\n\nOn the other hand Ethereum has been a major leader in terms of blockchain platforms powering thousands of decentralized transactions. Ethereum is more popular in the category of decentralization with over 2,900 dApps running on its platform whereas Solana has about 350.\n\nProcessing speed\n\nEthereum can process approximately 13-15 transactions per second. However, there are several Ethereum scaling platforms such as Polygon that helps to increase the number of nodes in the network, enhancing the transaction load.\n\nOn the contrary, Solana, does not need Layer-2 solutions to speed up its transactions. It uses a Turbine block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller fragments which in turn, makes data transfer across the network an easy task. The entire mechanism helps the blockchain perform at a whopping 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nTransaction time\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s key advantages compared to Ethereum is that it doesn\u2019t have a waiting period between processing a transaction and confirming it on the blockchain. While Solana transactions are capable of being accepted almost instantly, Ethereum has a waiting period spanning around four to five minutes.\n\nBecause transactions require less time to process, Solana is a more eco-friendly solution in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s gas-hungry blockchain, making the efficiency of SOL even more attractive. The Solana blockchain has a block time of 0.4 seconds and a block size of 20,000 transactions, compared to Ethereum\u2019s block time of 13 seconds and block size of only 70 transactions.\n\nTransaction fees\n\nEthereum is infamous for its notoriously high gas fees compared to Solana. The ETH transaction fees are quite high with users have to pay $2-$6 for just 1 transaction, depending on network traffic.\n\nConversely, one of the key advantages of Solana is its pricing offering a transaction fee of just $0.00025 per transaction. Solana is also the most inexpensive chain to drop NFTs. For comparison, the cost of deploying smart contracts on Ethereum is around $5,000+, whereas it is a meagre $30 on Solana.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity has been a major concern when it comes to cryptocurrency, and it\u2019s an important consideration when comparing Solana and Ethereum. With the recent software upgrade \u201cMerge\u201d, Ethereum shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus that will be a financial incentive against the temptation to validate fraudulent transactions.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, uses a Proof of History consensus mechanism. While this mechanism allows for considerably faster processing speeds, those speeds come at a cost. Unfortunately, Proof of History doesn\u2019t provide the same level of security.\n\nStaking: Solana vs Ethereum. Which is more profitable?\n\nCrypto staking is a process that involves \u201clocking up\u201d a portion of a user\u2019s cryptocurrency for a period of time as a way of contributing to the blockchain network. In exchange, the stakers can earn rewards, typically in the form of additional coins or tokens. In a nutshell, it is a way of earning passive income.\n\nEthereum (ETH) takes the trophy for the most staked crypto asset following the successful Merge of the Beacon Chain consensus layer with the Ethereum execution layer in 2022. On-chain ETH staking yields are currently around 4% APY.Hot on heels is Solana (SOL) with the second-highest staking transaction market cap of $12.7 billion.\n\nAs per analytics firm Nansen, most of the ETH currently staked is not profitable at current Ethereum prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) offers delegated proof of stake where tokens are delegated to validators running nodes. The Ethereum Killer staking has historically yielded around 5.5% annual percentage yield (APY). More than 16.5 million ether, worth $27.7 billion, has been staked since Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, of which 31% or 5.115 million ETH are in profit while the rest, 11.385 million ETH, are in loss.\n\nWhich Ecosystem is better for DeFi, Solana or Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is unquestionably the reigning champion in this category, as its ecosystem has been expanding and maturing for years. With a large developer community, robust development tools, and frameworks, Ethereum provides developers with a vast array of options for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is home to some of the most innovative and successful Blockchain projects, including Uniswap, Compound, and MakerDAO.\n\nAt the same time, Solana, has focused on enticing programmers who wish to create high-throughput and high-speed applications, such as DeFi and NFTs. It has already established partnerships with a number of decentralized projects, including Serum, Mango Markets, and Degenerate Ape Academy, which are attracting developers and users to its platform. Developers are beginning to take notice of Solana\u2019s unique features, such as its lightning-fast transaction speed and scalability.\n\nIn the NFT sector, Ethereum has continued to dominate, with OpenSea and Rarible being two of the most prominent NFT marketplaces. This platform has seen the rise of Axie Infinity and Gods Unchained. Uniswap and SushiSwap are two popular DEXs that use Ethereum. Because of its smart contract capabilities and established ecosystem, it has become the platform of choice for the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEX).\n\nAlternatively, Solana has been gaining impressive traction as a platform for NFT marketplaces and games. It has collaborated with a number of NFT initiatives, such as Degenerate Ape Academy, and gaming projects, such as Star Atlas, to provide consumers with unique gaming experiences. Solana is also quickly gaining popularity as a DEX platform, with Serum being one of the most promising regimens.\n\nSOL vs ETH: Which Cryptocurrency Should I Invest In?\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana can be excellent investment opportunities. However, it difficult to compare the two cryptocurrencies or two platforms and definitively say that one is better than the other. It\u2019s clear both Ethereum and Solana have major selling points.\n\nEthereum boasts long-term stability and security, along with its robust smart contract capabilities. It also has a higher trading price and more proven success as an investment. The Ethereum network is also gearing up for the next big upgrade dubbed Shanghai which aims to add new functionality. The software upgrade will separate code and data, helping Layer 2s handle smart contract code easier and quicker. This in turn will boost new smart contract functionality lowering gas fees even further.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has the edge when it comes to speed and scalability. Solana Mobile will soon make available the cutting-edge new phone from Solana, called Saga and would come pre-installed with a dApp store. The dApp store was intended to serve as a single hub through which users could access all of the decentralized applications available on the Solana network. The recent SOL rally came after Helium Network announced its migration to Solana. Solana also intends to upgrade its network by introducing new features, such as Solana Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge, and by allowing more developers and projects to utilize its platform.\n\nThe Helium network is migrating from its current L1 to Solana at the end of March, bringing with nearly 1 million hotspots worldwide across the LoRa and 5G networks \ud83d\udd25https://t.co/Bn847ghLik \u2014 Solana (@solana) February 20, 2023\n\nWhile, Ethereum has been around longer and has experienced explosive growth, Solana is not far behind prices jumping over the past few days. Which cryptocurreny to invest in right now? It depends on the individual investment style. Investors looking for less risk may feel more comfortable choosing market leader Ethereum. But for those willing to take on a bit more risk, Solana might be the best bet.\n\nRecap: Comparative Table Ethereum vs Solana\n\nEthereum (ETH) Solana (SOL) Launch Date 30 July 2015 16 March 2020 Max. Token Supply Infinite Infinite Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-History / Delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) $0.00025 per transaction Transactions Per Second 15 65,000 Programming Language Solidity The primary Solana programming language is Rust, but C, C++, and even Python are supported. Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://solana.com/\n\nConclusion\n\nIt can be concluded that Ethereum has a stronghold over the DeFi and NFT market with developers still preferring Ethereum. However, as the crypto competition heats up, Solana has jumped on the popularity bandwagon at a very short span of time. Therefore it can be safe to say, if someone is looking for the most dependable platform with security and features, it would be Ethereum. However, if they are looking for affordability and faster speeds, Solana is a better option.\n\nCrypto Economy reviews and comparisons are for informational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice. If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies, do so at your own risk and do your own research beforehand."

        "content": "Coinbase happens to be extremely pleased and takes an immense amount of pride in making its formal announcement of the testnet launch of Base. The entity Base happens to be an Ethereum Layer 2 network. It will be providing all of the connected users a safe and economical method of creating decentralized apps, or for that matter, dApps onchain. It will also supposedly be extremely user-friendly and accessible by anyone and from just about any place on the globe.\n\nThe aim and intention of Coinbase, where Base is concerned, is to be able to convert onchain into the next online, along with onboarding 1B+ users within the crypto-economy. In order to be able to achieve this effectively, Base will be playing the role of a home, in the case of Coinbase\u2019s onchain products, as well as an open ecosystem wherein just about any user will be capable of creating.\n\nCoinbase is an American publicly traded company that deals in Cryptocurrency. The company works as a crypto exchange platform. All the employees work from a remote location as everything is virtual, and the company does not have a physical headquarter.\n\nCoinbase happens to be working on the development of Bse within itself with the proper utilization of its collective expertise in the creation of crypto products, all the while focussing on the decentralization of the chain over a period of time. However, they happen to be absolutely clear about the fact that there are no plans afoot to bring out a new network token.\n\nThe idea behind the creation of Base happens to be the desire to make it the most convenient place for developers to be able to create onchain. It has been duly secured by Ethereum, which makes it safe as well as upgradable for the added boost in the case of decentralized apps. It has also been sufficiently boosted by Coinbase in order to make it more convenient for the creation of decentralized apps and being connected with Coinbase\u2019s products, users, as well as tools.\n\nBase happens to have many prime features along with very economical fees and provides complete EVM-like facilities at a much lesser cost. It also happens to be open-source, with its focus on being decentralized as well as permissionless. It will also allow any user to be able to build a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain that is boosted by Optimism.\n\nIn order to be able to rope in an almost endless number of users to the cryptoeconomy, there is a requirement for dApps to be more convenient, along with being more economical as well as secure for carrying out interactions. In the creation and development of Base, Coinbase is looking into certain aspects. In their opinion, Base needs to be offering convenient and safe connectivity with Ethereum L1, other L2s, along with other L1 ecosystems. It also needs to be open-source as well as decentralized.\n\nWhere Coinbase is concerned, there also happens to be the factor of a Base Ecosystem Fund that has been duly set up. It will be instrumental in making investments, as well as backing nascent stage projects that happen to be created on Base on the condition of meeting certain requirements."
