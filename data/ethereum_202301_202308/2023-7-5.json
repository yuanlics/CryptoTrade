        "title": "4 reasons why the Ether price can't break $1,970 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price faced resistance after hitting the $1,970 level on July 3. A number of factors capped the rally, including higher odds of more interest rate hikes in the coming months and a tighter regulatory cryptocurrency environment.\n\nMacro headwinds from the Fed\n\nBesides the external factors, the Ethereum network has faced withdrawals from its smart contract applications, which also put the June rally in check.\n\nInvestors now question whether tailwinds from requests for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund have faded, opening room for an Ether (ETH) correction down to the $1,700 level last seen on June 16.\n\nThe recent macroeconomic events may provide some hints, including the fact that the gross domestic product grew in the United States by an annualized 2% rate in the first quarter, Germany\u2019s Consumer Price Index increased 6.8% in June versus the previous year, and China\u2019s Caixin Global purchasing managers\u2019 index reported activity expansion.\n\nThus, strong economic indicators have heightened investors\u2019 expectations of further tightening measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s suggestion of two more interest rate hikes in 2023, coupled with the increasing cost of capital and higher returns on fixed-income investments, have diminished interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the most pressing news and events included:\n\nJune 28: European Union lawmakers moved ahead with the controversial Data Act, imposing requirements for smart contracts, including kill switches, that allow them to be safely terminated and rules for providing shareable data.\n\nEuropean Union lawmakers moved ahead with the controversial Data Act, imposing requirements for smart contracts, including kill switches, that allow them to be safely terminated and rules for providing shareable data. July 4: Binance Australia had its corporate offices searched by local authorities, part of an ongoing probe of its derivatives business, whose license was shut down in April 2023.\n\nTVL nears three-year lows as network demand falls\n\nThe Ethereum network is likely facing its own challenges, particularly after co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated on June 29 that he does not stake all of his Ether due to the complexities associated with multisignature wallets.\n\nEthereum network total smart contract deposits in ETH terms. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL), which measures the deposits locked in Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 3.1% to 13.7 million Ether in the 30 days leading up to July 4, according to DefiLlama.\n\nA lower TVL means either investors are losing interest in the network\u2019s smart contract use or have moved to layer-2 alternatives in search of lower transaction fees. Either way, the potential demand for the Ethereum network is negatively impacted, which is being interpreted as bearish.\n\nETH price gains fueled by leveraged longs\n\nAnalyzing the positions of professional traders in ETH derivatives is crucial to determining the likelihood of Ether\u2019s price surpassing the $1,970 resistance level.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nETH top traders' futures long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nDespite Ether trading within a narrow range of $1,815 to $1,975 since June 22, professional traders have increased their leveraged long positions in futures, as indicated by the long-to-short ratio.\n\nAt crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short ratio sharply increased, from 1.14 on June 20 to 1.30 on July 4. Similarly, at OKX, the long-to-short ratio increased from 0.76 on June 20 to a 2.25 peak on July 4, favoring leveraged longs.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew flirted with moderate optimism between July 3 and July 4 but was unable to sustain such a level. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for call and put options.\n\nRelated: The Supreme Court could stop the SEC\u2019s war on crypto\n\nETH at $1,700 might be distant, but so is $2,000\n\nConsidering these four reasons \u2014 namely, increased leverage long-to-short ratio, declining TVL, potential interest rate increases and tighter cryptocurrency regulation \u2014 ETH bears are in a better position to hold back the positive price impact coming from the Bitcoin ETF saga.\n\nAlthough these factors may not be sufficient to drive ETH\u2019s price down to $1,700, they present significant obstacles for ETH bulls. Notably, the previous attempt to break $2,000 on April 13 lasted less than a week. Therefore, in the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending the $1,970 resistance.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Will liquid staking cause Ethereum to succumb to the forces of centralization? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Liquid staking. It\u2019s one of the few hot spaces in crypto right now, Mike Ippolito says.\n\nThe freedom to tap into DeFi with wrapped tokens made available in exchange for staking ETH is a relatively novel concept that, although highly popular in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, did not originate there.\n\nFirst conceived in the Cosmos app chain ecosystem, the innovation took off in Ethereum\u2019s community \u2014 at least partly out of fear that centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance would hold too much staking power in a few massive pools.\n\n\u201cOne of the early core propositions when Ethereum was switching from proof-of-work chain to a proof-of-stake chain was they wanted to make sure that it didn\u2019t get concentrated,\u201d explains Ippolito, the host of the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple).\n\n\u201cSo what they wanted to do was make sure that didn\u2019t happen by not selecting a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism\u201d whereby only a few entities would control the network.\n\nDominant liquid staking protocols such as Lido have \u201coverruled that design decision,\u201d he says. Now, a form of delegated proof-of-staking is effectively provided through the Lido protocol, rather than via an Ethereum-intrinsic mechanism, according to Ippolito.\n\nAssociate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie Myles O\u2019Neil explains, \u201cEthereum looked at Cosmos and did not want a validator set of 100, 150 or 200. Ethereum wanted hundreds of thousands of validators and they wanted them to be individuals.\u201d\n\nBut because of the barriers and technical challenges of becoming validators, staking via centralized exchange services became an attractive solution to holders, he says.\n\n\u201cYou no longer had this 32 ETH minimum. You no longer had to set up your own hardware. You could actually have liquidity,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could actually sell your ETH on the centralized exchange while getting staking rewards.\u201d\n\nA handful of exchanges could then \u201ccapture the majority of the network through retail delegating,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that would be an even worse outcome than having 100 or 200 validators.\u201d\n\nLido to the rescue?\n\nWhen Cosmos developers were first looking at the possibilities of liquid staking, Ethereum was already enjoying the beginnings of a vibrant DeFi scene.\n\n\u201cBut they had this existential risk,\u201d O\u2019Neil explains, \u201cthat before the beacon chain even launched officially, it would be controlled by a handful of centralized exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why the idea took off on Ethereum when it actually originated in Cosmos.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers were trying to design a system \u201cthat couldn\u2019t be captured by a couple of large, deep-pocketed actors,\u201d Ippolito explains, but instead would be secured by \u201cgeographically-spread individual solo-stakers.\u201d\n\nLido, it seemed, was the solution to the centralization risk.\n\nBut the remedy has become too successful, it seems. Lido now dominates the liquid staking market. Ippolito says the centralized control that Lido could now potentially exert is equally concerning in the popular consciousness of Ethereum natives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a very core function of Ethereum \u2014 which is how it secures itself through staking \u2014 and made it subject to a different set of security properties and governance sets.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompounding network effects lead to what is likely going to be a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market structure,\u201d O\u2019Neil says.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve already started to see that on Ethereum in particular.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Will ERC 6551 transform Ethereum metaverses with NFT-owned wallets? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The proposed ERC 6551 token standard for NFTs is generating interest among crypto enthusiasts, as it would enable digital assets to own other tokens, a development that could significantly transform the NFT and metaverse landscape.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Shin on a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Benny Giang and Jayden Windle, two of the authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for ERC 6551, stated this new standard allows NFTs to own other tokens, essentially equipping them with their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nWhat is ERC 6551?\n\nThe token standard proposal, introduced in February, focuses on creating a system that assigns every ERC-721 (non-fungible token) a smart contract account. This will allow these tokens to own assets and interact with applications without changing existing ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure.\n\nThis system comprises two main components: a permissionless registry for deploying token-bound accounts and a standard implementation interface.\n\nThe registry will deploy a unique smart contract account for each ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token-bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\n\nThe proposal seeks to be maximally backward compatible with existing non-fungible token contracts. It also uses EIP-155 chain IDs to uniquely identify ERC-721 tokens, allowing for optional support of multi-chain token-bound accounts.\n\nDeveloper reaction\n\nThe initial developer discussion for the proposal centered on potential security implications, such as the risk of duplicating registries and the need for trust verification. Suggestions included creating a registry for broad registration of account Implementations and making the proposal\u2019s registry canonical due to its permissionless nature.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s potential implications for reducing airdrop costs were also highlighted, along with a discussion that also raised security worries about adding metadata to the NFT registry.\n\nMore recently, with over 160 comments from Ethereum developers, concerns were raised about the proposal still being in the \u2018Draft\u2019 status, potentially subjecting it to significant changes. Finally, there were discussions about finalizing the naming of functions and the potential impacts on those implementing the EIP.\n\nBenefits of ERC 6551\n\nAs Giang explained on the Unchained Podcast, ERC 6551 was sparked by a simple query \u2013\n\n\u201cWhat if we had a project that was an NFT project that had a character, and sometimes we call this a PFP (Profile Picture) project, right? Our main question was like, why can\u2019t you change the clothing or the aesthetic of this PFP character?\u201d\n\nThis question led to the inception of the ERC 6551 standard, allowing NFTs to own other tokens, essentially giving them their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nGiang further added,\n\n\u201cDo you pursue the off-chain way where you build a database, and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the NFT? Or you go the on-chain way, which is like every item an NFT can be applicable on-chain as a transaction. So through this kind of journey, as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months, we realized that there was a potential solution.\u201d\n\nGiang and Windle also discussed the pros and cons of pursuing the on-chain or off-chain method for applying every item an NFT could own as a transaction.\n\nThey concluded that the ERC 6551 standard was a potential solution to the limitations presented by previous attempts to standardize NFTs owning assets, such as the necessity for custom logic in their smart contract. The ERC 6551 standard overcomes these restrictions, granting NFTs the same rights as Ethereum users, allowing them to own assets and take action.\n\nThe podcast guests also highlighted that while ERC 721, ERC 1155, and soul-bound tokens exist as ways to own items on Ethereum, ERC 6551 is not a token standard in the traditional sense because it gives every existing ERC 721 its own wallet, thus unlocking a new layer of compatibility for NFTs.\n\nUse cases of ERC 6551\n\nThe implementation of ERC 6551 has created exciting prospects across various industries, according to the EIP authors. It allows NFTs to own assets and perform actions autonomously, potentially beneficial in gaming, DAOs, infrastructure and tooling, and social networks.\n\nGiang mentioned several projects like \u2018Sapiens,\u2019 \u2018Fuel Worlds,\u2019 and \u2018Parallel Trading Card Game,\u2019 leveraging the standard for gamification. Giang commented, \u201cIt makes a lot of sense for a decentralized game inventory.\u201d Such games, thus, allow characters to have their own wallets and act independently in the game.\n\nAccording to Giang, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, such as \u2018Station\u2019 and \u2018Dow House,\u2019 are also exploring this standard to monitor engagement within their communities. Further, the infrastructure and tooling industry, represented by \u2018Manifold,\u2019 \u2018Nosis Guild,\u2019 and \u2018Rabbit Hole,\u2019 are reportedly working on modules around the standard.\n\nGiang suggested a future in which NFTs could become Network Playable Characters (NPCs), digital entities that can perform on-chain actions controlled by either a human or an AI model. This could potentially resolve the \u201cempty world problem\u201d observed in many digital worlds.\n\nThe ERC-6551 proposal, as explained by Jayden Windle, is simple.\n\n\u201cA token-bound account, under this standard, is its own type of wallet. Thus, an NFT can have a unique wallet address that can own any assets \u2014 a concept that Windle describes \u2018gets pretty fractal pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nUnder this standard, a token-bound account is its own type of wallet. Therefore, an NFT can have a unique wallet address to own assets. However, it is important to note that while any Ethereum wallet can control an NFT\u2019s wallet, the ownership of the token-bound account will always be owned by the NFT.\n\nIf approved, the advent and application of the ERC 6551 standard could mark a significant development, expanding the functionality of NFTs and enhancing their utility.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It introduced a new programming language called Solidity, which allows for the creation of custom tokens and assets on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum assets can represent various types of digital and physical assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. These assets are implemented using Ethereum\u2019s native token standard called the ERC-20 standard, although other token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are also used for specific purposes.\n\nERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning they can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. They follow a set of rules and specifications defined in the ERC-20 standard, which ensures interoperability and compatibility between different Ethereum assets. These tokens can be traded, transferred, and stored just like any other cryptocurrency on Ethereum-compatible wallets and exchanges.\n\nUtility tokens are one of the most common types of Ethereum assets. They represent digital assets that provide access to specific products, services, or platforms. For example, utility tokens can grant access to DApps, allow users to purchase goods or services, or offer special privileges within a particular ecosystem.\n\nSecurity tokens, on the other hand, are a type of Ethereum asset that represents ownership in an underlying asset or company. They are designed to comply with relevant securities regulations, providing legal and regulatory compliance in the issuance and trading of tokenized securities. Security tokens can represent shares of a company, ownership in real estate, investment funds, or other traditional financial instruments.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are indivisible and distinguishable from each other. They can represent digital collectibles, artwork, virtual real estate, in-game items, and more. NFTs have gained significant attention and popularity due to their ability to provide verifiable ownership and scarcity in the digital world.\n\nEthereum assets have gained prominence due to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s robustness, security, and the large developer community that supports the platform. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality allows for the creation of sophisticated decentralized applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and various innovative use cases.\n\nEthereum assets can be created and issued through smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. They automatically enforce the terms of an agreement and facilitate the issuance, distribution, and management of Ethereum assets.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while Ethereum assets offer exciting possibilities, investors and users should exercise caution and perform due diligence when dealing with them. As with any investment or digital asset, there are risks involved, such as price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, security vulnerabilities, and the potential for scams or fraudulent projects. It is advisable to research and understand the project, its team, and the underlying technology before engaging with Ethereum assets.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum 2.0 The Evolution of a Blockchain Giant: Scalability And Sustainability\n\nImportance of Ethereum Assets for the Economy\n\nEthereum assets play a significant role in the economy by facilitating a wide range of financial activities, enabling new business models, and fostering innovation. Here are some key points highlighting the importance of Ethereum assets for the economy:\n\n1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum assets have been instrumental in the growth of DeFi. DeFi refers to a set of financial applications and protocols built on blockchain networks that aim to provide open, transparent, and decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems. Ethereum assets power various DeFi applications such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, stablecoins, yield farming, and more. DeFi has the potential to increase financial inclusion, reduce intermediaries, and offer new investment opportunities.\n\n2. Tokenization of Assets: Ethereum assets enable the tokenization of real-world assets, including traditional financial instruments, real estate, art, intellectual property, and more. Tokenization represents the process of converting these physical assets into digital tokens that can be easily traded, divided, and accessed by a global audience. Tokenization has the potential to enhance liquidity, fractionalize ownership, streamline transactions, and enable new investment avenues.\n\n3. Crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Ethereum assets have facilitated the emergence of new fundraising models. Through ICOs, projects can raise capital by issuing and selling their tokens directly to the public. This has democratized access to funding, allowing individuals worldwide to participate in early-stage investment opportunities. Ethereum\u2019s programmable smart contracts enable transparent and auditable distribution of tokens and funds, providing greater accountability and trust.\n\n4. Innovation and DApp Development: Ethereum assets have fueled the growth of decentralized applications (DApps) and spurred innovation in various sectors. Developers can create DApps that utilize Ethereum assets to offer new services, products, and experiences. This includes areas such as gaming, digital collectibles, supply chain management, identity verification, decentralized social networks, and more. Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature and extensive developer community contribute to a vibrant ecosystem that fosters continuous innovation.\n\n5. Interoperability and Standards: Ethereum assets adhere to token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, which provide interoperability across different projects and platforms. These standards ensure that Ethereum assets can be easily integrated into wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain-based services. This interoperability enhances liquidity, ease of use, and the overall ecosystem\u2019s efficiency.\n\n6. Global Accessibility: Ethereum assets are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their geographic location or financial background. This opens up economic opportunities for individuals in underserved regions, enables cross-border transactions without traditional intermediaries, and promotes financial inclusion. Ethereum assets can be transferred quickly and securely, reducing friction in global financial transactions.\n\n7. Programmability and Automation: Ethereum assets are programmable through smart contracts, allowing for the automation of financial processes and agreements. This programmability enhances efficiency, reduces the need for intermediaries, and enables the creation of complex financial instruments and protocols. Smart contracts facilitate self-executing agreements and ensure that transactions occur only when predefined conditions are met, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing trust.\n\nOverall, Ethereum assets have transformed the economic landscape by introducing decentralized financial systems, enabling new fundraising models, promoting innovation, and expanding access to financial services. They provide individuals and businesses with new opportunities for investment, collaboration, and value creation, paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient global economy.\n\nAlso read: How Does Ethereum In Casino Work?\n\nTop 10 Types of Ethereum Assets\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).

They are often used in initial coin offerings (ICOs) to raise capital for new businesses. Tokenized assets: Tokenized assets are assets that have been digitized and represented as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows them to be traded and managed more easily. These are just a few of the many different types of Ethereum assets that exist. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, we can expect to see even more types of assets being created on the platform.\n\nRisks associated with Ethereum Assets\n\nWhile Ethereum assets offer numerous opportunities, it\u2019s important to be aware of the risks involved. Here are some key risks associated with Ethereum assets:\n\n1. Price Volatility: Ethereum assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, are known for their price volatility. Their values can fluctuate significantly in short periods due to market speculation, investor sentiment, regulatory announcements, technological developments, or macroeconomic factors. This volatility can lead to substantial gains or losses for investors.\n\n2. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding Ethereum assets is still evolving. Different jurisdictions have varying views and regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, security tokens, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and other forms of digital assets. Regulatory changes or crackdowns can impact the legality, trading, and usage of Ethereum assets, leading to compliance challenges and potential loss of value.\n\n3. Security Vulnerabilities: Ethereum assets are exposed to security risks inherent in blockchain technology. Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum are not immune to vulnerabilities or coding errors. Exploits, hacks, or bugs can result in the loss or theft of assets, unauthorized access, or manipulation of transactions. Users must exercise caution and perform due diligence when interacting with Ethereum assets and platforms.\n\n4. Scams and Fraudulent Projects: The decentralized nature of Ethereum and the absence of strict regulations make it easier for fraudulent projects and scams to emerge. Investors may encounter fraudulent ICOs, fake projects, Ponzi schemes, or phishing attempts that aim to deceive users and steal their assets. It is crucial to research projects thoroughly, verify the credibility of the teams, and exercise caution when investing or participating in token sales.\n\n5. Network Congestion and Scalability: Ethereum\u2019s network has faced challenges with scalability, leading to network congestion and increased transaction fees during periods of high demand. This congestion can result in delays or increased costs for users when transacting with Ethereum assets. Additionally, as Ethereum continues to upgrade its infrastructure (e.g., Ethereum 2.0), there may be uncertainties and potential disruptions during the transition.\n\n6. Lack of Regulation and Investor Protection: The decentralized and global nature of Ethereum assets means that they operate outside traditional financial systems and lack the same level of investor protection and recourse mechanisms. Unlike traditional securities or financial instruments, Ethereum assets may not have the same legal frameworks, investor rights, or avenues for dispute resolution. Investors must understand the risks associated with investing in unregulated assets.\n\n7. Market Manipulation and Insider Trading: Cryptocurrency markets, including Ethereum assets, can be susceptible to market manipulation and insider trading. Illiquid markets, lack of transparency, and the presence of whales (entities holding large amounts of assets) can contribute to price manipulation, pump-and-dump schemes, and insider trading activities. Investors should exercise caution and be mindful of the potential for market manipulation.\n\n8. Technical Complexity and User Error: Interacting with Ethereum assets requires technical knowledge, proper security practices, and understanding of blockchain technology. Users may face challenges in setting up wallets, managing private keys, or executing transactions correctly. Mistakes, such as sending assets to the wrong addresses or mismanaging private keys, can result in irreversible loss of funds.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial for individuals interested in Ethereum assets to conduct thorough research, understand the associated risks, and exercise caution. It is advisable to consult with financial advisors, educate oneself on the underlying technology, and carefully assess the credibility and legitimacy of projects and platforms before engaging with Ethereum assets.\n\nAlso read: How To Secure Ethereum Assets- Top 10 Ways To Avoid Scams And Hacks\n\nFuture of Ethereum Assets\n\nThe future of Ethereum assets appears promising, as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and mature. Here are some key aspects that indicate the potential growth and development of Ethereum assets:\n\n1. Ethereum 2.0 and Scalability: Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. This upgrade aims to address scalability issues by transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. With Ethereum 2.0, the network\u2019s capacity to process transactions is expected to increase significantly, leading to improved scalability and reduced transaction fees. This upgrade will enable more efficient and cost-effective transactions for Ethereum assets.\n\n2. Improved Interoperability: Interoperability is a crucial factor for the future of Ethereum assets. Efforts are underway to enhance cross-chain compatibility and interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Protocols like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink are working towards creating bridges and interoperable solutions, allowing Ethereum assets to interact with assets on different blockchains. This expanded interoperability will increase liquidity, enhance functionality, and enable seamless movement of assets across multiple networks.\n\n3. Enhanced Privacy and Security: The Ethereum community recognizes the importance of privacy and security for its assets and users. Initiatives such as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and the development of privacy-focused technologies like zk-SNARKs and zero-knowledge proofs are being explored to enhance privacy and security in Ethereum transactions. These advancements will provide users with greater control over their data and assets while maintaining transparency and auditability.\n\n4. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: DeFi has experienced tremendous growth on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is likely to continue expanding. DeFi protocols offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges, and more. As DeFi matures, Ethereum assets will play a crucial role in supporting these protocols and enabling the decentralized and permissionless financial ecosystem. The integration of real-world assets through tokenization will further enhance the scope and utility of Ethereum assets within the DeFi space.\n\n5. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained significant attention and popularity, and Ethereum has been at the forefront of the NFT boom. NFTs represent unique digital assets, such as artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. The future of Ethereum assets includes continued innovation in the NFT space, with new applications, marketplaces, and use cases. NFTs have the potential to revolutionize areas like art ownership, gaming, virtual experiences, and intellectual property rights.\n\n6. Institutional Adoption: Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has been growing steadily. As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer and institutional frameworks and custodial services improve, more traditional financial institutions and corporations may embrace Ethereum assets. Institutional adoption can bring liquidity, stability, and further validation to the Ethereum ecosystem, attracting more users and investors.\n\n7. Layer 2 Solutions: Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions aim to address scalability and transaction speed challenges by offloading some transactional activities to secondary networks. Layer 2 solutions, such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups, can significantly increase the transaction capacity and efficiency of the Ethereum network. These solutions will enable faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum assets, making them more practical for everyday use and mass adoption.\n\n8. Regulatory Clarity: As the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies and digital assets becomes more defined, it is expected that clearer guidelines and regulations will emerge. Regulatory clarity can provide more certainty for users, investors, and businesses operating with Ethereum assets. It can also encourage institutional participation and foster responsible growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhile the future of Ethereum assets holds significant promise, it is important to note that the landscape is still evolving. Factors such as technological advancements, regulatory developments, market dynamics, and community consensus will shape the trajectory of Ethereum assets. Continued research, innovation, and community collaboration will play a crucial role in unlocking the full potential of Ethereum assets in the years to come.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Books To Learn About Ethereum To Understand Open- Source Blockchain"

        "content": "The smart contracts that account for the highest transaction fees on Ethereum are generally household names, so an unknown project topping the charts is an unusual event.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened this week when users racing to use a smart contract to mint a token called VMPX pushed gas prices on Ethereum to their highest levels since May.\n\nEthereum Users Have Been Burning ETH To Mint VMPX Tokens\n\nVMPX is an asset designed to connect the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, according to Jack Levin, the founder of the XEN ecosystem, a token with ties to VMPX.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing one of the first bridges between the world's largest crypto ecosystems, Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d he told The Defiant, adding that holders will be able to stake VMPX in order to earn fees when people transfer assets between the two blockchains.\n\nVMPX led all contracts in terms of burned ETH as of July 6, putting it ahead of typical gas guzzlers like Uniswap and the USDT stablecoin.\n\nEthereum Users Have Been Burning ETH To Mint VMPX Tokens\n\n$90M Burned\n\nProjects in the XEN ecosystem have spiked gas before.\n\nXENTorrent, another project in the ecosystem, accounted for 11% of gas usage in April. XEN also pushed ETH to become a deflationary asset in October 2022.\n\n\u201cI think in total, we burned about $90 million dollars worth of ETH so far,\u201d Levin said.\n\nXEN is an outlier as a project \u2014 while most crypto ventures tend to at least have some affiliation with a specific blockchain to begin with, XEN has been multichain from the start.\n\nIn fact, across major blockchains like Avalanche, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Fantom, XEN is either the number one or number two token in terms of how many addresses have sent or received it.\n\nThis week\u2019s mint was for a version of VMPX on Ethereum. A version of VMPX using the emerging Bitcoin standard called BRC-20 already exists and has a $7.8M market capitalization, according to BitX, an exchange and data provider.\n\nLevin said that he wanted to expand XEN to Bitcoin, but it wasn\u2019t feasible due to the blockchain\u2019s design. \u201cWe thought okay, we need to launch a XEN-like product, but it cannot be called XEN because it will not have the same economics,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimulated PoW\n\nLevin said that they wrote the code for VMPX\u2019s launch on Ethereum, to mimic how Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work system works.\n\nLike many projects in crypto, XEN and VMPX, are experimental, with utility that isn\u2019t entirely clear. Levin likened XEN to a currency in a game like Monopoly board game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a marketing token that gets you crypto without you needing to buy it from anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come to the smart contract and mint it yourself.\u201d\n\nNotably, XEN doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpremine,\u201d a preset amount of tokens allocated to investors and early contributors. \u201cWe wanted to go back to the roots of Bitcoin creation, which never had to raise any money,\u201d Levin said."

        "title": "Analyst Updates Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Targets, Predicts Coming 18 Months Will Be an \u2018Absolute Pleasure\u2019 - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The anonymous host of InvestAnswers is laying out bullish price targets for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, the host tells his 445,000 YouTube subscribers that he wouldn\u2019t be \u201csurprised\u201d if Bitcoin reaches $42,000 by April 2024.\n\nHis prediction is based on the behavior of the options market. According to InvestAnswers, the demand for Bitcoin\u2019s call options is higher than that of put options and this is \u201cvery bullish.\u201d\n\nCall options are contracts that give the holder the right to buy an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date while put options give the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a specific date.\n\n\u201cDecember 29, 2023 \u2013 and you can see here a huge amount of action at the $45,000 level\u2026\n\nOne thing I do want to cast your eye on is to put-call ratio \u2013 0.39. So a lot more calls are being bought than puts, which is very bullish.\n\nBut look at the amount of price action even there at $45,000, $44,000, $43,000, etc.\n\nI said many times before I would not be surprised if we saw $42,000 by April 2024 at the time of the halving. According to the [chart below], we could be there by Christmas \u2013 $45,000+. Again if these options actions\u2019 players are correct\u2026\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $30,560 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Ethereum, the pseudonymous analyst says that the put-call ratio of the second-largest crypto asset by market is sending an \u201cextremely bullish\u201d signal.\n\n\u201cYou can see a lot of call demand again at $2,500 for ETH, same date December 29, 2023.\n\nBut cast your eyes on the put-call ratio \u2013 0.21. That is extremely bullish. Nobody, pretty much nobody, is buying puts on Ethereum. Everybody expects it to go north at $2,000, up to $2,500 on average by Christmas. Some people have bets up there around $6,500 too.\n\nSo either way things happen fast, we don\u2019t know when. But the next five months will be fun guaranteed. And the next year after that. So we\u2019re going to have a year and a half of absolute pleasure here.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,913 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "It seemed like a perfectly believable story: Two teenagers in Canada posed as members of Coinbase\u2019s support team and scammed an American man out of $4.2 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing an email with a news release about the supposed arrest of the teenagers, a reporter from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC), one of Canada\u2019s leading news outlets, ran the since-deleted story, according to a member of the Hamilton Police Service familiar with the matter. (However, whether that email was the ultimate source for the story has yet to be determined.) The police in Hamilton, a city near the border of New York, reportedly teamed up with the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to pin down the two 17-year-olds, who went by the aliases \u201cFelon\u201d and \u201cGaze.\u201d\n\nNews of the arrest of the teenagers, who, according to reports, used some of their $4.2 million in stolen crypto to buy coveted username @zombie on Instagram, then spread across a number of crypto publications. However, the entire story\u2014from the teenagers\u2019 alleged heist to their arrest\u2014is a sham, according to the Hamilton Police Service.\n\n\u201c[We] can confirm this investigation did not occur and the email did not originate from the Hamilton Police Service,\u201d the police said in an official statement. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CBC has since removed its original story, and its URL now redirects to a new piece describing how its reporter received a hoax email.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has extensive security resources dedicated to educating customers about preventing phishing attacks and scams,\u201d a spokesperson for the exchange said in a statement. \u201cWe work with international law enforcement to ensure that anyone scamming Coinbase customers is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nWhile several publications were duped into running a lurid story of yet another crypto arrest, the theft as described would not have been the first of its kind.\n\nIn January 2018, in the village of Irvington, N.Y., 15-year-old Ellis Pinsky, nicknamed \u201cBaby Al Capone,\u201d allegedly stole almost $24 million from crypto millionaire Michael Terpin. Pinsky agreed to pay back Terpin without admitting any guilt.\n\nAnd the Hamilton Police Service itself has investigated and arrested a teenager for stealing almost $35 million in crypto through a SIM swap attack, or when scammers port a victim\u2019s phone number over to their devices to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nThe investigation and arrest, which happened in 2021, echoes the spoofed news release, including the Hamilton police partnership with the FBI and U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force as well as the stolen crypto being spent on a rare online username.\n\nUpdate, July 5, 2023: This article has been updated with an official comment from the Hamilton police as well as more information about the CBC."

        "title": "After Bitcoin's Hard Forks, Ethereum Classic (ETC) Enjoys an Uptrend Amidst Rising Momentum - Securities.io",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market traded lower on Wednesday, with Bitcoin going as low as $30,235 and Ether under $1,900. However, Thursday started on a bullish note, with Bitcoin surging to $31,480 and Ether jumping to almost $1,960 before retracing a bit.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $31,220, and Ether is at $1,940, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe volatility started the day prior after the release of the minutes from June\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that showed that almost all Fed officials \u201cjudged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.\u201d\n\nWith some Fed officially even favoring a rate hike in June, this hawkish tone put pressure on not just crypto but also stocks ahead of the June jobs report scheduled for release on Friday.\n\nRecent stress tests on banks showing that they are well-positioned to weather a severe recession and continue lending to qualified households may also propel FOMC to aggressively raise rates to bring down inflation without casting the US economy into recession.\n\nThe decline in Bitcoin price started during the July 4 holiday in the US, which resulted in July Bitcoin futures prices trading weaker in early trading on Wednesday, according to Kitco senior technical analyst Jim Wyckoff.\n\n\u201cThe current pause and choppy trading at higher price levels is not bearish and suggests the bulls are storing up energy for another push higher in the near term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage.\u201d\n\nOn the upside, Bitcoin has resistance around $34.4k, so if BTC does continue upwards, we can at least see it test $35k in the near future. Going higher would see a strong resistance zone around $37k, breaking which can see the price seek liquidity around $48k. But such spikes in price also increase the likelihood of a correction. This means testing the support levels below $30k.\n\nBullishness in the Market\n\nWhile the crypto sector started the day in the mix, derivatives markets have been signaling bullishness. Futures open interest (OI) for Bitcoin is now north of $12 billion, up from $10.4 billion at the beginning of June, albeit a bit lower than $13.4 billion on June 29, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nCrypto data provider CCData also revealed that institutional investors have been busy trading crypto futures, so much so that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) saw its best June for Bitcoin futures volumes, rising an astounding 28.6% to $37.9 billion. Eth-based instruments also saw a 10.8% increase, with over 97,000 ETH Futures contracts traded in June.\n\nThe USD value of the volume traded also jumped substantially, with BTC- and ETH-backed products collectively recording a 24.6% pump, with $46.8 billion changing hands \u2014 the highest number since May 2022.\n\nBitcoin has been enjoying gains since last month, when it first surged above $31k in mid-June following multiple spot Bitcoin ETF filings, and has remained mostly stable despite the positive investor sentiment. The unveiling of a quantitative easing program in China is another positive, while the crypto market sees increased regulatory clarity in Singapore, Korea, and Thailand.\n\nInterestingly, Prime Minister contender Pita Limjaroenrat, the leader of Thailand\u2019s Move Forward Party, has been found to hold crypto, according to disclosures filed. His thousands of dollars worth of crypto is split between BTC, ETH, BNB, and ADA.\n\nAmidst this, late on Wednesday, Larry Fink, the CEO of the $8.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock, gave the catalyst for the latest price action when he said in an interview that crypto \u201ccould revolutionize finance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities \u2013 that\u2019s what bitcoin is \u2014 it could revolutionize finance,\u201d said Fink, adding: \u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you\u2019re in, let\u2019s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it\u2019s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\u201d\n\nAs Bitcoin made attempts at recovery, altcoins experienced a sell-off, with Kaspa down the most among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by 8.3% in the past 24 hours. Radix, Fantom, Stellar, Gate, Woo Network, and Mina also recorded losses.\n\nMajor Forks Enjoying an Uptrend\n\nWhen it comes to the 24-hour gainers, the likes of FSX (8.6%), SOL (7.6%), CMOP (5.3%), PEPE (5.1%), Neo (4.2%), Monero (3.7%), and Maker (3%) are enjoying the greens. This has the total crypto market cap up by 2% to $1.256 trillion. However, it is the popular forks of the majors, Bitcoin and Ethereum, that are leading these performers.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been enjoying an uptrend for the past 15 days. During this period, the digital asset has rallied 180%. BCH is also up 11.5% against USD on Thursday to now trade at $295.60. BCH is also up 8.8% against BTC, and its trading volume soaring by 143.9% to $1.18 bln from a day ago.\n\nThese gains came as Bitcoin became the center of institutional attention as well as increasing BCH trading volumes on South Korean exchanges. Additionally, the launch of Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab-backed EDX Markets, which supports BCH along with BTC, ETH, and LTC, contributed to the uptrend.\n\nThe price action led traders betting against Bitcoin cash to lose the highest amount in over two years as BCH surged to the $320 level last week. According to Coinalyze data, shorts and longs cumulatively lost over $25 million on BCH-tracked futures, which may also have contributed to the sudden spike.\n\nThis week, funding rates have fallen negative across all exchanges that list BCH futures, indicating that short traders are willing to pay long traders to remain in their positions.\n\nBCH wasn\u2019t alone, though. Another Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin SV\u2019s (BSV) price, also jumped by 125% between June 20 and July 1. BSV is up 9.5% against USD and is currently trading at just above $46, while its trading volume increased by 12.30% to $40.6 mln. BSV is also in the green by 6.9% against BTC.\n\nJust like Bitcoin forks are enjoying an uptrend, Ethereum\u2019s fork Ethereum Classic (ETC) has also started rising in value.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Joins In\n\nETC is the 26th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $2.8 billion. And at the time of writing, ETC has been trading at $19.81, up 4.1% against USD, 1.6% against BTC, and 2.38% against ETH. During this period, the trading volume for the altcoin only increased by 0.3% to $140 million.\n\nIn the past week, the price of ETC has recorded 9% gains and 15.5% in the last two weeks. However, 2023 wasn\u2019t really a good year for this altcoin as ETC only registered gains of 25.73% so far this year. While the price did rise, the price has been stuck in the $15 to $24 range during this time.\n\nOver this past year, ETC jumped 31.2% while losing 88.14% of its value since hitting its all-time high (ATH) at $167 in May 2021.\n\nBesides the general positive momentum in the broad crypto market, ETC price may be rising in line with ETH, which is up 62% year-to-date (YTD), much like how BCH and BSV jumped alongside BTC. However, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 86.42% upside in 2023, BCH has rallied 205.7% and BSV 10.23%.\n\nETC is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain project that was created when the second-largest crypto, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, split into two separate chains in 2016. The split was due to a disagreement among members of its community regarding how to handle the massive hack on a decentralized Ethereum-based platform called \u201cThe DAO.\u201d\n\nA year after Ethereum was launched, the network saw one of its most successful ICOs, The DAO, which accumulated 11 million ETH from over 18,000 investors, and even got hacked. Many community members proposed rolling back the Ethereum blockchain to rescue the affected investors, while others argued that doing so would set the wrong precedent for future bailouts. The majority of the community voted to restore the lost funds through a hard fork, which split the chain into two separate networks.\n\nAfter the fork, the old chain became known as Ethereum Classic, which has a relatively small community and believes in the principle that \u201cCode is Law.\u201d When the split happened, those who held ETH received the exact same amount of ETC in their wallets for free. During the bull run of 2017, ETC\u2019s price went to hit its then peak of $42, only to crash as low as $3 during the following crypto-wide bear market.\n\nUnlike Ethereum, which doesn\u2019t have a hard cap on how many native tokens will be created, Ethereum Classic made changes to its monetary policy to be deflationary, meaning the number of tokens created decreases over time to make it a better store of value. ETC\u2019s supply is capped at 210.7 million, and its block reward declines by 20% every 5 million blocks.\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic remains a security concern. In August 2020, the blockchain suffered three 51% attacks in August 2020 with Terry Culver, CEO of ETC Labs, said at the time that the threat of 51% attacks on Proof of Work blockchains is a \u201cuniversal problem\u201d and introduced a series of \u201cdefensive mining measures.\u201d\n\nWhile ETC\u2019s price continues to see bursts of momentum whenever bullish sentiments return to the crypto market, Ethereum Classic continues to struggle with adoption. Much like how Bitcoin hard forks\u2019 activity and usage level is nowhere near the crypto king, ETC doesn\u2019t enjoy a considerable use case or user base either.\n\nThat said, ETC closed off June with a 13% increase in price, and if Ethereum Classic manages to keep up with this momentum, it can surge even more in July. On the other hand, if selling pressure prevails instead, the ETC price could drop to the $18 level.\n\nClick here to learn how to buy Ethereum Classic (ETC) in just four steps."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOften coined \"the art blockchain,\" Tezos has earned this reputation thanks to at least one key platform.\n\nNow, though, fxhash is set to also join the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nFxhash lets users create new iterations of generative artwork, with artists limiting the number of mints for their work. Collectors discover the specific iteration they've acquired at the reveal, adding a unique aspect to the process of collecting generative art.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision to expand fxhash to the Ethereum blockchain marks a significant step in the platform's evolution. Initially, fxhash chose the Tezos blockchain for its appealing proof-of-stake consensus, especially when Ethereum was still using proof-of-work.\n\nThe work of digital artist Zancan. Image: fxhash.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming launch of fxhash 2.0, the platform is set to become multichain, a move influenced by requests from its partners for expansion beyond Tezos.\n\nThe implementation of fxhash 2.0 aims to break down the barriers that currently exist between chains. At present, artists can often sell their artworks at significantly higher prices on Ethereum, which also offers greater visibility for artists.\n\n\"By bringing communities together and showing artworks side by side, regardless of the chain they were minted on, we aim to elevate generative art,\" Charlie Middleton, the creative director at fxhash, told Decrypt. \u201cThe chain doesn't matter. It's the art that matters.\"\n\nThe platform was initially started by the artist Ciphrd. As a generative artist, he felt difficult to find a platform that could properly showcase his work. This struggle led him to create fxhash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince then, it has been highly community-focused.\n\nThis plays a significant role in decision-making processes, too, particularly with the upcoming fxhash 2.0.\n\n\"fxhash is the largest live repository of Generative Art, as such we can never stand still, but need to provide Artists with a wide variety of tools that we are continuously adding to in close communication with our community,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cfxhash 2.0 is a natural consequence of that, and something our team, our partners, the community, and most importantly artists are incredibly excited about.\"\n\n2 million pieces of art on fxhash\n\nThe platform boasts a diverse array of talented artists, including Zancan, William Mapan, Iskra Velitchkova, Melissa Wiederrecht, Andreas Rau, and Kim Asendorf.\n\nSome have gained significant popularity, with Zancan's \"Garden, Monoliths\" collection, for instance, racking up over 1.2 million XTZ in secondary market sales.\n\nAs of now, fxhash hosts around 8,000 artists or users who have minted at least one token, and it showcases two million pieces of generative art. The platform has facilitated the movement of approximately $40 million to $45 million, with the lion's share of this amount going to the artists.\n\nThe team at fxhash is currently hard at work on the Ethereum integration, with the launch of fxhash 2.0 slated for after the summer.\n\nThis will likely come with a UI and UX overhaul, too, and there are plans for events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Right now we've got our sights focused on an event happening in Berlin, which is related to the hackathon we've just started,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cAs we get closer to the launch, we'll have a clearer idea of what we can plan.\"\n\nIn a world where the chain often matters more than the art, fxhash is striving to shift the focus back to where it belongs: on the artists and their creations.\n\n\"Our goal was always to build tools allowing artists and collectors to live out their passion for generative art,\u201d fxhash COO Paul Viktor Schmidt told Decrypt. \u201cWe have always prioritized pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and will continue to do so.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Set to Surpass $2,000: Staking on The Rise - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Contrary to expectations, the Shanghai upgrade has not triggered an exodus of users, but rather a surge in staking deposits on Ethereum. In fact, it looks like ETH may be ready to take on the $2,000 mark, at least in the short term.\n\nStaking Activity On The Rise\n\nAccording to recent data from blockchain firm Glassnode, Ethereum staking has been soaring in recent months. Following the Shanghai upgrade, daily staking deposits skyrocketed from 460 to an impressive 8,108.\n\nThis surge in activity was especially noticeable on June 2, when a staggering 13,595 deposits were recorded. These figures indicate a growing trend of investors opting to stake their Ethereum, showing increased confidence in the network\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nOne notable player in the Ethereum staking landscape is Lido Finance. Lido Finance offers liquid staking services, where users deposit Ethereum into a protocol that pools it with other users\u2019 deposits and stakes it on their behalf. In return, users receive stETH, a token representing their staked position.\n\nLido has garnered attention due to its significant footprint in the network\u2019s staking pools. However, concerns about centralization have been raised as Lido\u2019s pools expand.\n\nLido is Hot\n\nDespite calls for action, Lido\u2019s dominance remains intact. Its supply of Staked Ethereum (stETH) recently reached a new all-time high of 7.49 million stETH, surpassing other pools.\n\nGlassnode highlights that Lido\u2019s supply is approximately 16 times larger than RocketPool (461,000 stETH); however, it has not observed a significant increase in new users.\n\nAdditionally, there have been interesting shifts in stETH\u2019s presence within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. stETH\u2019s collateral usage in lending protocols has seen an uptick, suggesting that investors are strategically maximizing their staking yields.\n\nOn the other hand, stETH\u2019s liquidity in certain DEX pools has decreased, with a 39% drop in the largest stETH-ETH Curve Pool.\n\nSpike in Whale Activity\n\nAs the price of ETH increased over the last week, there has been a noticeable rise in whale transactions. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that ETH whales doubled their transaction counts over a few days, with the total number of transactions increasing from 2,120 to 3,230 in just 48 hours. Within 7 days, approximately $20 billion has been moved by ETH whales.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s whale wallets account for 42% of its total wallets, whereas Bitcoin\u2019s whale holders make up only 11% of its total holder base.\n\nWhile the high number of whale transactions can potentially affect the price of Ethereum, the recent data shows the opposite. The price of ETH has remained relatively stable and maintained its support at around $1,900. It suggests these whales may be moving their coins without immediate selling intentions.\n\nDespite the increased whale activity, Ethereum\u2019s trading activities have decreased significantly. Trading volume was down 27% on Monday.\n\nDencun Upgrade: Ethereum\u2019s Next Milestone\n\nEthereum is eyeing the upcoming Dencun upgrade, set to be implemented within the year. This upgrade combines the consensus upgrade (Deneb) and the execution upgrade (Cancun) with a primary focus on EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding.\n\nEIP-4844 aims to minimize gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem by breaking down transaction data into smaller parts called \u201cblobs.\u201d This reduction in gas fees is particularly beneficial when using Rollup solutions.\n\nOptimistic Rollup solutions are estimated to cost 3-8 times less than Layer-1 transactions, while ZK-Rollup solutions achieve even greater efficiency with gas levels 40-100 times lower than Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1.\n\nThe adoption of the blob model not only reduces gas fees but also helps optimize the Data Availability problem faced by rollups. Successfully implementing this approach is a significant step towards Ethereum\u2019s future Sharding ambitions.\n\nThe Dencun rollout has the potential to fuel further growth within the Ethereum ecosystem. The upgrade is expected to bring improvements and optimizations that can enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness."

Blockchain is high on the agenda for the state secretary.\n\n\u201cI think that even before the end of the year, we will have other countries joining, probably even before the end of the summer,\u201d Michel said. \u201cEurope could go further if everybody looked in the same direction.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: \u2018This is not a Big Brother project\u2019: EU proposal for digital euro faces privacy and sovereignty fears\n\nThis year, each country is to invest \u20ac50,000 in the blockchain project.

All together, the bare-bone budget adds up to just under \u20ac1 million for the coming year and a half.\n\nFor Michel, one million is not enough, but it\u2019s a start. He is hopeful seeing as Belgium, he says, has a \u20ac1 billion yearly budget for digitalising its economy and administration. Blockchain could help streamline the digitalisation process, he said.\n\nCredibility\n\nBelgium ranked at the bottom of the European Commission\u2019s annual Digital Economy and Society Index report in 2022, which Michel deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to restore our credibility and boost our foreign investments, we must react quickly,\u201d Michel previously responded to the news.\n\nNOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in\n\nMichel hopes that by the end of next year, every European Union member state will be working on the blockchain infrastructure project.\n\nIn full capacity, legal administration for companies would be simplified into smart contracts where data can be seamlessly transferred between states.\n\nVerified profiles\n\nProperty titles and driving licences would be verified on the blockchain.

        "content": "EIP-7265 Would Allow DeFi Protocols To Delay Or Revert Sudden Token Outflows\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum developers have proposed a circuit breaker mechanism that would halt token outflows exceeding a predetermined limit as a security measure.\n\nEIP-7265 would allow developers to specify the value of withdrawals that triggers the circuit breaker, and whether that takes the form of delayed settlement after a cooldown or completely revert attempted outflows. The feature could prevent hackers from immediately draining the assets of exploited DeFi protocols and protect users against losses.\n\nThe proposal has garnered support on Github. However, Enbang Wu, a smart contract auditor, suggested adding a timelock function to protect users against administrators abusing ERC-7625. A timelock would give users a grace period to withdraw their assets in the event an administrator suddenly changes the circuit breaker\u2019s limit.\n\n\u201cThe proposed standard is agnostic to what the admin is\u2026 it could, for a given app, be decentralized, [or] only operate on a timeline,\u201d replied Daniel Goldman, a software developer. \u201cI don't think the standard itself needs to be opinionated on this.\u201d\n\nThe proposed ElP comes as core developers are working to ship Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade, Dencun, which is tipped to bolster the scalability of Layer 2 rollups by orders of magnitude.\n\nOn July 1, FLCL, an Ethereum developer at Nethermind, tweeted that the seventh closed devnet for EIP-4844, the core proposal included in Dencun, was live and stable. EIP-4844 improves data efficiency on Layer 2 by replacing bandwidth-intensive \u201ccalldata\u201d with lightweight blobs.\n\n\u201cGreat to see [Devnet 7] stable for over 9,000 blocks,\u201d said Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei podcast. \u201cThis is [EIP-]4844 running live on a devnet.\u201d\n\nCombined transactions on Layer 2 are currently outpacing mainnet by 250%, according to L2beat.\n\nLayer 2 and Ethereum mainnet transaction volume over 12 months\n\nMEV Sector Expands\n\nOn July 1, Toni Wahrstatter, an Ethereum researcher, tweeted data showing more than 95% of blocks are processed through MEV-Boost, software allowing validators to earn extra rewards from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Eigenphi, an MEV data aggregator, estimates MEV bots made off with $1M in profits over the past week.\n\nThe data also shows the dominance of Flashbots, the MEV research team that developed MEV-Boost, dropped to 22% after peaking at around 70% last November. Ultra Sound is now the top relayer with 30%.\n\nMarket share of MEV-Boost relayers\n\nFlashbots drew criticism last year after confirming it complies with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions blacklisting wallets associated with the Ethereum-based coin mixing protocol, Tornado Cash. Flashbots responded by open-sourcing aspects of its code, allowing developers to design MEV-Boost relayers that disregard the sanctions.\n\nAccording to Mev Watch, only 27% of blocks now comply with U.S. sanctions, down from a high of 79% last November."

        "content": "VMPX, a newly launched ERC-20 token, is responsible for over 30% of all Ethereum (ETH) burns in the last 24 hours, according to data from Ultrasound.money.\n\nSoftware engineer 0xCygaar first called attention to the project, claiming its minting contract had no purpose except to increase the network\u2019s overall gas usage.\n\n\u201cThe top ETH gas guzzler is this contract where users make validators run useless/unnecessary code just to increase overall gas usage. People are literally burning their money to increase gas fees for everyone else.\u201d\n\nQedk, a smart contract engineer at Polygon (MATIC), confirmed this, adding that the ERC-20 token would make users spend more gas if they want to mint more tokens.\n\nAccording to tweets from the project founder, Jack Levin, VMPX is the first ever BRC-20 token linked to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token. The project\u2019s website states that its supply is 108.62 million but fails to provide additional information about its utility.\n\nVMPX consumed nearly $3M in gas fees\n\nMeanwhile, Etherscan data shows that the VMPX mint contract consumed over 1,500 ETH, around $3 million, in gas fees during the last 24 hours. This represents around 30% of all the gas fees spent during the period, above those generated by the Uniswap (UNI) decentralized exchange.\n\nHarrison, the co-founder of PopPunk, pointed out that those who minted the token paid gas fees as high as 1.36ETH.\n\nEigenPhi, a DeFi data platform, corroborated Harrison\u2019s statement, adding that an average mint transaction of VMPX was 0.167ETH, around $317 per tx.\n\nThis high network activity saw Ethereum network fees jump to as high as 76.3 Gwei during the reporting period, according to Ultrasound.money.\n\nA representative from Push Protocol, the Ethereum messaging service, told CryptoSlate:\n\nGas fees still play a vital role in interacting with Ethereum and is probably one of the reason projects are moving to L2s or prefering off-chain yet verifiable executions.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Transfers Over 25,000 ETH To Exchange: Massive Dip On The Horizon? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price seems to have been following Bitcoin\u2019s, but recent large transactions suggest it may soon move independently.\n\nWhale Alert reported a sum of 25,264 ETH, roughly valued at around $48 million, was moved from an unidentified wallet to the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase.\n\nAnalyzing The Potential Impact\n\nWhile these large transfers can, on occasion, herald an upcoming uptrend, they can also imply a short-term surge in volatility. Particularly, such movements can be used to discern possible price sentiment changes.\n\nIn addition to the 25,264 ETH transferred, another substantial transaction of 30,000 ETH was also noted. This amount was relocated from an anonymous wallet to OKEX, another prominent crypto exchange.\n\nNotably, as with any financial market, the crypto industry is impacted by many factors, with \u2018whale\u2019 movements being just one of them. While they can potentially influence price sentiment, other elements, such as broader market trends, global economic indicators, and investor sentiment, should also be considered for a holistic market understanding.\n\nEthereum Latest Price Action\n\nThiese Ethereum transactions come at a time when ETH has been trading between an intra-day high of $1,957.35 and an intra-day low of $1,872.94. At the time of writing, Ethereum has only seen a slight decline of 1.4% in the past day, with a market price of $1,884.\n\nThis modest plunge indicates whales might not have moved or sold just a small amount of the ETH deposited. Notably, a \u2018whale\u2019 in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity holding a large amount of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThis individual or entity has the potential to influence the market due to the sizeable volume of its holdings. When such transfers occur, they can create waves in the market and often signal potential price shifts.\n\nOver the past week, Ethereum has seen more than a $3 billion surge in its market capitalization. The second largest asset by market cap has surged from the $223 billion seen last Thursday to $226 billion. ETH\u2019s daily trading volume has also surged significantly in the same period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily trading volume has soared from $6 billion last week to above $12 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\n\u2018Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees!\u2019 You couldn\u2019t have reached your twenties without listening to this phrase at least once! It is still used as a cautionary reminder to instill some financial responsibility in young people. However, it\u2019s time to debunk this notion!\n\nWhile there may not be a literal \u201cmoney plant,\u201d there are indeed ways to cultivate wealth. All it takes is choosing the right path. In this article, we will assist you in making that choice by explaining how to generate $100 per day through crypto passive income using Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Caged Beasts (BEASTS).\n\nBuild Your Wealth with Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) requires no introduction in the world of cryptocurrencies, as it holds the position of the second-largest crypto with a market capitalization of $225 billion. What do you think has contributed to Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth in value? The answer is simple: it\u2019s potential to generate high returns on investment and provide various avenues for passive income. Among the most profitable methods is staking ETH tokens.\n\nETH tokens hold significant value in the crypto market, making staking them a highly rewarding endeavour. It offers an impressive annual percentage yield of approximately 6.3% \u2013 7.31%. By selecting a reputable and credible crypto platform for staking your Ethereum tokens, you can even earn an additional 1 or 2% yield.\n\nAlways remember that staking cryptocurrencies yields greater returns compared to depositing money in traditional banks. Furthermore, the yield for staking increases based on the market value of ETH tokens, providing you with an opportunity to earn significantly more through saving rather than solely relying on trading!\n\nEasy Way to Earn More with Solana\n\nIf you think that Ethereum tokens are beyond your financial reach, don\u2019t worry! There are numerous alternatives available in the crypto realm, and one of them is Solana (SOL)\u2014a blockchain platform with a focus on web3 infrastructure.\n\nThe current valuation of the Web3 blockchain market stands at $2.86 billion and is projected to reach $116 billion in the next 10 years. Therefore, owning Solana tokens would be a wise decision, at least for the next decade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore how to earn passive income using Solana. Once again, staking takes a prominent position. A year ago, the renowned crypto exchange platform Binance offered a 9-13% annual percentage yield (APY) for SOL staking, while Phantom offered a slightly lower range of 6-7%. Additionally, SOL lending yielded a 3.6% return.\n\nAlthough the yield values have decreased slightly over the past year, as Web3 technology continues to grow, the value of SOL tokens will also increase, multiplying the yield value for staking SOL.\n\nLet the Beasts Make Money for You\n\nCaged Beasts is an innovative crypto project that is about to launch its presale very soon. This exciting new meme coin has been making a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its captivating storyline, community-driven approach, and generous referral program.\n\nThe Caged Beasts team is dedicating their time and effort to creating engaging competitions, events, and special offers that will attract more customers to join their brand-new community.\n\nAs a first step in this direction, the Caged Beasts team has introduced a referral program that grants a 20% bonus to both the user and their referral. Let\u2019s say your referral invests $500, you will receive a $100 commission, and your referral will also earn bonus tokens worth $100. This means both of you will benefit and potentially become wealthier at the same time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEarning $100 per day in crypto passive income is achievable, but it does require a significant investment. However, if you\u2019re unable to invest a substantial amount, you can still invest in Ethereum, Solana, Caged Beasts, or all of them gradually, earning small amounts without exerting excessive effort. Over time, your investment will grow to the point where it can generate more than $100 per day.\n\nFind out more about Caged Beasts (BEASTS):\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "content": "Account abstraction, also known as \u201csmart accounts,\u201d could eventually onboard a billion users from Asia to Web3, according to an executive at Ethereum software solutions provider ConsenSys.\n\nLaura Shi, the director of strategic initiatives at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph that the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem had seen a strong expansion in Asia this year.\n\n\u201cMore DApps are improving [user experience] UX for the Asian market, including introducing Asian language support,\u201d she said.\n\nShi added this expansion is primarily being driven by the introduction of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) rollups and the mass adoption of Optimistic Rollups.\n\nThe two rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions with the zkEVM offering developers security, scaling and direct compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nShi believes the development of account abstraction, which offers greater programmable functionality and more \u201cbank-like\u201d features than a regular crypto wallet, would increase adoption in the region.\n\n\u201cThe development of account abstraction will facilitate the onboarding of the billion-level users in APAC to Web3.\u201d\n\nAccount abstraction was proposed in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers in EIP-4337 to \u201ccompletely avoid consensus-layer protocol changes, instead relying on higher-layer infrastructure.\u201d However, the concept goes much further back in Ethereum\u2019s timeline.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, the top two crypto-adopting countries in the world were in Asia: Vietnam and the Philippines. Thailand, China and India were in the top 10 despite anti-crypto sentiments from their respective governments.\n\nShi believes mass adoption in Asia is also driven by social and Web3 gaming, citing South Korea and China as examples.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea's gaming publishers are continuously focusing on Web3 RPG game publishing, attempting to optimize the sustainability of the on-chain economic model,\u201d said Shi.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Chinese-speaking developer ecosystem is focusing on onboarding Web2 users to Web3 gaming through adopting account abstraction solutions.\u201d\n\nBoth use cases will rely heavily on zkEVM rollups and account abstraction development, she added.\n\n\u201cFrom the use case perspective, we see Web3 social and gaming content has the largest potential in the coming years. It is powered by [a] zkEVM rollup solution and [an] account abstraction solution that enables gas fee subsidy and social recovery.\u201d\n\nRelated: Asia\u2019s current gaming domination \u2018crucial\u2019 for Web3 games\n\nAsked whether the current United States industry crackdown could be driving Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem growth in Asia, Shi said she didn\u2019t see any correlation.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have not observed any direct correlation between these and the regulatory dynamics in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe pivot to Asia has been a hot topic recently as U.S. crypto and Web3 companies seek friendlier jurisdictions in the Far East.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum ecosystem in Asia appears to be doing fine on its own without the catalyst of Uncle Sam\u2019s war on crypto.\n\nMagazine: Crypto City: Guide to Osaka, Japan\u2019s second-biggest city"

        "content": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 11, 2023, Chainwire\n\nPikamoon, an Ethereum blockchain game, has raised $3.6 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO) to bring more value to the Ethereum ecosystem and possibly revolutionize the blockchain gaming space.\n\nPikamoon would launch a metaverse game integrating an earning model that allows players to withdraw their in-game rewards directly to their wallet or bank account without needing a third party.\n\nPikamoon focuses on becoming a realistic metaverse game where players can get a 360-degree experience of the growing virtual space through gameplay, visuals, and decentralized finance (DeFi) features. Drawing inspiration from games like Fortnite, Pokemon, and FIFA, the Ethereum game prepares to blend non-fungible tokens (NFTs), video gaming, and metaverse entertainment.\n\nThe Pikamoon game is built on Unity, a game development technology, to create the visuals and architecture needed to give players an immersive experience.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum sees major developments as analysts show optimism\n\nAdditionally, Pikamoon is built across Ethereum and MultiversX (formerly Elrond) blockchains. While Ethereum provides scalability, MultiversX complements it by providing efficiency and ensuring the game is environmentally friendly by reducing carbon emissions generated by transactions. This dual blockchain feature ensures that the Pikamoon ecosystem can cater to legions of gamers without lag.\n\nGaming enthusiasts and smart investors are convinced Pikamoon is the future of gaming, and this is evident in how fast phase one and phase two of the crowdfund sold out. In the first phase, one PIKA sold for $0.0002, which increased to $0.0004 in the second phase, and now in the third and last phase, one PIKA is selling for $0.0006 and selling out faster.\n\nNotable partners of this Ethereum-based game include future-thinking web3 brands such as Ethereum, Transak, Cryptonews.com, Kevuru Games, and MultiversX. This line-up of industry leaders further reinforces the project\u2019s credibility, reaffirming that the team is committed to building the best gaming projects.\n\nPikamoon allows investors to enter what is strategically seen as a vast metaverse market and gaming on Ethereum. A core feature of the PIKA token is its deflationary nature. Whenever a sell or transfer transaction occurs in the Pikamoon ecosystem, 0.5% of the tokens are burned.\n\nThe ongoing presale employs ethereum (ETH) as its primary currency. Due to this, it is gaining popularity among the Ethereum community. The smooth integration with Ethereum streamlines the investment process for enthusiastic investors and enhances the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAbout Pikamoon\n\nPikamoon makes metaverse gameplay exciting and rewarding for players of all age groups. The Pikamoon\u2019s metaverse, the Pikaverse, offers players endless opportunities to explore, battle, trade, and earn a living within the game. It operates on Ethereum and MultiversX blockchains, ensuring smooth and glitch-free gameplay for every player. Similarly, Pikamoon\u2019s unique earning model allows players to easily monetize gameplay, solidifying its place as one of the best metaverse games on the market.\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA)\n\nWebsite | Where to purchase PIKA | Twitter | Telegram\n\nContact\n\nFounder\n\nNick Evans\n\nPikamoon\n\n[email protected]\n\nRead more: Solana surpasses Ethereum in 24h NFT sales\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Collectors discover the specific iteration they've acquired at the reveal, adding a unique aspect to the process of collecting generative art.\n\nThe decision to expand fxhash to the Ethereum blockchain marks a significant step in the platform's evolution. Initially, fxhash chose the Tezos blockchain for its appealing proof-of-stake consensus, especially when Ethereum was still using proof-of-work.\n\nThe work of digital artist Zancan. Image: fxhash.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming launch of fxhash 2.0, the platform is set to become multichain, a move influenced by requests from its partners for expansion beyond Tezos.\n\nThe implementation of fxhash 2.0 aims to break down the barriers that currently exist between chains. At present, artists can often sell their artworks at significantly higher prices on Ethereum, which also offers greater visibility for artists.\n\n\"By bringing communities together and showing artworks side by side, regardless of the chain they were minted on, we aim to elevate generative art,\" Charlie Middleton, the creative director at fxhash, told Decrypt. \u201cThe chain doesn't matter. It's the art that matters.\"\n\nLinda Dounia's IN/Visible NFT Exhibition Highlights Black Artists, AI's \u2018Skewed\u2019 Lens\n\nThe platform was initially started by the artist Ciphrd. As a generative artist, he felt difficult to find a platform that could properly showcase his work. This struggle led him to create fxhash.\n\nSince then, it has been highly community-focused.\n\nThis plays a significant role in decision-making processes, too, particularly with the upcoming fxhash 2.0.\n\n\"fxhash is the largest live repository of Generative Art, as such we can never stand still, but need to provide Artists with a wide variety of tools that we are continuously adding to in close communication with our community,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cfxhash 2.0 is a natural consequence of that, and something our team, our partners, the community, and most importantly artists are incredibly excited about.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n2 million pieces of art on fxhash\n\nThe platform boasts a diverse array of talented artists, including Zancan, William Mapan, Iskra Velitchkova, Melissa Wiederrecht, Andreas Rau, and Kim Asendorf.\n\nSome have gained significant popularity, with Zancan's \"Garden, Monoliths\" collection, for instance, racking up over 1.2 million XTZ in secondary market sales.\n\nAs of now, fxhash hosts around 8,000 artists or users who have minted at least one token, and it showcases two million pieces of generative art. The platform has facilitated the movement of approximately $40 million to $45 million, with the lion's share of this amount going to the artists.\n\nThe team at fxhash is currently hard at work on the Ethereum integration, with the launch of fxhash 2.0 slated for after the summer.\n\nThis will likely come with a UI and UX overhaul, too, and there are plans for events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the launch.\n\n\"Right now we've got our sights focused on an event happening in Berlin, which is related to the hackathon we've just started,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cAs we get closer to the launch, we'll have a clearer idea of what we can plan.\"\n\nIn a world where the chain often matters more than the art, fxhash is striving to shift the focus back to where it belongs: on the artists and their creations.\n\n\"Our goal was always to build tools allowing artists and collectors to live out their passion for generative art,\u201d fxhash COO Paul Viktor Schmidt told Decrypt. \u201cWe have always prioritized pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and will continue to do so.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been experiencing a significant increase in gas fees. The reason behind this surge has been a mystery to many until recently, when a Twitter user named Cygaar [@0xCygaar] shed some light on the issue. Let\u2019s take a look at this Ethereum Gas fee article in more detail.\n\nThe Top ETH Gas Guzzler\n\nhttps://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1676699126682075136?s=20\n\nAccording to Cygaar, the primary culprit behind the high gas fees is a specific contract where users are making validators run useless or unnecessary code. This action, in turn, increases the overall gas usage on the Ethereum network. The contract in question has been identified as the top ETH gas guzzler, contributing significantly to the high transaction fees.\n\nAn Introduction to Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nEthereum gas fees are the costs required to perform any operation on the Ethereum network. These operations can range from simple transactions, like sending Ether (ETH) from one address to another, to more complex interactions with smart contracts.\n\nThe concept of gas in Ethereum is similar to the fuel in your car. Just like you need fuel to drive your car a certain distance, you need gas to perform operations on the Ethereum network. The more complex the operation, the more gas it requires.\n\nThe gas fee is determined by two factors: the amount of gas required for the operation (Gas Used) and the price you\u2019re willing to pay per unit of gas (Gas Price).\n\nLet\u2019s consider a simple example to illustrate this:\n\nSuppose you want to send some ETH to a friend. This is a simple operation and let\u2019s say it requires 21,000 units of gas (this is the actual amount of gas required for a standard ETH transfer).\n\nNow, you need to set a gas price, which is the amount of ETH you\u2019re willing to pay for each unit of gas. The gas price is usually set in \u2018gwei\u2019, where 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei. Let\u2019s say you set a gas price of 20 gwei.\n\nThe total gas fee for your transaction would be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal Gas Fee = Gas Used x Gas Price\n\nSo in this case, the total gas fee would be:\n\nTotal Gas Fee = 21,000 (Gas Used) x 20 (Gas Price) = 420,000 gwei or 0.00042 ETH\n\nThis is the amount you would pay to send ETH to your friend. Note that if the Ethereum network is busy, you might need to set a higher gas price to get your transaction processed quickly. Conversely, if the network is not very busy, you might be able to get away with a lower gas price.\n\nUnderstanding Gas Fees Calculation in Ethereum\n\nThe high gas fees have a direct impact on the users of the Ethereum network. People are essentially burning their money to increase gas fees for everyone else. This situation is not only detrimental to individual users but also to the overall health and sustainability of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn Ethereum, the cost of a transaction (the \u201cgas fee\u201d) is determined by two factors: the amount of computational work that needs to be done (the \u201cgas used\u201d) and the price per unit of gas (the \u201cgas price\u201d).\n\nGas Used: Every operation that occurs in the Ethereum network, from simple transfers to complex smart contract interactions, requires a certain amount of computational work. This work is measured in \u201cgas.\u201d For example, a simple ETH transfer requires 21,000 units of gas.\n\nEvery operation that occurs in the Ethereum network, from simple transfers to complex smart contract interactions, requires a certain amount of computational work. This work is measured in \u201cgas.\u201d For example, a simple ETH transfer requires 21,000 units of gas. Gas Price: The gas price is the amount of ETH that the transaction sender is willing to pay for each unit of gas. It\u2019s usually measured in \u201cgwei,\u201d where 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 (one billion) gwei. The gas price is set by the sender but ultimately determined by supply and demand in the network. If the network is busy, you might need to pay a higher gas price to incentivize miners to include your transaction in the next block.\n\nThe total gas fee is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal Gas Fee = Gas Used x Gas Price\n\nThe Impact of Unnecessary Code Execution\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider a smart contract that includes unnecessary code. For simplicity, let\u2019s say this unnecessary code doubles the computational work required for the contract execution, increasing the gas used from 21,000 to 42,000 units.\n\nIf we assume a gas price of 100 gwei, the gas fee for a normal transaction would be:\n\nNormal Gas Fee = 21,000 (Gas Used) x 100 (Gas Price) = 2,100,000 gwei or 0.0021 ETH\n\nHowever, with the unnecessary code, the gas fee would be:\n\nIncreased Gas Fee = 42,000 (Gas Used) x 100 (Gas Price) = 4,200,000 gwei or 0.0042 ETH\n\nAs you can see, the inclusion of unnecessary code in the contract has effectively doubled the gas fee. This is a simplified example, but it illustrates how inefficient code can lead to higher transaction costs on the Ethereum network. In reality, the impact could be even more significant, especially during periods of high network congestion.\n\nThe execution of unnecessary code by validators not only increases the gas usage but also puts an additional load on the Ethereum network. This unnecessary load leads to congestion, slowing down transaction processing times and causing a spike in gas fees.\n\nThe Economics of Ethereum Gas Fees and the Role of Unnecessary Code\n\nIn the Ethereum network, every operation that takes place, from simple transactions to complex smart contract interactions, requires computational resources. These resources are not unlimited and are provided by nodes or validators in the network. The cost for these resources is paid in \u201cgas,\u201d and the price of gas is determined by supply and demand dynamics. When a specific contract makes validators run useless or unnecessary code, it artificially inflates the demand for computational resources.\n\nThis unnecessary demand puts a strain on the network, causing congestion. As more and more resources are requested, the available supply decreases, leading to an increase in gas prices. This is similar to traffic congestion on a highway; the more cars (or in this case, transactions) there are, the slower the traffic moves, and the longer it takes to reach the destination. In the context of Ethereum, this means that users have to pay higher fees to get their transactions processed faster. Therefore, by making validators execute unnecessary code, users are effectively driving up the demand and, consequently, the price of gas, leading to higher transaction fees for everyone on the network.\n\nThe Call for a Solution\n\nThe revelation by Cygaar has sparked a conversation about the need for a solution to this problem. It\u2019s clear that the Ethereum network needs to find a way to prevent the execution of unnecessary code to maintain its efficiency and keep gas fees at a reasonable level. The community is now looking towards Ethereum\u2019s developers for a solution that can address this issue and ensure the network\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nSo, the high gas fees on the Ethereum network are a pressing issue that needs immediate attention. The revelation by Cygaar has shed light on a significant contributing factor, and it\u2019s now up to the Ethereum community to find a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

However, key macroeconomic data and US Fed's minutes of meeting due later today will guide the markets over rate hike cues.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking on Wednesday as the largest crypto token dropped more than a per cent to slip below $31,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also down, dropping more than a per cent to breach $1,950-level. However, price action in other altcoins was mixed.\n\n\n\nBitcoin experienced a surge above the $31,000 mark recently, but it is currently consolidating around the $30,800 level as market participants eagerly await the release of the FOMC minutes today. Despite being down by 54% from its all-time high, Bitcoin has still achieved a substantial 86% gain year-to-date, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The market sentiment is currently balanced, with neither bulls nor bears dominating, as Bitcoin trades within the range between support and resistance levels. If the price manages to close above the $31,000 zone consistently in the coming days, there is a possibility of Bitcoin surpassing the $32,000 mark in the near future. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading at $1,940,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged stablecoins and Tron, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Wednesday. Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash dropped 4 per cent each, while Toncoin was down 3 per cent. Litecoin, Cardano and Polygon declined 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, dropping to $1.21 trillion-mark as it declined more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes plunged almost 24 per cent to $29.01 billion.\n\n\n\nThe world's largest digital asset crossed the $31,000 mark, rising 2 per cent from the previous day after a few prospective bitcoin ETF issuers refiled their applications. The refiled applications came after the SEC rejected several spot bitcoin ETF applications in recent months, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have begun to pick up momentum this month as the second half of the year edges closer toward a highly anticipated Ethereum upgrade. LST platforms and protocols like Lido and Rocketpool have so far accrued $20 billion in total value locked, representing around 10.3 million ETH,\" it added.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum (ETH)is in an ascending trend under some bullish momentum with the asset trading above the 100-day moving average.ETH price is trying to consolidate between the range of $1,925 and $1,975, where it is facing immediate resistance. If the price successfully surpasses this level, it could potentially lead the asset towards next resistance at $2,025.\n\n\n\nIts RSI is rising which indicates that the underlying buying pressure for Ethereum price is increasing. This bullish divergence increases the possibility of a rally towards the trendline. On the down side, if ETH fails to hold the $1,900 support level, it could encounter renewed selling pressure.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,900, $1,861\n\nResistance: $1,975, $2,025\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Starknet\u2019s Quantum Leap upgrade has been deployed on a testnet, with the Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol claiming it\u2019s capable of processing \u201chundreds of transactions per second.\u201d\n\nIf achieved, it would be at least a 50x improvement from its current throughput, thanks to the version 12 upgrade harmonizing how the sequencer\u2019s code interacts with the Cairo programming language.\n\nA Starknet fact sheet states that the \u201ctime to inclusion\u201d after the upgrade goes live on the mainnet \u201cwill be under 15 seconds,\u201d meaning decentralized applications will be able to confirm transactions on-chain within seconds.\n\nCo-founder Uri Kolodny was a little more circumspect in an interview with Cointelegraph, stating that the upgrade has hit \u201ctriple figures\u201d during testing.\n\nIf this throughput is mirrored in real-world usage \u2014 and high TPS is as much a function of demand from users as technical capability \u2014 the upgrade would be a huge leap for Israeli firm StarkWare\u2019s decentralized scaling network.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, Starknet is currently processing just 1.79 TPS, meaning the upgrade could improve transaction speed by 56x or more. It would also easily outshine other Ethereum L2s, including the Optimism mainnet (6 TPS), zkSync Era (8.63 TPS) and Arbitrum One (9.69 TPS), not to mention Ethereum itself (12.29 TPS).\n\nEthereum layer 2 TPS. Source: L2Beat\n\nBut to put those TPS figures in perspective, it\u2019s still a lot less than Solana\u2019s 4,127 TPS or Visa\u2019s 1,700 TPS.\n\n\u201cScaling has been the primary challenge that this ecosystem has been fighting with over the past several years,\u201d Kolodny said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that version 12 brings with it this Quantum Leap \u2014 in fact, there are a whole series of leaps that will roll out through the summer we\u2019ll go through. But we are already in the triple digits for transactions per second.\u201d\n\nCapacity is very different to usage, however; and even after the upgrade, if there are not enough users on Starknet that actually make 100 transactions per second, then the protocol will not run at 100 TPS.\n\nKolodny added that raw TPS is not the best metric of performance, given that complicated transactions are harder to perform than simple ones. But he said the upgrade also enables complicated transactions to make multiple calls, \u201ceach performing separate logic from a separate contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of Cairo steps per second, we\u2019re observing an increase of at least something on the order of 50x compared to what we have today.\u201d\n\nRelated: Zero Barriers podcast series: Crypto adoption fueled by ZK-rollups\n\nThe Quantum Leap upgrade does not solve the data availability problem faced by all zk-Rollups. The issue is that there is not enough room on Ethereum to write back all of the required data for the transactions on L2s, which pushes up costs.\n\nAs of now, 90% of costs on Starknet are associated with Data availability cost to L1.\n\n\n\nAckktually, Starknet will be the first L2 to offer Volition, and reduce fees by up to 85% post its launch later this year.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the implementation of EIP4844 on L1 will further lower it. \u2014 Starknet (@Starknet) June 7, 2023\n\nKolodny said this would be addressed by the version 13 Volition upgrade, which is due before the end of this quarter. It will give users granular control that enables them to store crucial or high-value data on Ethereum, and less important data elsewhere. This is projected to cut fees by 85% and could pave the way for low-fee micropayments or a boom in affordable, fast blockchain gaming.\n\nOne of the key components of the upgrade is Cairo-rs from venture studio LambdaClass, which is a faster implementation of the Cairo virtual machine using Rust instead of Python.\n\nFounder Federico Carrone said Quantum Leap was a \u201chistoric moment\u201d for blockchains in general.\n\n\u201cThis release shows that it\u2019s possible to scale blockchains in a safe way thanks to STARKs and enables the creation of new applications that were impossible to think of a few years ago on top of a blockchain.\u201d\n\nStarkWare previously announced on June 29 that its validity-proof ZK scaling technology had now facilitated more than $1 trillion in transactions.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019"

        "title": "Crypto Meta Transactions - Milk Road",
        "content": "Outside of scalability, one of the biggest things holding crypto back is usability. Right now, there\u2019s a massive barrier-to-entry for everyday users looking to access decentralized applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s the need to pay gas, the fuel that powers transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong either, there\u2019s a fundamental need for transaction fees in the network to properly secure the network. But with this, in order to use any applications, users have to hold ether to pay for gas.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem for most experienced Ethereum users. However, for new users, this presents a serious barrier-to-entry. The need to pay gas when interacting with dApps requires every user to go out and buy ether. While this is great in terms of price action and network economics, it does create some friction as users likely have to acquire the asset through a fiat on-ramp. This generally means completing KYC on major exchanges, like FTX, linking your bank account or debit card, providing your social security number, and uploading a selfie.\n\nThe need for users to have ether to access DeFi applications and other dApps creates a considerable amount of friction in terms of accessibility and usability. Even then, once users have Ether in their wallet, they may be required to have some knowledge about gas prices, especially when the network is congested. In short, the need for paying gas (i.e. transaction fees) presents a significant barrier-to-entry for driving mass adoption.\n\nThe answer to this problem? Meta transactions.\n\nMeta Transactions Enable Gasless Transactions\n\nIn essence, meta transactions allow users to interact with a public blockchain without paying a transaction fee. This leads to a more seamless UX as users no longer have to understand the inner workings of public blockchains and market dynamics for transaction fees.\n\nAt its core, meta transactions are nearly identical to regular network transactions but with the addition of a proxy contract, also known as a relayer. With meta transactions, users still use their signature to send and authenticate transactions. The difference is, once this happens, the transaction is now managed by the relayer who pays the gas and sends the transaction to the receiving address.\n\nBy leveraging meta transactions, developers can significantly streamline the user experience for their applications. Ultimately, this feature brings the ecosystem closer to a frictionless user experience when accessing web 3.0 and DeFi.\n\nThe Two Types Of Meta Transactions\n\nCentralized Relays\n\nWe\u2019ve seen some applications deploy a single relayer or a select few relayers to facilitate meta transactions within their contracts. Given Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the notion of trustless transactions, centralized relayers contradict the movement as a centralized relayer acts as a single point of failure for the network. In other words, developers can censor transactions or if the relayer goes down, the application may go down with it.\n\nWhile this is the easiest way for application developers to integrate meta transactions, it does go against the ethos of decentralized networks.\n\nDecentralized Relays\n\nIt goes without saying that in a decentralized network, decentralized relays are the ideal solution. Decentralized relayers could watch the transaction pool and act as secondary miners. However, they would still suffer from a synchronization problem. With meta transactions, a relayer can only process one transaction at a time where each relayer will only pick the most profitable transaction. This would result in a saturation of miners competing for the most profitable transactions, where only one of the miners would succeed while all others would fail and lose money on their attempt.\n\nWhile decentralized relayers are the penultimate solution, they do present some problems in terms of incentivization schemes and a lack of synchronization among miners. Luckily for us, the Ethereum community is filled with brilliant people who love to solve challenging problems like these.\n\nWho\u2019s Pioneering Meta Transactions?\n\nThe most well-established initiative pioneering meta transaction is Open Zepplin\u2019s Gas Station Network (GSN). The GSN is an open-sourced community-driven effort comprised of a consortium of different crypto projects pushing for mass adoption. The GSN is an open-sourced SDK creating a decentralized and trustless mechanism for leveraging meta transactions for any Ethereum application. With the GSN, relays will take care of paying for verified transactions, allowing users to quickly onboard and easily access their favorite dApp.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe Gas Station Network consists of relayers, also known as gas stations. Gas stations can accept etherless transactions from users, filling them with gas by signing them, and then returning the transactions to the users and relaying them to the network. With this architecture, trust can be minimized in a decentralized fashion. A single open-source smart contract, called the RelayHub, acts as a registrar for relays and facilitates transactions between the relays and smart contracts.\n\nThe RelayHub holds small deposits from dApps and developers in order to compensate relayers for processing transactions. Relayers are required to stake ETH in the RelayHub when they register to prevent certain DoS and other censorship attacks. With this, honest relays can earn transaction fees while malicious relays can have their stake slashed.\n\nFrom the user\u2019s perspective, everything from selecting a relayer and the delivery of the transaction to the network is done transparently, autonomously and in a timely manner. Ultimately, this leaves users with a seamless UX when interacting with their favorite applications.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta transactions significantly abstract the complexities of gas away from the user. As a result, dApp onboarding is made easy and users can begin enjoying the massive benefits that web 3.0 applications provide. Over the next few years, it will come as no surprise if meta transactions become common practice when developing new decentralized applications.\n\nMore importantly, meta transactions may be the key to driving more adoption to DeFi applications. Being able to hold Dai and access emerging DeFi applications without ever having to worry about holding Ether or paying gas will likely be a major factor when it comes to mass adoption.\n\nFor more detailed information surrounding meta transactions, feel free to visit the gas station network website or read up on Austin Griffith\u2019s Medium post about meta transactions.\n\nAdditional Resources"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Holds Firm, Can it Break $2,000? InQubeta On Track To 100X Its Price in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The InQubeta (QUBE) presale has emerged as one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world and the attention it received from global investors seems to be carrying over to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain which its platform is built on.\n\nEthereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency based on market capitalization, but it\u2019s seen more price growth in 2023 than Bitcoin, the most popular crypto. Ethereum went on a massive bull run in early 2023, with prices increasing by almost 60%, and it seems to be preparing for another bull run, with prices growing steadily in the past week. Ethereum has been picked as the most likely altcoin to ever replace Bitcoin\u2019s status as the top cryptocurrency since its platform is more flexible and capable.\n\nPlatforms like InQubeta are proof of Ethereum\u2019s greater utility compared to Bitcoin as its blockchain can be used to host other cryptocurrency projects and allows for the creation of smart contracts.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is on track to surpass 100x growth in 2023\n\nInQubeta investors can expect to increase the value of their investment by 400% by the time its presale is over. They can thank the incremental price changes that occur at each of the presale\u2019s ten stages for that.\n\nThe real fun starts after the project is officially launched later in the year, with some projections expecting InQubeta\u2019s value to increase by up to 100x before the year is over. These might seem like overly optimistic projections, but they\u2019re more on the conservative side given how undervalued InQubeta tokens are.\n\nThe InQubeta ecosystem is run by its native $QUBE tokens, which have a limited total token supply of 1.5 billion. $QUBE also has deflationary systems like a 2% burn tax. Tokens collected through the tax are sent to burn wallets to be removed from the total token supply.\n\nStartups raise capital on the InQubeta network by making equity-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are divisible so investors can invest as little or as much as they wish. These NFTs are reviewed by the operations team before being listed on the marketplace where investors can purchase them.\n\nInvestors receive the NFTs once sales are finalized, while startups get more $QUBE tokens they can convert to fiat to innovate with. Smart contracts guarantee investors get any bonuses promised on their NFTs.\n\nInQubeta solves the problem of mainstream investment firms being inaccessible for many by creating barrier-free investment opportunities for anyone who wants to tether themselves to the artificial intelligence revolution to secure equity in companies that might end up causing major disruptions in industries worldwide.\n\nTechnological breakthroughs are always highly anticipated events for savvy investors who recognize how rare the opportunities such events bring are. Investors who backed Internet-based businesses like Netflix in the early 2000s have made exponential returns on their investments and those who back AI startups that end up transforming industries can expect similar returns.\n\nInQubeta has emerged as one of the surest bets in the crypto space as platforms that help to push AI receive a massive inflow of capital. Investments in AI have increased by over $100 billion since 2015 and they\u2019re projected to surpass $1.5 trillion by 2030. Ethereum (ETH) poised to break the $2,000 barrier\n\nEthereum is already having an excellent 2023 and it appears to be poised for more growth as platforms built on its blockchain like Polygon (MATIC) and InQubeta generate lots of buzz in mainstream and crypto investment spaces. Polygon was recently featured in TIME as one of the most influential companies, while InQubeta\u2019s getting attention for making investments in AI accessible for all.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta and Ethereum are two cryptocurrencies many savvy investors already have in their portfolios. Ethereum will likely continue to see price increases for the rest of the year, but its odds of keeping up with InQubeta are low. At best, Ethereum might increase by up to 3x, while InQubeta beats that during its presale alone.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

As a result, altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have remained lull. Additionally, the lack of a proper catalyst has sapped crypto traders' optimism.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin price face negative effects from Federal Reserve\u2019s two rate hikes?\n\nBitcoin price makes a modest foray above $31,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, up almost 5% since the new week started. The king of crypto has taken a subtle step above the $31,000 level, pointing to a growing buying activity after the start of the third quarter. The price action since June 15 has led to the appearance of a bullish flag pattern.\n\nThe pattern is resolved considering that Bitcoin price broke out of the flag formation in the direction of the prevailing trend, which is bullish. A decisive break above the June 23 high of $31,458, however, would provide cast-iron confirmation of the pattern\u2019s activation. Decisive would mean a long green candle breaking above the confirmation level and then closing near its high or a break by three green candles in a row.\n\nThe target of the flag is estimated by measuring the length of the pole and extending it in the direction of the breakout. A common stop level is just outside the flag on the opposite side of the breakout.\n\nBased on this estimation, Bitcoin price could rally 24% in the long term toward the $40,000 level. Meanwhile, experts anticipate a strong upward trend, with conservative investors speculating a breach of the $35,000 area. Another possible target lies at $33,650, the 61.8% extrapolation of the flagpole higher.\n\nsilver cross + CME gap - Maio 2022 entre $ 35K / $36 K. pic.twitter.com/AgED04X9Hh \u2014 6.25BTC \u26a1\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@3_125BTC) July 3, 2023\n\nOptimism is bolstered by a positive assessment of the probabilities that the major financial institutions seeking regulatory approval for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nwill be successful, according to $650 billion asset manager Bernstein, who said the US SEC will likely approve a spot Bitcoin, in a recent note.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, early profit-taking could cut the rally short, sending Bitcoin price back into the fold of the flag pattern. In a dire case, BTC could lose the support offered by the lower boundary of the flag at $29,578 before a possible trend reversal.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin options strategy: How to trade July\u2019s Q2 earnings\n\nEthereum price eyes $2,000 amid positive correlation with BTC\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is on a course north, joyriding the Bitcoin rally. A sustained uptrend could see the largest altcoin by market capitalization cross into the $2,000 zone. The PoS token is up almost 10% from the June 29 correction, with signs of a continued ascent as technical indicators communicate optimism.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) faces north, suggesting rising momentum. Similarly, the Awesome Oscillators (AO) are above the midline with deep green histograms, further adding credence to the upside.\n\nAn increase in buying pressure from the current level could see the Ethereum price rise around 2%, crossing into the $2,000 zone. In a highly bullish case, ETH could reprint the mid-April highs around $2,120, denoting a 7.95% ascent from the current price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from the $2,000 level could send Ethereum price back to the 50- and 100-day EMA at $1,842 or $1,809, respectively. In the dire case, ETH could tag the 200-day EMA at $1,747, constituting a 10% downswing.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum eyes $2,000 target as institutional investors pour capital into ETH funds\n\nRipple price could breach $0.491 unless buying momentum wanes\n\nRipple (XRP) price has regained momentum after a successful flip above the 50-day EMA at $0.485. The remittance token is up around 5% since the beginning of the new month as bulls push to breach the $0.491 resistance level.\n\nAn increase in buying pressure could facilitate the 0.61% climb, clearing the hurdle for the remittance token\u2019s foray above $0.500. A sustained bullish momentum could propel XRP up 10% from the current level to tag the $0.542 hurdle.\n\nThis optimistic outlook draws support from the up-moving RSI and green-flashing AO histograms, suggesting increasing buying activity among XRP bulls.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, day traders looking to make a quick profit could interrupt the rally by selling XRP at its current market value. The ensuing selling pressure could send Ripple price back under the foothold of the 100-day EMA at $0.472 or lower, below the 200-day EMA at $0.456.\n\nFailure by the bulls to leverage these buyer congestion zones could see Ripple price head lower, breaking below $0.450 and approaching the $0.420 support level.\n\nNotice that the AO is still negative while the RSI is under 50, suggesting bears still have a grip on XRP.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton says SEC Chairman Gary Gensler could resign"

        "content": "Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin, Ether Supply on Exchanges Fell in June \u2013 Bull Market Back?\n\nSource: Adobe / Luisa\n\nExchange balances of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell significantly in June as more crypto holders chose to take self-custody, a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs has said.\n\nAnalyzing on-chain data, the Goldman Sachs report said it is likely that many crypto investors have moved their holdings away from exchanges due to fears over regulatory crackdowns and potential security issues related to hacking and theft.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that staking of ETH has now become possible through self-custodial solutions, which incentivizes the withdrawal of tokens from exchanges.\n\nAs a result of this move to self-custody, exchange\u2019s supply of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, BTC is now close to its lowest level since December 2022.\n\nSimilarly, the supply of ETH on exchanges is also down, reaching levels not seen since May 2018.\n\nThe news was first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin miners selling\n\nThe Goldman Sachs report also mentioned that June marked a record month for Bitcoin miners\u2019 inventory sales.\n\nMiners took advantage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s strong performance, resulting in nearly doubled monthly BTC inflows from miners to exchanges, amounting to $99 million.\n\nDuring this period, the price of Bitcoin rose by approximately 12% to a price of $30,472 as of the end of the month.\n\nBitcoin price since June. Source: TradingView\n\nTransaction fees returning to normal\n\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, another key development in June was that transaction fees finally returned to normal levels after the network congestion witnessed in May.\n\nAs a result, both Bitcoin and Ether experienced a rebound in monthly address activity, with a 15.5% increase for Bitcoin and a notable 37.5% surge for Ether.\n\nGoldman Sachs also observed a significant decline in average daily ether burnt, which fell by 65.1%, and average daily fees, which dropped by 63.3% on a month-on-month basis.\n\nIncreased on-chain activity\n\nLastly, the report highlighted an increase in new on-chain activity.\n\nThe daily average count of new addresses for both Bitcoin and Ether rose by 9.8% and 48.2%, respectively, compared to the previous month.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nBased on these developments, it seems that the decline in Bitcoin and Ether supply on exchanges, coupled with increased on-chain activity, may suggest the return of a bullish market."

By combining meme appeal with innovative functionalities, DogeMiyagi presents an exciting opportunity for high returns within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShiba Inu: The Dogekiller\n\nBut hold on to your digital leashes because Shiba Inu (SHIB) is here to shake things up. Often dubbed the \u201cDogecoin Killer,\u201d it was developed by \u201cRyoshi,\u201d an anonymous individual inspired by the Shiba Inu dog breed. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, Shiba Inu brings a fresh twist to tokenomics, promoting liquidity and stability in the most paw-some way possible. With a significant portion of its supply locked in decentralised exchanges, Shiba Inu ensures a smoother ride for its investors. And that\u2019s not all!

        "content": "Is it Safe to Buy ETH Now? \u2013 Analysing Ethereum, Avalanche, and DogeMiyagi\n\nThe crypto market has been buzzing with the remarkable performance of Ethereum (ETH), which witnessed a staggering 61% surge in the first half of this year. As traders anticipate the continuation of this rally, a crucial question arises: is it safe to buy ETH NOW? In this article, we will delve into the growth potential of Ethereum, analyse it as a model for newer projects like Avalanche (AVAX) and DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), and provide insights to aid readers in their crypto investment decisions. Our goal is to offer news, education, and updates on the crypto market, all while maintaining an informative yet comical tone.\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Leading Smart-Contract Blockchain\n\nEthereum experienced a staggering 61% surge during the year\u2019s initial half, prompting traders to speculate on the possibility of this rally extending into the latter half. In an intriguing move observed in late June, an investor made a notable transaction involving approximately 63,250 \u201cbull call spreads\u201d linked to ether, with an expiration date of December 29. This intricate manoeuvre consisted of selling a call option at the $2,500 strike price, generating funds that partially facilitated the acquisition of a call option at the $1,900 strike.\n\nNotably, the overall strategy came at an initial cost of $10 million, as the trading entity expended more to purchase the $1,900 call than it received from selling the $2,500 call. This particular strategy allows the call buyer to secure protection against price rallies while the call seller obtains an upfront premium from the buyer.\n\nThe phenomenal growth of Ethereum sets a benchmark for newer projects like Avalanche and DogeMiyagi. These projects aim to leverage Ethereum\u2019s success and address its limitations, ultimately striving for its unique value propositions.\n\nAvalanche: Rising from Crypto Winter with Promising Future\n\nDuring the crypto winter, Avalanche faced significant setbacks, experiencing a similar growth trajectory as the now-defunct Terra (LUNA) before reaching its peak at an all-time high of $146.22 over a year ago. Although currently down by more than 87% from that pinnacle, AVAX holders have demonstrated resilience by disregarding the losses and embracing the promising future that awaits the protocol.\n\nThe latest data indicates that many AVAX holders are in an unfavourable financial position, signifying losses.\n\nHowever, despite this prevailing circumstance among the majority of holders, the steady progress of the protocol serves to assuage investor concerns across the entire spectrum.\n\nDogeMiyagi: Memes, NFTs, Community for Crypto Success\n\nAmong the emerging meme coin projects, DogeMiyagi distinguishes itself by presenting an innovative approach to cryptocurrency. Incorporating elements of the beloved Karate Kid franchise and meme culture, DogeMiyagi succeeds in cultivating a unified community of enthusiastic investors. This dynamic project introduces NFTs and offers enticing rewards and engaging giveaways, fostering an immersive and captivating experience.\n\nThe core of DogeMiyagi lies a strong emphasis on community involvement, facilitated by a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). This unique framework ensures that every community member has a voice in shaping the project\u2019s trajectory, and users reap benefits as the project progresses; leveraging the Ethereum network enhances transparency, security, and sustainability.\n\nAvalanche and DogeMiyagi: Learning from Ethereum\u2019s Growth Model to Propel Success\n\nAvalanche and DogeMiyagi can leverage Ethereum as a growth model in several ways. Firstly, they can learn from Ethereum\u2019s success in establishing itself as the world\u2019s largest smart-contract blockchain. By studying Ethereum\u2019s approach to scalability, security, and developer community engagement, Avalanche and DogeMiyagi can enhance their protocols to attract more users and developers.\n\nSecondly, Avalanche and DogeMiyagi can draw inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s vibrant ecosystem of decentralised applications (DApps) and tokenised assets. They can explore similar use cases and develop innovative features that provide value to their respective communities. This includes the integration of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and the creation of platforms that facilitate seamless token swaps and decentralised finance (DeFi) activities.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s extensive network effects can serve as a guiding principle for Avalanche and DogeMiyagi. By fostering strong partnerships, building strategic alliances, and collaborating with other projects in the blockchain industry, they can create synergies that benefit all participants. This cooperative approach can help accelerate adoption and increase the overall value proposition of Avalanche and DogeMiyagi, mirroring Ethereum\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nOverall, by studying and applying the growth model of Ethereum, Avalanche and DogeMiyagi can position themselves as promising projects in the crypto market, attracting investors, developers, and users seeking the next big opportunity in the ever-evolving blockchain space.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The recent crackdown by the SEC, particularly targeting cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, has labeled altcoins like Cardano and Polygon as securities. This regulatory classification has had a detrimental effect on these tokens\u2019 prices, causing them to suffer significant declines. Furthermore, Revolut, a prominent European exchange and payments company, has delisted these altcoins from its US operations, further adding to the downward pressure on their prices.\n\nIn stark contrast to the challenges faced by Cardano and Polygon, InQubeta has displayed resilience and made substantial gains during this period of regulatory uncertainty. This AI-focused token has emerged as a promising investment opportunity, attracting attention from investors looking for long-term growth potential.\n\nWhy Qube Is Poised To Hit 100x By 2024\n\nInQubeta\u2019s native token offers several features and utilities that position it for substantial growth in the coming years:\n\nFractional Investment Opportunities: The token serves as a utility for investors to invest in AI startups through fractionalized investment opportunities, allowing for greater accessibility and diversification. Deflationary Mechanism: InQubeta is a deflationary token with a 2% buy and sell tax that goes into a burn wallet, reducing the total token supply over time. Additionally, a 5% sell tax contributes to a dedicated reward pool, incentivizing long-term holding. Built on Ethereum: InQubeta is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the strength and established ecosystem of one of the most renowned blockchain platforms. This provides stability, security, and compatibility with various decentralized applications. Staking Rewards: Users can stake their InQubeta tokens to earn rewards, further incentivizing participation and engagement within the InQubeta ecosystem. Governance and Decision-Making: InQubeta token holders have the opportunity to participate in the governance process, where they can propose ideas, vote on proposals, and influence the future direction of the platform and its projects.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Biggest Presale In Crypto\n\nInQubeta has achieved major milestones with its ongoing presale that has gained strong interest and support within the crypto community. So far, the presale has raised over $900,000 in just a few weeks, indicating a high level of interest in the project.\n\nSome of the reasons for this is due to the minimal entry fee of $50 for participants. The low fee has attracted retail investors seeking to become a part of an AI ecosystem with massive potential. It also ensures that QUBE token is well distributed and decentralized thus limiting the influence of whales taking over its blockchain network.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s presale also accepts popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and more, providing convenience and accessibility for investors.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile Cardano and Polygon face challenges due to increased regulatory scrutiny, InQubeta has demonstrated resilience and the potential for significant growth. Investors should consider participating in the ongoing presale, which has already shown strong interest and raised substantial funds. With its unique utilities, deflationary mechanism, association with Ethereum, staking rewards, and governance features, InQubeta is well positioned to achieve a potential 100x increase in its price by 2024. As the crypto market continues to evolve, identifying promising opportunities like InQubeta can be instrumental in maximizing investment returns and capitalizing on the future potential of the AI industry.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

It leverages the power of blockchain technology to enable secure and transparent transactions. The community actively participates in decision-making processes, such as selecting charities and organising events. This involvement fosters a sense of ownership and inclusivity among DogeMiyagi holders.\n\nStandout Factors\n\nDogeMiyagi stands out in the crypto market due to its strong meme culture and utility-driven approach. While meme coins often face scepticism, DogeMiyagi aims to transcend the initial hype by integrating real-world use cases and partnerships. The team behind DogeMiyagi actively collaborates with charities and organisations to support causes such as animal welfare and education. This unique blend of humour, utility, and philanthropy sets DogeMiyagi apart in cryptocurrency.\n\nSolana: The Smart Contract Platform\n\nBoasting a substantial market capitalisation of around $6.6 billion, Solana was specifically created to serve as a driving force behind decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, decentralised apps (DApps), and smart contracts.

This remarkable shift can be attributed to its devoted community and creative memes. Unlike numerous other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin sets itself apart by not imposing restrictions on the maximum supply of coins.\n\nEthereum: Powering Smart Contracts and NFTs\n\nEthereum, renowned as a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, captures the hearts of programmers due to its vast range of potential applications. One notable feature is its support for smart contracts, which execute automatically once predefined conditions are met, empowering developers to create efficient and secure digital agreements. Additionally, Ethereum has gained significant attention for its involvement in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), adding another layer of innovation to its ecosystem.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is rapidly expanding, with the top 5 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalisation offering unique attributes and positions. DogeMiyagi, Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are notable for their meme-driven approach, utility-focused initiatives, scalable platforms, proof-of-stake validation, dedicated communities, and significant value growth.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Will InQubeta (QUBE) Surpass Ethereum (ETH) in Price? Analysts Think So - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "After the massive initial success of InQubeta\u2019s beta presale, crypto analysts are anticipating it will surpass Ethereum in price by 2025.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as the biggest trend in the AI industry, creating headlines and attracting the attention of crypto lovers and expert investors. This has generated buzz among enthusiasts, with many hedging their bets that it could succeed similar to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the leading altcoin and largest smart contract network, pioneering several trends like decentralized finance, NFTs, and Gamefi. However, InQubeta distinguishes itself from competitors by focusing on a unique industry.\n\nCan InQubeta surpass Ethereum to begin the top altcoin by 2025 as it gathers momentum and builds on the hype of its ongoing presale? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nInQubeta : A Trailblazer For AI Crowdfunding\n\nInQubeta is regarded as an outlier from the tokens in the market and stands out from others due to its growth potential in artificial intelligence. AI technology has captured the world\u2019s attention with the success of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing.\n\nThis makes it the next big thing, and many companies have committed huge capital toward expanding this growing industry. InQubeta intends to provide an ecosystem for AI startups struggling to get capital to tap into a crowdfunding system where anyone can invest in their idea in exchange for a part of the company using blockchain technology.\n\nInQubeta achieves this by utilizing fractionalized NFTs whereby AI startups are listed on their NFT marketplace, and interested investors fund the projects and receive NFTs providing ownership of their stake in the project.\n\nThese NFTs can be traded on a secondary market, while long-term holders benefit from rewards when the project profits. This solves the problems of funding for startups, provides liquidity for projects, and enables anyone to invest in the success of projects without breaking the bank.\n\nTo ensure that only the best projects make their way to the NFT marketplace, InQubeta uses a team of experts that vet the projects and provide users with relevant statistics and data to make informed investing decisions.\n\nFurthermore, InQubeta has a native token QUBE which serves as utility, and holders can purchase these NFTs with the tokens and become a part of the startup ecosystem. Beyond this, holders can also get rewards from staking and benefit from the deflationary system, which increases scarcity, thereby driving demand and value.\n\nInQubeta has also taken the step to ensure that security breaches are mitigated by auditing their smart contracts with Block Audit and Hacken. These platforms are two of the top smart contract security firms, and users can rest assured that their funds are safe.\n\nQUBE also acts as a governance token, and holders can participate in decision-making processes that shape the project\u2019s future. They can also make proposals and choose to vote for upgrades and changes to tokenomics or its blockchain infrastructure.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Biggest Presale In Crypto\n\nInQubeta is still in its early phases, and anyone can join the community by participating in the ongoing presale. The presale has raised over $550,000 in a few weeks, and there\u2019s massive buzz and interest in the project.\n\nFurthermore, the presale has a minimum quota of $50, making it accessible to a wide range of investors looking to diversify. Users also have diverse payment options, including Bitcoin, USDT, Ether, and Binance Coin.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nInQubeta has massive potential to scale and become a top leader in the AI industry. A significant user-base is attracted to its crowdfunding approach and reward system based on its native token QUBE. The current presale numbers have also exceeded expectations making QUBE an ideal token for investors to buy.\n\nWe expect that QUBE could be worth $1,900 before 2025 making it a higher value than the current price of Ethereum. The InQubeta team is prepared to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance and will continue to release new products after the presale phase.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "content": "The live trading option is just one click away, but before we can start trading, we have to choose our stop-loss limit. The stop-loss system saves your investment. When the market drops sharply, it kicks in and stops the robots from spending any more money. It keeps you from losing money. Then, we chose the best coin pairs for our first trades in the real world. It was our job to do this, and we picked trade pairs based on what was going on in the market at the time. The fact that Ethereum Code has trade pairs like BTC/USD, XRP/USD, LTC/USD, and ETH/USD is another great thing that lets users make more money. We were pleased, so we sat back and watched the robots trade for us using the money in our account during the live trading session, which ran for many hours. When our trade time was over and Ethereum Code made us money, we were so happy."

        "title": "Dencun, the Ethereum Upgrade Poised to Revive Liquid Staking - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade is the EIP-4844 Cancun-Deneb, aka Dencun, which will aim to stimulate liquid staking, and it is expected to arrive in Q4 2023. The upgrade would stimulate proto-dansharding and blobbing and will be the next major upgrade after the Shapella Upgrade which had arrived on April 12, 2023, and enabled unstaking of staked ETH.\n\nUpcoming Ethereum Upgrade and Liquid Staking\n\nAfter the Shapella Upgrade took effect on April 12, 2023, the consensus during a bi-weekly all-core developer call decided on the new upgrade. Dencun would focus on an important feature essential for the success of the network\u2019s roll-up-centric roadmap. Initially, the nickname for the upgrade EIP-4844 was proto-danksharding, and it was later named Dencun.\n\nDencun or proto-danksharding introduces a newer type of transaction, the \u201cblob-carrying transaction.\u201d This would present a temporary data storage mechanism and is expected to drastically reduce the transaction costs for layer-2 users.\n\nThe team lead of the Ethereum Foundation, Peter Szilagyi, suggested making EIP-4844 a priority in January 2023 when his peers subdued his voice to focus on the withdrawal of staked ETH, a feature that would be introduced by the Shapella Upgrade.\n\nCancun is the execution layer part of the upgrade, while proto-danksharding would be front and center. The upgrade would allow large \u201cblobs\u201d of data to be transmitted to nodes on the Ethereum network in a limited time. It is ironic that the data is permanently hosted on the layer-1 chain.\n\nThe data in EIP-4844 is stored there for a significant period for nodes to demonstrate and carry layer-2 roll-ups. This would allow for making effective transactions on layer 2. Sequencers have the role of receiving and keeping the transactions in order and would face a reduced load on the blockchain.\n\nDencun is an attempt to get rid of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to make way for statelessness. Here, state refers to every piece of crucial information available at the given time for the blockchain, including all the accounts, individual balances, all deployed smart contracts, and the storage requirements for all this data.\n\nThe upgrade would shift the responsibility of storing the complete information of the blockchain\u2019s state to a specialized \u201carchival node.\u201d This would facilitate storing a more extensive set of full nodes in order to store less data. Moreover, this makes running the node much easier and paves the way for network decentralization.\n\nCall moderator and project coordinator Tim Beiko said that \u201cclearly the self-destruct [proposal] is the second most mentioned EIP beyond 4844.\u201d He also pointed out that an external auditor is hired to determine if with the usage of on-chain data can, the currently deployed smart contracts be broken down or changed. The results of the exercise are expected in August 2023.\n\nVilatik Buterin\u2019s Road Map for Development\n\nIn November 2022, Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap diagram for the blockchain ecosystem, explaining what should be done to beat Bitcoin blockchain. After the upcoming Dencun upgrade, there are plans for upgradation that should take the blockchain to a whole new level.\n\nThe next upgrade would be Verge, which shall include Verkle trees. It is supposed to increase scalability by allowing developers to store vast amounts of data. The users can access this massive information via a short proof-of-data verification dubbed as the root of that tree. This would make data proofs on the blockchain more efficient.\n\nThe purge would follow Verge, which would remove historical data from the network. This step will help reduce congestion and significantly increase the transaction speed. Buterin argues that once the upgrade is executed, the network can process 100,000 Transactions per Second (TPS). The current rate is around 29 TPS."

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko: Ethereum Can Be An L2 Solution For Solana - Blockzeit",
        "content": "As blockchain technology continues to evolve, discussions around interoperability and scalability have become crucial. Recently, Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, ignited a thought-provoking conversation about the possibility of Ethereum serving as a Layer-2 (L2) solution for the Solana blockchain. In this article, we delve into the considerations put forth by the Russian computer engineer and explore the concept he is pushing forth, along with its implications for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThe Idea of Ethereum as an L2 for Solana\n\nIn an interview, Yakovenko proposes that Ethereum has the potential to function as an L2 solution for Solana, suggesting that this concept is more viable than it may initially appear. L2 solutions act as bridge protocols, providing an additional layer of security.\n\nUnder this proposal, SOL asset holders on Ethereum would have guarantees of finality, allowing them to safely transition back to the Solana blockchain in case of any issues on Ethereum.\n\nKey Components for Integration\n\nTo transform Ethereum into an L2 protocol for Solana, several key components have to be established, such as:\n\nAll Ethereum transactions would need to be submitted to the Solana blockchain, ensuring secure interoperability.\n\nA Simplicity Payment Verification (SPV) root, representing the agreed-upon state, would be submitted as proof of Ethereum consensus signatures aligning on a specific state root.\n\nA mechanism that allows for the identification and resolution of faults within the bridge protocol must be implemented. This crucial component ensures that any potential issues or discrepancies can be detected and effectively addressed, further enhancing the overall reliability and security of the integrated system.\n\nSecurity and Limitations\n\nWhile this proposition presents a method to safeguard Solana assets on the Ethereum network, it is crucial to take into account the constraints and potential hazards that may arise from this integration. Yakovenko emphasizes the importance of recognizing that although holding assets on Ethereum might be deemed secure, engaging in activities such as lending or maintaining positions against these assets would not be recommended.\n\nIn the event of an Ethereum fault, Solana assets held on Ethereum could become disconnected from the Ethereum social consensus fork, rendering the representations of these assets worthless. Therefore, lending Solana assets on Ethereum could result in borrowers receiving real assets while lenders receive valueless tokens.\n\nImplications for DeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe incorporation of Ethereum as a Layer-2 solution for Solana would undoubtedly impact the DeFi ecosystem. While central limit order books (CLOBs) would continue to operate as usual, automated market makers (AMMs) and borrowing and lending protocols for non-flash loans may encounter certain limitations and constraints.\n\nIt is crucial to consider these factors when evaluating the potential consequences of integrating Ethereum as an L2 protocol within the DeFi landscape to ensure its smooth operation going forward.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe idea of considering Ethereum as a Layer-2 solution for Solana, put forward by Anatoly Yakovenko, has ignited engaging conversations regarding the potential and obstacles that come with integrating the two platforms. This proposal presents an opportunity to enhance the security of Solana assets on Ethereum and promote better interoperability between the two blockchains. However, it is crucial to identify and weigh its pros and cons thoroughly before proceeding further."
