        "content": "The Ethereum wallet landscape is changing at breakneck speed as it has become more than a simple payment and storage device. There is an all out war to win what futurists see as the browser to Web3 and maybe even the metaverse.\n\nThis new ecosystem can be intimidating for someone who just learned the difference between a seed phrase and a private key. How do you compare Ethereum wallets when their scope of use keeps changing? It is important to know that your wallet of choice will give you the functionality you need to traverse worlds and decentralized applications with ease.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nEthereum wallets are now more than just a banking app without the bank. They have become a place to store digital art, community membership, voting privileges and even online gaming personas.\n\nEthereum wallets are different from wallets only used for non-smart contract blockchains like Bitcoin. They have a signing function that enables users to execute complex smart functions such as depositing liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nThe need to sign multiple transactions can make it difficult to use various wallets for more complex applications such as DEXes and games.\n\nWallets that try to offer a better user experience through browser extensions of mobile apps tend to have more security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis guide will walk you through the basics of evaluating and comparing the best Ethereum wallets on the market. But first, the highlights:\n\nTop Ethereum wallets:\n\nMost Compatible: MetaMask\n\nMost Secure: Ellipal\n\nMost Secure and Compatible: Ledger\n\nMost User-Friendly: Trust Wallet\n\nMost Versatile: Argent\n\nMost Affordable: Coinbase, Meta Mask and Trust Wallet\n\nWhat\u2019s an Ethereum wallet?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is a hardware device or software enabling users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its decentralized applications (dapps) ecosystem. An Ethereum wallet supports sending and receiving ETH and Ethereum-based tokens, including crypto tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThere are three main functions of an Ethereum wallet, with one being more used than the others. These functions include:\n\nAn app: The primary use case for an Ethereum wallet is to help you manage your funds. It provides an interface to transfer assets and use the Ethereum network without much technical knowledge. Your Ethereum account: An Ethereum wallet holds access to a user\u2019s unique addresses on the blockchain and provides an immutable account of their activities on the network. With an Ethereum account, users can build a social identity across different applications such as Twitter, Reddit, and Web3 applications. A login for Ethereum apps: The Ethereum ecosystem includes a variety of dapps built around finance, gaming, predictions, NFTs, and more. An Ethereum wallet provides login access to these applications and allows users to interact with them seamlessly.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is one of the many types of cryptocurrency wallets. You can learn more about them in our in-depth guide on crypto wallets. Meanwhile, the next section analyzes what to consider when choosing an Ethereum wallet.\n\nWhat to look for in an Ethereum wallet?\n\nWhen choosing an Ethereum wallet, you need to first identify your priorities. Do you plan to use it for investing or storage or as your main interface for Ethereum-based applications? You may need multiple wallets for different purposes. Comparing these features will help you determine the best Ethereum wallet.\n\nSecurity and reputable history: Choose a wallet that integrates advanced security features and boasts a strong reputation within the crypto industry. The wallet seed phrase generation process, PIN options, and recovery process should be highly-secure for even less experienced users.\n\nIt is advisable to choose wallets with no record of a security breach. That way, users can rest assured that the company implements the best security practices and thus maintains a good reputation within the crypto industry.\n\nUser-friendliness : Investors find it helpful to look for wallets with an easy-to-navigate interface. Basic functionalities such as sending, receiving, and swapping crypto tokens should work seamlessly. Additional features such as NFT display, multiple accounts, portfolio tracking, and others should work in an intuitive manner.\n\n: Investors find it helpful to look for wallets with an easy-to-navigate interface.

Regular updates to fix security issues and improve user experience also count as one of the things to consider when choosing an Ethereum wallet. Hot or cold wallet: A hot wallet is connected to the internet and intended for regular usage. On the other hand, a cold wallet is designated for the long-term storage of your ETH and other assets. Many investors combine hot and cold wallet setups to balance their portfolio risk.\n\n10 Best Ethereum Wallets for All Users\n\nType of wallet: Browser and mobile wallet\n\nBrowser and mobile wallet USP: Connect to dapps and Web3\n\nConnect to dapps and Web3 User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Free-to-use The wallet experience could be significantly improved MetaMask is widely supported across the dapp ecosystem MetaMask does not support new-age networks such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc The wallet is EVM compatible (with support for BNBChain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.) Being a hot-wallet solution makes users susceptible to hacks and other online attack vectors MetaMask offers a built-in swap feature and portfolio tracker\n\nReleased in September 2016 by Ethereum development studio Consensys, MetaMask is arguably the most popular Ethereum wallet. It boasts over 10 million active monthly users and has grown significantly since launching on mobile devices. Initially, the wallet was only available as a browser extension.\n\nThe MetaMask wallet is a self-custodial solution. Users create a new seed phrase upon installation or import an existing one. There is also the option to import wallets via a cryptographic private key. The MetaMask wallet features a relatively straightforward experience on both mobile and browsers. MetaMask users can send and receive tokens and connect with decentralized applications across Ethereum and almost all other EVM networks.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nUSP: Advanced security\n\nUser-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons The Ledger Nano X provides secure offline storage for crypto assets Expensive for the average crypto investor The wallet is durable and portable The Ledger Live application might confuse users with more than one wallet \u2014 because the app sums up user balances, users must label wallets correctly The device supports over 5,000 crypto tokens, making it an option for investors with a diverse portfolio The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats Directly exchange and swap cryptocurrencies through supported partners\n\nThe Ledger Nano X is a USB-shaped hardware device for storing cryptocurrencies. The device stores your cryptographic keys offline, eliminating the risk of losing funds to online attackers.\n\nUsers can connect to their mobile devices via Bluetooth to manage their portfolios using the Ledger Live application available on Android and iOS. A wired connection is required to use Ledger Nano X with a Windows, macOS or Linux device.\n\nEven though this wallet is a hardware device, it is not considered cold storage or air gapped. This makes it vulnerable to certain attacks that can exploit Bluetooth and USB connections. Air-gapped wallets use QR codes to sign transactions instead of direct connections. The process can make for a clunky user experience, but it is more secure.\n\nUpon installing Ledger Live, users can set up their Ethereum app to manage ether (ETH) and other ETH-based tokens. The Ledger Nano X wallet supports Ethereum staking and is among the best-supported options for decentralized applications.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nUSP: Affordable security\n\nUser-friendliness: Simple\n\nPros Cons Secure offline storage Has fewer functionalities than the Nano Optimized to offer a seamless NFT and DeFi experience Not compatible with iOS devices It weighs less than the Nano X and is thus more portable A known issue of summing portfolio balances presents a challenge to users who manage more than one wallet with Ledger Live The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats\n\nThe Ledger Nano S Plus is a pocket-friendly alternative to the Nano X device. For around 60% of the price of the older counterpart, the Nano S device also features secure offline private key storage. More importantly, the device enables users to manage ETH and ETH-based tokens and interact with dapps.\n\nThe Ledger Nano S Plus is a predecessor to the Ledger Nano S device. An immediate improvement to the newer hardware wallet is an increased focus on optimizing the wallet for NFT and DeFi transactions. Meanwhile, the Nano S Plus device is not Bluetooth-enabled, one of the core differences between the most expensive Nano X.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nHardware wallet USP: Advanced offline security\n\nAdvanced offline security User friendliness: Simple\n\nPros Cons Trezor hardware wallets are user-friendly and offer seamless management with the Trezor Suite web and desktop apps Trezor hardware wallets do not offer native support for displaying and managing NFTs, although users can sign transactions Trezor supports the use of an advanced seed phrase for additional security Trezor devices support fewer coins and tokens compared to competitors Built-in exchange to buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrencies The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats\n\nProduced by Satoshi Labs, Trezor hardware wallets are another popular physical storage device for managing ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Trezor offers two products, the Trezor Model T and Trezor One devices.\n\nThe Trezor Model T is the more expensive option, offering advanced security features such as a touchscreen display and support for more cryptocurrencies. The Trezor One device is more affordable, enables managing fewer cryptocurrencies, and is sold at approximately 30% of the price of the Model T.\n\nHowever, both wallets are easy to set up and rank highly on the list of best Ethereum wallets. Users can connect their Trezor device to MetaMask via a simple integration to enjoy top-notch DeFi experiences.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware, cold air-gapped wallet\n\nUSP: Most secure\n\nUser-friendliness: Complex\n\nPros Cons Most secure storage Cannot connect to smart contract applications User-friendly touch screen Sending crypto requires multiple steps on different devices Wide selection of coins and staking options Requires USB updates\n\nEllipal Titan Wallet is a cold storage wallet that utilizes air-gap technology. Unlike traditional cold storage wallets, the Ellipal Titan does not connect to the internet, Bluetooth or USB. Instead, transactions are conducted using QR codes, which are generated on the Ellipal app and scanned using the Titan\u2019s camera.\n\nThis air gap technology ensures a higher level of security as it prevents the wallet from being hacked through internet connections. The Ellipal app allows users to receive coins but not to send coins, as the private keys are stored inside the Titan wallet and transactions must be signed and approved using the QR code on the wallet.\n\nThe Ellipal Titan is a highly secure wallet, but it does have the drawback of requiring manual updates using a mini-USB, as it does not connect to the internet. Unlike Trezor and Ledger, it cannot connect to Metamask to approve transactions and interact with Ethereum dapps. Overall, the Ellipal Titan is a unique and secure option for those seeking to store their cryptocurrencies in cold storage.\n\nType of wallet: Web and mobile wallet\n\nUSP: Open source\n\nUser-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Open-source wallet with multi-device support A hot wallet solution, making users susceptible to online attacks Native dapp store and NFT management application Users report frequent crashes on MyEtherWallet mobile and instability while interacting with the Polygon network Built-in token cross-chain swap functionality powered by decentralized exchanges MyEtherWallet is developer friendly, including a smart contract interaction, gas unit conversion, and verification message add-ons\n\nLaunched in 2015, MyEtherWallet is the oldest Ethereum wallet, becoming the first open-source solution for users to create and manage assets on the network. The wallet has since evolved to provide new functionalities, including a web, mobile application, and browser extension (Enkrypt).\n\nIn addition to pioneering self-custodial ownership, MyEtherWallet is compatible with most EVM-compatible networks and tokens. Users also enjoy the luxury of a built-in dapp store that features the most popular protocols and an NFT manager app.\n\nLike MetaMask, users can connect MyEtherWallet with many hardware wallets, including Ledger, Trezor and Keep Key. This integration provides another gateway for accessing dapps with funds stored in a secure offline location.\n\nType of wallet: Mobile and browser extension\n\nMobile and browser extension USP: Multichain\n\nMultichain User-friendliness: Extremely easy\n\nPros Cons Trust Wallet users can directly stake ETH and several Ethereum-based tokens Trust Wallet popularity makes users susceptible to phishing attacks Trust Wallet includes an option to track charts and prices Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Users can swap assets across different networks using the built-in multichain swap widget\n\nTrust Wallet is one of the best Ethereum wallets and boasts remarkable adoption with over 25 million users. The self-custodial wallet launched in 2017 and is notably backed by popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n\nTrust Wallet enables storing ETH and managing ERC-20 tokens. Users can simply toggle support for several assets and manage Ethereum gas fee settings based on network usage.\n\nThe Trust Wallet application also includes an NFT display feature and a native dapp store for accessing protocols across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks. Trust Wallet launched its browser extension in 2022 to broaden its user appeal and ward off competition.\n\nType of wallet: Desktop, web, and mobile wallet\n\nDesktop, web, and mobile wallet USP: Beginner friendly and multi-signature features\n\nBeginner friendly and multi-signature features User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Multi-signature features available for ether and bitcoin At the time of writing, users pay a relatively high fee of 5.7% when using the in-app purchase option to buy cryptocurrencies Guarda provides advanced security options, including biometrics unlock and Face ID The wallet is not purpose-built for accessing dapps and NFTs The wallet supports native Ethereum staking Guarda Wallet is developer-friendly with several add-ons for token creation\n\nLaunched in 2017, Guarda is another top wallet for Ethereum users. Guarda Wallet supports over 50 blockchain networks and 400,000 tokens, making it an excellent option for investors with a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe Guarda wallet is available on multiple devices and offers a user-friendly interface for managing assets. Guarda provides developer-friendly add-ons such as a token generator, mnemonic converter, Etherscan integration, and smart contract deployer.\n\nOther prominent features include a built-in multichain swap widget, fiat purchases, and a Visa debit card for users to spend cryptoassets. Unlike a handful of self-custodial wallets, Guarda also prides itself in providing prompt customer service through LiveChat and email.\n\nType of wallet: Smart contract mobile wallet\n\nSmart contract mobile wallet USP: Ethereum layer-2 wallet\n\nEthereum layer-2 wallet User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Cheap and fast transactions via Ethereum layer-2 Argent Wallet is only available on mobile Argent offers a user-friendly interface ideal for onboarding new investors to Ethereum Only supports tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain Native Ethereum-staking solution and DeFi integration No seed phrase recovery required\n\nArgent is a smart contract wallet specially designed for accessing the Ethereum layer-2 network zkSync. It replaces the traditional Externally Owned Account (EOA) model of Ethereum wallets with a smart contract model.\n\nThis enables account abstraction \u2014 where the user can interact with the Ethereum ecosystem with more functionality. For example, instead of using a seed phrase recovery system, you can set up a multi-signature solution that utilizes social recovery. It also enables transaction bundling so that engaging with smart contracts does require multiple transaction approvals.\n\nArgent offers direct Ethereum staking and the option for users to earn interest across DeFi protocols on the layer-2 solution. There is also an inbuilt swap widget and a novel recovery process for users to retrieve lost wallets without a paper backup. The only trade-off is that the wallet is focused on optimizing user experience and thus does not support the layer-1 Ethereum network.\n\nRead more: The Seed Phrase Debate: Do Wallets Really Need Them?\n\nType of wallet: Desktop, mobile, and browser wallet\n\nDesktop, mobile, and browser wallet USP: Multichain and beginner friendly\n\nMultichain and beginner friendly User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Exodus wallet offers full multichain functionalities, enabling access to Ethereum, EVM-compatible networks, and new-age networks such as Solana Supports fewer cryptocurrencies than some competitors Multi-device support, including desktop and mobile synchronization Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Native support for Ethereum staking and earning interest via DeFi protocols Exodus provides customer support through LiveChat and email\n\nLaunched in 2015, Exodus is one of the oldest cryptocurrency wallets and among the best Ethereum wallets. Exodus offers a user-friendly experience and native integrations with the Ethereum dapp ecosystem. One of these integrations is an app store that allows users to access DeFi protocols such as Compound Finance and Aave with a single click.\n\nExodus is accessible across multiple devices with Android, iOS, desktop, and browser options available to users. The wallet features an intuitive portfolio tracker and support for the Trezor Model T hardware wallet. Users can also seamlessly buy and sell crypto using Exodus mobile\u2019s numerous fiat on-ramp solutions.\n\nType of wallet: Browser and mobile wallet\n\nBrowser and mobile wallet USP: Retail friendly\n\nRetail friendly User-friendliness: Straightforward\n\nPros Cons The Coinbase wallet is more user-friendly Integrates few EVM-compatible networks compared to competitors The wallet integrates native support for Ethereum and Polygon NFTs Close ties with the Coinbase exchange mean limited privacy options for connected users Users can store ETH, all Ethereum-based tokens, and several other cryptocurrencies Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Coinbase Wallet lets users buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat\n\nDeveloped by the famous cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase, the Coinbase Wallet is a self-custodial solution for Ethereum investors. Users can browse decentralized applications from the built-in dapp store and manage NFTs from the Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n\nThe wallet initially only existed as a mobile app for Android and iOS devices. However, the company released the Coinbase Wallet browser extension in 2021, expanding its grip on market share. Coinbase\u2019s wallet is synonymous with a seamless user experience powered by a minimalistic design that even new investors can navigate.\n\nAmong other features, the Coinbase Wallet allows users to set up usernames. Thus, users can execute transactions without using hard-to-read cryptocurrency addresses. The wallet also supports Ethereum staking and the option to earn interest on crypto using DeFi protocols.\n\nEthereum wallet FAQs\n\nWhich wallet is best for Ethereum?\n\nThe best wallet for Ethereum depends on a user\u2019s needs. For instance, MetaMask is considered the best Ethereum wallet by many to easily interact with dapps across the DeFi and Web3 gaming ecosystem. However, a hardware wallet provides the best security for the long-term storage of ETH and Ethereum-based assets. Mobile wallets are ideal for day-to-day transactions involving smaller amounts, while connecting your hardware wallet to browser extensions for transaction signing provides greater security while using dapps.\n\nWhich wallet is best for Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nMost Ethereum-focused wallets, such as MetaMask and MyEtherWallet, do not support Bitcoin. Therefore, the best choice for Bitcoin and Ethereum is any of the hardware wallet devices listed in this article. Other options, including Trust Wallet, Guarda Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, enable storage and transfers for ETH and BTC.\n\nWhich is the safest Ethereum wallet?\n\nThe safest Ethereum wallet is a hardware solution such as Ledger Nano X or Trezor Model T device. These devices store a user\u2019s private key offline and provide advanced security options such as extra passphrases and customized backup solutions. Users can further ensure safety by setting up a cold-storage wallet, one not used for regular transactions.\n\nWhich is the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum?\n\nWith more than 30 million users, MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum. It is the most supported wallet on dapps and boasts significant usage within and outside the Ethereum ecosystem. Other popular options include MyEtherWallet and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nWhat is the crypto wallet with the lowest fees?\n\nMost crypto wallets allow users to set the lowest transaction fees based on network usage. Because users pay transaction fees to validators/miners on the underlying networks, crypto wallets technically do not offer low fees.\n\nChoosing rightly to secure your Ethereum assets\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has significantly evolved from its early days. Nowadays, a user can choose the best Ethereum wallet for them based on their portfolio size, dapp usage, and other specific needs. Combining one or more wallet types may help users achieve the best security practices and benefit from the numerous opportunities available on Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum price risks 20% correction amid SEC's crackdown on crypto staking - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), saw its worst daily performance of the year as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stopped Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, from offering crypto staking services.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle the SEC\u2019s allegation that it broke securities rules by offering crypto staking services to U.S. retail investors.\n\nIn particular, the news pushed down the prices of many proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain project tokens. Ethereum, which switched to a staking-based protocol in September 2022, also suffered.\n\nOn Feb. 9, ETH\u2019s price plunged nearly 6.5% to around $1,525, the largest single-day decline since Dec. 16 of last year.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView.com\n\nWill Ethereum staking survive the SEC crackdown?\n\nThe SEC's crackdown on crypto staking begins as Ethereum awaits the release of its key network upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, in March.\n\nThe update will finally allow Ether validators \u2014 entities that have locked approximately $25.6 billion worth of ETH tokens in Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract \u2014 to withdraw their assets alongside yield rewards.\n\nAs a result, multiple analysts, including Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, consider Shanghai a bullish event for Ether.\n\n\u201cToday, many investors who would like to stake ETH and earn yield are sitting on the sidelines. After all, most investment strategies can\u2019t tolerate an indefinite lock-up,\u201d wrote Hougan in his letter to investors in January, adding:\n\n\u201cSo, most investors stay out of the market. But once that indefinite lock-up is removed, the percentage of investors willing to stake their ETH will explode.\u201c\n\nBut doubts have been emerging about the future of crypto staking in the U.S., with Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase crypto exchange, fearing that the SEC would ban staking for retail investors in the future.\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nMoreover, some analysts argue that banning Ether-staking services will force users to move away from Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Ethereum requires stakers to deposit 32 ETH (~$50,000) into its PoS smart contract to be a validator. As a result, retail investors often use third-party staking services that pool smaller amounts of ETH to enable validator status.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC bans crypto staking for the public, then a majority of Ethereum validators will have to come down,\u201d argues independent analyst Ripple Van Winkle, adding:\n\n\u201cBecause you need 32 ETH to stake. Which means the ETH network is going to experience issues.\u201c\n\nETH price sees bearish rejection\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether price is positioned for a potential 20% price correction in February.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price hits 2-week low amid warning $22.5K loss means fresh dip\n\nNotably, on the daily chart, ETH price has been undergoing a pullback move after testing its multimonth descending trendline as resistance. It now holds the 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $1,525 as support.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nEther risks dropping below the 200-day EMA support wave owing to its negative market fundamentals. Such a scenario includes the next downside target at $1,200, which coincides with a multimonth ascending trendline support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Mining: Understanding The Second Largest Cryptocurrency - Simplilearn",
        "content": "According to MarketCap, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a current value of $2,921.50. Recently, Bitmain, a company that manufactures ASIC chips for crypto-mining, has announced a release of an Application Specific Circuit(ASIC) miner for Ethereum Mining. Thus, indicating to its developers that the Ethereum Mining Industry is going to be doubling down at Proof-of-Work only.\n\nTill today almost 115,708,027 Ethereum has been mined with a trading volume of $29,107,123,138.\n\nIf you are interested in Ethereum and Ethereum Mining, then you are in the right place.\n\nIn this Ethereum Mining tutorial, you will look into the various concepts and components around Ethereum Mining.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nIntroduction to Ethereum\n\nEthereum is defined as a blockchain-based computing platform that enables its developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency for Ethereum, which is used to build decentralized applications, smart contracts, and make standard peer-to-peer payments.\n\nEther acts as fuel for the Ethereum Network. It tracks and facilitates all the transactions in the network.\n\nEthereum Coin\n\nFeatures of Ethereum\n\nNow, have a look at the features of Ethereum that make it so different from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum ensures all the transactions in the Ethereum blockchain are cryptographically more secure.\n\nAll transactions performed under the Ethereum blockchain are immutable. That is, once the data is written and stored, it cannot change. This makes it more difficult to hack or manipulate.\n\nEthereum has the largest developer community globally, which gives it a tremendous advantage over other protocols.\n\nYou can instantly connect the applications built on Ethereum to hundreds of different protocols like finance and marketing, known as money legos.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Mining?\n\nIn simple words, Ethereum Mining is a process of creating and adding a block of transactions to the blockchain network of Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, it uses the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\nAll transactions taking place in the Ethereum network need to get approved by the miners.\n\nMiners use a Hashing Scrypt (Ethash) to solve computationally hard puzzles for successfully mining the blocks of transactions, in the Ethereum Blockchain Network.\n\nThis process helps secure the network from attacks like hacking or manipulation of identity.\n\nEthereum Mining\n\nWhy Should You Mine Ethereum?\n\nThe primary goal for mining Ethereum is to make money.\n\nIt turns the act of securing the network into a relatively complex, but profitable business.\n\nMiners receive a certain amount as a reward for mining each block of the Ethereum Blockchain Network, including the transaction fees paid by the users.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Mining\n\nThere are three ways of performing Ethereum Mining :\n\nPool Mining\n\nSolo Mining\n\nCloud Mining\n\nPool Mining\n\nPool Mining is the easiest and fastest way to get started with Ethereum Mining.\n\nAlong with other people, you work together in a single pool. And if someone gets the hashcode correctly, they share the reward among everyone in the Pool.\n\nImportant Factors that you should consider before joining a Pool are:\n\nPool size\n\n\n\nMinimum Payout\n\n\n\nPool fee\n\nPool size is the factor that determines the number of blocks you find in the Ethereum network and its share rewards. As the number of miners increases, the chances to get rewards also increase.\n\nHowever, the more people, the smaller your share in the reward.\n\nMinimum Payout is the minimum amount of Ethereum you need to mine before it gets credited to your wallet.\n\nPools with large Minimum Payouts are not beneficial as you will have to wait in the same pool for a longer period before getting your reward.\n\nTherefore, pools with small Minimum Payouts are considered to be a safer option. You will get paid frequently without committing your time to a single Pool for too long.\n\nEvery pool has a certain amount of Pool fee associated with it. It is the amount you need to pay to continue using the pool. This amount is percentage-based, on the amount of Ethereum you are mining. It mainly varies between 1% to 3%.\n\nNote: It would help more if you went for Pool Mining because you might get a smaller reward, but you will not have to wait for days or weeks to get no reward.\n\nSolo Mining\n\nIn Ethereum Solo Mining, you will get rewarded only if you solve the puzzle and mine the Ethereum block first.\n\nNote: Here, since you are competing with many people and companies, you have to be very good at your work.\n\nSolo Mining is only profitable when you have plenty of resources with you, like a 100+ Graphics Card. But it has its disadvantages like:\n\nElectricity costs - Having so much equipment and other electrical devices like fans and lights may use a lot of electricity, leading to high electricity bills.\n\nSpace - Space is a real problem because not everyone has a considerable amount of area to set up all the resources and equipment needed for mining Ethereum.\n\nCloud Mining\n\nIn Ethereum Cloud Mining, you pay someone else with the equipment to mine Ethereum for you. You pay some amount of money as fees to them for investing their time and resources, and in return, they provide you with the reward they gain by mining Ethereum.\n\nBut this technique of mining Ethereum has some pros and cons too.\n\nPros\n\nYou are not responsible for any equipment damage.\n\nYou don't have to acquire all the necessary equipment and look for ample space to store it. You can sit back, observe the market and enjoy the reward for your investment in Ethereum Mining.\n\nCons\n\nIf the Ethereum price drops, then there is no way you are getting your money back. The money you invested, or the fees you paid to the miner, is lost.\n\nYou can't ask the other person to change their equipment according to your concern.\n\nEthereum Cloud Mining is considered a safer way for mining service providers to guarantee a profit for the resources they have purchased.\n\nHow Does the Mining Process Work?\n\nEthereum Mining follows a specific set of steps to function.\n\nA user requests a transaction with the help of the private key of his digital wallet account. Then the request is shared worldwide with the Ethereum network. Next, the requested transaction is added to a list of pending transactions that need to be added to the Ethereum blockchain network. The miner then verifies and validates the requested transaction and performs a complex mathematical puzzle on the transaction data. Once the requested transaction is verified and it stores a copy of it in EVM, the process of \"Proof-of-Work\" begins for the respective block. Then, the nodes of the Ethereum Network verify that the checksum of the state of the miner's block matches the checksum of their updated state of EVM after execution of all transactions. Only after that, the block is added to the Ethereum Blockchain Network. On successfully mining the block, it rewards the miner with some amount of Ether in their wallet. Then the requested transaction is approved and credited to the respective wallet/wallets.\n\nEach transaction is mined only once, but every participant of the Ethereum Network verifies it.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum?\n\nTools you will need to be an efficient miner for Ethereum on your personal computer are :\n\nAn Ethereum wallet to store all your currency earned.\n\nGPU drivers or Graphics Card with a minimum of 3GB RAM.\n\nA mining software suitable according to your hardware like GPU.\n\nAnd a compatible operating system (Windows 7 or 10, 64 bit).\n\nCreate an Ethereum Wallet\n\nBefore getting started with mining Ethereum, you need to create an Ethereum Wallet to store all your Ether.\n\nTrezor Model T and Ledger Nano are the most reliable and secure wallets in the market of cryptocurrency.\n\nInstalling Your GPU drivers or Graphics Card\n\nAfter creating your digital wallet, you need to update all the hardware, i.e., drives in your system.\n\nYou can use two types of Graphics Cards, they are :\n\nAMD Graphics Card\n\nNvidia Graphics Card\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All!

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake in how Kraken\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission plays out for the crypto industry.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the SEC announced that crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine for not registering the offering and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Just a day before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned on Twitter that he\u2019d heard \u201cthe SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, it sounds like something that should have been bad for all crypto staking services. But that\u2019s not quite how the news landed. The governance tokens for Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the largest pooled staking services, soared as high as 11% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that the market thinks centralized exchanges acting as staking intermediaries, like Kraken and Coinbase, should worry, but not the rest of the industry. In the past day, Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) selling volume has outpaced buying at a ratio of almost 3:1, according to GeckoTerminal.\n\nStaked assets on proof-of-stake networks, like Ethereum, help keep networks running. They\u2019re how validators, whose hardware stores data and processes new transactions, prove they have skin in the game. Validators receive rewards for participating on networks, but can lose some of their staked assets for inactivity or other offenses.\n\nBecoming a standalone Ethereum validator, which is now the largest proof of stake network, isn\u2019t easy for most retail-level investors. A user would need 32 ETH, worth roughly $48,000 at current prices, to do it. Instead, users with more modest amounts of ETH to stake turn to staking-as-a-service and pooled staking providers.\n\nThose come in two different flavors: straightforward and liquid staking. The latter is meant to give users the best of both worlds: They get a share of validator rewards for their deposited ETH and a token, redeemable for their staked assets, that can be traded or used as collateral.\n\nAs a category, the 65 liquid-staking protocols tracked by DeFi Llama account for $12 billion, or 26%, of the $47 billion worth of assets in the DeFi ecosystem. That means they\u2019re the third-largest category behind $13 billion in lending, and $19 billion on decentralized exchanges, or DEXes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than $11 billion worth of the assets in liquid-staking protocols is Ethereum. And among the 16 protocols that support ETH staking, Lido is far and away the largest. It accounts for $8 billion, or 75%, of the funds that have been deposited.\n\nIt seems at least part of the problem the SEC had with Kraken\u2019s program was an oversimplification of staking to make it less intimidating for retail customers. A section of the SEC\u2019s complaint takes issue with the fact that Kraken itself determined the returns that its customers would receive, as opposed to the variable rate of rewards determined by the protocol.\n\n\u201cDefendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on the actual returns that Kraken receives from staking,\u201d the commission wrote.\n\nBy doing so, Kraken made itself too much of an intermediary, Alex Mogul, senior director of staking and infrastructure at Republic Crypto, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you're depositing to Kraken and then Kraken handles the math, that\u2019s far and away easier than trying to switch the network that you're engaging with, then press transact to delegate stake. It is really complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nFor its part, Coinbase has said its staking program is not like Kraken\u2019s.\n\n\u201cStaking on Coinbase continues to be available and staked assets continue to earn protocol rewards. What\u2019s clear from today\u2019s announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a statement yesterday. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities. For example, our customers\u2019 rewards depend on the rewards paid by the protocol, and commissions we disclose.\u201d\n\nMogul, who leads the Runtime staking-as-a-service offering at Republic Crypto, said she hopes to see software, like better designed wallets, fill the gap that might now be left by centralized exchanges in staking options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still think we can build software products that abstract that complexity without sacrificing who's in custody of the assets,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the other end of the investor spectrum, Jaydeep Korde, Launchnodes co-Founder and CEO, said the Kraken settlement will push business towards decentralized alternatives.\n\nHis company offers non-custodial staking solutions for institutions or high-net-worth individuals who have the 32 ETH required to run their own node, but don\u2019t want to handle the tech on their own. The user owns the infrastructure used to operate a validator, but Launchnodes handles all the upkeep.\n\n\u201cBy running your staking operations on infrastructure you own, it avoids needing to trust compliant, regulated or non-regulated crypto businesses that are seemingly ever bigger governance and operational holes,\u201d he told Decrypt in an email."

        "title": "What investors need to know about \u2018staking,\u2019 the passive income opportunity at the center of crypto\u2019s latest regulation scare - CNBC",
        "content": "Not six months ago, ether led a recovery in cryptocurrency prices ahead of a big tech upgrade that would make something called \"staking\" available to crypto investors.\n\nMost people have hardly wrapped their heads around the concept, but now, the price of ether is falling amid mounting fears that the Securities and Exchange Commission could crack down on it.\n\nOn Thursday, Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, closed its staking program in a $30 million settlement with the SEC, which said the company failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThe night before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned his Twitter followers that the securities regulator may want more broadly to end staking for U.S. retail customers.\n\n\"This should put everyone on notice in this marketplace,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Friday morning. \"Whether you call it lend, earn, yield, whether you offer an annual percentage yield \u2013 that doesn't matter. If someone is taking [customer] tokens and transferring to their platform, the platform controls it.\"\n\nStaking has widely been seen as a catalyst for mainstream adoption of crypto and a big revenue opportunity for exchanges like Coinbase. A clampdown on staking, and staking services, could have damaging consequences not just for those exchanges, but also Ethereum and other proof-of-stake blockchain networks. To understand why, it helps to have a basic understanding of the activity in question.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nStaking is a way for investors to earn passive yield on their cryptocurrency holdings by locking tokens up on the network for a period of time. For example, if you decide you want to stake your ether holdings, you would do so on the Ethereum network. The bottom line is it allows investors to put their crypto to work if they're not planning to sell it anytime soon.\n\nHow does staking work?\n\nStaking is sometimes referred to as the crypto version of a high-interest savings account, but there's a major flaw in that comparison: crypto networks are decentralized, and banking institutions are not.\n\nEarning interest through staking is not the same thing as earning interest from a high annual percentage yield offered by a centralized platform like those that ran into trouble last year, like BlockFi and Celsius, or Gemini just last month. Those offerings really were more akin to a savings account: people would deposit their crypto with centralized entities that lent those funds out and promised rewards to the depositors in interest (of up to 20% in some cases). Rewards vary by network but generally, the more you stake, the more you earn.\n\nBy contrast, when you stake your crypto, you are contributing to the proof-of-stake system that keeps decentralized networks like Ethereum running and secure; you become a \"validator\" on the blockchain, meaning you verify and process the transactions as they come through, if chosen by the algorithm. The selection is semi-random \u2013 the more crypto you stake, the more likely you'll be chosen as a validator.\n\nThe lock-up of your funds serves as a sort of collateral that can be destroyed if you as a validator act dishonestly or insincerely.\n\nThis is true only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network like Bitcoin uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nIn most cases, investors won't be staking themselves \u2013 the process of validating network transactions is just impractical on both the retail and institutional levels.\n\nThat's where crypto service providers like Coinbase, and formerly Kraken, come in. Investors can give their crypto to the staking service and the service does the staking on the investors' behalf. When using a staking service, the lock-up period is determined by the networks (like Ethereum or Solana), and not the third party (like Coinbase or Kraken).\n\nIt's also where it gets a little murky with the SEC, which said Thursday that Kraken should have registered the offer and sale of the crypto asset staking-as-a-service program with the securities regulator.\n\nWhile the SEC hasn't given formal guidance on what crypto assets it deems securities, it generally sees a red flag if someone makes an investment with a reasonable expectation of profits that would be derived from the work or effort of others.\n\nCoinbase has about 15% of the market share of Ethereum assets, according to Oppenheimer. The industry's current retail staking participation rate is 13.7% and growing.\n\nProof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work\n\nStaking works only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network, like Bitcoin, uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nThe two are simply the protocols used to secure cryptocurrency networks.\n\nProof-of-work requires specialized computing equipment, like high-end graphics cards to validate transactions by solving highly complex math problems. Validators gets rewards for each transaction they confirm. This process requires a ton of energy to complete.\n\nEthereum's big migration to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work improved its energy efficiency almost 100%.\n\nRisks involved\n\nThe source of return in staking is different from traditional markets. There aren't humans on the other side promising returns, but rather the protocol itself paying investors to run the computational network.\n\nDespite how far crypto has come, it's still a young industry filled with technological risks, and potential bugs in the code is a big one. If the system doesn't work as expected, it's possible investors could lose some of their staked coins.\n\nVolatility is and has always been a somewhat attractive feature in crypto but it comes with risks, too. One of the biggest risks investors face in staking is simply a drop in the price. Sometimes a big decline can lead smaller projects to hike their rates to make a potential opportunity more attractive."

        "content": "On February 9th, DappRadar published a report showing that the Ethereum NFT market cap value fell by 59.60% from $9.3 billion in 2022 to around $3.7 billion in early 2023.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s study is based on the marketcap analysis of 81 of the largest NFT collections running on the Ethereum network.\n\n2/ The market cap for 81 Ethereum collections analyzed by our machine-learning algorithm experienced a decrease of 59.60% in USD value, from $9.3B in the beginning of 2022 to $3.7B at the end of the year. \ud83d\udcc9 \u2014 DappRadar (@DappRadar) February 9, 2023\n\nAccording to DappRadar the collapse of Terra Luna in May 2022 was the main cause of the 88% market cap loss of NFT projects running on Ethereum by June 2022.\n\nTherefore, the drop in the market cap of NFT projects was not due to a lack of interest on the part of investors but to the manipulations of bad actors in the ecosystem. This is probably the main cause of the broader collapse of the crypto industry, as during the collapse of FTX, the market cap of the entire NFT ecosystem crashed following the global crypto market.\n\nThese Were The Highest Earning NFT Collections On Ethereum Since 2022\n\nThe report noted that some projects launched during 2021 and early 2022 had \u201csignificant market cap growth\u201d of up to 260%. Among those projects were the Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and Degen Toonz collections, whose market cap appreciated by 113.89%, 260%, and 204%, respectively.\n\nAmong the newer NFT projects, which were launched after the collapse of Terra Luna are: The Potatoz with a market cap growth of 134.68%, Renga with 211.63%, DigiDaigaku with 209.88%, and God Hates NFT with 1,653.28%.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that all of these projects managed to see dramatic growth, despite the fact that ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum network, saw a 60% price drop over the last year due to the bear market.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club Dominates The Market\n\nAccording to DappRadar, Yuga Labs, the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club project, dominated the Ethereum network\u2019s NFT market, \u201cestablishing itself as a leading player in the NFT industry\u201d, despite the exponential fall of other projects.\n\nDespite Yuga Labs\u2019 collection accounting for 67% of the total value of the NFT market on Ethereum, Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s market capitalization saw a 64.92% depreciation falling from $2.6bn to $934m by the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop Yuga Labs from buying two of the largest NFT collections on the market, CryptoPunks and Meebits, for an undisclosed sum to date. Both collections are already seeing a significant rebound after suffering declines of up to 60% in 2022.\n\nBut now that the crypto market is showing signs of a recovery, probably the NFT ecosystem has some chance to breathe. And we might be seeing green pastures ahead as just recently, trading activity around blue-chip collections started to spike, and now there are even NFTs taking over the Bitcoin network."

        "content": "Coinbase CEO\u2019s tweet sparked speculation on SEC\u2019s new crypto rulings.\n\nNew regulations could impact the crypto industry and lead to problems.\n\nThe crypto world has been buzzing for the last 24 hours, thanks to a tweet by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The speculation triggered by the tweet revolved around the potential impact of the SEC\u2019s new rulings on the crypto space.\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nArmstrong\u2019s tweet suggested that the SEC might look to eliminate crypto staking for retail customers in the U.S. The reason cited for this move was the SEC\u2019s view of Ethereum as a security post the launch of its staking feature.\n\nArmstrong added that regulation by enforcement would force companies to move offshore. This would lead to more FTX-like problems for the crypto industry, according to him.\n\nPost-update FUD?\n\nArmstrong\u2019s tweet may trigger FUD in the crypto space, as many prominent Twitter accounts added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe situation was further compounded by the news of the SEC\u2019s investigation of the Kraken exchange. The reason cited for the investigation was the suspicion of the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nKraken, the second-largest U.S. exchange, is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of unregistered securities and may settle in the coming days, according to Bloomberg. https://t.co/yrxxuMdAE2 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2023\n\nImpact on Ethereum\n\nThese developments could potentially impact the growth of Ethereum, especially with the much-awaited Shanghai Upgrade. Despite this, at press time, the Ethereum network continued to set new records, with the number of non-zero addresses exceeding 94 million and the total number of ETH 2.0 staked addresses surpassing 527,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETH worth today?\n\nHowever, the number of large addresses on Ethereum declined during this period. Moreover, the number of addresses holding over 10 coins reached a one-month low of 350,897 at press time. This decline in the sentiment could possibly signal a reversal of the bullish interest in Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigations and potential new rulings could impact Ethereum negatively. However, the network continued to grow at press time. It remains to be seen how the situation will impact the crypto space."

        "title": "What is crypto staking and why did the SEC just go after Kraken for it? - Fortune",
        "content": "In the latest of a string of actions brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that it broke the agency\u2019s rules by offering a service that allowed investors to earn rewards by \u201cstaking\u201d their coins. The SEC is pushing to bring crypto operators within the US under the same regulatory framework that governs the sale of all sorts of securities \u2014 to treat the tokens much like stocks and bonds. What\u2019s different from other crackdown efforts is that staking is a central feature of many blockchains such as Ethereum and key to potentially switching other cryptocurrencies away from a system that requires vast amounts of electricity.\n\n1. What is staking?\n\nIt\u2019s depositing Ether or other cryptocurrencies for use in what\u2019s known as a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d system that helps run a blockchain network by ordering transactions in a way that creates a secure public record. Ethereum in September switched to staking to replace the \u201cproof-of-work\u201d system pioneered by Bitcoin, which continues to use it. Ethereum\u2019s switch was said to cut the network\u2019s energy usage by about 99%, an important step for an industry that has come under fire for the amount of electricity it uses.\n\n2. What are the \u2018proof of\u2019 systems for?\n\nCryptocurrencies wouldn\u2019t work without blockchain, a relatively new technology that performs the old-fashioned function of maintaining a ledger of time-ordered transactions. What\u2019s different from pen-and-paper records is that the ledger is shared on computers all around the world. Blockchain has to take on another task not needed in a world of physical money \u2014 making sure that no one is able to spend a cryptocurrency token more than once by manipulating the digital ledger. Blockchains operate without a central guardian, such as a bank, in charge of the ledger: Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems rely on group action to order and safeguard a blockchain\u2019s sequential record.\n\n3. How are the two different?\n\nIn both systems, transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks\u201d that were published to a public \u201cchain.\u201d In proof of work, that happens when the system compresses the data in the block into a puzzle that can only be solved through trial-and-error computations that can potentially need to be run millions of time. This work is done by miners who compete to be the first to come up with a solution and are rewarded with new cryptocurrency if other miners agree it works. Proof of stake works by giving a group of people a set of carrot-and-stick incentives to collaborate on the task. An example: People who put up, or stake, 32 Ether (1 Ether traded at around $1,519 on Feb. 10) can become \u201cvalidators,\u201d while those with less Ether can become validators on Ethereum jointly. Validators are chosen to order blocks of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n4. What\u2019s the incentive for staking?\n\nIf a block is accepted by a committee whose members are called attestors, validators are awarded new Ether. But someone who tried to game the system could lose the coins that were staked. Typically people who stake their coins are rewarded by earning yields of about 4% for staking-as-a-service users on Ethereum.\n\n5. What\u2019s the SEC\u2019s issue with staking?\n\nKraken and other centralized providers had been offering \u201cstaking as a service,\u201d which lets users stake their coins without buying or maintaining the computers needed for staking. The agency\u2019s action against Kraken makes clear that it considers this to be akin to crypto lending, in which providers would pay crypto depositors high rates of interest for lending out their coins. It\u2019s a practice regulators cracked down on last year, when a slew of lenders like Celsius Network, BlockFi and others collapsed. The SEC considers both crypto lending and staking-as-a-service programs to be securities, a designation that imposes a wide range of regulatory requirements that crypto used to think it was immune from. Kraken agreed to immediately cease offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services in the US; it didn\u2019t admit or deny allegations in the SEC complaint.\n\n6. What does it mean for something to be a security?\n\nIn its most simple form, whether something is or isn\u2019t a security under US rules is basically a question of how much it looks like shares issued by a company raising money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Under that framework, an asset can be under SEC purview when it involves a. investors kicking in money b. into a common enterprise with c. the intention of profiting from d. the efforts of the organization\u2019s leadership. In staking-as-a-service, users deposit their coins with the expectation of earning a yield on them, while the service provider takes care of the technical side of things.\n\n7. Why does being labeled a security matter?\n\nFor starters, such designations may make running a staking-as-a-service program more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection and disclosure requirements. This burden would put smaller providers at a disadvantage compared to deeper-pocketed competitors. What\u2019s more, exchanges that try to continue offering the service would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in a worst case, prosecutions if criminal authorities ever got involved. It could also mean losing future funding from investors who may be skittish of those increased compliance burdens and regulatory scrutiny. Supporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors \u2014 and would ultimately bring more users into the services.\n\n8. What might a crackdown on crypto staking mean?\n\nThe crackdown only applies to staking-as-a-service providers focused on US consumers. Blockchains are typically secured by validators from around the world, so they will continue to function, assuming overseas regulators take a more lenient view of their services. This would further the split between heavy regulation in the US and the Wild West in some other parts of the world. There are questions about whether the tightening of regulations surrounding staking will impact so-called decentralized staking providers, which claim to be immune to them because they are not operated by a particular company or based in a particular place; in theory, such providers are just collections of software that execute transactions automatically. But many of these decentralized finance (DeFi) services are actually run by a core group of people whom regulators could potentially still hold responsible for noncompliance."

        "content": "Ethereum Bearish Signal: California-based crypto exchange, Kraken had agreed to shut its cryptocurrency staking operations after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused the platform of offering an unregistered crypto staking program. According to the SEC, it is a violation of the U.S. securities law.\n\nThis major step by the SEC sent shockwaves in the crypto market causing the price of major cryptocurrencies drop. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, lost approximately 5.34% in the last 24 hours, bringing it back down to the level of $1.5k.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Struggles\n\nThe downtrend in ETH price is being driven by strong selling pressure. The ETH price was able to climb above $1,700 on February 03, 2023, and remained stable near the $1,650 level over the past few weeks. With a live market cap of $188 billion, CoinMarketCap is currently ranked #2.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Have a Huge Impact\n\nIn March 2023, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will go live. ETH stakers will be able to withdraw their cryptocurrency currently locked in the ETH 2.0 smart contract.\n\nThere is plenty of room for the 14% ratio to rise, the bank said, given that the average for other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks is about four times as high, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAssuming the staking ratio converges over time to the 60% average of other major PoS networks, the validator number could increase from 0.5 million to 2.2 million and the yield would fall from 7.4% current to around 5%.\u201d\n\nNow that the cryptocurrency market is projecting a bearish trend, this upgrade seems the only hope for ETH holders. It can lead Ethereum toward a massive surge, or investors can witness the price dump, nobody knows, but it\u2019s just a matter of time until we find out!\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Progress: Will ETH Price Rise Or Fall?"

        "content": "DeFi is shorthand for \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d a way of conducting financial business utilizing peer-to-peer networks, blockchains, and other developing technologies to eliminate intermediaries and central oversight. In a traditional financial system, banks and various third parties like credit card companies facilitate essentially every step of the movement of money from one person to another.\n\nDeFi aims to allow for these transfers to occur in a secure way but without the scrutiny\u2014and the costs, privacy concerns, and occasional delays\u2014associated with these third parties.\n\nTools of DeFi\n\nDeFi has emerged as a focal point among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as the Ethereum network and its powerful smart contract capabilities have developed. Proponents of DeFi utilize various systems to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies. These include individual tokens\u2014and particularly stablecoins\u2014as well as exchanges, networks, and decentralized apps.\n\nDeFi Protocols\n\nOne reason Ethereum and smart contracts have been crucial to the development of DeFi is because of protocols. DeFi protocols are simply codes, procedures, and rules which govern the systems utilized in DeFi. Through DeFi protocols, participants in the ecosystem are able to trade, lend, stake tokens, and much more. These protocols must be accessible to all wallets so that anyone participating in the DeFi system can follow the same set of rules.\n\nWhat is MakerDAO?\n\nBy and large, DeFi protocols are autonomous programs encoded into smart contracts either on Ethereum or a similar blockchain ecosystem. Most protocols attempt to identify and improve upon one or more traditional financial processes. As an example, a DeFi protocol could aggregate data from various decentralized crypto exchanges in an effort to consolidate trading and liquidity pools in order to make transacting more straightforward for users.\n\nUnderstandably, many DeFi protocols use highly complex procedures in an effort to simplify and increase accessibility. When comparing different protocols, one metric that may be helpful is total value locked (TVL). TVL refers to the total underlying supply of tokens that is being secured by a specific application. The largest DeFi protocol as of mid-2022 by TVL is MakerDAO, with a TVL of over $7.5 billion as of June of that year. This protocol enables users to borrow and lend crypto tokens. Users lock their own crypto assets in exchange for tokens of a stablecoin called DAI. Participants can lend and borrow, while the MakerDAO protocol uses smart contracts to liquidate loans and sell collateral to support the stability of DAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn astonishing thing about DeFi protocols is how wide-ranging they are. There are protocols allowing users to move assets from one blockchain network to another, to swap various pegged assets, to create their own liquidity pools, to take and offer loans, and much more. DeFi protocols even allow users to put money away into savings account alternatives or to take on riskier, advanced investments like derivatives.\n\nSome of the Most Popular DeFi Protocols\n\nBesides MakerDAO, some of the other best-known and most popular DeFi protocols include:\n\nAAVE: AAVE is a lending protocol which has its own native token, also called AAVE.\n\nUniSwap: UniSwap is a decentralized exchange operating in the DeFi space. Users can earn native UNI tokens by offering liquidity.\n\nCurve: Curve is a liquidity aggregator bringing together assets that have the same peg, such as stablecoins.\n\n0x Protocol: 0x allows users to move assets from Ethereum to Polygon, where fees tend to be lower.\n\nCompound: Compound provides lending and borrowing capabilities that exist outside of a centralized financial system. It is a decentralized marketplace giving users the opportunity to lock crypto assets in order to participate in the loan market.\n\nCheat Sheet"

        "title": "Same brand stablecoins can carry different risks - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "When the FTX crypto exchange collapsed last year, the focus turned to the biggest exchange, Binance. People worried about the amount of the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin that the exchange holds because they thought it was self-issued. That\u2019s not entirely correct. Binance outsources the issuance of BUSD to New York-regulated trust company Paxos, which has a conservative approach towards reserve assets, holding them in cash or Treasuries.\n\nHowever, Paxos is only responsible for BUSD issuance on Ethereum, not the four other blockchains on which BUSD is available. \u201cThe NYDFS must approve our BUSD operations, including the blockchains on which BUSD tokens may be listed,\u201d Paxos told us via email. \u201cToday, BUSD is approved for issuance only on Ethereum. Paxos is not involved in the management or support of wrapped versions of BUSD.\u201d And it makes that clear on the Paxos website.\n\nBinance issues BUSD on other chains, including its own-brand blockchain Binance Chain. Together these amount to about a third of the total issuance of BUSD. It doesn\u2019t create it out of thin air but uses the Ethereum BUSD as the 1:1 backing asset. This wrapping of a token to make it usable on another blockchain network is commonplace in crypto, but not without risks. The obvious ones are who has keys to the wallets and how to ensure the 1:1 backing is in sync.\n\nNon-ethereum BUSD stablecoin wasn\u2019t always 100% backed\n\nIt turns out that BUSD on other chains was not always 1:1 backed in the past, although Binance said it rectified the process last year. It claimed the issues were a timing difference and it now rebalances more regularly.\n\nBinance locks BUSD on Ethereum in a specific wallet and issues the BUSD on the other chains, with Binance Chain making up most of it. Currently, this \u2018Binance-peg BUSD\u2019 accounts for $5.44 billion, a third of the total $16.3 billion on the Ethereum chain.\n\nIn the blog post about the mismatch of the backing assets, Binance refers to the BUSD issued on the other chains as Binance-Peg BUSD or PBUSD. But on the blockchains themselves, they appear as BUSD. The same branding as on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBlockchain explorers have a disclaimer for BUSD that it is pegged BUSD. \u201cIt is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the NYDFS,\u201d reads the disclaimer. But how many people will view the explorer, especially if they hold stablecoins on an exchange?\n\nBUSD is not the only stablecoin where the core issuer is not responsible for issuance on all chains.\n\nUSDC is another example where the stablecoin on the popular Polygon blockchain is bridged. However this only accounts for around 2% of USDC\u2019s $41 billion issuance. The issuer of USDC, Circle, provides Bridged USDC terms of service allowing those with a Circle Account to redeem the Polygon USDC for dollars.\n\nHowever, Binance also wraps almost $900 million USDC on the Binance Chain, which is not directly covered by Circle\u2019s terms of service.\n\nUsing the same brand when there are different risks results in potential consumer misconceptions because they don\u2019t appreciate the difference.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\nThere\u2019s a vast difference in trustworthiness between an issuer that\u2019s a regulated trust company such as Paxos and an unregulated blockchain startup that decided to wrap tokens. For all we know, the startup might leave the wallet keys available to all staff on Slack. Allegedly FTX did something similar.\n\nWrapped Bitcoins are tradable on the Ethereum network. The symbol is not BTC. It is wBTC. So an obvious solution is a branding indicator for wrapped stablecoins rather than an obscure disclaimer that a user might never see. So \u2018Binance-Peg BUSD\u2019 should be something like wBUSD or pBUSD. The same goes for bridged USDC.\n\nWhether or not that will make a difference remains to be seen. After all, Tether remains the most popular stablecoin despite evidence that it has not been fully backed at all times.\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins are meant to be lower risk tokens, so there\u2019s a need to be more conservative. It\u2019s generally accepted that issuers need to be regulated. But what about organizations that wrap stablecoins? It\u2019s still possible to achieve composability, such as creating programmable money based on stablecoins without handing over keys to large quantities of digital currency.\n\nIn other related news, there are reports that one of the Paxos regulators, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is probing Paxos. However, an NYDFS spokesperson told Bloomberg that it keeps in contact with regulated entities to understand crypto market risks.\n\nStablecoin fragmentation beyond wrapping\n\nApart from multi-chain issuance, there\u2019s additional potential for fragmentation within a brand. There could be multiple issuers of the same brand of stablecoin on the same chain. Or the same parent company might issue the stablecoin in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nUSDC is associated with issuer Circle, but the USDC stablecoin is governed by Centre, which originally planned multiple issuers for USDC. With different entities issuing the same brand of stablecoin, the issuers will always have different risk profiles.\n\nSingapore regulators plan to incorporate some international supervision where a stablecoin is issued in multiple jurisdictions, even if by the same entity.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with Europe\u2019s MiCA regulations, the crypto-asset sector moves quickly and it\u2019s hard for regulations to keep up. With stablecoin rules in the works in several jurisdictions, there\u2019s a need to consider wrapped stablecoins and other ways in which same-brand stablecoins carry different risks."

The latter has been in early access beta access mode since June 2022 and was previously only available to a select number of merchants.\n\nWith tokengating, all applicable Shopify merchants can now set up their stores to dictate which tokenholders can and cannot gain access to exclusive products, nonfungible token (NFT) drops and benefits.\n\nThe tool verifies user eligibility via their connected wallet and is being touted as a handy way for NFT Merchants to reward certain users or add exclusivity to specific products.\n\nTokengating example. Source: Shopify\n\nIn terms of expanded crypto wallet support, Shopify has integrated with the sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) protocol led by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSIWE essentially enables secure user sign-ins and authentication of Ethereum accounts and ENS domains without giving away private identifiers to third parties, such as names, phone numbers and residential addresses.\n\nThe topic of private user information has been a sour spot for Shopify in the past. In April 2022, a group of disgruntled users filed a class-action lawsuit against the firm and hardware wallet provider Ledger concerning a hefty leak of user data in 2020.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella transition is \u2018on the horizon\u2019\n\nENS Labs community advocate @sadaf.eth highlighted the SIWE integration with Shopify via Twitter on Feb. 9 and linked to developer documents explaining how to build the tool into Shopify stores, much to the delight of some from the Ethereum community.\n\n\u201cThe statementGenerator prop allows you to customize the statement displayed in a Sign-In with Ethereum message. The function receives the address of the wallet that has connected, allowing you to expand and customize your message statements to better suit your brand,\u201d the document reads.\n\nAt this stage, once a merchant hooks up the SIWE feature on Shopify wallet connect, it appears that users will be able to click a \u201csign-in with Ethereum\u201d button to connect their addresses via SIWE\u2019s partnered intermediaries such as Coinbase, Fortmatic, WalletConnect, Portis and Torus."

        "content": "ETH tanked to a two-week low at press time.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s staking activity was not massively impacted.\n\nThe crypto space felt the pinch of yet another U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruling. According to a 10 February tweet by Wu Blockchain, Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the U.S., \u201cimmediately\u201d ceased its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers.\n\nThe U.S. SEC charged Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program and advertise annual investment returns of as much as 21 percent. Kraken agreed to immediately cease staking products and pay $30 million penalties. \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 10, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThis was done after the SEC charged Kraken with a $30 million penalty once the latter failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto staking program. Moreover, Kraken confirmed that it would unstake all assets other than Ethereum [ETH], since ETH unstaking would only be possible after the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nETH tanked to its two-week low at the time of writing.\n\nEnd of staking is near?\n\nThis development came less than 24 hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s speculative tweet on the future of crypto staking in the U.S. sparked FUD in the crypto space. Now that the ruling has been made public, Coinbase, too, felt the heat. Its shares plummeted by about 14% during Thursday\u2019s trading hours, its biggest drop since July 2022.\n\nBrian Armstrong took to Twitter again to assuage the crypto community and stated that Coinbase would protect its customers from \u2018government outreach.\u2019\n\nWe will keep fighting for economic freedom (our mission at Coinbase). Some days being the most trusted brand in crypto means protecting our customers from government overreach. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 10, 2023\n\nThere have been apprehensions over SEC\u2019s view of ETH as a security post its staking feature. SEC chair Gary Gensler said,\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors\u2019 tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws.\u201d\n\nShould ETH investors press the panic button?\n\nThe news created doubts in the minds of ETH investors, which was evident in the fall in ETH balances on exchanges, per data from Glassnode. At the same time, the number of daily active addresses also dipped by 5%.\n\nInterestingly, staking activity remained immune to a greater degree, as revealed by the increase in ETH staked. Additionally, the growth in validators on ETH 2.0 also rose steadily. However, with more regulatory tightening on the anvil, these key staking metrics could be in the red in the days to come.\n\nThe weighted sentiment for ETH went deeper into the negative territory, signifying investors\u2019 uneasiness at the moment.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt press time, ETH fell by over 5% to trade at $1547.13. It had traded in a range since 20 February but was in real danger of breaking to the downside.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) went below neutral 50, which was a negative sign. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line went below the signal line, paving the way for bears to take back control. Moreover, the On Balance Volume (OBV) made lower-lows of late, adding evidence to the bearish idea."

        "content": "Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nThe integration of real-world assets, or RWAs, into the world of DeFi has been one of the hottest narratives so far in 2023. And emerging just in time to meet that red-hot trend head on is a crypto startup looking to soak up the interest.\n\nThis week, Switzerland-based Backed Finance launched a tokenized version of a BlackRock ETF (CSPX) that includes tons of big names like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and 496 other large American companies.\n\nThe token is called bCSPX, and runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The token is backed 1:1 by shares of those stocks, and the shares are held by a licensed custodian, according to Backed.\n\nAnd insofar as it runs on Ethereum, that means it can hypothetically interact with a whole host of DeFi applications, leading to some pretty innovative ideas like, for example, minting MakerDAO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin DAI using a stock index as collateral.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the S&P 500, either. Based on the project\u2019s marketing materials, the expectation is to onboard additional public securities under a regulatory framework that takes a page from Switzerland\u2019s Distributed Ledger Technology act.\n\nIn terms of who can get a hold of these tokens, it looks like there\u2019s three kinds of users. The first is professional investors and exchange platforms that may want to offer the token to clients; the second is KYC\u2019d token owners who are also interested in redeeming the underlying asset (a key feature should the token depeg from the price of the underlying asset like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC product); and the third is everyone else on the market.\n\nWell, almost everyone. You can't get the token in the United States\u2014likely a decision by Backed Finance to avoid having to navigate the SEC's choppy regulatory waters right now.\n\nThe United States has put itself in strange company. (Source: Backed Finance)\n\nThere\u2019s another hurdle to overcome, too.\n\nWhen the product was initially launched, a Uniswap pool was seeded with enough liquidity for folks to get started trading bCSPX. But now, Uniswap\u2019s interface indicates that the Backed\u2019s new token is \u201cunsupported\u201d because it \u201cmay not work well with the smart contracts or we [Uniswap] are unable to allow trading for legal reasons.\u201d Tokens that fall under this list, and dont\u2019t have \u201ccaution\u201d or \u201cwarning\u201d next to them, are \u201cmanually curated by Uniswap Labs.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, this may not be the biggest issue. If you\u2019re an American citizen living in the United States, you likely won\u2019t need a product like this. You can just head over to Fidelity or another broker and scoop up your fill there.\n\nUnfortunately, it means that American traders won\u2019t get to enjoy speedy swaps between, say, Apple stock and Circle\u2019s USDC. They may also get left behind should assets like bCSPX become deeply integrated in other DeFi apps.\n\nStill, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink doesn't sound concerned about that. In December, the finance exec declared that \u201cthe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\u201d\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

        "content": "In this article, we will examine some of the different cryptocurrencies and their fundamentals to predict whether their price will go up to the moon, or plummet to rock bottom. We will look at Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nThough it is impossible to guess with certainty the price of many different cryptocurrencies, what we can do is look at the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies and their price movements in the past to try to predict their potential price movements in the future.\n\nBitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin is becoming more and more popular as an investment choice because of its long-term development potential as a store of value. Having been released in 2009, Bitcoin has grown to become the most valuable cryptocurrency. Due to its potential for substantial long-term financial gains, many view Bitcoin as a promising long-term investment.\n\nBitcoin is very tempting for investors because it is decentralised, which means that no single body has authority over it or the ability to change its value. This makes it a viable replacement for traditional investments, which are frequently subject to influences like those of the government.\n\nFrom its price movements in the past, we can see Bitcoin continuing its upward momentum in the long term. Though volatility is to be expected, in the long run, Bitcoin is likely to outlast the rest of the competition, being one of the original cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum: Digital Silver\n\nInvestors are increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as a viable investment choice. With good cause, too! Ethereum provides a secure, decentralised framework for building blockchain applications. Smart contracts can run on the platform, giving it a lot of utility in the blockchain space, and allowing developers to build dApps (decentralised applications) on the platform.\n\nIt is a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios since it provides several advantages and features.\n\nEthereum is likely to maintain its position as one of cryptocurrency\u2019s leaders due to its low transaction costs, rapid transaction speeds, and tremendous scalability. Aside from better security, increased returns on investment, and improved liquidity, investing in Ethereum can provide investors with several benefits.\n\nIn the future, Ethereum is most likely to maintain its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies, and we can see its price retaining a steady position in keeping with Bitcoin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The New Meme Coin King?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is one of the hottest new meme coins on the market right now. It has raised $24.5 million and counting!\n\nIt was developed on the Ethereum network and works to raise consumer awareness of the DeFi market while promoting DeFi to boost the amount of money coming into the DeFi ecosystem.One of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s key goals is protecting the seas. To benefit organisations that promote ocean conservation, Big Eyes Coin retains 5% of all tokens in an open charity wallet.\n\nWant to carry out your price prediction? On the Big Eyes Coin website, there is a calculator to look at your potential ROI if you invested now and what your returns could be if Big Eyes Coin increased in price!\n\nWe can easily see this coin skyrocketing, as it already has an incredible amount of momentum, and it champions a social cause that people are looking to get involved in.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThough no price prediction is certain, we can see all of these coins increasing in value due to their solid fundamentals and promising communities built around their respective cryptocurrencies. As always, ensure that you carry out thorough research before investing in any asset. Happy investing!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin-native NFTs recorded a 25% growth in network fees.\n\nBitcoin mining revenue rose sharply, powered by an increase in transactions.\n\nThe new Ordinals NFT platform on Bitcoin [BTC] recorded exponential growth since mid-January, data from crypto research firm Messari showed. The daily Ordinal NFT mints soared by 300 times in the same time period.\n\n1/ If we told you #Bitcoin NFTs were making waves in the sector would you believe us? The New #Ordinals NFT project on Bitcoin is attempting to challenge the longstanding debate that the blockchain should primarily be used for simple financial transactions. ? pic.twitter.com/2O0jHjzRLZ \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) February 9, 2023\n\nAdditional data from Messari\u2019s Twitter thread pointed towards a 25% growth in network fees and an increased share of the available block space.\n\nWhile Ordinals has presented an exciting new use case, it has also triggered debates around the ultimate purpose of the Bitcoin chain.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction 2023-2024\n\nHow do NFTs on Bitcoin work?\n\nIn simple terms, Ordinals are NFTs that can be minted directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to NFTs on Ethereum [ETH] which point to off-chain data and rely on token standards like ERC 721 to create a collection of tokens. Since Ordinals are minted on the blockchain, all content stored is permanent and immutable while Ethereum NFTs can be altered using metadata.\n\nOrdinals focus on BTC\u2018s smallest units, satoshis. According to NFTNow, the protocol allows users to inscribe each satoshi with data. This data can include smart contracts which are then used to enable NFTs.\n\nAnother potential advantage of Bitcoin NFTs over Ethereum NFTs could be the low transaction fee due to the Taproot upgrade which was intended to make Bitcoin transactions more efficient.\n\nHowever, Ordinals has divided opinions in the crypto community with the naysayers objecting to its non-financial use case which would congest the network and drive up transaction fees on the chain.\n\nOn-chain activity picks up decisively\n\nThe growth of the Ordinals platform seemed to have heightened the network activity on Bitcoin, data from Santiment showed.\n\nThe transaction volumes proliferated over the last week, increasing by more than four times. The velocity indicator revealed a sharp spike as well, implying that BTC moved frequently between wallets.\n\nWhile BTC purists may be spooked by the idea of more network congestion, miners got a chance to rejoice. As per data from Glassnode, the miner revenue witnessed considerable growth after sustained periods of downturn.\n\nWith increased rewards for their efforts, BTC mining could become more profitable which is coming from the lows of the 2022 bear market.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nWith BTC wilting under pressure due to the SEC\u2019s increased regulations on the crypto market, Bitcoin-native NFTs could provide it with the much-needed impetus in the short run.\n\nWith a new target audience in place, it can put the chain in direct competition with market leaders in NFT trading such as Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL]."

        "content": "It\u2019s always a tough call to make. What will be the next top crypto? No one could\u2019ve predicted that Dogecoin (DOGE) would see the astronomical gains it has, to ascend to the top of the meme coin ladder. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, but by looking at cryptocurrencies\u2019 fundamentals, we can find out if any have what it takes to make it the next top crypto.\n\nIn this article, we will look at Uniswap (UNI), Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) to see which one has the potential to become the next top crypto! Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nUniswap: No FTX? No Problem!\n\nWhile the rest of the cryptocurrency market was floundering in the red last year, Uniswap (UNI) is somehow in the green. How is this possible?\n\nWhen FTX imploded and destroyed many people\u2019s assets and money, Uniswap seemed to come out unscathed. This incident foreshadowed the increase of suspicion of centralised cryptocurrency exchanges and increased scrutiny of other exchanges, including Crypto.com, Binance, and Coinbase. This is due to the proven danger that a collapse or some unanticipated catastrophe may occur, preventing the withdrawal of a person\u2019s hard-earned money.\n\nIn this madness, DeFi is beginning to gain ground, particularly Uniswap, which is the most often used DeFi token. As more and more crypto fans who are weary of centralised exchanges turn to DeFi as an alternate method of participating in the crypto sector, Uniswap is expected to continue on its upward trajectory. It is one of the leading DeFi cryptocurrencies, and may well be the next top crypto.\n\nEthereum: The Top Crypto After Bitcoin\n\nEthereum (ETH) is becoming a more popular option for investors as a legitimate investment. with justification, too! A safe, decentralised platform for creating blockchain applications is provided by Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is an open-source distributed blockchain network that supports smart contracts. Given that it offers a variety of benefits and features, it is a popular option for investors trying to diversify their portfolios.\n\nDue to its cheap transaction fees, quick transaction times, and exceptional scalability, Ethereum is expected to continue to be one of the top cryptocurrencies. Investing in Ethereum has a variety of advantages for investors, in addition to greater security, higher returns on investment, and enhanced liquidity.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The Top Crypto For Memes\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is now among the market\u2019s most promising meme coins. Big Eyes Coin is one of the most pre-eminent pre-sale tokens in the previous three years, having raised $25 million and counting.\n\nDue to the coin\u2019s enormous potential, investors are grabbing as many Big Eyes Coin tokens as they can. As a cryptocurrency, Big Eyes Coin\u2019s main goal is to transfer as much cash as possible into the DeFi community.\n\nAdditionally, Big Eyes Coin is a coin that further aims to help environmental causes! Regular funding is provided to The Orca Network and The Sea Shepherd, two organisations working to safeguard marine life. No wonder so many people are backing the coin.\n\nWe can easily see Big Eyes Coin potentially becoming the top crypto in the meme coin space.\n\nFinding the next top crypto can be a difficult task. We hope that our examination of these different cryptocurrencies has helped you on your journey to find the next top crypto. As always, ensure you conduct your research before investing in any asset.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The 2023 Ethereum price outlook is optimistic, as the market anticipates substantial price growth for the ETH token in the long term. Although the 2023 Ethereum price is promising, it may not be the top investment opportunity currently available.\n\nIn contrast, the impressive interest generated by the RenQ Finance (RENQ) presale suggests that it could deliver massive returns in the years ahead, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2023 and beyond.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is, without a doubt, the best crypto to invest in\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum in 2023 is positive, with predictions that the token will experience growth in the long-term after its recent merger in September 2022. Despite the current bear market, the Ethereum price forecast for 2023 suggests a potential reversal in trend. But the top crypto to invest in this year may be RenQ Finance (RENQ). The RENQ presale has generated significant interest, raising over $300k in just three days after its announcement. RenQ Finance is poised to make a big impact in the DeFi space and has the potential for significant future price growth, making it a highly promising investment opportunity.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is a foundational blockchain and the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 world. It was created using a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, but the recent update to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the merge in 2022 has made Ethereum\u2019s blockchain more economical and environmentally friendly. The PoS protocol assigns the mining process to trusted participants, who are incentivized to act in a trustworthy manner, instead of having nodes compete for block mining using their computing power, which was the case with the PoW mechanism.\n\nDespite the upgrade, Ethereum continues to be a prime crypto investment opportunity due to its status as the first Turing complete blockchain. This has resulted in Ethereum hosting over 2,000 independent projects and a growing number of use cases being discovered for blockchain technology, largely due to Ethereum\u2019s innovative solution.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023: Will ETH reach $2500?\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2023 is more bullish than in 2022, when Ethereum suffered an 80% price fall. The ETH token is expected to reverse this trend and could begin to climb back toward its previous all-time high at $4865.\n\nETH faces strong resistance at $1780. However, if the token can break through this price level, the next target is $2500 for the Ethereum price prediction 2023.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized financial platform that offers a seamless trading experience without compromising on decentralization. It provides users with full control over their assets, which are stored on the blockchain and accessed through the private key to their wallet, unlike centralized exchanges that hold full control and put users at risk of losing their funds. To enhance security, RenQ Finance employs Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect users\u2019 seed phrases and private keys.\n\nThe platform integrates isolated blockchain networks in the DeFi space, creating a multi-chain network for the exchange of value and assets. This makes it easier for users to access and transact value without having to create multiple accounts on different blockchain networks. The native token of RenQ Finance, RENQ, serves as the network\u2019s utility and governance token.\n\nHow RenQ Finance (RENQ) works?\n\nRenQ offers users anonymity, security, and transparency in trading. While other decentralized exchanges are strong in these areas, they still face challenges such as failed trades, slow order execution, front-running, high slippage, and limited features compared to centralized exchanges. As a result, many traders prefer to use centralized exchanges over decentralized ones, but this means giving up control of their assets. RenQ Exchange offers a solution to this problem, providing users with a direct trading experience through their wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, RenQ elevates decentralized trading by eliminating these drawbacks and providing a secure and user-friendly platform.\n\nWill RENQ reach $10?\n\nForecasts predict that the token could increase by as much as 500 times its value, reaching around $10 in 2025. RenQ Finance is deemed the top crypto to invest in during 2023, attracting a surge of investment following the launch of its presale. The platform is poised to play a significant role in the DeFi industry and has demonstrated promising growth prospects. The presale of RENQ is considered a rare investment opportunity with high potential, providing investors the chance to acquire RENQ at a discounted price. Long-term predictions place RENQ among the leading DeFi projects, with a target of $10 in 2025. In 2023, it is expected to reach $1 as its growth accelerates. Currently, RenQ Finance is considered the best crypto investment at its current price level.\n\nIs RENQ worth buying?\n\nYes, RENQ is considered a good buy as it is currently in its first stage of presale at a low price of $0.02. The RENQ project has the potential to gain a lot of attention and users in the upcoming months, which could lead to significant growth for the token by the end of the year and potentially make it one of the top altcoins of the year. Based on the expected increase in demand for RENQ and the possibility of being listed on major exchanges, the price predictions for 2023 are between $0.9 to $1.1. These estimates are based on the expectation of higher interest and trading activity for the RENQ token.\n\nRight now, RenQ Finance (RENQ) is in the first stage of its presale which is priced at $0.02, this will increase to $0.055 by the end of the presale which itself is a 175% gain. User\u2019s can take advantage of these low prices on RENQ and buy presale here."

        "title": "Web3 software architecture design \u2014 The solution based on Sinso infrastructure - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Web3 denotes a relatively abstract concept, and it also refers to a grand infrastructure, which we can divide into the following levels:\n\nThe blockchain network layer is arguably the cornerstone of Web3, composed of the most well-known blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, etc. It is known that the birth of Ethereum has allowed decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop by leaps and bounds. But meanwhile, it has long been stipulated in the planning of Ethereum to build a \u201cWorld Computer,\" which means seeking solutions to the storage problem. Although the concept of \u201cStorage\u201d space appeared in the early technical definition of Ethereum, the high gas cost and low efficiency accompanying storage functions determined that Ethereum cannot store too much data. In reality, no other blockchain had perfectly solved the storage problem on top of Ethereum. Thus, the storage-oriented blockchain networks thrived, with premium projects such as Arweave and Filecoin. Filecoin is almost an exception \u2014 with advantageous storage solutions, it created the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), aiming to add a layer 1. Such a great leap has allowed Filecoin to evolve from a storage-oriented network to a competitor in the public chain racetrack. FVM allows Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers to deploy smart contract instances to FVM with familiar Ethereum tools out-of-the-box, which means that many applications written in solidity can easily transition to using FVM. At this point, Filecoin\u2019s hybrid architecture of storage and compute programmability is visible.\n\nThe urgent need for decentralized storage in applications demanded a middle layer. Sinso works as a middleware infrastructure connecting the blockchain network layer and application layer.\n\nThe middle layer we defined has these components:\n\nSinso has five major components: Donors Network, Sinso Getway, DataLand, DApp Cube and Sinso DAC. As detailed in Sinso\u2019s roadmap, Sinso Getway and DataLand constitute the tasks for the first stage of development and have delivered version 1. Sinso Getway is designed to tackle inefficiencies of decentralized applications (DApps) accessing the persistent storage layer, which is not that easy. The first step is to build a crowdsourced network (not a private network) based on a free-market competition mechanism to maintain decentralized consistency. After more than a year of testing, Sinso has perfected a model for a distributed cache network built by a large group of miners. Offering a certain amount of free storage, Sinso Getway has released an API that allows users to write data to storage space. As an important blockchain middleware, Sinso Getway is like the cache in cloud computing, a high-speed content delivery network, or a load-balancing facility. To understand why middleware is so powerful and attractive, you can look back at the history of WebLogic and BEA, which Oracle acquired. The ultimate motivation behind this is human\u2019s desire to free technology from labs and apply it to large-scale commercial applications or even create high throughput business for the world. Born in 2000 during the internet explosion, WebLogic was to address the demands in performance, scalability and high availability for web application systems. Now in 2023 \u2014 the second year of the metaverse. The next trigger of the booming industry will be the most dazzling blockchain infrastructure; thus, middleware architectures have come to the stage.\n\nSinso DataLand is another product at the application level whose prototype has been released and is available for everyone to play with (For a detailed introduction to DataLand, please refer to the article \u201cNative Motivity of Web3.0 Ecology\u201d). It is important to note that DataLand is a product for common customers and a powerful tool for business entities to build private domain traffic. By transforming the business model from a centralized paradigm to a decentralized one, DataLand will provide rich APIs to business clients. Assuming a business organization is to develop a decentralized business-to-business (B2B) model, then DataLand will be an ideal entry point. In contrast to its competitors, DataLand is a metaverse for personal data. This business model will work if people agree that data is humanity\u2019s greatest asset. There is no doubt that DataLand, a \u201cmetaverse-oriented distributed storage niche market,\u201d can preliminarily establish a business model that has never been included in Web2. With significant differences from the WebLogic era, which takes simple B2B models as the core, the Web3 era has centered its priorities on individuals, based on which business clients can further build new business models. Since then, business-to-customer and B2B models have reached a high degree of agreement regarding ideas and interests. This is not a patchwork of technologies but the soil for building a new commercial species.\n\nAs the focus of Sinso\u2019s development work in 2023, Donors Network will make data more sequenced, enable the construction of a new data economy and further build an incentive layer for Sinso\u2019s token economy. Different from Web2, Donors Network will construct a completely different ecology. While the former is completed by the sales of sales-as-a-service standard or cloud computing, Donors Network introduces incentivization from the beginning of network construction. It can be understood that crowdsourcing is applied even in the manufacturing of a component. The simplest and most intuitive application rudiment of Donors Network is the combination of storage miners and guarantors, which is essentially a DeFi concept. Web2 only solves functional problems, whereas Web3 has begun to deal with the division of labor and cooperation in society. Most of the time, data producers and developers are in separate roles, so they need to cooperate \u2014 Web2 will not solve this problem. Thanks to the token economy based on blockchain technology, this problem is properly solved so that we can empower market regulation mechanisms. Working with the data \u201csoil,\u201d the tools will be more abstract, but such progress is in line with the revolution in productivity and production relations.\n\nSinso DAC is a data-oriented decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance framework based on FVM and AmStar chain. DAOs are also critical to the data economy. We could create a storage contract that would allow storage providers to add content identifiers (CIDs) to interact with Filecoin\u2019s built-in storage marketplace and store data in Filecoin. The DAO members must approve the process of adding CID through a voting mechanism. This is a simple description of DAO governance to present a data-oriented governance pattern with broad application scenarios in the future. The definition of Web3 as individual-oriented internet is well established. Furthermore, DAOs should be the only answer for now on how to organize humans for large-scale collaboration. Sinso DAC is a data-oriented DAO framework. As a public product, its birth will promote the further upgrade of human civilization. In his book \u201cThe Patient Will See You Now,\u201d Eric Topol lays out the vision of large-scale collaboration with medical data. Still, in Web2, it is almost impossible to achieve that because it is difficult to maximize the use of medical data while protecting personal privacy. Sinso DAC will be the soil to build public products of medical data and make it a reality for humans to share medical data on a large scale.\n\nSinso DApp Cube is building a unique platform, representing an experimental area for integrating the free market and technology. It is an open research and development environment for web infrastructure. As we all know, the legend of blockchain was formulated by free and open-source software, and it is difficult for the corporatization system to produce excellent products continuously. Sinso DApp Cube allows developers from around the world to settle into the Sinso developer ecology, with rewarding rules based on reference times and payment. As a free software stack with an incentive layer, DApp Cube can provide services for the protocol, intermediate and application layers. Some of these services are for internal members only; some are standardized services and products open to external clients; and some have industrial attributes. In short, Sinso DApp Cube builds an exchange for free software.\n\nTo build an integrated DApp, in addition to using layer 1 and distributed storage, you also need security audit, oracle, index query service, API service, data analysis, data storage, DeFi, digital identity, DAO governance and other related components. In the specific development process, Sinso provides a series of key data-oriented components so that DApps centered on data asset operation can use Sinso to build a fast development plan. Sinso provides not only tools but also empowerment from Sinso ecology. The middleware system of Web3 will bring more in-depth application scenarios than Web2, especially the evolution of business models.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Discord"

The analytics platform reports about $1.1 million in sales over the past day for a project with lifetime secondary sales totaling almost $39 million.\n\nMetagood, the startup behind OnChain Monkey, said it put all 10,000 NFTs onto Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol using a single transaction, much as it did for the original Ethereum collection back in 2021.\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces today, Metagood co-founder Danny Yang said that enabling trading was the next step for the team but suggested that other tooling needs to be created around Ordinals to facilitate that feature. He also noted that Metagood plans to build a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin to let NFT holders switch between the two versions.\n\n\u201cThey are the same on both chains,\u201d an OnChain Monkey Discord moderator wrote earlier today. \u201cBuy on ETH and you will have access to the BTC version when the tools catch up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project\u2019s Discord server is filling up with users who claim to have purchased one of the Ethereum NFTs following the Bitcoin announcement and are asking for details on how it will work.\n\nOnChain Monkey is part of Metagood\u2019s push to use Web3 initiatives to fund programs that benefit communities. These include efforts to fund coral restoration and provide aid to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. Metagood, co-founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai alongside Yang and Amanda Terry, raised $5 million in December.\n\nMetagood says that it minted the first 10,000 NFT project on Ordinals\u2014a claim that the creators of Bitcoin Punks, a clone of popular Ethereum project CryptoPunks, have also made.\n\nBitcoin Punks began inscribing its NFTs via Ordinals before OnChain Monkey, but opted to put each Punk as a separate inscription\u2014a process that stretched from Wednesday into Thursday. OnChain Monkey, on the other hand, committed its entire collection to Ordinals via a single transaction late Wednesday.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify when OnChain Monkey and Bitcoin Punks were inscribed via Ordinals."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently on a see-saw trend trading on high and lows as it saw its global market capitalization dip by 2.68% to $1.06 trillion, from $1.08 trillion. The decline comes following an upward trajectory indicated earlier in the year. On the bright side, however, the total crypto volume did see a rise of 5.24% to $64.65 billion, up from $60.94 billion.\n\nWhile top currencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded in the negative, crypto experts remain optimistic that the market will be predominantly bullish throughout the year. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), however, continued with their presale success with brand new offers and benefits for investors.\n\nBitcoin: The Struggle at the Top\n\nHaving gained by 1.33% to surpass the $23,000 for a brief period, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price dipped by 2.62% to trade at $22,618. The latest downtrend for Bitcoin places the top-ranked currency with a weekly decline of 4.91%.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $437 billion and was trading at a 24-hour volume of $29.2 billion.\n\nDespite the downward movement, experts indicate that Bitcoin is in the uptrend zone.\n\nEthereum: Hunting for a Rally\n\nWith the constant up and down trends over the past few weeks in the crypto market, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has been sluggish and facing the uphill task of reaching the $1700 mark, albeit expert indications that it would do so in February. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price saw an overnight decline of 2.66% to trade at $1631.79.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum held a market capitalization of $199 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $8.6 billion.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Going Big With Giveaways\n\nWhile the top two leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum had a poor past 24 hours, Big Eyes Coin (BIG), which is relatively new to the crypto scene made steady gains while continuing to rake in investors during its presale phase. Now in its 11 out of 15 stages, Big Eyes Coin has raised $25 million in presale tokens, becoming the most successful presale in cryptocurrency in the last two years. And in a mark of celebration of becoming the \u201clargest presale ever\u201d, Big Eyes Coin announced on Twitter, @BigEyesCoin that it would be giving away five PlayStation 5\u2019s to investors.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum Network, Big Eyes Coin has eyes on a $50 million presale target before it goes live on the market. The community-owned meme token is offering the bonus code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 through which investors could earn a 200% return on a purchase of a BIG coin when it goes live.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has laid out an eco-friendly roadmap where it says it will use its PoS protocol to reduce blockchain energy requirements by eliminating crypto mining, a large factor for over a million tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. A 5% of Big Eyes Coin\u2018s total token supply will also be set aside to be donated to multiple ocean-saving charities.\n\nSimilar to its eco-friendly ambitions, Big Eyes Coin provides a safe space with its contract code fully audited by Solidity Finance and shown to be 100% secure and has received KYC verification from CoinSniper to build a reputation for transparency and credibility.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nThe integration of real-world assets, or RWAs, into the world of DeFi has been one of the hottest narratives so far in 2023. And emerging just in time to meet that red-hot trend head on is a crypto startup looking to soak up the interest.\n\nThis week, Switzerland-based Backed Finance launched a tokenized version of a BlackRock ETF (CSPX) that includes tons of big names like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and 496 other large American companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe token is called bCSPX, and runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The token is backed 1:1 by shares of those stocks, and the shares are held by a licensed custodian, according to Backed.\n\nAnd insofar as it runs on Ethereum, that means it can hypothetically interact with a whole host of DeFi applications, leading to some pretty innovative ideas like, for example, minting MakerDAO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin DAI using a stock index as collateral.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the S&P 500, either. Based on the project\u2019s marketing materials, the expectation is to onboard additional public securities under a regulatory framework that takes a page from Switzerland\u2019s Distributed Ledger Technology act.\n\nIn terms of who can get a hold of these tokens, it looks like there\u2019s three kinds of users. The first is professional investors and exchange platforms that may want to offer the token to clients; the second is KYC\u2019d token owners who are also interested in redeeming the underlying asset (a key feature should the token depeg from the price of the underlying asset like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC product); and the third is everyone else on the market.\n\nWell, almost everyone. You can't get the token in the United States\u2014likely a decision by Backed Finance to avoid having to navigate the SEC's choppy regulatory waters right now.\n\nThe United States has put itself in strange company. (Source: Backed Finance)\n\nThere\u2019s another hurdle to overcome, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the product was initially launched, a Uniswap pool was seeded with enough liquidity for folks to get started trading bCSPX. But now, Uniswap\u2019s interface indicates that the Backed\u2019s new token is \u201cunsupported\u201d because it \u201cmay not work well with the smart contracts or we [Uniswap] are unable to allow trading for legal reasons.\u201d Tokens that fall under this list, and dont\u2019t have \u201ccaution\u201d or \u201cwarning\u201d next to them, are \u201cmanually curated by Uniswap Labs.\u201d\n\nOf course, this may not be the biggest issue. If you\u2019re an American citizen living in the United States, you likely won\u2019t need a product like this. You can just head over to Fidelity or another broker and scoop up your fill there.\n\nUnfortunately, it means that American traders won\u2019t get to enjoy speedy swaps between, say, Apple stock and Circle\u2019s USDC. They may also get left behind should assets like bCSPX become deeply integrated in other DeFi apps.\n\nStill, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink doesn't sound concerned about that. In December, the finance exec declared that \u201cthe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\u201d\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

While there are supernovas like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), and Ripple (XRP), new stars like Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), and Binance (BNB) are also glowing brightly.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has been stealing the limelight lately as the cat-themed meme coin has entered Stage 11 of its pre-launch activities. The meme coin has attracted eyeballs in a grand fashion by piling up a whopping $24.30 million in presales.\n\nAmong the hotcakes in the crypto world, Bitcoin and Ethereum are super hot but Big Eyes Coin has also started making its presence felt. While all three of them are considered cryptocurrencies, there are key differences that set them apart from each other.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the key differences that set them apart.\n\nUnderlying Technology\n\nA major factor that differentiates between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their underlying technology.\n\nBitcoin uses a simple scripting language for its transactions for a more streamlined approach to payments.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more advanced programming language, which enables developers to create a wider range of decentralized applications. This makes Ethereum a more flexible platform, and allows it to be used for a wider range of purposes beyond just payments.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is built on the Ethereum network, which means it also uses an advanced underlying technology that makes it ready to welcome the future with open hands.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum use different consensus mechanisms.\n\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work mechanism, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. This process consumes a lot of energy and is computationally intensive, which has led to concerns about its sustainability.\n\nEthereum uses a proof-of-stake mechanism, which is less energy-intensive and requires validators to hold a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This means that the validation process is less centralized, as it is not dominated by a small group of miners with large amounts of computing power.\n\nOne of the key selling points of Big Eyes Coin is its use of a new consensus mechanism called \u201cProof of Attention\u201d (PoA), which rewards users for actively participating in the network. This is a departure from the traditional \u201cProof of Work\u201d (PoW) and \u201cProof of Stake\u201d (PoS) mechanisms used by most other cryptocurrencies and is thought to be more energy-efficient and secure.\n\nSize and Kind of Community\n\nThe community and development behind each cryptocurrency is an important differentiating factor.\n\nBitcoin has a large and established community of developers, users, and businesses, who are actively working to improve the platform and make it more accessible to the general public.\n\nEthereum has a more decentralized and open-source development community, which allows for more collaboration and innovation.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has a strong and growing community of supporters and developers. This community is actively working to improve the cryptocurrency and make it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. With its strong community support, Big Eyes Coin has the potential to grow and evolve quickly.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIt is important to consider the use cases and potential applications of each cryptocurrency before making a decision.\n\nBitcoin was created primarily as a form of payment, and is widely used as a store of value and a means of exchange.\n\nEthereum is a platform for decentralized applications, which has a wider range of potential uses and applications beyond just payments.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a future-centric meme coin, focuses big on the privacy and security of its users. To achieve this goal, the cat-themed meme coin uses cutting-edge cryptographic technology that ensures confidentiality of transactions. This way, Big Eyes Coin lets its users stay private while making transactions, a feature that has the potential to make it popular in countries with stricter financial regulations.\n\nA New Dawn Is Here!\n\nAre you ready to welcome the new rising sun? Yes, we are talking about Big Eyes Coin, which is giving out a rollicking 200% bonus to its users as part of its promotional activities. If you want to join the exclusive group of BIG investors, use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to get your hands on the meme coin.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Big Eyes are very different from each other due to their certain features. Big Eyes Coin looks all set to finish among the leaders of the crypto industry, largely due to its unique attributes, including a combination network, rapid transaction times, low costs, a strong security focus, the possibility for widespread usage, eco-friendly infrastructure, and expanding community backing. Due to all these exclusive features, Big Eyes Coin is positioned to be a significant influencer in the cryptocurrency landscape in the future.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSushiSwap is making good on its January promises to launch a derivatives trading platform. But instead of building it from scratch, it\u2019s gone out and bought one.\n\nThe popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) announced the acquisition of Vortex Protocol today for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBuilt atop Sei Network, a blockchain using Cosmos\u2019 tooling, the on-chain trading platform will come under the SushiSwap umbrella as another product and will take a new name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVortex Protocol is a not-yet-launched decentralized derivatives exchange and will offer users 10x margin trading on a variety of assets. Sei Network and Sushi\u2019s newly-acquired Vortex Protocol will both launch on mainnet in Q2 of 2023.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is a direct partnership between the SEI, Vortex, and Sushi teams to help bring to market the first fully on-chain perpetual DEX via Sushi,\u201d SushiSwap\u2019s CEO Jared Grey told Decrypt.\n\nThe co-founder of Sei Network Jayendra Jog said that conversations around the acquisition began at the end of last year.\n\nSushiSwap to launch on Cosmos\n\nThe move also means that SushiSwap will be one of the first Ethereum applications to make the move over to the Cosmos ecosystem. Another Ethereum-native derivatives exchange called dYdx has also signaled that it would aim to launch on Cosmos in Q2.\n\nThe advantage of building on Cosmos is that it lets developers spin up blockchains specifically tailored to a project\u2019s needs. From modifying the network's consensus mechanism or opting to run a native validator set (rather than turn to Cosmos for shared security), it\u2019s all in the developers' hands, says Jog.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe chose to make use of the Cosmos SDK [Software Development Kit] because it's extremely modular and extremely easy to get a chain off the ground,\u201d the Sei Network co-founder told Decrypt. \u201cAnd then you can tweak whatever you need to tweak to make that chain better.\u201d\n\nAnd this is precisely what Sei and Vortex have done.\n\nPurpose-built for spinning up decentralized exchanges, Jog explained that the Sei team has adjusted block processing on the chain, decreased finality to 300 milliseconds, and introduced a feature called parallelization that boasts up to 22,000 orders per second on its internal testnet.\n\nThese features, and \u201ca cross-chain thesis that we resonated with,\u201d are all part of what made the latest acquisition so enticing, said SushiSwap\u2019s Jared Grey."

        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike other blockchain platforms, Ethereum has a unique governance structure that allows its community to make decisions that shape the future of the network. This article will provide an overview of Ethereum governance and explore the process of decision-making, its impact on the network\u2019s development and direction, and the challenges and criticisms associated with it. Those who are prepared to take on the risks may be rewarded with rewards if the market goes up therefore for investing in cryptos check Immediate Edge.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Governance?\n\nEthereum Governance: An Overview\n\nEthereum governance refers to the process by which decisions are made and changes are implemented on the Ethereum network. It is a decentralized process that allows the community to collectively make decisions that impact the network\u2019s direction and development. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where decisions are made by a single entity, in Ethereum, decisions are made by a consensus of stakeholders, including developers, users, and token holders.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nThe Decision-Making Process\n\nThe Mechanics of Ethereum Governance\n\nThe decision-making process in Ethereum is done through a series of proposals, discussions, and voting. The process starts with the proposal of a change or an improvement to the network, which is then discussed and evaluated by the community. If a consensus is reached, a vote is held to determine whether or not the change should be implemented. The outcome of the vote is determined by the number of tokens held by each participant, with each token giving the holder a proportional say in the decision.\n\nThe process of decision-making in Ethereum is transparent and open to all participants, allowing everyone to have a voice in shaping the future of the network. This system of decision-making ensures that the community has control over the direction and development of the network and that changes are made in the best interests of the majority of stakeholders.\n\nImpact on Network Development and Direction\n\nThe Influence of Governance on Ethereum\u2019s Evolution\n\nThe decentralized governance structure of Ethereum has had a significant impact on the network\u2019s development and direction. It allows the community to make decisions that are in line with their needs and interests, leading to the creation of new and innovative solutions. This has helped the network to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of its users and stay ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and progress.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nOne of the most notable examples of Ethereum\u2019s governance in action was the decision to implement the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. The upgrade aimed to address some of the scalability and security issues that were hindering the growth of the network. Through the Ethereum governance process, the community was able to make the decision to implement the upgrade, which has since been hailed as a major milestone in the network\u2019s evolution.\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nThe Limitations and Controversies Surrounding Ethereum Governance\n\nDespite its many benefits, Ethereum governance is not without its challenges and criticisms. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that the community reaches a consensus on important decisions. This can be difficult, as the community is often divided on key issues and there may be disagreements on the best course of action.\n\nAnother criticism of Ethereum governance is that it can be susceptible to manipulation by large token holders. This is because the decision-making process is based on the number of tokens held, rather than the number of people participating. This means that those with large token holdings have more influence over the decision-making process and can potentially sway the outcome of votes.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Future of Ethereum Governance\n\nEthereum governance is a critical component of the network\u2019s success and a key factor in its ability to evolve and adapt to changing needs. While it has proven to be effective in guiding the development and direction of the network, it is not without its challenges and criticisms. Despite these, the decentralized governance structure remains a unique and innovative aspect of Ethereum, allowing the community to have a direct say in the future of the network.\n\nAs the network continues to grow and evolve, it is important that the Ethereum governance process remains transparent and inclusive, allowing for a diverse range of voices to be heard. The future of Ethereum will be shaped by the decisions made through this process, and it is crucial that the community works together to ensure that the network remains a leader in innovation and progress.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum governance is a complex and dynamic process that has a profound impact on the network\u2019s development and direction. It is essential that the community understands the mechanics of the process and works together to ensure that the network remains a decentralized and open platform for innovation and progress."

        "title": "Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum to find a Superior one - THISDAY Newspapers",
        "content": "Bitcoin has become the most hyped cryptocurrency worldwide in the last few years, with the largest market capitalization. Satoshi Nakamoto created an anonymous identity, but later, he left the project, and some other blockchain developers created Bitcoin. During the pandemic, Bitcoin has given unbelievable returns and have left precious metal behind. Anyone can invest in Bitcoin through The News Spy. The reason behind creating Bitcoin is a digitalized current monetary system where users can be on both of their own money.\n\nEthereum can be defined as a global software, and it is powered by blockchain technology to facilitate other Decentralized applications to carry on their product and services. Anyone can use it to create secure digital technology. Ethereum has its currency known as the ether, which is used to pay for the work supporting blockchain. But the users of Ethereum can also pay through tangible goods and services. Ethereum work on work of stake as it is less energy intensive and is about to launch its second version, known as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nComparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nProof of work and proof of stake\n\nBitcoin was not created, although it is mined with the help of superpower computers that use a heavy amount of electricity. At the same time, Ethereum uses proof of steak and does not create the hunger for electricity. The bitcoin consensus protocol is known as proof of work through which Bitcoin allows its network nodes to access recorded information and prevent it from specific cyber-attacks and hacks. In 2022 Ethereum moved from proof of work to proof of stake with interconnected upgrades, which will make Ethereum a more secure network.\n\nOne of the most significant criticisms of using proof of work is that it requires computational power, which is highly energy intensive. At the same time, proof of stake substitutes computational power with staking, which makes it less management intensive.\n\nPurpose\n\nBitcoin was created to digitalize the current monetary system and pull out the control of financial affairs from a single identity or government officials. Because Bitcoin does not involve any government authority in its economic matters, it can also be used to make anonymous payments from one country to another and from one source to another. Still, it was designed to facilitate monetized operations with the help of smart contracts.\n\nFuture\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem continuously grows due to its high return and price volatility. Also, Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency which has gained too much hype in recent years. Bitcoin network is continuously lighting up with the different projects working on a second layer protocol which helps to take the transaction off the chain and results in a speeding up and more efficient monetary network.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem will grow with the increased use of decentralized applications in finance. Ethereum is also the home for many other decentralized investment plans like NFT defy and other decentralized applications. Ethereum holds a bright future due to its multiple uses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin can be used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, providing alternatives to traditional currencies. In contrast, Ethereum is used to find numerous applications like NFT and intelligent contracts. Bitcoin has the potential to push the economy toward complete digitalization. Many companies and economies use bitcoin to make and receive payments. In comparison, the Ethereum blockchain network is used by many developers to facilitate decentralization applications. You can also use the Ethereum blockchain for decentralized application investments like NFT, Dpps, and other decentralization investments.\n\nWrapping up\n\nBoth currencies have the same roots but different workplaces. Both coins have a bright future. Bitcoin can become a Medium of exchange in the coming future, whereas Ethereum can be used for other decentralized investments. On the other hand, one should be careful about Bitcoin and Ethereum prices as these are the most volatile currencies. The prices can be changed within minutes and let you fall into losses. Therefore, it is better to get the required knowledge before indulging them in your monetary system. It may not give you an excess profit, but it can save you from bearing losses.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith the details given here, it is clear that bitcoin is the most trusted and fair coin as per the technology needed in the modern world. So, make sure to opt for the most preferred coin in the crypto, which is none other than bitcoin today."

        "content": "If you are brand new to the world of crypto and are wondering where to invest your money and you are torn between Bitcoin and Ethereum, look no further. First, before establishing where to invest, it is important to understand what they are, the differences between the two, and the pros and cons of each.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is best described as \u2018digital gold\u2019 in the way that it is suitable for collecting and exchanging and used for buying things online without the interference of third parties. It isn\u2019t the first time someone has executed this idea, however, it is the first time it has been deemed successful. Originally launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group under the alias \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019. It has since become the most popular cryptocurrency in the world and has encouraged an influx of cryptocurrencies since its launch.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum (ETH) was originally created as a direct response to Bitcoin, enhancing and highlighting what the coin was missing. Ethereum is powered by the Ether token and runs as a decentralized blockchain network, which in essence means that it is near impossible to hack into or change the information once it is released into a blockchain. Ethereum is often used for the functionality of NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens used to represent ownership of digital assets. This can vary from digital art, music, videos and so much more.\n\nThe Comparison Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe difference between the two basically comes down to the function of Bitcoin: the main purpose is to be able to exchange currency and purchase items. Bitcoin will be and is accepted as an alternative form of currency from say the Great British Pound (GBP). Various websites such as Shopify, Express VPN, and Paypal in the US accept Bitcoin as a payment method. However the same cannot be said for Ethereum, as its primary usage is for the creation of secured digital technology such as NFT art and others. Although Ethereum can be used to pay for services, that is more of a secondary usage for the platform.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin and Ethereum do share some similarities, being that they are the top two most popular cryptocurrencies on the market at the moment. They both see a large volume of trading transactions on a daily basis, much more than any other currency. Both of them being decentralized also means that outside sources such as the Federal Reserve System or the government cannot keep track of transactions. So it is often found that those who use Bitcoin to make alternative means of payment can do so in confidence.\n\nAll in all, whether you invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum depends on what you intend to use them for. For regular currency exchange purposes and buying online, it seems that Bitcoin is the best investment. Alternatively, for a deep dive into the world of NFT and other digital assets, Ethereum may be the way to go.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has disclosed in a blog post that a mainnet upgrade Shapella (including Shanghai+Capella) is going through its conclusive stages. The platform mentioned that the respective upgrade is going through its pre-launch sequence. This phase is related to the public testnets.\n\nSapolia Testnet to Witness a Shanghai Upgrade in February\n\nThe platform disclosed that the Zhejiang testnet is presently functional and the users as well as stakers can utilize it for the testing of Shapella at present. In addition to this, the Ethereum Foundation asserted that Sepolia (the initial of the established public testnets) is planned to experience the respective upgrade on the 28th of this month. As per the platform, the Shapella upgrade comprises several features. Nonetheless, the most significant thing is that the consensus layer and the stakers will be permitted to carry out withdrawals.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the exited validators will have complete withdrawals. On the other hand, the dynamic validator balances exceeding 32 ETH will have partial withdrawals. It added that to take part in withdrawals, the validators must possess a 0x01 credential for execution-layer withdrawal. On the contrary, if 0x00 is a validator\u2019s credential for BLS withdrawals at present, they are required to have a change operation. In this way, withdrawals will be enabled for them.\n\nThe platform added that the Shapella upgrade will be beneficial for infrastructure providers, node operators, the Ethereum stakers, and so on. The relevant parties are advised by the Ethereum Foundation to be focused on the latest upgrade as well as test their software. The platform disclosed that it will upgrade every public testnet.\n\nAcademic Grants Round of Ethereum Goes Live\n\nApart from that, if everything moves according to the schedule, the next stage is the mainnet launch which will shortly take place, in the words of the Ethereum Foundation. Along with this, the platform made another announcement. This is related to Academic Grants Round. The platform brought to the front that the facility is presently live.\n\nIn the previous year, it added, the platform remained successful in grasping the attention of academics around the world to operate on the projects existing within the span of the Ethereum network. At present, the respective project has been renovated with a remarkable exclusive wishlist to cope with the zones related to cryptography and protocol design. 27th of February is scheduled for Academic Grant applications."

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed concerns about the possible elimination of cryptocurrency staking for retail clients by the SEC.\n\nLater, it was announced that Kraken, one of the longest-running crypto exchanges, reached a $30 million settlement with the SEC on the issue.\n\nIn recent hours, information has also emerged regarding regulators\u2019 persecution of large centralized stablecoin issuers.\n\nThese events come shortly after the White House\u2019s statement regarding its concerns about cryptocurrencies. Ironic situation when considering that several US regulators in recent years have received funding from the FTX exchange, and now find the future of cryptocurrencies in their hands.\n\nFunding that after the exchange goes bankrupt could be part of the bankruptcy recovery action and be returned.\n\nScrolling down the Top 30 list, only one green sign stands out.\n\nIt is that of Polygon (MATIC), which from last Friday\u2019s levels is registering a rise that exceeds 6%. The token, which plays an important role in the Polygon platform ecosystem, is on its way to ending its 6th consecutive upward week. After about 10 months, the MATIC digital token recovers $1.3, gaining more than 70% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAfter sustained gains in January, Bitcoin (BTC) is set to close the week down for the 2nd consecutive time, with prices hovering around $21,800.\n\nShould these levels hold until Sunday\u2019s close, there would be a decline from the $22,900 with which the week began.\n\nScenario that should not surprise readers of these pages who follow the cryptocurrency market. As hypothesized in my last update published on Tuesday, an imminent close of the monthly cycle, expected between the end of this week and the beginning of next week, was being reported, which would be characterized by a continuation of the bearish trend.\n\nThe cyclical structure is taking shape confirming a final phase of a major cycle, such as the monthly cycle, in which prices are subject to downturns.\n\nHowever, the presence of an ongoing monthly cycle and its conclusion could be an important factor to consider when analyzing future market trends.\n\nTechnically, it is important that any continuation of the descent does not push prices too far down and in any case below $20,600. This level coincides with the last valid support built in mid-January during the last bullish run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) performance\n\nThe move backwards brings Ethereum (ETH) prices back to test the crucial $1,520 USD support. A level that has been an opportunity for a rebound several times since mid-January.\n\nRebounds that have been unsupported by new buying that has so far failed to confirm momentum beyond the $1,620 resistance, previous to the November highs.\n\nOver the weekend, it is important for ETH to confirm the holding of current support. A breakout of $1,500 could result in the stimulation of bearish speculation that would find space for a descent down to the $1,420 USD area, caused by the lack of validly built supports during the last ascent in January.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, only an overtaking of $1,650 accompanied by volumes would create the conditions for a new bullish extension with the next target in the $1,750 USD area."

        "title": "What Ethereum Staking Means After the Kraken Crackdown - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe outcome of Kraken\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission will have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC stated on Thursday afternoon that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has agreed to pay a $30 million punishment for failing to register the offering and sale of its program for staking digital assets. The SEC reportedly wants to end cryptocurrency staking for retail customers in the United States, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said just the day prior.\n\nOn the surface, it appears that this should have been bad news for all cryptocurrency staking providers. But the news didn\u2019t exactly land like that. According to CoinGecko, the governance tokens for Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the biggest pooled staking platforms, increased by as much as 11% in the previous day.\n\nIt\u2019s an indication that the market believes Kraken, Coinbase, and other centralized exchanges that act as staking intermediates should be concerned, but not the rest of the sector. According to GeckoTerminal, selling volume of Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) has exceeded buying volume by a ratio of over 3:1 during the past day.\n\nOn proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, staked assets support network operation. They demonstrate the stakes validators have in the game because their hardware processes new transactions and saves data. Validators are rewarded for their participation in networks, but they risk losing some of their staked assets if they become inactive or do other crimes.\n\nProfits that can be made through staking on Ethereum\n\nFor the majority of retail-level investors, it is difficult to become an independent Ethereum validator, which is currently the largest proof of stake network. To do it, a user would require 32 ETH, or about $48,000 at the time of writing. Users who have smaller amounts of ETH to stake instead employ pooled staking services and staking-as-a-service providers.\n\nThese are offered in two flavors: plain and liquid staking. With the latter, customers are intended to receive the best of both worlds. For their ETH deposits, they receive a portion of the validator incentives in addition to a token that can be exchanged or used as collateral and is redeemable for the staked assets.\n\nOf the $47 billion in assets in the DeFi ecosystem, the 65 liquid-staking protocols tracked by DeFi Llama account for $12 billion, or 26% of the total. This places them in third place, behind lending ($13 billion) and decentralized exchanges ($19 billion), or DEXes.\n\nEthereum makes up more than $11 billion of the assets in liquid-staking protocols. And Lido is by far the most popular of the 16 protocols that offer ETH staking. Of the money deposited, it accounted for $8 billion, or 75% of the total.\n\nIt appears that oversimplifying staking to make it less daunting for retail clients was at least a portion of the issue the SEC had with Kraken\u2019s program. The fact that Kraken chose to set the returns that its customers would receive, as opposed to the variable rate of rewards decided by the protocol, is criticized in one portion of the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe commission stated:\n\nDefendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not always reliant on the actual profits that Kraken obtains through staking.\n\nStaking on other platforms\n\nAccording to Alex Mogul, senior director of staking and infrastructure at Republic Crypto, Kraken turned into too much of an intermediary as a result. She remarked that:\n\nDepositing to Kraken and letting it handle the arithmetic is by far easier than trying to switch networks and then pressing the transact button to delegate stake. It is quite difficult.\n\nCoinbase has asserted that its staking scheme differs from Kraken\u2019s. According to Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase:\n\nStaking on Coinbase is still possible, and staked assets are still eligible for protocol awards. The fact that Kraken was basically offering a yield product is evident from today\u2019s announcement. The staking services offered by Coinbase are fundamentally different and are not securities. For instance, the rewards for our customers are determined by the awards provided by the protocol and the commissions we publish.\n\nMogul, who oversees Republic Crypto\u2019s Runtime staking-as-a-service division, expressed her optimism that software, such as better designed wallets, would eventually replace any staking options gaps left by centralized exchanges.\n\nShe added that:\n\nI still believe that complexity can be abstracted in software solutions without compromising asset custody.\n\nThe Kraken settlement will drive companies toward decentralized alternatives, according to Jaydeep Korde, co-founder and CEO of Launchnodes, who represents the other end of the investment spectrum.\n\nFor organizations or wealthy people who have the 32 ETH necessary to run their own node but don\u2019t want to handle the technology themselves, his company offers non-custodial staking alternatives. The infrastructure needed to run a validator is owned by the user, but Launchnodes takes care of all maintenance.\n\nHe explained:\n\nBy operating your staking operations on equipment you own, it avoids needing to trust compliant, regulated or non-regulated crypto enterprises that are seemingly growing larger governance and operational flaws.\n\nRelated"

        "title": "Dubai: school fees in Bitcoin and other crypto - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum in Dubai: a new school will accept crypto payments for its tuition fees. In this way, the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is also progressing in education. The news was also reported on Bitcoin Archive\u2018s official Twitter profile, which reads:\n\nJUST IN: Students can now pay tuition with #Bitcoin and crypto at the Canadian University of Dubai! \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) February 9, 2023\n\nDubai increasingly keen on crypto: Bitcoin payments at schools\n\nAfter becoming home to multiple digital asset companies in recent months, Dubai wants to improve cryptocurrency adoption through other tactics. This time, a local school has reportedly said it wants to start accepting digital asset payments for things like tuition fees.\n\nThe Citizens School in Dubai, a wealthy city in the United Arab Emirates, said families will be able to pay tuition in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The two cryptocurrencies will be accepted as forms of payment, and will be automatically converted into the local currency (AED).\n\nCitizens School, which will open next September precisely in downtown Dubai, will have the structure of an international school, and will accommodate students aged 3 to 18.\n\nHisham Hodroge, CEO of Citizens School, said in this regard:\n\n\u201cIntroducing the ability to pay tuition using cryptocurrencies goes beyond simply offering an alternative payment method. It is rather a way to boost interest in blockchain technology. Citizens School intends to leverage this technology in many of its administrative and academic operations in the future.\u201d\n\nAs such, Bitcoin and Ethereum in Dubai will not be mere forms of payment. Instead, the UAE city seems to be focusing heavily on the adoption of blockchain technology and its organic integration.\n\nIndeed, lately we have seen the creation of very crypto-friendly regulations throughout the Emirates.\n\nThe exchanges Binance and FTX, for example, have recently received licenses to begin their operations in this state.\n\nDubai and the regulatory framework for crypto: not only Bitcoin\n\nThe decision of crypto payments in the school was driven primarily by recent actions taken by the city\u2019s authorities to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and turn Dubai into a cryptocurrency hub.\n\nAdil Alzarooni, Founder of Citizens School, commented on the matter:\n\n\u201cA while back, cryptocurrency was just a floating term among savvy investors. However, today cryptocurrency is becoming much more mainstream, reshaping the traditional financial system. Similarly, Citizens is disrupting the education sector by reinventing every element of the learning experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Alzarooni noted that the addition of digital asset payments should strengthen the role of the younger generation in developing the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nAs anticipated, there are also other pro-crypto actions taken recently by Dubai authorities.\n\nFor example, the two most recent companies to outline such intentions in Dubai are Bybit and Crypto.com. Specifically, Bybit has received approval in principle to conduct a full range of virtual asset businesses in Dubai.\n\nCrypto.com, on the other hand, has promised to start recruiting heavily in the coming months to establish a \u201csignificant presence\u201d in the UAE.\n\nDubai\u2019s new guidelines for virtual asset service providers\n\nAnother recent development involving Dubai concerns the new crypto guidelines for digital asset service providers. In which the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority\u2018s new set of regulations sets out requirements for crypto companies that cover everything from issuing and exchange services to advertising.\n\nAccording to Irina Heaver, a cryptocurrency and blockchain lawyer based in the United Arab Emirates, VARA has issued its \u201cComprehensive Market Product Regulation,\u201d which includes four mandatory regulations and activity-specific regulations that set the rules for the operation of VASPs.\n\nThe Dubai regulator also emphasized that all market participants, whether licensed by VARA or not, must comply with regulations for marketing, advertising, and promotions.\n\nIn general, regulators around the world are racing to establish oversight of cryptocurrencies after last year\u2019s market crash led to the implosion of many of the high-profile digital asset lending and exchange platforms.\n\nThe European Union is poised to approve its own licensing regime, while the United Kingdom, South Korea and other jurisdictions are rapidly forming their own frameworks\n\nIn any case, Dubai\u2019s new framework, which also covers advertising and promotion requirements for crypto companies, still needs final approval before it can be implemented."
