        "content": "Visa has wrapped up testing a way for users to pay on-chain gas fees directly in fiat with a credit or debit card, the payments giant said on Thursday.\n\nThe experiment, which was conducted on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, uses a paymaster contract to sponsor gas fees on behalf of users, according to a statement.\n\nIt means users can send blockchain transactions without having to worry about maintaining a balance of ether. Visa believes the contract could make transactions more accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n\u201cOur experiment aims to offer a promising approach to substantially addressing the challenges of blockchain-based transactions,\u201d Visa\u2019s technical team wrote. \u201cBy leveraging the innovative concept of a paymaster, in conjunction with account abstraction and the ERC-4337 standard, we explored the potential for a process that could redefine blockchain-based transactions.\u201d\n\nA paymaster contract is a specialized type of smart contract within the blockchain ecosystem, designed to manage the payment of gas fees.\n\nThe company said merchants or decentralized applications (dapps) could run their own paymaster solution, or existing wallet and paymaster service providers could offer a card-based gas fee payment choice alongside their other paymaster offerings.\n\nThe experiment is part of Visa\u2019s ongoing development within the industry. The company has been working on ways to make blockchain payments more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nVisa reportedly began experimenting with converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain earlier this year. The aim is to parallel its current foreign currency exchange processes, as part of its broader push to build proficiency in global settlements involving both digital and traditional currencies.\n\nIn the context of transactions on blockchains like Ethereum, every operation conducted incurs a cost known as a \u201cgas\u201d fee, representing the computational effort required to execute the operation. Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure by making it costly for bad actors to spam the network.\n\nSince inception, network fees have been a fundamental part of ensuring security and encouraging adoption within first-generation blockchain systems. Though, following ten years of user growth, the hope is the trajectory of Web3 will move towards a \u201cgasless\u201d future.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The next big leap for Ethereum liquid staking: The staking landscape - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their background, can easily access and participate in the revolutionary world of Ethereum. A world where decentralized applications empower individuals, and the potential for innovation knows no bounds. Against a highly equivocal and chaotic macroeconomic landscape, this is the world that the prophets of Ethereum dream of.\n\nBut little do they know this world is like an unrealized dream. Why? Let\u2019s dig deeper.\n\nReflecting on the Ethereum liquid staking landscape\n\nCentralized liquid staking protocols are at the forefront of the liquid staking revolution on Ethereum, and it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Why? Because they are highly scalable \u2014 thanks to the centralized validator set that they have. The biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum currently has a limited node operator set of 29 operators. It must then be a no-brainer that they hold a hegemony over the network. Any protocol claiming to be decentralized but running its operations as a business is also able to offer much higher standards of composability. While this composability that is offered to users is a feature, it can be counter-productive as well \u2014 primarily because of the systemic risks this can cause.\n\nOn the flip side, decentralized protocols do exist, but they are highly unscalable. And thus, they have a fraction of ETH staked in them compared to what is often staked via the centralized ones.\n\nWhile decentralized protocols have attempted to reduce the minimum capital required to run a validator node from 32 to 8 ETH, that is still a sizeable amount for the wider ecosystem. Admittedly, this does open up opportunities for a wide number of stakers to start staking on the network, however, we contend that 8 ETH is still a sizeable amount. This reintroduces the problem of scalability, and thus a significant portion of ETH gets staked through a select group of professional node operators. This leads to the further concentration of staked ETH. The presence of these centralized node operators across different liquid staking protocols undermines the censorship resistance of the underlying network.\n\nThe inflow of ETH post-Shapella is a good indicator of users\u2019 liquid staking preferences. One would hope that a lot of the incoming ETH would go to decentralized liquid staking; however, the figures state otherwise.\n\nMaking Ethereum liquid staking scalable\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the existing liquid staking protocols today is that they are tuned for either scalability alone or decentralization alone. The ones that are tuned for scalability alone are not decentralized, and the ones that are tuned for decentralization are not scalable. There are several examples of this \u2014 from protocols having a concentrated node operator set to those having high minimum capital requirements to run validator nodes for Ethereum.\n\nWhile there have been attempts by these protocols to move towards either making their architectures scalable or decentralized, making that is quite difficult given the huge amounts of ETH that are already staked via them. Moreover, these protocol-level changes require a lot of internal deliberations (at-least for decentralized protocols) before they are rolled out.\n\nMoreover, a core objective of any business is to make sure that they hold the hegemony over the industry to persistently retain that. This is reflected by the feigned attempts at a willingness to decentralize \u2014 but then having them falling on their head. Perhaps, there is no reason why this would happen. A centralized liquid staking protocol often operates as a business whose core objective is to compromise decentralization to achieve profitability. While I do not condemn the latter, I do feel that it comes \u2014 almost always \u2014 at the cost of decentralization.\n\nWhat Ethereum needs\n\nEthereum prophets often call for the need to diversify staking across a multitude of protocols. And perhaps, it wouldn\u2019t be remiss to credit those protocols that have emerged that are attempting to realize that vision. However, I must provide a caveat that any emerging protocols need strategic and critical analysis. No one would want shabby architecture being polished and presented as a resilient solution and risking the stability of Ethereum. I believe that there are two things that need immediate attention to drive growth to Ethereum liquid staking:\n\nReducing the minimum capital requirements to run a validator node: This is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation.\n\nThis is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation. Building censorship resistance: This is perhaps common knowledge, but it often gets overlooked. With the pace at which the macroeconomic landscape is evolving, it is a dire need for protocols to integrate solutions that build the censorship resilience of the protocol. This is akin to hedging against potential future slowdowns in validator architecture and building a high-performant architecture that keeps the network secure.\n\nAdmittedly, I find myself at crossroads while writing these solutions because, while I assert that being aware of the existing challenges as well as the solutions is of paramount importance, it is not enough to persistently echo them. It is essential that we engage in extensive research and relentlessly test and build solutions that help solve these challenges and build a resilient architecture.\n\nMohak is the founder of ClayStack.

        "content": "Bloomberg Intelligence crypto market analyst Jamie Coutts predicts PayPal\u2019s new PayPalUSD (PYUSD) stablecoin will have a huge impact on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nCoutts says that there is massive growth potential for Ethereum even if just a small percentage of PayPal\u2019s existing customer base adopts the stablecoin, which aims to keep a 1:1 peg to the US dollar and is built on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe PayPal announcement is not priced in.\n\nPayPal has 435 million active accounts vs. Ethereum Layer-1/Layer-2 active addresses 1 million.\n\nIf 1% convert a dollar balance to PYUSD (4.35 million) and begin to use it then the ramifications for the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH, the asset, are massive.\u201d\n\nCoutts also says that he is bullish on the layer-1 (L1) smart contract platform after an expansion of layer-2 (L2) projects had less of an adverse impact on ETH\u2019s financials than he expected.\n\n\u201cThe dual surprise of faster L2 adoption and less than expected cannibalization of the L1 financials has our confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential to accrue more value than alternative L1s over the cycle.\u201d\n\nThe analyst says ETH\u2019s sideways price action doesn\u2019t tell the full story of all that is going on in the ecosystem, including network development and increased Ethereum staking.\n\n\u201cFlat Price Masks Improving Value Accretion:\n\n1. Network is back on a growth trajectory driven by growing L2s, less severe monetary tightening\n\n2. Mostly deflationary despite bear market (pre-merge inflation was 4%+)\n\n3. Despite cooling activity, ETH staked accelerated up 38% in three months.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coutts, ETH accumulation is increasing during the stalled crypto market.\n\n\u201cWhile activity is down, investors are nonetheless demonstrating aggressive accumulation behavior. The total number of non-zero balance addresses exceeds 100 million, with over 1.7 million wallets containing at least one ETH.\u201d\n\nCoutts notices that ETH\u2019s network is generating 3x the amount of revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cDepending on your framing, dollar value of the network\u2019s GDP/revenue, while down significantly from 2021, has increased 3x from the fourth quarter 2022 low and is now outpacing the price. L1 generates approximately $6 million in fee revenue per day \u2013 80% is burnt (buyback) and the rest paid to validators (div).\u201d\n\nHe also notes that the increase in fees is similar to a 2020 pattern that led to an ETH bull run.\n\n\u201c2023 fees have climbed 176% vs. the price, up 53%. The relationship between the two was instructive for the last bull market when fees outpaced price in 2020 after a two-year decline.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,850 at time of writing, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDeath Cross forming on a weekly chart for Ethereum\n\nThe ETH daily chart suggests short-term declines\n\nOn-chain metrics aren\u2019t showing long-term holders\u2019 selling pressure\n\nTwo scenarios are still in play\n\nThe price of Ethereum reached $2,130 on April 18, its highest point since May 2022. After the high, we saw a retracement of 23%, as it came down to $1,632 on June 15, but another attempt to continue an uptrend was made, with the price recovering just slightly above $2,000 on July 15.\n\n\n\nEven though these moves were in double-digit percentages, on a higher time frame like the daily chart, the price has moved sideways since the April high. Now, we are seeing some technical indicators signaling a potential start of a downtrend.\n\nETHUSD Forming Death Cross\n\nThe simple moving averages are starting to form a death cross on the weekly time frame. This occurs when the fast MA (50) crosses the slow MA (200) to the downside and indicates the start of a downtrend.\n\nIt especially carries more weight on the higher time frames, and seeing it on a weekly chart where the SMA 200 served as support since 18 June 2022 could be of concern.\n\nZooming into the daily chart, these moving averages are still far apart, which could be a sign of relief, but in the short term, the price is eyeing another interaction with the MA 200.\n\nThis interaction might end as a bounce around the $1,736, which correlates with the local horizontal support, but the situation is still vague.\n\nReal volume is, historically speaking, at its lowest level since October 5, 2020. This could indicate that the current price doesn\u2019t carry much weight as with diminishing volume, retail traders primarily drive the price fluctuations.\n\nOn-chain data\n\nCurrently, by looking at the on-chain metrics, no data suggests incoming selling pressure. One of the most reliable signs would definitely be exchange inflows, meaning that investors are depositing ETH to exchanges for a potential sale.\n\nEven though The Netflow chart has a positive day, on July 26, it shows low volatility in its histogram, which has been the case since June 18. Of course, this might change with price fluctuations.\n\nSo what about the derivatives market? Can we see some short-term selling pressure from traders?\n\nAll of the key derivatives market metrics show a positive sentiment at the time of writing. The funding rate favors long-position traders, and open interest is decreasing, meaning there is less leverage on the market, and there are most short-position liquidations. Taker buy sell ratio also shows a bullish sentiment as more buy orders are filled.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt appears that the price of Ethereum is in a tough spot. We are seeing some mixed signals across the technical indicators, but overall the market is indecisive. The price has been in an uptrend from the start of the year until mid-April when it peaked and started moving sideways.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we outlined two scenarios that still stand. Some early signs of struggle have been seen but there isn\u2019t much data to draw upon in further price expectations.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Kisco, NY-based firm in June.\n\nBitwise: Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: NYSE Arca\n\nAfter withdrawing its initial filing in May, Bitwise re-applied for its Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHG) on August 1. According to the filing, ETHG intends to invest in cash-settled, front-month, i.e. with the shortest time to maturity, ETH futures contracts, without seeking direct exposure to the current spot price of Ethereum.\n\nThe fund is classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, meaning it is able to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in financial instruments with a single counterparty or a few counterparties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe filing details that the fund will not invest in ETH futures contracts directly; instead, the investments will be channeled through a wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nFurthermore, since the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF intends to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company, the size of the fund\u2019s investment in that subsidiary will not exceed 25% of its total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nDespite such a low allocation, the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through its investment in ETH Futures Contracts, whereas the remaining 75% of assets are expected to be invested in U.S. Treasuries and other U.S. government obligations, as well as money market funds, cash and cashlike equivalents such as high-quality commercial paper.\n\nRoundhill: Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nNew York-based Roundhill Investments is an SEC-registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors.\n\nThe firm currently has a total of $662 million of assets under management across eight ETFs and is seeking to expand the offering with the launch of the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nAccording to the August 1 filing, the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks capital appreciation by investing in CME-listed front-month Ether futures contracts.\n\nSimilar to Bitwise, the fund plans to invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVanEck: VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nVanEck, which is also among the spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls, appears to be going big on Ethereum: according to the August 1 filing, the total value of the ETH to which the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF is planning to have economic exposure is approximately 100% of its total assets.\n\nIf for any reason such as exceeded position limits or liquidity constraints, the fund is unable to achieve the target exposure, it may invest in equity securities of ETH-related companies, i.e. companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange that the fund\u2019s adviser believes provide returns that generally correspond, or are closely related, to the performance of ETH or ETH futures.\n\n\u201cFor example, the Fund may invest in U.S. listed companies offering digital asset trading platforms,\u201d reads the filing\n\nIn addition to ETH futures, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF expects to have \u201csignificant holdings\u201d of cash and fixed-income investments, which are intended to provide liquidity and serve as collateral for the fund\u2019s ETH futures, as well as to engage in \u201cactive and frequent trading of portfolio holdings.\u201d\n\nProshares: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn August 1, ETF-issuer ProShares filed for two different Ethereum-focused ETFs: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nThe former seeks daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index, whereas the latter seeks to provide capital appreciation primarily through managed exposure to CME-listed Ether futures contracts, with the investment objective being \u201cnon-fundamental,\u201d meaning it may be altered by the Board of Trustees without the approval of the fund\u2019s shareholders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimilar to the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, both Proshares\u2019 Ethereum futures ETF seeks to qualify as regulated investment companies, meaning that the size of the fund\u2019s investment in their corresponding subsidiaries, which will also be based in the Cayman Islands, will not exceed 25% of the total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nGrayscale Investments: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn May 9, Grayscale Investments, best known as the sponsor of the troubled Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the formation of Grayscale Funds Trust\u2014a Delaware statutory trust structure that encompasses three new funds: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.\n\nJust a week later, the firm submitted amendments to its SEC filing to remove mentions of the Ethereum Futures ETF though, only to re-apply for the offering on August 1.\n\nThe updated filing states that the Ethereum Futures ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through exposure to Ethereum futures contracts, purchased via a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\nThe fund is also planning to hold approximately 100% of its net assets in Ethereum futures contracts, however, it may also have significant holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills or repurchase agreements.\n\nDirexion Bitcoin Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/02/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: NYSE Arca\n\nETF issuer Direxion joined the list of companies seeking to introduce Ethereum futures ETFs, after it filed its application for a combined Bitcoin and Ether Futures Fund on August 2.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the prospectus, the Fund aims to achieve its investment objective through

and redeemed only in large blocks called \u201cCreation Units,\u201d comprising 25,000 shares each.\n\nThere\u2019s no minimum investment set for the fund, which may also invest in other ETFs with exposure to futures products.\n\nBitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Weight ETF\n\nFiled: 08/03/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/17/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nBitwise followed with another filing on August 3, which includes applications for two dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures-based products: Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Weight ETF and Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight ETF.\n\nThe Market Weight fund\u2019s strategy is to invest in either Bitcoin futures contracts or Ether futures contracts, with the allocation based on the relative market capitalization between the two cryptocurrencies and rebalanced each month.\n\nDetails for the latter are scarce, as the information in the prospectus is not complete and may be changed.\n\nAgain, the filing states the investments would be done through the company\u2019s Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProshares Bitcoin & Ether Strategy ETF Bitcoin\n\nFiled: 08/02/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nFiled on August 2, ProShares\u2019 dual Bitcoin & Ether Strategy ETF seeks investment results that track the performance of the S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap CME Futures Index, with investments mostly targeting front-month crypto futures.\n\nAs is the case with the company\u2019s Short Ether Strategy ETF and Ether Strategy ETF, the fund seeks to qualify as a regulated investment company, expecting to invest a portion of its assets (up to 25%) in a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and advised by ProShare Advisors.\n\nThe filing also states that the Fund will issue and redeem shares only to authorized participants (typically broker-dealers) in exchange for cash in large blocks, known as Creation Units.\n\nThe fund\u2019s shares may only be purchased and sold by retail investors in secondary market transactions through broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries\n\nProshares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/03/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/17/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nProShares\u2019 fourth application in three days came on August 3, stating that the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF \"seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, that track the performance of the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Index.\"\n\n\u201cThe Index measures the performance holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts,\u201d reads the filing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimilar to the three previous filings, ProShare\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF will have exposure to futures and generate qualifying income by investing up to 25% of its assets in front-month crypto futures through a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\nAdditionally, the fund may invest in shares of other ETFs, which are registered investment companies that are traded on stock exchanges and hold assets such as stocks or bonds.\n\nThe filing further states that any cash balances maintained in connection with its use of derivatives are expected to typically be held in high-quality, short-term money market instruments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills and Repurchase Agreements.\n\nKelly Ethereum Ether Strategy ETF (EX)\n\nFiled: 08/04/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/18/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nDenver-based investment firm Kelly Strategic Management first filed for an Ethereum futures ETF back in November 2021; however, those plans were eventually shelved after none of the other similar products that landed on the SEC\u2019s desk materialized.\n\nAccording to an updated prospectus filed with the SEC on August 4, Kelly Ethereum Ether Strategy ETF (EX) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, in standardized, cash-settled Ether futures contracts traded on CFTC-registered commodity exchanges, as well as pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to Ether.\n\nAs with the majority of the other Ether futures ETF hopefuls, the Fund will invest in futures contracts traded on the CME indirectly, via a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The latter complies with the provisions of the 1940 Act relating to affiliated transactions and custody.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/04/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/3/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Nasdaq\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinancial services firm Valkyrie Digital Assets made a surprise move on August 4 when it submitted another update to its existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, declaring its intention to convert it into a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF that will primarily invest in front-month Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts through a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Fund\u2019s Summary Prospectus, Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, on or around October 3, 2023, the principal investment strategies of Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF will change to pursue its investment objective through managed exposure to a combination of bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts,\u201d read the filing\u2019s definitive materials.\n\nThe fund\u2019s name is also expected to change to Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF on or about October 3, however, it will keep the same ticker symbol \u201cBTF\u201d and is expected to continue to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nPer the prospectus, in addition to its investments in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, the fund will also invest its remaining assets directly in cash, cash-like instruments or high-quality securities, including bills, notes, and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, as well as money market funds and/or corporate debt securities.\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF is one of the few to state a management fee of 0.95%.\n\nBitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/10/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/09/2023\n\nListing Exchange: NYSE Arca\n\nOn August 10, Bitwise filed an updated prospectus for its existing Bitcoin futures ETF, signaling its intention to turn the fund into an ETF centered on an equal-weight strategy for both Bitcoin and Ether, with the effective date set for October 9.\n\nThis means the firm now has as many as three applications for Ethereum-related ETFs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs per its filing, Bitwise's Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF will be renamed to Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF, while also altering its ticker from BITF to BTOP.\n\nThis strategic shift mirrors a similar move made by Valkyrie, which also modified its Bitcoin Strategy ETF into a Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. Notably, this change aligns with the trend of various companies filing for Ethereum-focused ETFs.\n\nThe Fund is a series of Bitwise Funds Trust and is regulated as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 1940 Act, with investments\u2014made through a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary\u2014primarily going into front-month Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts traded on the CME and rebalanced each quarter.\n\nThe Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF states a management fee of 0.85%.\n\nValkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/16/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/30/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Nasdaq\n\nValkyrie followed its previous filing to convert the existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF into a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF with another application for Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF.\n\nIn an August 16 filing, Valkyrie said that \u201cEther may be regarded as a currency or digital commodity depending on its specific use in particular transactions.\u201d The filing further stated that, despite significant periods of price volatility, Ethereum may also be used as a store of value.\n\nIn addition to the investments in Ethereum futures, the fund will also invest directly in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo help maintain the desired level of exposure to the Ethereum futures contracts, the Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements\u2014a form of borrowing in which the fund sells portfolio securities to financial institutions and agrees to repurchase them at a mutually agreed-upon date and price that is higher than the original sale price, using the proceeds for investment purchases."

        "title": "New Milestone For Ethereum Could Spell Good News For ETH Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The number of Ethereum non-zero addresses, meaning addresses that hold at least some amount of Ether, just reached an all-time high. According to data from Glassnode, this metric which counts only externally owned addresses just reached an all-time high of 104,127,318. But what does this mean for the price of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Non-Zero Addresses Reach New All-Time High\n\nMore addresses mean more people are using the network and Ethereum is in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to most application aspects of the crypto industry. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years.\n\nThis growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time.\n\nAlthough only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption. In the same vein, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses only recently reached an all-time high of 47.8 million addresses.\n\nMore Addresses Means Increased Network Activity and Adoption\n\nThe growing interest in trading, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs will continue to boost the number of Ethereum users and non-zero addresses, especially now that the industry sits on the cusp of a possible bull run.\n\nETH bulls continue to hold above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to a similar metric by Glassnode Alerts, the amount of Ethereum supply last active within a seven to 10-year timeframe also just reached n new all-time high of 4.312 million ETH. This extended state of inactivity is suggestive of HODLing and long-term faith on the part of investors.\n\nBullish For The Price Of ETH\n\nIn the past, major rallies in Ether\u2019s price have coincided with a surge in new addresses on the network. During the 2021 bull run, Ethereum saw a flurry of new addresses and non-zero addresses, as its price reached an all-time high of $4,810.\n\nAs mainstream interest and adoption of Ethereum grow, the value and price of Ether (ETH) are likely to increase. Non-zero addresses mean activity on many addresses is increasing, which can create buy pressure in addition to other factors that should push ETH\u2019s price higher.\n\nAdditionally, investment companies are looking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ethereum futures, which could propel a spike in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nRight now, ETH is currently trading at $1,852 and is looking to break above the resistance being mounted at $2,000 by the bears.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

In order to promote decentralization, Rocket Pool has a network of over 3,100 node operators and over 780,000 ETH staked for liquid staking on Ethereum.\n\nFollowing the news, the RPL token increased by over 6.9% to $28.78. RPL is up 0.10% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nCoinbase is involved with Rocket Pool's Oracle DAO in addition to providing funding, and it uses ETH taken from its corporate balance sheet to run a sizable number of nodes on the Rocket Pool network.\n\nThe decision fits in with Coinbase's broader initiatives to secure and decentralize the expansion of Ethereum's infrastructure in order to bring more users on to the blockchain."

        "content": "On August 9th, the NFT community eagerly tuned in to witness the unfolding of Frank DeGods\u2019 pivotal announcements regarding his NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts. While the anticipated revelations did not disappoint, they also sparked a compelling conversation about the potential impact on y00ts\u2019 value and status within the NFT realm.\n\nTransitioning to Ethereum: The Big Step for y00ts\n\nAt approximately 5:30 pm ET, the first announcement reverberated across the NFT landscape: y00ts would be migrating from Polygon to Ethereum. This migration, though fraught with promise, has raised valid concerns within the community. The timing of the migration, while yet to be confirmed, marks a significant shift for y00ts, raising questions about its perceived value in relation to other NFTs.\n\nPolygon y00ts\n\nThis strategic shift in migrating y00ts from Polygon to Ethereum, while laden with potential benefits, carries implications that extend beyond the immediate NFT landscape. The decision to depart from Polygon, a platform that had provided a substantial grant as part of the original move, could be perceived as a nuanced challenge for the Polygon ecosystem. The return of the grant funds, which were initially intended to incentivize growth, marks an unexpected turn in the relationship between y00ts and Polygon. This move could be interpreted as a momentary black eye for Polygon, raising questions about its ability to retain high-profile projects and ensure the longevity of partnerships in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and NFTs.\n\n1. y00ts will be migrating to Ethereum. \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nValue Dilution and the Second-Tier Conundrum\n\nThe announcement of y00ts\u2019 migration has brought forth a mixed sentiment within the NFT sphere. While Ethereum\u2019s broader liquidity and reach are undeniably appealing, some stakeholders worry that this move could potentially lead to a dilution of y00ts\u2019 value. The transition to the Ethereum mainnet begs the question: will y00ts maintain their standing as a unique and valuable NFT collection, or will they be relegated to a second-tier status in the broader Ethereum NFT landscape?\n\nMarket Dynamics and Response: Uncertainty Breeds Volatility\n\nIn response to the announcement, the subsequent overnight volatility signaled a more nuanced narrative. A portion of holders exhibited caution, resulting in a decline of the floor price to 1.7 ETH. This downturn, equating to an 8% reduction on the day and a staggering 23% decline from a recent local peak, underscores the market\u2019s uncertainty and the delicate balance that the y00ts migration seeks to navigate.\n\nIn Search of Balance: Innovating without Compromising\n\nFrank DeGods\u2019 announcements on August 9th have ushered in a period of introspection and contemplation within the NFT community. The move to Ethereum is undoubtedly a testament to the project\u2019s commitment to embracing technology and innovation. However, the potential implications for y00ts\u2019 value have also ignited an essential conversation about maintaining uniqueness and desirability within a broader, more expansive ecosystem.\n\nTL;DR: Frank DeGods\u2019 decision to migrate y00ts to Ethereum has sparked discussions about the potential impact on y00ts\u2019 value and position within the NFT space. While the move offers access to Ethereum\u2019s liquidity, concerns have arisen about the potential dilution of y00ts\u2019 value and whether they might become second-tier NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Coinbase, a leading U.S. crypto exchange, officially launched Base, its Ethereum layer 2 network, to the general public on August 9, 2023.\n\nThe Base testnet launched in February, followed by a developer-specific release in July. Built on Optimism\u2019s software stack known as the OP Stack, Base operates as a rollup network, a scaling solution that processes transactions off the main Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, providing a more efficient and affordable network for decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBetting on Base\n\nSince its inception, Base has integrated with a wide array of crypto projects, including DeFi protocols, wallets, bridges, oracles, analytics, and infrastructure providers.\n\nUnlike other layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, Coinbase has confirmed that it has no plans to introduce any native tokens to Base. Pollak insisted that tokens \u201cdistort\u201d what is being done on a network, something Coinbase would rather avoid in favor of focusing on incubating developers.\n\nThe launch of Base aligns with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s vision for the fourth phase of the company\u2019s development, aimed at mass adoption through decentralized apps. The new network is anticipated to become the default network for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products.\n\nIn connection with the Base launch, Coinbase announced plans for corporate partnerships, including with Coca-Cola, to showcase the new project\u2019s capabilities, and it emphasizes integration into daily life rather than mere speculation.\n\nThe launch of Base represents a significant step forward in the evolution of blockchain technology, opening new opportunities for developers, users, and the broader crypto ecosystem."

The Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis approach used to predict future price movements in financial markets and is based on the idea that market prices move in repetitive patterns or waves, driven by the collective psychology of investors. From the November 2021 peak of $4951, the coin price tumbled around 82% to mark a $883 low in June 2022. If the wave counts are corrected, the ETH price could start a new impulse wave.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Revises Bitcoin Futures ETF To Bitcoin And Ether Strategy ETF\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nA channel pattern carries the current recovery rally in the ETH price\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 49 reflects a neutral sentiment in the market.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $3.25 Billion, indicating a 23.6% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nConsidering the first wave of impulse started from the June 2022 low of $883 to August 2022 at $2029, the second wave(correction) retraced to around 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level and bottomed around $1074.\n\nA bullish upswing initiated from this low could be the third wave of an impulsive trend. In theory, the third wave is referred to as the most powerful and dynamic phase of a market trend.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the 3rd wave could be Wave 1 x 1.62%, 2.62%, or 4.25%. Thus, the potential target for Ethereum price could be $2900, $4010, or $5830 respectively.\n\nCan ETH Price Rally to $2500?\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nBy the press time, the Ethereum price traded at $1853 with an intraday gain of 0.08%. The daily time frame chart shows the ETH price is resonating in a rising channel pattern. Amid the ongoing correction, the coin price would retest the support trendline to recuperate the bullish momentum. A potential reversal from this trendline would bolster buyers for a rally to $2500 registering a 35% growth.

        "title": "3 reasons why Ether price is still pinned below $1,900 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether's price has been locked within a tight trading range spanning from $1,800 to $1,900 since July 21. This remarkable lack of volatility has instilled a sense of uncertainty and skepticism among investors, despite recent positive developments, which include the launch of PayPal\u2019s Ethereum-based stablecoin and a surge in requests for Ether-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nPayPal\u2019s entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies could signify a major step toward mainstream adoption for Ethereum. However, this move also raises concerns about centralization and the potential loss of control over personal assets.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has recently witnessed a surge in applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs, which mirrors a trend of major asset management firms seeking to establish spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nETH\u2019s drop in DApp deposits and active users is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is having problems because of high gas fees, which are the costs for transactions, including those done with smart contracts. For the past two months, the average transaction fee has been more than $4, which limited the demand for its decentralized apps (DApps).\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThere has been a noticeable decline in the total value locked (TVL) of deposits on the Ethereum network. This decrease marked the lowest TVL level observed over the past three years, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nWhile there may have been some shifts in this trend over the past week, the current scenario still reflects a substantial reduction in Ether deposits, specifically around 12.9 million, in contrast to the 14.75 million recorded three months ago.\n\nTo ascertain whether the decline in Ethereum\u2019s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, investors should monitor the utilization of DApps. It\u2019s important to note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is concerning. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 25% fewer active users. This might reflect that investors aren\u2019t satisfied with how much it costs to transact on the network.\n\nExamining Ether derivatives can help to figure out whether the $1,800 level could actually prove a reliable support level based on how ETH investors are positioned.\n\nDerivatives metrics show balanced demand between bulls and bears\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs per the futures premium, also referred to as the basis indicator, professional traders in the Ether market have remained unable to adopt a bullish stance since July 16.

Several development teams within the ecosystem have announced their offerings for the Base network, which presently incorporates a version of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nWhile Ether\u2019s bullish prospects are fueled by the potential approval of an ETF and the substantial user base facilitated by PayPal\u2019s stablecoin, the network finds itself confronted by competition from existing smart contract platforms and challengers with ample resources.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPayments solution provider Visa has unveiled an experimental solution on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to pay gas fees uing their Visa credit or debit cards.\n\nThe initiative aims to streamline the process of interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the company, the trial \u201chelps set the stage for a more accessible and user-friendly approach to digital transactions.\u201d\n\nThe successful test was conducted during an internal hackathon on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, a replica of the Ethereum mainnet's functionality designed for testing purposes, and follows the publication of a deep dive report on self-custodial crypto wallets at the end of the last year, in which Visa researched the potential of auto-payments on the Ethereum network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTraditionally, users need to acquire ETH from exchanges or on-ramp services and then transfer the coins to their wallets to cover fluctuating gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet or when transacting in stablecoins such as USDT or USDC. This often leads to overspending or insufficient ETH balances, increasing the complexity of the user experience.\n\nVisa's technical team utilized a combination of cutting-edge technologies to facilitate this experiment, including paymaster smart contract agreement, account abstraction, as well as the ERC-4337 standard.\n\nAccount abstraction refers to a comprehensive concept that involves transforming a traditional crypto wallet into a \"smart contract wallet.\" This evolution goes beyond the conventional setup of a public and private key pair, offering enhanced capabilities such as gasless transactions, batch transactions, and social recovery.\n\nERC-4337, in turn, is an Ethereum standard that outlines a specific approach for implementing account abstraction within a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nHow the tech works\n\nIn Visa's implementation, the process begins when a user intends to execute a transaction on the blockchain. To initiate the operation, the wallet generates a User Operation request, which includes details about the intended transaction (known as \"calldata\") and the maximum cost allocated for the operation, encompassing parameters associated with gas fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpecifically, the parameters within this request define the gas limit, determining the highest computational effort allocated for the operation, and the gas fee, specifying the cost for each unit of computation required.\n\nHowever, rather than immediately transmitting the User Operation request to the blockchain, the wallet takes an intermediary step. It sends the User Operation along with the user's Visa card credentials to a paymaster web service (as depicted in Step 2 below).\n\nPaymaster Flow. Image source: Visa Crypto\n\nThis web service then utilizes the gas fee details to calculate the appropriate fiat currency cost that the user should be charged. Simultaneously, leveraging the provided card credentials, the card-issuing institution may opt to authorize the card payment.\n\nThe chosen payment acceptance solution for the web service is Visa's own payment management platform Cybersource, which equips developers with essential Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and empowers merchants to seamlessly accept digital payments.\n\nOnce the payment has been successfully processed via Cybersource, the web service generates a digital signature encompassing pertinent information within the User Operation. This includes the calldata specifics and gas fee particulars (as indicated in Step 3, above). Additionally, the web service determines a specified timeframe during which this digital signature remains valid.\n\nSubsequently, the wallet receives the digital signature and the designated time window from the web service. These details, along with the on-chain address of the paymaster contract, are then appended as the paymaster parameter to the User Operation. Once all facets of the User Operation are in place, the wallet is empowered to sign and transmit it to the blockchain (as outlined in Step 4, above).\n\nUpon reaching the blockchain, in accordance with the processing framework outlined by the ERC-4337 standard, the paymaster contract receives the User Operation data. This data should encompass the digital signature obtained from the paymaster web service. If any discrepancies or inaccuracies are detected within the provided data (such as an incorrect signature or an invalid time window), the paymaster contract is designed to trigger an error, relieving it from covering the associated gas costs.\n\nHowever, when the signature is duly validated, signifying that the web service has received the card payment to cover the operational cost of the User Operation, the paymaster contract remains error-free and proceeds to manage the cost. Consequently, the User Operation can be executed without hindrance (Step 5).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSummarizing the experiment, Visa said that \u201cthe intricacies and complexities of blockchain-based transactions have been a significant stumbling block for many users, creating a challenging learning curve and increasing user friction.\u201d The experiment, the researchers added, offers a \"promising approach to substantially addressing these challenges.\""

        "content": "On the back of Ripple\u2019s partial win over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), activity on the blockchain has ramped up quickly. This increase has now seen XRP beat out market leader Ethereum when it comes to the number of daily transactions carried out on the blockchain.\n\nRipple Leading The Pack\n\nWhile the euphoria from Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s ruling has been waning, there is still enough left to continue to drive new milestones on Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger. The most prominent of these has been the number of transactions that are being carried out on the Ledger since the ruling.\n\nDespite ending the month of July on a low note, the transactions have picked up in August. According to data from BitInfoCharts, daily transactions on the Ripple Ledger have consistently crossed 1 million since the start of August.\n\nThis puts XRPL ahead of leading blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), both of which have seen daily transaction figures come out below 1 million this month. On August 2, which has been the best day of the month so far for Ripple, transaction figures crossed 1.3 million, compared to 1.04 million for Ethereum and 390,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nXRP daily transactions rise above Ethereum | Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe new milestone comes after XRP first experienced a sharp drop in July. But since then, the blockchain has been on an upward trajectory. According to the present data, the XRP Network carried out 1.1173 million transactions on Thursday, August 9, almost double the number of its July 29 low of 612,000.\n\nHowever, despite the rise in transaction numbers, XRP continues to lag behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of volume. Coinmarketcap data shows Bitcoin\u2019s volume over the last day was $14 billion, Ethereum was in second with $4.2 billion, while XRP volume came in at $1.7 billion.\n\nToken price falls from local peak following court ruling | Source: XRPUDST on Tradingview.com\n\nSEC\u2019s Appeal Brings Down The XRP Momentum\n\nXRP had undoubtedly enjoyed a huge boost following Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 partial summary judgment in favor of Ripple in its ongoing case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nXRP experienced a massive spike from $0.47 to $0.81 (+72%) on the 13th of July (the day the partial summary judgment was given). However, it has since then retracted to the present zone. The token has maintained its current price range since the start of August with no significant movement upwards since then.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s intention to file an interlocutory appeal may also draw down XRP\u2019s momentum. In fact, XRP has reacted negatively to the aforementioned news as it is trading at around $0.6293, down 2.24% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a potential transformative move for users, Visa, the payments solution provider, is testing an innovative solution enabling on-chain gas fees to be paid using a Visa card.\n\nMustafa Bedawala, a product manager at Visa, presented the report, highlighting an observed challenge with cryptocurrency wallets; the ongoing requirement to oversee Ether (ETH) balances for covering gas fees.\n\nThe standard Ethereum procedure involves users acquiring ETH from an exchange or on-ramp service and then transferring it to their wallets to cater to variable gas fees. This continuous adjustment of gas prices frequently leads to users either overspending or having insufficient ETH, introducing intricacies and challenges.\n\nVisa\u2019s innovative solution employs Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 standard and the \u201cPaymaster\u201d smart contract, enabling off-chain gas fee settlement. The process involves the user triggering an Ethereum transaction via wallet, sent to the paymaster.\n\nImage illustrating steps involved in paying gas fees with Visa card via Paymaster. Source: Visa\n\nThe web service computes the gas fee and charges Visa using Cybersource. Subsequently, a digital signature is provided and momentarily validated, then attached by the wallet before being sent to Ethereum. Paymaster verifies the signature and covers the gas fee.\n\nThis sequence of steps allows the user to directly pay gas fees with their Visa card off-chain, eliminating the need for users to hold ETH merely for paying fees.\n\nAccording to the publication, Visa has trialed this concept on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, utilizing available open-source tools, such as Stackup\u2019s userop.js library. The trial transactions effectively covered fees through the Paymaster, bypassing the requirement for ETH.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ether price is still pinned below $1,900\n\nNotably, this concept has the potential to reduce friction for blockchain users and allows the user to directly pay gas fees with their Visa card off-chain, eliminating the need for users to hold ETH merely for paying fees.\n\nThe report also suggested wider ramifications, highlighting the potential for merchants or decentralized applications to utilize the Paymaster framework to improve customer interactions, facilitating gas fee payments using Visa cards. This innovation may also create opportunities for current wallet and Paymaster providers to introduce options for Visa card-based gas fee payments.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

Discover SCENE\n\nA landmark research paper found that Ethereum investors who\u2019ve lost funds because of cybercrime tend to see better gains after becoming victims\u2014a surprising result, according to the author, with some big caveats.\n\nPublished in early August, the investigation identified 19 unique cybercrime categories. On the Ethereum network, Ponzi schemes have accounted for 60% of funds stolen, followed by giveaways (18%), exploits (13%), and hacks (5%).\n\nPaul Momtaz, professor of entrepreneurial finance at the Technical University of Munich and one of the four co-authors, told Decrypt he was shocked to find that for Ethereum investors \u201cburning your fingers is good for you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe told Decrypt that the team discovered \u201conce you become a victim, your returns from investing in Ethereum tend to improve.\u201d\n\nThe results revealed that investors modified their risk-taking models, both according to portfolio size (smaller wallets tend to \u201cbecome gamblers,\u201d explained Momtaz), but also timeframes. In the long run, read the paper, victims reduce their overall risk by diversifying more, but also \u201cbecome less willing to take risks that are harder to control.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also came across another surprising finding: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been understating the amount of Ethereum lost to scams by a factor of 16. The paper, titled \u201cCybercrime on the Ethereum Blockchain,\u201d cites a report commissioned by the FTC that estimates $106 million worth of ETH has been lost on the network.\n\nAccording to the researchers, who ran an Ethereum full node to collect and analyze the data\u2014costing the team nearly $100,000, according to Momtaz\u2014the number of \u201cabducted funds,\u201d is closer to $1.65 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is striking,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause they are the primary agency that informs governments who later make policy decisions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Momtaz, who has written a plethora of research papers on DeFi and cryptocurrency in the past, \u201cthe crypto market is maturing.\u201d\n\nNot only because the \u201cstructure of the type of scams is changing over time,\u201d he told Decrypt, but as institutions come onboard, bringing more stringent requirements for enterprises in the industry, \u201ccrypto companies are becoming more legit,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the steep costs incurred by the team\u2013which Momtaz emphasized could be a hindrance for others, urging industry players to help with funding\u2013this type of research paper is much needed.\n\nAnother benefit of this type of research, he said, is identifying how wallets operated by cybercriminals might act. \u201cWe now have the data to develop great forensic tools to detect scams before they happen,\u201d he said."

        "content": "DeLabs\u2019 NFT project, y00ts, has taken a surprising step by migrating back to the Ethereum mainnet from the Polygon scaling network. This is just ahead of the highly anticipated unveiling of DeGods\u2019 \u201cSeason 3\u201d content. While the exact migration date remains undisclosed, this move has sparked interest, debates, and discussions within the NFT community.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDeLabs\u2019 NFT project y00ts shifts from Polygon back to Ethereum mainnet ahead of DeGods\u2019 \u201cSeason 3\u201d reveal.\n\nThe return has raised questions about project motives after migrating from Solana to Polygon with a $3 million grant.\n\nDeLabs\u2019 decision to return the grant and allocate $1 million to Polygon-native builders adds complexity to the shifting NFT landscape.\n\ny00ts \u2013 All Around The Blockchain\n\nInitially, y00ts garnered attention when it shifted from Solana to Polygon, supported by a substantial $3 million grant from Polygon Labs. This grant aimed to empower DeLabs, fostering team growth and Polygon ecosystem contributions. However, the unexpected return of y00ts to Ethereum raises questions regarding the project\u2019s motivations behind this transition.\n\nThis move comes paired with a noteworthy decision. DeLabs has opted to return the entire $3 million grant to Polygon Labs. Meanwhile, the brand allocates $1 million to support \u201cPolygon-native builders and creators.\u201d This strategic redistribution highlights the intricacies of navigating the blockchain landscape. But it also prompts responses from the NFT market.\n\nThe floor price of y00ts NFTs on OpenSea experienced a significant increase in this time. This indicates investors and collectors are closely monitoring the project\u2019s unfolding developments. In parallel, DeGods, another DeLabs creation, retains its position as a valuable NFT project in the market.\n\nThe Heavy Question: Is DeGods Rugging?\n\nAmid these strategic shifts, the NFT ecosystem eagerly anticipates the outcomes of DeLabs\u2018 decisions. The journey from Solana to Polygon and back to Ethereum underscores a willingness to explore and adapt to various blockchain environments. While the y00ts migration offers intriguing prospects, questions linger about potential synergies between y00ts and the esteemed DeGods collection on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe dynamic NFT landscape thrives on continuous innovation and exploration. DeLabs\u2019 strategic choices mirror the fluidity of the ecosystem, where creators actively seek optimal platforms to showcase their collections. As DeLabs navigates these migrations, the broader NFT community observes with keen interest, eager to witness how these choices will shape both the y00ts and DeGods projects\u2019 trajectories. These moves contribute to the ongoing evolution of the NFT realm, reaffirming its status as a dynamic and ever-changing space."

        "content": "El Salvador \u2014 a 21.041 km\u00b2 republic in Central America \u2014 made history by being the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender currency in 2021.\n\nOn September 6 of the same year, Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, announced the Salvadoran treasury bought 400 BTC at an average price of $46,811.00. Following that, there were nine new purchase announcements on different days, until June 30, 2022 \u2014 all done on Bukele\u2019s official Twitter (X) account.\n\nBesides Nayib Bukele\u2019s own statements, there is no evidence that the country has ever bought one single Bitcoin, but \u2014 for this report \u2014 we are assuming that all his words are truthful and accurate.\n\nEl Salvador bought today 80 #BTC at $19,000 each!#Bitcoin is the future!\n\n\n\nThank you for selling cheap \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/ZHwr0Ln1Ze \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) July 1, 2022\n\nWith a total investment of around $103.23 million for 2,381 BTC (at an average price of $43,357.14/btc), the country\u2019s wallet is now down around $33 million (-32%), considering Bitcoin\u2019s spot price of $29,400, by press time.\n\nBitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, highly promoted as \u2018sound money\u2019; followed by Ethereum (ETH), promoted as \u2018ultra-sound money\u2019.\n\nThis makes Finbold wonder: What if El Salvador had bought Ethereum over Bitcoin?\n\nWhat if El Salvador had bought Ethereum?\n\nAccording to data collected by Finbold\u2019s team \u2014 considering only the purchases from September 6, 2021 to June 30, 2022 \u2014 Nayib Bukele made the least worse investment decision with BTC than with ETH.\n\nIf El Salvador had used the same amount in US Dollars to buy Ethereum, on each of the same days Bukele announced the Bitcoin\u2019s purchases, according to historical price data by Coingecko, the country would be losing $15 million more than the current losses.\n\nThese investments would now be worth around $55.60 million, holding 30,053.12 ETH, for a 46.14% loss.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nIf El Salvador had staked all these Ethereum\u2019s on July 1, 2022, considering an average yield of 3.29% annually, the country\u2019s treasury would have earned around $1.83 million by now, still worse than by simply holding Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin daily purchases by El Salvador\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the president once again talked about Bitcoin purchases, declaring that he would be buying 1 BTC per day starting on November 18 within El Salvador\u2019s treasury. Since then, there have been no related updates made publicly, which keeps the promise alive.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nFinbold also collected historical price data from Coingecko for a raw simulation on the possible outcome if (A) Nayib Bukele kept his promises of buying 1 BTC per day since November 18, 2022; and (B) El Salvador had made daily ETH purchases with the same amount in USD.\n\nThere would have been a total of 267 Bitcoin purchases, at an average price of $24,692.13 per BTC, resulting in a current position of $7.85 million, profiting around $1.25 million (+19.07%) for these 267 days only. This would have reduced El Salvador\u2019s total losses to around $31.85 million.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nThe daily performance for Ethereum purchases would also have been worse than Bitcoin\u2019s. Sitting in a current amount of around $7.27 million, for an estimated profit of $0.67 million (+10.38%), making a meaningless impact on the bigger outcome.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "y00ts\u2019 disclosure of its move to Ethereum has been met with intense debate.\n\nNFT sales across blockchains have decreased in the last 30 days.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Polygon [MATIC]-based NFT collection y00ts has made a strategic decision to ignore the possibility of a move back to Solana [SOL]. Instead, it announced its migration to the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s MATIC\u2019s market cap in SOL\u2019s terms\n\nFrom Solana to Polygon, now to Ethereum\n\nWhile the y00ts Twitter handle said the date for the move was still undecided, it would ensure that it returns 100% of Polygon\u2019s grant.\n\n2. We're returning 100% of the grant provided by Polygon. The funds will be re-deployed for NFT ecosystem growth to empower builders and creators. We still love Polygon. It's just time to unite the DeGods & y00ts communities. \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nThe decision comes amid a backdrop of increasing competition among different blockchain ecosystems. However, y00ts\u2019 latest decision to move from its host is once again controversial.\n\nBefore the collection migrated to Polygon, its first stop was Solana. When it launched on the blockchain, it experienced massive adoption, making it one of the most successful Solana NFT projects. This was because DeLabs, the team behind the collection, was also behind DeGods, which was also once Solana-based.\n\nBut in March, the project\u2019s founders, led by Rohun Vora, popularly known as FrankDeGods, announced the switch to Polygon. At the time, Vora took a jab at Solana, saying the blockchain did have enough capacity to scale y00ts features but Polygon did.\n\nAnother controversy also arose then\u2014 the team denied ever receiving a $3 million grant from Polygon before recently admitting it.\n\nFinding calm amid the turbulence\n\nIt was also around the same period that DeGods moved to Ethereum. The team said that the decision to migrate y00ts was to ensure that the collection and DeGods were on the same blockchain.\n\nHowever, this decision did not sit well with some of the NFT holders. For some, it was a move well thought out as the y00ts brand did not fit the Polygon brand. Others, on the other hand, were not comfortable with moving from blockchain to blockchain.\n\nBut Vora, via his Twitter, begged the y00ts community to respect the project\u2019s decisions and the communities of all blockchains involved, saying,\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to make it work but we just need to bring our 2 communities together. I would appreciate it if everyone remains respectful of all parties involved.\u201d\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt press time, the NFT market was still in a state of upheaval. According to CryptoSlam, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon were the top three blockchains with the highest volume in the last 30 days.\n\nHowever, the ranks they had did not stop them all from registering notable drops in sales and buyers. Within the last 30 days, Ethereum NFT sales dropped by 36.91%. Polygon decreased by 29.05% while Solana NFTs fell by 56.03%."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could drop below the 50-day EMA at $29,348 as momentum indicates a flip below defining levels.\n\nEthereum price's overall bullishness stretches thin as BTC shows weakness, though delayed, a 5% drop may be inevitable.\n\nRipple price finds support on the 50-day EMA at $0.6260, but risks of a drop run high as momentum fades.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is on a downtrend, recording d three consecutive red candlesticks. This bearishness has diffused to Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices and comes at a time when the BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) bubble has burst before the eyes of traders and investors as the US Securities and Exchange Commission put off a decision concerning Cathie Wood's Ark Invest.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: US SEC likely to reject BTC ETF, experts say\n\nBitcoin price could correct premature breakout\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has been sitting on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $29,348 since August 9. However, this support oasis may be running dry as the weekend sets in because of the retail tendency to relax their trading hands around that time.\n\nAccordingly, Bitcoin price could slide below the 50-day EMA back under the descending trendline to continue its downtrend. Without a strong catalyst to trigger impulse, the people's crypto could extend south to test the 100-day EMA at $28,641 or, in a dire case, the 200-day EMA at $27,198. This is likely considering speculation of the US SEC likely rejecting BTC ETF applications.\n\nThe nose-diving Relative Strength Index (RSI), whose direction is interpreted as falling momentum, reinforces this outlook. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is in the negative zone, which points to the presence of stronger bears than bulls in the market currently.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with the weekend setting in, large holders are likely to step in, amassing or offloading BTC in huge chunks and cash in the weekend price swings. Former Morgan Stanley technical strategist Mark Newton supports this dynamic, saying:\n\nWe're seeing above-average volatility on weekends with it moving dramatically up or down\u2026 the size of individual orders is usually big with overall fewer orders. It indicates that the large holders of the cryptocurrency, so-called bitcoin whales, are active during the weekend to amass or offload bitcoins in big numbers and cash in the weekend price swings.\n\nIf they buy, Bitcoin price could extend north, potentially tagging the $31,440 resistance level or shattering past and recording a new range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and altcoin prices could benefit from cooling inflation, US PPI for July exceeds expectations.\n\nEthereum price conformity to BTC threatens its overall bullishness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is suffering because it is correlated to BTC, meaning it suffers the initial impact of a weakening Bitcoin before the ripples reach the rest of the altcoin community. Thus, if BTC slides below the downtrend line, ETH could follow suit to lose the support offered by the 100-day EMA at $1,842.\n\nThe subsequent selling pressure could see Ethereum price retest the 200-day EMA at $1,788 or, in the extreme case, test the $1,733 support level. Such a move would constitute a 5% drop from current levels.\n\nNotably, the RSI for Ethereum price is showing the same waning momentum as that of Bitcoin price, just as the MACD is in the negative zone. This adds credence to the bearish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, a new resolve among bulls could send Ethereum price north, breaking out from below the foothold of the 50-day EMA for a chance to test the $2,005 resistance level. This would denote a 10% leap above current levels.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that on-chain metrics point to an incoming rally for Ethereum price, including the low supply of tokens deposited into exchanges. This is often interpreted as a sign of increasing buying pressure, while the fact that there is increasing whale accumulation also hints at a potential increase in prices. Find details here.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum's low volatility and bullish on-chain metrics hint at potential ETH price rally\n\nRipple price could drop as 50-day EMA becomes trite\n\nRipple (XRP) price has been sitting on the 50-day EMA at $0.6308 for seven consecutive days, a risky stunt considering markets tend not to wait for so long. With broader crypto market momentum fading, chances of a slump increase, which could see the remittance token drop to the 100-day EMA at $0.5737. In a highly bearish case, the altcoin could slump further to test the $0.5206 support level.\n\nThe RSI and MACD are also nose-diving, suggesting a falling momentum that could lower Ripple price.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, bullish momentum could restore as Ripple price collects leftover liquidity from the past few days. The stability that follows and ensuing buying pressure could fuel an uptrend, possibly past the $0.6840 resistance level, or in a highly ambitious case, tag the $0.8193 resistance level. This would represent a 30% flight above present levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP rallies to $50 on Gemini, Ripple holders speculate the outcome of SEC appeal against Judge Torres' ruling"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices held steady on Thursday despite a widely-watched inflation gauge that showed a resurgence in inflation.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.2% in the 12 months through July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Wednesday, coming in slightly lower than economists\u2019 expectations. The uptick comes after inflation slowed to 3% annually in June.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in July, the same as a 0.2% increase the month before. The BLS said the index\u2019s monthly increase was largely fueled by shelter prices, which rose 0.4% during the month and accounted for 90% of CPI\u2019s overall increase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were largely unaffected by the report\u2019s release, holding steady at around $29,600 and $1850, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Other Coins, such as Dogecoin and Solana, were also flat, edging up less than 1%.\n\nAs the Fed draws closer to a so-called soft landing, where it\u2019s able to reign in inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, IntoTheBlock\u2019s Head of Research Lucas Outumuro said each month\u2019s CPI report is steadily becoming less of an impact in crypto markets.\n\n\u201cCPI prints are becoming less and less relevant for crypto and even markets in general,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cI think that we're seeing the worst of inflation is behind us.\u201d\n\nFor example, after annual inflation came in at a multi-decade high of 9.1% last June, Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped 4% and 6%, respectively, in the hour after the CPI report\u2019s release. That was back when traders weren\u2019t sure the Fed could clamp down on rampant inflation without effectively putting the economy into a coma.\n\n\u201cPeople didn't think soft landing was possible at the beginning of this year,\u201d Outumuro said. \u201cNow they're close to pulling it off\u2014it's a positive surprise for markets and hence why stocks are up so much this year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuly\u2019s CPI report will be one of several factors weighed by the Federal Reserve at its next Federal Open Markets Committee meeting in September, as its fight against inflation soldiers on.\n\nThe U.S. central bank has tried to tame soaring prices by raising interest rates, which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow.\n\nHigher interest rates have weighed on crypto prices and stocks alike, as so-called risk assets become less attractive in the eyes of investors compared to short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash reserves, which see their yields increase as the Fed tightens.\n\nThe Fed began its fight against inflation 18 months ago when it lifted rates from near zero last March. And while inflation has trended down from a sweltering 9.1% clip last summer, the Fed\u2019s ultimate goal is 2%, which Fed Chair Powell said last month he doesn\u2019t expect until at least 2025.\n\nThe Fed officially adopted its target of 2% in 2012 under former Fed chair Ben Bernanke. And while the U.S. central bank has been laser-focused on getting there, there\u2019s also the possibility that its mandate changes down the line, Edward Moya, Chief Market Analyst at OANDA, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cI think that [the Fed] might be able to live with inflation that\u2019s slightly above their target,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have policy reviews, and they might change what they have to do with inflation.\u201d\n\nFor the Fed, Moya said the strength of the U.S. consumer is also quite important. And a spike in energy prices over the past month could put a dent in American\u2019s wallets while pushing up inflation in the coming CPI report as well.\n\n\u201cThe next inflation report will definitely feel the impact of the surge in energy prices,\u201d Moya said. \u201cThe risks of a reacceleration a few months down the road, remain on the table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.82 on Wednesday, up over 7% from $3.53 a month ago, according to AAA. Experts have attributed the spike to extreme heat and oil production cuts, per ABC News.\n\nThe Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point rate hike last month that pushed its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 22 years. At a range of 5.25% and 5.5%, Powell said future rate hikes will be a meeting-by-meeting decision.\n\nStripping out food and energy prices, which are known to be volatile, so-called core inflation rose 4.7% in the twelve months through July. It represented a slight decrease from 4.8% in June.\n\nThe Fed considers core CPI a more accurate indicator of where inflation might be headed. It also looks closely at the Personal Consumption Index, set to be released on Aug. 31. It\u2019s considered to be the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nIn terms of what could lie ahead, traders think the most likely outcome is that the Fed holds interest rates steady until at least January 2024, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool on Thursday.\n\nAt their meeting in September, traders currently have an 86% chance penciled in that rates remain where they currently are."

        "content": "Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Shares Insights on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Reputation\n\nSource: ShutterStock\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has revealed that a larger section of the crypto community did not respect Sam Bankman-Fried as depicted by the mainstream media.\n\nButerin has been a long critic of Bankman Fried since the collapse of the latter\u2019s digital asset exchange, FTX, and has made new revelations concerning the matter.\n\nSpeaking in a podcast interview with Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy, Buterin spoke on the reputation of SBF, how the sector continues to recover from the infamous scandal, and the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to Buterin, the crypto industry had reservations about SBF from the beginning although no one expected $8 billion to go into thin air.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people have this misconception that everybody deeply respected Sam and that he caught the entire ecosystem by surprise \u2026 but if you\u2019re looking at Ethereum influencers like Anthony Sassano, a lot of them disrespected him and FTX from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe main reason for Buterin\u2019s judgment was SBF\u2019s inability to project the cause of cryptocurrencies and related technologies without financial benefits.\n\n\u201cHe was just not able to articulate a vision of why crypto was good\u2014he just clearly saw it as purely a business opportunity. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, hey, crypto is this thing where you can make money,\u201d he added.\n\nRecall that after the collapse of FTX, Buterin noted that people were mostly drawn to the marketing of FTX which he compared to the \u201c1930 dictators\u201d adding that cryptocurrencies are more than the lifestyle and brands of the company.\n\nAI will augment human power\n\nButerin also spoke on the rapid development of AI in several industries including cryptocurrencies hailing the level of adoption so far.\n\nAccording to him, AI would help human capabilities in the workspace and should be embraced at this stage citing the example of ChatGPT .\n\n\u201cI think one of the positive aspects of this is that I think it\u2019s a good example of how, instead of AI killing 30% of the jobs, which would be catastrophic and terrible, it\u2019s like, AI is killing 30% of your job, which is an amazing time saver.\u201d\n\nHe touched on the ability of AI to disrupt the creative space including the production of movies in Hollywood. Although he stated that he doesn\u2019t want to see artists get replaced, he added that he would love to see an author easily produce a movie with the numerous tools provided by AI.\n\n\u201cI would want to see the cost of making a movie go down from $100,000 to one person with basically just his creativity and a couple of months with an AI platform.\u201d"

        "title": "Analyst Predicts ETH to Plunge 50% Against BTC: The End for Altcoins? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe altcoin market is facing a 40-50% drop\n\nBenjamin Cowen predicts a drop in Ethereum price for the same 40-50% decrease against Bitcoin\n\nThe analysis is valid and highly likely\n\nA popular macro investor and analyst behind Into the Cryptoverse Benjamin Cowen was interviewed by Crypto Banted host Ran Neuner. Among topics like \u201cAre altcoins coming back,\u201d \u201cWhy is Bitcoin better than Ethereum?\u201d and \u201cMacro Economics & Fundamentals,\u201d Cowen has stated that his analysis points out a potential 50% dip in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin (ETHBTC).\n\nIt is worth delving deeper into this possibility and look into some of the other possibilities moving forward.\n\nWhere Does This Target Come From?\n\nThe first chart Benjamin uses is a ratio he developed in order to spot the altcoin market tops. The altcoin market cap (TOTAL3) minus USDT (deducting stablecoin) is divided by the BTC market cap.\n\nAs he states, when the ratio reached 1 it points out at the altcoin market tops, while it bottomed out at the 0.25 level. Measuring from its current level of 0.45 to its bottom area, there is a decrease potential of 44%.\n\nThe first question is how valid is this ratio, and can it be trusted? While comparing the prices of some altcoins that were most successful in the previous cycle and some that were not so much, we can see that the ratio is accurate.\n\nOn the chart above, we have inserted price charts of SOL, ADA, DOT, AVAX, DOGE, LINK, and MATIC. Aside from ADA, which is skewed to the left other altcoin tops match those of the ratio 1 mark interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, regarding bottoms, some of the compared altcoins were new to the market and there is no price history before July 2020. But December 28 was the lowest the ratio has been and from that point onward, we have seen bull market runups in these coins.\n\nThis ratio is for the altcoin market in general, and the total market cap 3 excludes Ethereum. So now let\u2019s take a closer look at the Ethereum chart and what Benjamin Cowen states about it.\n\nETH/BTC\n\nAccording to Benjamin the price of ETH in BTC is forming a double-top chart pattern indicating a distribution phase.\n\nThe last time we saw a double top on the monthly chart, was in Jun 2017 to January 2018, after which a decline of 85% followed.\n\nWith the average monthly returns in the red from June to December, historically speaking, and with the double top forming on the monthly chart, these are the reasons Cowan believes that we are going to see a breakout to the downside.\n\nAccording to our chart, there is a significant support zone at 0.036 BTC which is 42.6% lower than the current level of 0.063 BTC. Cowan also points out this zone as the potential ending point of the \u201caltcoin reckoning.\u201d\n\nThe reasons behind this altcoin reckoning he sees in the traditional markets and the seasonal correction in the S&P500. Another reason he speculates that could be the catalyst for this ETHBTC plummet is the DeFi depreciating prices and collateral debt position (CDP) liquidations.\n\nConclusion\n\nCowen is a respected analyst who first came into the scene by introducing logarithmic regression analysis to analyzing Bitcoin and his macro outlooks. He is a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, which \u201callows him to bring a unique perspective to the crypto verse.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe analysis he presented is well-researched and backtested, so there isn\u2019t a reason for doubt except for the standard probability chance that the data history indicates the potential future outcome.\n\nThere are strong clues that the altcoin market has indeed reached only halfway in the bear cycle, so another final low could occur with the prices in general decreasing by another 40-50%, and Ethereum is not an expedition.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading in red on Friday after better-than-expected US inflation data. The two largest cryptocurrencies continue to shake off macro waves. Other than macroeconomic factors, analysts continue to eye $30,000-mark for the Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its fall as on Friday as the largest crypto token dropped about another per cent to slip below 29,500-mark once again. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading slightly lower but brached $1,850-levels after the latest weakness. Price action in the major altcoins was on the lower side.\n\n\n\nBaring a few names, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Bitcoin Cash dropped more than 3 per cent, while Cardano dropped about 2 per cent. BNB, Litecoin and Polkadot shed over a per cent each. Among the gainers, Solana and Shiba Inu rose 2 per cent, while Tron added about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite lower, falling down to $1.17 trillion-mark as it dropped almost a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 26 per cent to $25.84 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform:\n\nBNBis currently moving sideways within a horizontal channel in the medium term. The candle sticks have inched closer to the $240 level in the past two days which coincides with its 50-day moving average.\n\n\n\nIf there is any upside momentum, additional gains could potentially drive the price towards the resistance levels of $250 and $265. Its RSI slope, moving sideways, indicates that the underlying buying pressure for BNB isn\u2019t strong. On the downside, if BNB fails to withhold the $230 support level, it may revisit support zones at $220.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $220, $230\n\nResistance: $250, $265, $280\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Solana Beats Out Ethereum To Emerge As Best Performer In Terms Of TVL - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently dominating the DeFi and smart contract niches when it comes to the Total Value Locked (TVL). However, while Ethereum is still the king, other chains like Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot compete to prove themselves worthy contenders to the throne.\n\nSolana, in particular, has seen some massive growth recently in terms of its total value locked (TVL). According to on-chain data from Messari, Solana outperformed other chains by achieving a total value-locked (TVL) gain of 14% over the course of the previous month.\n\nSolana Sees Massive Growth in Total Value Locked\n\nThe aggregated TVL of the entire DeFi sector has been in a freefall since November 2022, and Solana hasn\u2019t been exempted. However, Solana\u2019s growth during the past month was driven in significant part by an increase in the TVL of protocols for staking and yielding based on Solana.\n\nTVL refers to the total amount of assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and is used as a metric to rank platforms. On-chain reports show that Solana grew its TVL by $45 million in July, corresponding to a 14.4% growth.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Solana currently sits at the 9th position in terms of TVL locked in all chains. Solana is now at a TVL of $320.07 million, representing a massive growth from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile Ethereum still has the highest value with a TVL of $23.3 billion, it saw its TVL decline by 13% over the past month. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) also posted a monthly loss in TVL, dropping by 4.6% to $3.3 billion.\n\nSOL price recovers to $24.75 as TVL grows | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHow Far Can SOL Go In 2023?\n\nWhile the increase in TVL is due in part to an increase in the TVL of protocols, Solana also witnessed a surge in price at the beginning of July. Data from Coinmarketcap shows the price of Solana shot up from $18.9 on July 1 to $27.4 on July 16 to reach a market cap of $11.81 billion.\n\nSolana, along with Bitcoin, led the surge in the crypto market around this time period. As a consequence, the surge in Solana\u2019s price led to a direct proportion in the value of the total assets locked in DeFi protocols on the chain.\n\nDespite having a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on the chain dropped toward the end of the month. Its market cap also dropped to $9.7 billion at the end of July, demonstrating the volatility of the crypto market.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana is trading at $24.85 and is up by 14.93% in a monthly timeframe. Although experts predict Solana can surge above $30 before the end of the year.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The so-called carbon-negative blockchain developed by CLabs voted to become an Ethereum scaling network in July.\n\nBNB Chain is also impacted by the success of Ethereum layer 2 networks as its community has been considering ways to lower transaction fees on the network to remain competitive.\n\nThe blockchain also has a layer 2 network called opBNB, which is currently in its testnet phase.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

The meme currency is the darling of investors, as they believe it could replicate Dogecoin and Shiba Inu\u2019s success. However, the social media mentions for July could most likely be negative, as the token relentlessly dipped last month.

        "content": "The financial landscape is constantly evolving, and cryptocurrency continues to be a leading force in this revolution. While Ethereum has caught the eyes of many investors for its potential to break through the $2,000 barrier again, another crypto entity, InQubeta, is making waves with its groundbreaking presale growth.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s Impressive Presale Surge\n\nBefore we delve deeper into Ethereum\u2019s potential rise, it\u2019s crucial to note the meteoric ascent of InQubeta. With its presale showing an astonishing 1500% growth trajectory, InQubeta is rapidly becoming a hot topic in investment circles.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s approach is unique, focusing on creating a platform that allows fractional investment in AI start-ups using QUBE tokens. This means that instead of investors having to stake large amounts in startups, they can now take a different approach, investing as per their comfort and financial capability. Such a model promotes democratization in the investment ecosystem, allowing everyone a shot at being a part of groundbreaking AI innovations.\n\nOne of the standout features of InQubeta\u2019s model is the QUBE token. As a deflationary ERC20 token, QUBE offers crypto investors a different avenue to diversify their portfolios. With buy and sell tax mechanisms that benefit the token\u2019s ecosystem, investors can earn rewards through staking their tokens. This makes QUBE an attractive investment for those believing in the growth potential of AI technology start-ups.\n\nMoreover, the InQubeta NFT marketplace is another innovative feature. Here, investors use $QUBE tokens to invest in AI start-ups through fractional investment opportunities. These investments are in the form of reward and equity-based NFTs, making the process transparent, efficient, and, most importantly, lucrative for both investors and start-ups.\n\nWith the presale already garnering over $2.1 million and still surging, it\u2019s evident that the crypto community recognizes InQubeta\u2019s potential. The roadmap for InQubeta is also ambitious, with plans for the NFT marketplace launch and multichain expansion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential Breakthrough\n\nComing back to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, there\u2019s palpable anticipation around its possible return to the $2,000 mark. Since its inception, Ethereum has been seen as a major player in the DeFi sector and a formidable competitor to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s past fluctuations have kept some investors on edge, many experts believe that its fundamental strengths, coupled with growing institutional interest and a robust decentralized application ecosystem, could propel its price. The platform\u2019s smart contract functionality continues to be a major draw, with several decentralized apps and projects relying on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain for their operations.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader economic environment, the potential for new blockchain competitors, and regulatory challenges when evaluating Ethereum\u2019s future price potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s potential breakthrough is on many traders\u2019 radar, it\u2019s impossible to overlook the promising rise of InQubeta. By tapping into the limitless potential of AI technology and offering a unique, inclusive investment platform, InQubeta may well be setting a new standard in the crypto investment realm.

        "title": "Analysts Bullish on Ethereum ETFs, but How Is ETH Performing? Pomerdoge Predicted to 2,000% In 2023 - The Economic Times",
        "content": "The narratives shaping the crypto market are quite intriguing. There appears to be a glimmer of hope for Ethereum ETFs as analysts have predicted its bullishness. On the flip side, Ethereum (ETH) performance has come under intense scrutiny as a result of the crypto market volatility.\n\nAmid these uncertain times, Pomerdoge (POMD), a new project , has surfaced in the crypto space with promising gains that captivate the minds of investors.\n\nClick Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD)\n\nEthereum ETFs (ETF) Set to Stay Bullish by Analysts' Projection\n\nModeled after the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum has come up with another exciting investment option that allows investors to trade on the stock exchange. The Ethereum ETFs which came up as a result of the Volatility Shares filing in June have heightened the intense competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCrypto experts are predicting that Ethereum ETFs may likely remain on the upward trajectory due to these factors. First, ETFs can be traded on the stock exchange which seems easier and more convenient for investors.\n\nSecondly, ETFs are an investment option that is secure and regulated. It can serve as an entry point for investors and financial institutions who may not be in sync with traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. By leveraging the ETH price and attracting more investors, ETH is expected to remain bullish.\n\nHow Is Ethereum (ETH) Shaping Up in Terms of Performance\n\nAfter the early 2023 bull run in which many crypto tokens receive price boost, the reality of the current market is beginning to set in. Ethereum which had jumped the $2000 mark during the bull is now back to its pre-bull run price, with the current price trading at $1832.\n\nDespite this upheaval, experts are predicting a bullish run for Ethereum, with some analysts expecting it to outshine Bitcoin in the next bull run.\n\nWhile giving the reason for this perspective, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group stated that the Bitcoin halving which is expected to happen next April and the massive adoption of Ethereum by financial institutions is an obvious sign that Ethereum will bounce back to the $2000 threshold.\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) Set to Dethrone SHIB and DOGE\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Pomerdoge, a new project bringing new ideas into the gaming industry. Pomerdoge is a newly built gaming platform that allows players to compete, interact and network globally. The platform will allow players through its Pomerplace marketplace to transact in-game assets like NFTs, cards and avatars.\n\nPomerdoge has also developed a utility token that will serve as a transaction token on the platform. Those who purchase the token at presale value will have access to the collection of 7,777 NFTs when they are launched.\n\nPOMD holders will also be able to acquire a certain percentage that is commensurate with their token worth from the platform game revenue. To vouchsafe investors' assets, Pomerdoge has undergone auditing by SolidProof and Cyberscope.\n\nAnalysts are predicting that POMD will skyrocket by 2,000% before the end of the year.\n\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Today\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "y00ts is ditching Polygon for Ethereum.\n\nThe move has raised questions about the Polygon NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe data tells a different story.\n\nThe migration of DeLabs\u2019 NFT project y00ts to Polygon in April 2023 was met with significant fanfare due to the project\u2019s success on the Solana network. But just four months later, y00ts is now bidding farewell to Polygon.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 9, DeLabs announced that y00ts would migrate to the Ethereum network. The team also revealed they would return $3 million in grants from Polygon Labs.\n\nFollowing DeLabs\u2019 decision, questions about Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem have arisen.\n\ny00ts Exit a Blow to Polygon?\n\nSeveral crypto community members have asserted that y00ts\u2019 planned exit from the Polygon network is a blow to the network. \u201cSucks for polygon,\u201d one user tweeted in response. Prominent Cardano influencer Chris O simply stated, \u201cRip Polygon.\u201d\n\nDespite the negative views, it is worth noting that not all are pessimistic about the move. zkPhantazm suggested that y00ts had ended up giving Polygon free promotion, framing it as a win for Polygon Labs. Additionally, the user claimed that y00ts was bailing because it had failed to meet the KPI for the grant. zkPhantazm received a retweet from Polygon Labs Executive Chairman Sandeep Nailwal for his efforts.\n\nSo just to understand, @y00tsNFT helped @0xPolygonLabs for 0 dollars.\n\n\n\n\u2705 Basically got polygon free marketing\n\n\u2705 Free added volume, free exposure\n\n\u2705Free added activity, and free increased users?\n\nContrary to people spamming L in comments, see this as an absolute W for Polygon.\u2026 https://t.co/9cLPgN3J3R \u2014 zkPhantazm (@zkPhantazm) August 10, 2023\n\nSo how much of an impact will y00ts\u2019 exit have on Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem?\n\nPolygon\u2019s NFT Ecosystem\n\nPolygon has processed over $30.8 million in NFT sales in the past 30 days, behind only Solana and Ethereum per data from CryptoSlam at the time of writing. For clarity, y00ts only accounts for about 8% of Polygon\u2019s NFT sales within the period with $2.5 million.\n\nIn comparison, collections like Draft Kings and Misfits by Pluto are garnering notoriety within the Polygon community. Draft Kings, for example, saw over $10 million in sales in the last 30 days, representing more than half of what y00ts has generated during its four-month stint at Polygon, with $3 million of those sales processed in 24 hours on Wednesday, August 9.\n\nNearly 3 million dollars in sales in 24 hours for @DraftKings NFTs. On many days, it is the largest volume product across the whole NFT space.\n\n\n\nThis is the mainstream adoption @0xPolygon ecosystem has been working relentlessly on.\n\n\n\nMany such big apps alone will do larger volumes\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DyYMT5gGrg \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon \ud83d\udc9c (@sandeepnailwal) August 9, 2023\n\nResponding to y00ts exit, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron asserted that while he was disappointed by the decision, he was not worried due to Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem, which he hailed for its infrastructure and growing number of marketplaces.\n\nBig thank you to @frankdegods and the @y00tsNFT community. They brought lots of excitement to the Polygon ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWhen I first heard y00ts was leaving, I was disappointed. But I was never worried after I took a look at the ecosystem from infra and marketplaces that have been\u2026 https://t.co/kWX4M68kym \u2014 Marc Boiron (@0xMarcB) August 10, 2023\n\nPolygon Labs has revealed that a part of the returned y00ts grant would be used to incentivize further growth in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSome pundits have suggested that y00ts\u2019 move to Ethereum is driven by a search for hype.\n\ny00ts sales volume on Polygon has surged 278% following the announcement of the migration to Ethereum, per data from CryptoSlam.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\ny00ts is one of the most popular profile picture NFT projects. The collection\u2019s quick exit from Polygon raised questions about the network\u2019s NFT ecosystem. However, the data suggests it may not be as impactful as some fear.\n\nRead this to learn more about y00ts\u2019 exit from Polygon:\n\nDeLabs\u2019 Y00ts Undertakes Second Major Migration, Leaving Polygon\n\nLearn more about Coinbase\u2019s Base launch:\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Layer-2 Base Kick-Offs\u2019 Onchain Summer\u2019 with Public Release"

        "title": "Why Ethereum (ETH), Pepecoin (PEPE), and Anarchy (ANA) Could Be the Best Investment This Year? - Euro Weekly News",
        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Updated: 11 Aug 2023 \u2022 15:58\n\nImage: Anarchy\n\n2023 has been a particularly exciting year for the crypto-verse, as tokens kept stunning us from the first week. Even now, Ethereum (ETH), Pepecoin (PEPE), and Anarchy (ANA) are still viable projects for investment, with Anarchy topping that list at the moment.\n\nThe reason for this is simple, meme coins are the rave in the cryptocurrency market, and Anarchy (ANA) is miles ahead of any other meme project.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Pepecoin (PEPE): Should I Buy ETH and PEPE?\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Pepecoin (PEPE) have taken quite different paths in the cryptocurrency market, leaving investors with a crucial decision to make. Let\u2019s take a closer look at both tokens to help you make an informed choice.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been a dominant force since its launch in 2015. Initially, it started as an ICO, which successfully raised $19 million in just a month, setting the stage for its future success. Over the years, Ethereum has evolved into a versatile platform, offering an extensive collection of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its robust ecosystem and widespread adoption have solidified its position as one of the top cryptocurrencies, attracting crypto enthusiasts and developers alike.\n\nOn the other hand, Pepecoin (PEPE) made headlines in 2023 with an astonishing price rally that surpassed 10,000%. This meteoric rise caught the attention of the entire cryptocurrency market, making it one of the hottest meme coins. However, since reaching its peak in May, PEPE\u2019s price has been on a gradual decline, leading some to question its long-term sustainability and potential.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to be a reliable and solid investment option with its wide range of utilities and innovative technology, there\u2019s another contender that has been making waves in the meme coin space \u2013 Anarchy (ANA).\n\nAnarchy (ANA) Set to Recreate Pepecoin\u2019s Launch\n\nThe meme coin market has been especially trendy in 2023, with Floki Inu (FLOKI), Pepecoin (PEPE), and Anarchy (ANA) already making it to the heart of the crypto buzz. Anarchy (ANA) is set to beat Pepecoin\u2019s launch success. And why not? Its ongoing presale success is already telling tales of a promising launch.\n\nBut that\u2019s where Anarchy\u2019s similarities with the rest of the meme coin sector end. The meme coin brings something different to the table with its focus on bantering corrupt politicians and policymakers while also empowering its users with gains from their crypto investments.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot for a meme coin, you think. But there is still more, and here are some of what to expect from the project.\n\n\u25cf Memes, But Not Just Entertainment!\n\nWhat did you expect? No memes? Heck no! What\u2019s a meme coin without its memes? Anarchy\u2019s creative team will work overtime to ensure the memes and jokes flow around the clock. And why? Anarchy (ANA) will give the government hell with its revolution, but it won\u2019t use Twitter hashtags and protest placards. The memes will call out the corruption in government while giving everyone a good laugh at the end of it all.\n\n\u25cf Launch On Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain is a haven of treasure for any budding project. Its vast collection of DApps and massive user traffic are just the right mix for fast platform growth. Plus, Ethereum (ETH) has one of the most secure blockchains in the cryptocurrency market, so Anarchy (ANA) users have little to worry about regarding transaction glitches and server failure.\n\nAnarchy (ANA) Presale Update!\n\nYou might have missed out on Pepecoin\u2019s launch, but Anarchy (ANA) is still profitable crypto business for investors this year. Anarchy\u2019s presale is already over $2 million in sales, and there are still 100x potential profits to think about.\n\nThe ANA tokens go for $0.00024 each, and you can get them from the presale website to start your Anarchy (ANA) journey.\n\nAnarchy Website Anarchy Twitter Anarchy Telegram\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

        "title": "Litecoin vs Ethereum - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin \u2013 the big name in the cryptocurrency world. But today, we\u2019re diving into two other digital coin superstars: Litecoin and Ethereum. It\u2019s not just about picking team blue or team green. Each has its own unique features, strengths, and uses. Whether you\u2019re curious about dabbling in digital coins or simply looking to learn more about these crypto giants, join us as we dive deep into the Litecoin vs. Ethereum.\n\nShort Summary\n\nLitecoin and Ethereum are distinct cryptocurrencies with unique features; Litecoin focuses on fast and affordable transactions, while the Ethereum network emphasises smart contracts and a platform for decentralised applications.\n\nKey differences lie in their consensus mechanisms, hashing algorithms, and network scalability, with Ethereum transitioning to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake and Litecoin retaining its proof-of-work model.\n\nBoth offer robust security features and decentralisation, ensuring transparent, trustworthy transactions and operations across their networks.\n\nContents\n\nUnderstanding Litecoin and Ethereum\n\nThink of Litecoin and Ethereum as two totally different apps on your phone. Litecoin, created by Charlie Lee in 2011, is like a speedy version of Bitcoin, aiming to process transactions quickly and efficiently\u2014it\u2019s like your go-to messaging app that sends texts in a flash! On the other hand, Ethereum, cooked up by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, isn\u2019t just about sending and receiving coins. It introduces \u2018smart contracts\u2019\u2014think of them as customisable mini-programs running on the blockchain. So, while both Litecoin and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies, they have different purposes and features. It\u2019s a bit like comparing your favorite game app with a handy productivity tool\u2014both super cool, but in different ways!\n\nLitecoin\u2019s Purpose\n\nLitecoin is like the slightly younger sibling to Bitcoin, named . It was created back in 2011 by a guy named Charlie Lee, with the idea of being the \u201csilver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cgold\u201d. In simpler terms, if Bitcoin is like the big, fancy store downtown where everyone goes to buy expensive things, then Litecoin is like the local convenience store \u2013 faster, more accessible, but still pretty cool. It was designed to process transactions quicker than Bitcoin, making it a great choice for smaller purchases and everyday use. So, in a way, while Bitcoin is often seen as a store of value (like gold bars in a vault), Litecoin is more like the change in your pocket, always ready to be spent.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vision\n\nThink of the Ethereum network like a massive LEGO set, but for the digital world. Instead of just being another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum wanted to be a platform where people can build anything they dream up, using special pieces called \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Imagine building a LEGO castle that can move its drawbridge all by itself whenever someone approaches. In the digital space, these smart contracts are like self-operating programs that follow specific rules. So, Ethereum\u2019s big vision is to create a world where anyone can design their own projects, games, or even digital businesses, all without needing a middleman like a bank or a company. It\u2019s like giving everyone the tools to be their own inventor, but in the online universe!\n\nComparing Key Features\n\nAlright, so imagine Ethereum and Litecoin are like two different types of cars. Both can get you from point A to B, but they have different features under the hood. Let\u2019s dive into how they\u2019re built and how they operate, so we can get a better sense of what makes each one unique.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms\n\nWhen it comes to cars, we have traffic rules to keep things in order, right? Similarly, in the cryptocurrency world, we have something called a \u201cconsensus mechanism\u201d to make sure everyone plays fair and agrees on the same version of events. Ethereum originally used something called \u201cProof of Work\u201d (like Bitcoin) where computers compete to solve complex math problems. After transitioning to proof-of-stake, Ethereum now consumes roughly 99% less energy than before and is far more cost effective, efficient and ecologically friendly as well. On the other hand, Litecoin continues to run its platform with an unchanged proof-of-work model.\n\nHashing Algorithms\n\nNow, onto the engines! If our cryptos are cars, then hashing algorithms are like their engines. They take in data, churn it up, and output a fixed code, ensuring everything\u2019s secure. Ethereum uses something called \u201cEthash\u201d for its engine, which is tailor-made for Ethereum\u2019s needs. Litecoin, however, runs on \u201cScrypt\u201d. It\u2019s like choosing between a diesel and petrol engine; both do the job but have their own strengths and quirks.\n\nNetwork Scalability\n\nLastly, let\u2019s talk about how many passengers these cars can carry, or in crypto terms, \u201cnetwork scalability\u201d. If too many people try to use a cryptocurrency at once, it can get congested, like a traffic jam. Ethereum has faced some scalability issues in the past, but they\u2019re working on solutions, like Ethereum 2.0, to handle more transactions. Litecoin, being a bit lighter and designed for faster transactions, can handle its traffic pretty smoothly, but it\u2019s still smaller in scale compared to the big highways Ethereum aims to build.\n\nTransaction Speed and Fees\n\nOkay, let\u2019s think of cryptocurrencies like online shopping. You\u2019ve put something in your cart, and now you\u2019re deciding between standard shipping (takes a bit longer, might be cheaper) and express shipping (super quick, but maybe pricier). In the crypto world, the \u201cshipping\u201d is how fast your transaction gets processed and how much it costs. So, let\u2019s break down these \u201cshipping\u201d options for our digital money.\n\nTransaction Speed\n\nImagine you\u2019re sending a digital coin to your friend. How fast that coin gets to them is the transaction speed. Some coins are like lightning \u2013 zap, and they\u2019re there! Others might take a bit longer, like waiting for that slow pizza delivery. Ethereum, for example, can be pretty quick, but if their network is super busy, it might slow down. Litecoin, on the other hand, is designed to be speedy Gonzales, with a goal of processing transactions in just 2.5 minutes. So, it\u2019s kinda like choosing between express and standard delivery, each coin has its own pace.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nWhen it comes to transaction fees, Litecoin is the clear winner in terms of affordability and practicality for everyday use. Usually transactions with Litecoins cost around $0.0070 which makes them suitable for even smaller transactions compared to Ethereum whose gas-based system can result in higher costs depending on complexity and network demand during peak times.\n\nSecurity and Decentralisation\n\nImagine you\u2019ve got this super secret diary where you write down all your thoughts. Now, instead of keeping it under your pillow (because let\u2019s be honest, everyone checks there), you\u2019ve made copies and given them to a bunch of trusted friends. This way, even if one friend loses their copy or someone tries to change what you wrote, the others can vouch for the original content. This idea of spreading things out for safety is at the heart of \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018decentralisation\u2019 in the world of cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s dive deeper.\n\nSecurity Features\n\nThe first thing to know about crypto is that it\u2019s super focused on keeping things secure. It\u2019s like having a diary with a hi-tech lock and an alarm system. Cryptocurrencies use complex math (called cryptography) to make sure your coins are safe and transactions are legit. Both Ethereum and Litecoin have their own \u201csecurity guards\u201d. Ethereum uses its unique \u2018Ethash\u2019 (remember, like its engine?), while Litecoin employs \u2018Scrypt\u2019 to keep things tight. These are like special codes that ensure no sneaky folks can tamper with your digital money or fake transactions.\n\nDecentralisation Levels\n\nBack to the diary example! Instead of one person or company being in charge (like a bank), cryptocurrencies spread their data across many computers worldwide. This is called \u2018decentralisation\u2019. It\u2019s like if every time you wrote in your diary, all your friends with copies updated theirs too. So, if someone tried to sneak in and change an entry, the others would be like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s not what the original said!\u201d Ethereum and Litecoin both use this principle. By being decentralised, they make sure that no single group can control or mess with the system, making everything more transparent and trustworthy.\n\nSummary\n\nLitecoin and Ethereum are distinct pillars in the cryptocurrency landscape. Litecoin is tailored for quick and efficient transactions, while Ethereum offers versatility with its smart contracts. They differ in aspects like transaction speeds, fees, and core designs. By understanding these differences, users can navigate the crypto world more effectively. Both have their strengths, making them indispensable in the realm of digital currencies.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat\u2019s the main difference between Litecoin and Ethereum?\n\nThe primary difference is their purpose. Litecoin is designed primarily as a currency for fast and affordable transactions. Ethereum, on the other hand, is not just a cryptocurrency but also a platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts.\n\nHow do Litecoin and Ethereum differ in terms of transaction speed and fees?\n\nLitecoin is optimised for speed, aiming to process transactions in about 2.5 minutes, making it faster than Ethereum. In terms of fees, Litecoin transactions are generally cheaper, especially for everyday use, while Ethereum\u2019s gas-based fee structure can vary depending on network congestion and transaction complexity.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s vision with smart contracts?\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain aims to revolutionise the digital space by enabling users to create \u201csmart contracts\u201d, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. These allow for customisable, decentralised applications to be built on the Ethereum platform without intermediaries.\n\nWhich consensus mechanism do Litecoin and Ethereum use?\n\nAs of 2023, Ethereum has transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, making it more energy-efficient. Litecoin, meanwhile, continues to use the proof-of-work model.\n\nAre Litecoin and Ethereum secure?\n\nYes, both Litecoin and Ethereum employ strong cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction security. Ethereum uses its unique \u2018Ethash\u2019 hashing algorithm, while Litecoin utilises \u2018Scrypt\u2019. The decentralised nature of both cryptocurrencies further enhances their security against potential attacks."

We tried our best to make it work but we just need to bring our 2 communities together.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it if everyone remains respectful of all parties involved.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all love. https://t.co/6AT4SMUT76 August 9, 2023\n\nThe project tweeted that they still love Polygon (MATIC), but it\u2019s time to unite DeGods and y00ts on Ethereum (ETH). The project also reaffirmed that the grant, which will be returned, will be redeployed for NFT ecosystem growth.\n\n2. We're returning 100% of the grant provided by Polygon.\n\n\n\nThe funds will be re-deployed for NFT ecosystem growth to empower builders and creators.\n\n\n\nWe still love Polygon. It's just time to unite the DeGods & y00ts communities. \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) August 9, 2023\n\nHowever, the move to Ethereum was announced all the way back in December 2022. Back then, Frank said that the decision had been made to \u201cexplore new opportunities.\u201d Additionally, he had claimed that this would enable the collections to expand.\n\nAlso Read: Top 2 NFT Projects on Solana are Jumping to Ethereum, Polygon: Why?\n\nAfter the FTX collapse in November 2022, many projects began to abandon the Solana (SOL) network, as it was one of the worst affected networks due to the collapse.\n\nWill the move from Polygon to Ethereum affect prices?\n\nSource: PYMNTS.com\n\ny00ts\u2019 migration to Ethereum is yet to be announced. However, the news about the move has already had an effect on the floor prices of each NFT collection. According to CoinGecko data, the floor price of y00ts increased 7.2% in the last day to 1.88 ETH. Meanwhile, the floor price of DeGods decreased by 4.9% to 8.9 ETH. As per the 24-hour volume, DeGods is presently the third-most traded NFT collection. On the other hand, y00ts is the eighth most traded, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAlso Read: Gucci and a 256 Years Old Auction House Partners For NFT Collection"

        "title": "Mixed Performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum after XRP Rally Calms: Analyst Eyes 1500% Growth For DigiToads Presale - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The recent XRP rally showed that even though much of the market is in a slight downturn, gains can still be made in this space. And such movement is especially remarkable when you consider all the issues XRP itself has faced in recent years. But what if you could invest in a crypto newcomer that has many experts licking their lips, and doesn\u2019t have any of the downsides associated with Ripple? You can: by investing in the DigiToads (TOADS) presale before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s regarded by many as the best crypto to buy right now by a considerable margin. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) beats out any other altcoin in the space thanks to an incredible range of features that are unmatched by any other memecoin. While other ERC20 coins and meme tokens might offer social media popularity: TOADS has that alongside tons of other actual, definable benefits. These benefits include the unmatched NFT staking protocol, which puts real passive income potential in the palm of your hands. With the TOADS NFT staking pool, 2% of transactions are funneled into a staking rewards system that will pay out those who stake their own popular NFTs for the longest intervals. It\u2019s the easiest way to earn hands-off income from any crypto project on the planet.\n\nAnd momentum into the TOADS presale is already surging, having already surpassed huge sales milestones that get smashed every single day. There are still discounts available at prices of $0.5. But remember: these prices will NOT be available for much longer. They\u2019re set to go up a level to $0.055 when it officially launches onto mainstream exchanges like Uniswap and BitMart in just a couple of weeks\u2019 time. So jump at your chance to make automatic gains by joining the remarkable TOADS presale while there\u2019s still a bit of time left.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple stunned analysts and onlookers by actually making solid gains over the past couple of months. This was remarkably bullish for the token when you consider how many issues it faced in recent years, including being delisted on mainstream exchanges and struggling with legal battles. So there is still upside for this altcoin, and it could surge even higher once these issues are firmly put in the past.\n\nWhat about Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nRipple\u2019s recent movement was expected by some to pour a new lease of life into more established cryptos like BTC and ETH. While a couple of mini-rallied occurred, these failed to live up to expectations. Both these tokens are still the mainstays of the crypto investment world, and they are absolutely here to stay, but if you want gains over the coming months: there might be better options out there. Options like TOADS.\n\nConclusion\n\nXRP still has potential, even after its recent rally has slowed somewhat. And you should probably always have space for stalwarts like BTC and ETH in your portfolio: but you should have more space for TOADS. That\u2019s because it leads the way with potential for the next few months, and could be the best thing ever for your portfolio. Join the TOADS presale and snap up discounts before it\u2019s too late.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

DCG\u2019s filing on August 10 claimed that Winklevoss\u2019 crypto firm had failed to support the fraud alleged against the crypto conglomerate and its founder Barry Silbert. In response, Winklevoss, who serves as Gemini\u2019s president, has accused DCG and its chief of playing dumb in order to avoid responsibility.\n\nGood Luck In Front Of A Jury: Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss\n\nThe Digital Currency Group\u2019s motion to dismiss Gemini\u2019s lawsuit highlighted that the complaint named DCG as the defendant, despite it having no direct business dealing with Cameron Winklevoss\u2019 crypto exchange. The crypto conglomerate added that Gemini\u2019s allegations pertaining to its transaction with its subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital.\n\nSilbert\u2019s firm accused the Winklevoss twins of mounting a character assassination campaign on Twitter, to deflect the blame from the stranded customers of Gemini Earn Program. DCG also called out Gemini for avoiding responsibility, having actively promoted Genesis as a \u201csophisticated market participant\u201d to its customers.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post earlier today, Winklevoss described DCG\u2019s motion to dismiss as a brief written by a law school student making up baseless legal defenses. According to the Gemini founder, the motion was in line with Silbert\u2019s playbook of refusing to take responsibility, playing dumb, and attempting to avoid accountability using technicalities.\n\nGood luck making these arguments to a jury of your peers. See you in court. Cameron Winklevoss\n\nWinklevoss also took issue with DCG\u2019s claim of owing no direct duty to Gemini to correct the allegedly false statements made by Genesis. \u201cWhen a company you own says you wrote a $1.1 billion check that you know you didn\u2019t write, yes, you have a duty to correct this. Sorry, but this doesn\u2019t even pass the giggle test,\u201d the Gemini founder added."

        "content": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release may profoundly impact the Bitcoin and crypto market, potentially leading to an unexpected boost if it aligns with Fundstrat\u2019s predictions of a more dovish Federal Reserve stance.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price stability ahead of the CPI data underscores the ongoing tension in the market, with key support and resistance levels reflecting anticipation around the impact of inflation metrics on the digital asset market.\n\nOur latest update brings thrilling insights into the cryptocurrency market, where Bitcoin and Ethereum are holding their ground as the world braces for today\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release at 8:30 am EST!\n\nInflation and Market Anticipation\n\nThe digital asset market is perched on the edge of anticipation as traditional markets and central banks await the ripple effects of the July CPI data. Wall Street expects a 0.2% rise from June, leading to a 12-month core CPI of 4.7%, while the headline index is predicted to ascend to 3.3%.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 Thomas Lee took to social media to highlight the significance, stating, \u201cJuly CPI going to be revelatory.\u201d He further illustrated potential outcomes, creating a heightened sense of intrigue and concern.\n\nInflation Projections and Influencing Factors\n\nMost experts forecast that inflation will pick up in the coming months. The Cleveland Fed\u2019s projections suggest a steady climb in headline CPI inflation YoY, while JP Morgan\u2019s projections indicate a re-acceleration in the US CPI.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat\u2019s recent analysis might provide a pleasant surprise. The report suggests a Core CPI of +0.15% or better MoM, notably below the consensus estimates of +0.22%. This prediction hinges on disinflationary pressures from falling used car prices and a cooling housing market, which have accounted for a substantial 66% of core price increases since the end of 2019.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin and Crypto\n\nIf the CPI data aligns with Fundstrat\u2019s predictions, the Federal Reserve may take a more dovish stance, potentially weakening the US dollar and boosting Bitcoin and crypto.\n\nMarket analysts also highlight the importance of liquidity in the market, especially during significant data releases like the CPI. The key areas of support and resistance remain critical to watch, with potential for rapid price movements in the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s Current Position\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s price stands at $29,565, holding strong support around 28500. The interim trend remains up, suggesting the overall bullish bias. Ethereum\u2019s uptrend has momentarily stalled but maintains major support, reflecting an intact upward bias since the end of 2022.\n\nDaily Updates and Observations\n\nOn the daily charts, BTC/USD shows resilience, while ETH/USD finds support at crucial barriers. The tension in the market ahead of the CPI release indicates that the ongoing debate between bulls and bears in the Bitcoin and crypto sector may soon find an unexpected turn.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Visa (NYSE: V) will use the current standard for Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) on Ethereum (ETH) in order to allow users to pay for their transaction\u2019s gas fees directly with a Visa Credit Card, instead of keeping a certain amount of tokens available in the wallets for transactions fees.\n\nAs announced through an official post, this should be possible even with self-custody wallets, like Metamask, and could drive adoption of blockchain technologies.\n\n\u201cOne of the major obstacles in the world of crypto is the complex process of paying for transactions or operations on blockchains. Each operation, whether it\u2019s a simple token transfer or a more intricate interaction with a smart contract, incurs a cost known as a \u2018gas\u2019 fee. In the case of Ethereum, this gas fee must be paid in the blockchain\u2019s native token, ETH.\u201d \u2014 Visa\n\nThe paper also explains that even for stablecoins transactions, like Circle USD (USDC), users are still required to have Ether (ETH) for gas fees.\n\nHow is it possible to pay gas fees with Visa\u2019s credit cards?\n\nAccording to the example diagram shared by Visa, a user who wants to make a $200 worth purchase on a merchant\u2019s website using Circle USD, but only has 1,000 USDC and no ETH, would initiate the blockchain transaction in a self-custodial wallet that supports ERC-4337, and chooses \u2018Visa Card\u2019 for gas fees.\n\nThe system would process the payment, paying the gas fees on the user\u2019s behalf, allowing the transaction to be successfully sent to the Merchant\u2019s wallet.\n\nSimplified user interaction image. Source: Visa\n\n\u201cIn this proposed solution, we once again put the paymaster at the heart of the process\u201d, explains Visa. \u201cA paymaster is a specialized type of smart contract account that can sponsor gas fees for user Contract Accounts (think of these as user-centric smart contracts).\u201d\n\n\u201cOur proposed solution liberates users from the need to hold native blockchain tokens or constantly engage in bridging tokens merely to cover gas fees.

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price prediction remains bullish till it holds the $16.00 level. It suggests buyers are active at lower levels and short-term bounce back is possible.\n\nETC price is stuck in the narrow range between $16.00 to $20.00. Buyers and sellers both tried to break the range on either side but got rejected. It shows that prices lacked direction and are likely to consolidate for some more time.\n\nEthereum Classic price faced rejection from the 200-day EMA and also dropped below the 50-day EMA. It indicates that the positional, as well as the short-term trend, is down.\n\nAt the beginning of July, ETC crypto witnessed a massive spike in buying volume. The price also reacted positively and attempted to break the $20.00 hurdle.\n\nSadly, the attempt failed and prices again reverted down. It formed a long-tail bearish rejection candle which created fear and triggered the supply zone.\n\nEthereum Classic price is trading at $17.718 with an intraday decline of -0.79%. The 24-hour volume to market cap is 3.63%. The pair of ETC/BTC is trading at 0.000600 with an intraday decline of -0.33%.\n\nEthereum Classic Price at attractive levels\n\nETC/USDT daily chart by TradingView\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction suggests a short-term pullback is possible in the coming months. ETC price is near to the demand zone and downside risk is low. The overall crypto market is recovering which might positively impact the prices of ETC in the coming weeks.\n\nTill the Ethereum Classic price sustains above $16.00 the possibility of bounce back remains high. However, the price will pick up momentum when buyers will be able to break the $20.00 hurdle.\n\nThe technical analysis suggests ETC crypto price is at attractive levels and buyers will become active soon.\n\nETC crypto is in a short-term correction mode\n\nETC crypto price is in short-term correction mode and buyers are trying their best to rebound. If the BTC and ETH price recovers then ETC crypto might also get positively impacted.\n\nThe MACD curve slopes down and slips below the zero line indicating mild bearishness. The RSI at 41 denotes bulls losing strength and might reach the oversold territory. However, the ETC price sustained above the super trend buy line shows buyers are also active.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction is bullish for the short term as well as for the long term. ETC crypto price is near to the demand zone so the possibility of bounce back remains high.\n\nTechnical levels\n\nResistance levels: $20.284 and $22.934\n\n$20.284 and $22.934 Support levels: $16.623 and $14.359\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Anarchy (ANA), an up-and-coming meme coin, has caught the attention of a renowned figure in the Ethereum community, known for their steadfast support of the blockchain revolution.\n\nThis Ethereum Maxist, a visionary with a track record of accurately predicting trends, is now urging individuals to consider investing in Anarchy if they harbor serious ambitions of having massive profits this year. The recent endorsement of ANA has caught the attention of profit-driven investors. This backing reinforces the belief that this meme coin would soar high in the market.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the features and market prospects of Anarchy, exploring the reasons behind the Ethereum Maxist\u2019s endorsement and analyzing the potential impact of ANA on your financial journeys as an investor. But first, let\u2019s look at Ethereum.\n\n>>> BUY $ANA NOW <<<\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum took center stage by playing a pivotal role in driving the decentralized revolution. The ETH network has been at the forefront of the blockchain revolution, powering a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and enabling the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). ETH has established itself as the go-to choice for developing blockchain-based solutions, thanks to its vibrant ecosystem, robust infrastructure, and extensive developer tools.\n\nEthereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards is a key aspect of Ethereum\u2019s appeal in the market. These standards offer guidelines for developing smart contracts and dApps that can create, manage, and exchange tokens within the Ethereum network.\n\nAmong the various ERC standards, several stand out. The widely used ERC-20 standard allows for the creation of fungible tokens, facilitating seamless interchangeability and interoperability. On the other hand, ERC-721 is specifically designed for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have gained significant attention for their unique properties and applications.\n\nThese ERC standards have played a crucial role in shaping the development of the Ethereum ecosystem by establishing a common set of guidelines and protocols for creating and managing tokens on the blockchain. They have fostered interoperability, standardized token functionality, and facilitated the growth of tokenized economies.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to evolve, it remains the platform of choice for developers seeking to harness the potential of blockchain technology. Its vibrant ecosystem, coupled with the versatility and utility of ERC standards, ensures that Ethereum will continue to drive innovation, foster growth, and provide a solid foundation for the development of blockchain-based solutions.\n\nNow, let\u2019s delve deeper into understanding what ANA is and what it aims to achieve.\n\nSomething huge is coming.

        "content": "It\u2019s official: the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has formalized the integration of zkSync Era, on layer-2 of Ethereum network, into its deposit and withdrawal section.\n\nUsers can thus take advantage of the speed and low gas consumption of the zk-rollup blockchain to transfer ETH from one wallet to another.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nEthereum: Crypto.com integrates deposits and withdrawals via the zkSync Era network\n\nThe centralized trading platform Crypto.com has officially opened its doors to Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 blockchain zkSync Era, enabling deposits and withdrawals for users through this network.\n\nThe news, which came yesterday via a Twitter post from the exchange, is very important for the layer-2 industry as it is the first instance of a zk-rollup network being integrated within a CEX.\n\nUsers of Crypto.com can take advantage of the zk-evm network that involves low fees and fast transaction executions: just consider that gas consumption can be as low as 1/100 compared to Ethereum while on the scalability front, up to 2000 transactions per second can be processed.\n\nInitially, deposits and withdrawals via zkSync Era are only available in ETH currency, but could be expanded to more tokens in the future.\n\nThe integration applies to both the web exchange and the app.\n\nWith this latest move, Crypto.com is aiming to carve out a new slice of audience after last years\u2019 slide in which many users abandoned the platform due to reduced incentives on credit card cashback.\n\nWe hope that the implementation of the zkSync Era network will help the exchange compete at a high level again.\n\nThe CRO coin, despite the excellent news, did not see particular price movement yesterday, with a negative change of 0.33%.\n\nThe cryptocurrency currently trades at $0.057, down more than 93% from its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nFocus on zkSync Era\n\nzkSync Era is a layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, developed by Berlin-based technology company Matter Labs.\n\nThe project was funded to the tune of $458 million by private investment from a number of companies and venture capitalists such as a16z, the Ethereum Foundation, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, 1kx and others.\n\nAs a zk-evm blockchain, zkSync Era uses \u201cSNARK\u201d zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to prove that all transactions wrapped in the rollup are valid.\n\nOther layer-2 \u201coptimistic rollup\u201d such as Arbitrum and Optimism use fraud proofs and act only when they detect erroneous data in transactions, while considering all wrapped TXs valid by default.\n\nLaunched in the mainnet in March 2023, the zkSync Era cryptographic network immediately attracted the attention of the DeFi world community, eventually capitalizing a TVL of $443 million according to L2Beat data.\n\nThe main decentralized applications in the crypto ecosystem are Syncswap, Mute.io, Maverick, IziSwap, Velocore, SpaceFi, EraLend, Pancakeswap,VeSync, and Reactor Fusion.\n\nA total of 939,648 ETH were bridged from the Ethereum blockchain within just five months for a counter value of $173 million.\n\nThe number of users of the infrastructure has skyrocketed in recent months to 1.47 million wallets and 1.8 million transactions made.\n\nThe success of zkSync and its rapid rise among top-of-the-line blockchains is justified by the narrative of a rumored airdrop of a governance token that is expected to arrive soon for all early adopters of the layer-2.\n\nBeyond that there is the efficiency of the chain and the convenience of zk-rollups: currently a transaction on zkSync Era is processed in seconds and requires payment of about $0.10 in gas fees.\n\nWe will most likely hear more and more about this network and the results that will be achieved."

        "title": "Crypto: Fantom explores optimistic rollups - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Fantom Foundation, a prominent player in this space, recently caught the attention of the crypto community with its intention to integrate optimistic rollups to establish a connection between Fantom and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nThis move has ignited debate about the nature of Layer 2 solutions, with co-founder and architect Andre Cronje offering a unique perspective that challenges conventional understanding.\n\nFantom tries to bridge Ethereum new modalities for the crypto community\n\nLast month, the Celo network grabbed headlines by unveiling a plan to transform its tier 1 blockchain into a layer 2 solution on the Ethereum network through the use of optimistic rollups.\n\nThis strategic maneuver not only attracted considerable attention, but also led to an impressive 18% surge in the value of its native token after the announcement.\n\nIt demonstrated the market\u2019s enthusiasm for layer-scaling solutions that leverage the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Scoop, Fantom Foundation co-founder and architect Andre Cronje revealed that his team is actively exploring the integration of optimistic rollups to establish a link between Fantom and Ethereum.\n\nThis investigation includes various implementations, including Optimistic Stack and Arbitrum Stack, to understand how these canonical bridges use cryptographic evidence to increase security guarantees.\n\nCronje confirmed that it is seriously considering adopting one of these solutions as its canonical bridge.\n\nIf Fantom were to implement optimistic rollups and offer a complete transaction history on the Ethereum network, it would have to pay transaction fees to record these snapshots on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe benefits of the new layer 2 implementation idea\n\nFantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong outlined the potential benefits of implementing Layer 2 technology in this way, noting how it would allow the Fantom network to tap into a larger pool of liquidity from the burgeoning Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis strategic move could open up new avenues for decentralized applications and financial instruments, as greater liquidity often leads to greater functionality and a better experience for users.\n\nHowever, the crux of the issue lies in how Layer 2 solutions are defined. Cronje challenges conventional terminology and offers an analysis of Layer 1 solutions. Cronje challenges conventional terminology by arguing for a different perspective.\n\nIn his view, so-called Layer 2 solutions are essentially sidechains, and the technology behind optimistic rollups acts as a bridge between distinct blockchains rather than falling into the traditional pattern of a Layer 2 solution.\n\nHe recognizes that this distinction could be useful in improving functionality and user experiences. Cronje acknowledges that this distinction might seem semantic, but he is resolute in his position.\n\nThe crypto universe is full of innovations and technological experiments such as Fantom\n\nCronje argues that technologies such as optimistic rollups function as linking mechanisms that facilitate the secure movement of native assets between different blockchains.\n\nHowever, he introduces a critical nuance: this security is compromised when multiple bridges connect the affected blockchains.\n\nIn essence, the enhanced security of optimistic rollups primarily benefits canonical assets within a specific blockchain, but loses its effectiveness when numerous bridge connections exist.\n\nCronje argues that such solutions are effective only when the blockchain is completely blocked, when other bridging mechanisms cease to function.\n\nIn an industry characterized by rapid innovation and evolving terminologies, debates such as the one sparked by Fantom\u2019s potential integration of optimistic rollups are not uncommon.\n\nThe nuances of these discussions are not merely semantic, but reflect the ever-expanding horizons of blockchain technology.\n\nFantom\u2019s exploration of this frontier indicates a willingness to experiment and push boundaries, even as it leads to conceptual debates that challenge established norms.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Fantom Foundation\u2019s ongoing investigation of integrating optimistic rollups as a bridge between its blockchain and Ethereum shows the dynamic nature of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe potential benefits of increased security and liquidity are undoubtedly enticing, but the semantic debate over whether such solutions qualify as layer 2 networks or rather serve as a bridge offers a fresh perspective that could influence future discussions in the blockchain community.\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, the adoption of different viewpoints and the reevaluation of established concepts will undoubtedly contribute to its growth and maturation."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, is optimistic about Artificial Intelligence (AI), saying that rather than taking away 30% of jobs, it should save 30% of human labor.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin: Artificial Intelligence (AI) does not replace human labor\n\nAccording to reports, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be quite optimistic about Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nSpecifically, Buterin argues that instead of taking away jobs, AI should save human labor. Here are his words:\n\n\u201cI think one of the positive aspects of this is that I think it\u2019s a good example of how, instead of AI killing 30% of the jobs, which would be catastrophic and terrible, it\u2019s like, AI is killing 30% of your job, which is like actually an amazing time saver.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the co-founder of Ethereum does not see emerging technology as a substitute for human labor, but rather that it complements it. In other words, it is a matter of enhancing people\u2019s talents, rather than replacing them.\n\nAs an example, Buterin talked about AI-based image generators and individual content creators. For the Russian computer scientist, AI platforms can help creators make films and artistic works without the need for Hollywood-style high production costs.\n\nHere are his words:\n\n\u201cThe thing happening that we don\u2019t want to see is artists getting replaced; the thing that I wants to see is an author, instead of just being able to write a novel, also being able to personally make a movie. I would want to see the cost of making a movie go down from $100,000 to one person with basically just his creativity and a couple of months with an AI platform.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin from Ethereum and AI: the most significant development and the regulation\n\nMoving on with his speech, Buterin also called AI one of the most significant developments in all of history.\n\nHere are his words:\n\n\u201cThis human to superhuman AI transition, that level of transition, I would argue has only happened basically three or four times in the history of the Earth.\u201d\n\nAs technology advances, Buterin also notes that regulation remains limited in being able to deal with future risks.\n\nIn this regard, the Ethereum co-founder suggests that regulations should be case-targeted, rather than across-the-board bans that hinder innovation.\n\nNot coincidentally, the very chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, recently spoke out on the issue, saying that AI will be the cause of future financial crises.\n\nSpecifically, Gensler\u2019s biggest fears relate precisely to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT that want to transform businesses and companies, perhaps creating new and potential conflicts of interest between companies and investors.\n\nThe price of ETH and Ethereum futures ETFs\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s co-founder shares his views on AI, its crypto ETH continues to hover around the $1850 price point.\n\nETH\u2019s trend seems to have been fairly stable for a while now, with its annual peaks occurring last month at a price of over $2,000 and in April at a price of $2135. Otherwise, from March to the present, ETH has remained between $1800 and $1900, touching $1650 in May.\n\nRecently, news emerged that the SEC is to evaluate four new applications related to Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThese are the four applications submitted by VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise and Roundhill, which came after the application that seems to have launched the Volatility Shares initiative.\n\nGiven that the SEC has long since approved ETFs based upon futures contracts on the price of BTC, there should be no problem in approving those on Ethereum as well. If that were the case, perhaps the price of ETH might be able to get a more significant pump."
