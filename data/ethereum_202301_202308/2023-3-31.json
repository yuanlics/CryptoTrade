        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Ethereum Virtual Machine (or EVM) is a virtual computer that distributes information across the entire Ethereum network. It is responsible for executing smart contracts and updating the state of the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EVM is not just for Ethereum; many layer one and two blockchains use it, including Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EVM has improved interoperability and accessibility, powering countless decentralized applications and other use cases across multiple blockchains.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most popular blockchain for smart contracts, Ethereum owes much of its success to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). From gas fees to smart contract execution, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is responsible for much of the magic behind the Ethereum blockchain. EVM also powers the ecosystem of other leading blockchains like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.\n\nBut what is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and how does it work?\n\nLet\u2019s dig in and find out.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine?\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine is software that executes programmable code on the blockchain (smart contracts) and determines the state of Ethereum after each successful block.\n\nAs a virtual machine, EVM doesn\u2019t have a central computer or cloud \u2014 it distributes and executes information across hundreds of computers participating in the network, also called nodes. These nodes all run the same EVM code, which makes it easier to build software on Ethereum.\n\nHistory of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nBefore diving deep into what EVM does, let\u2019s first understand how it came to be. Vitalik Buterin introduced the idea of Ethereum in 2013 \u2014 creating a decentralized platform for building applications. Vitalik\u2019s idea eventually became the Ethereum network, and at the heart of that network is the EVM.\n\nInterestingly, Vitalik claims that BitTorrent was the first decentralized app (or dApp) ever created in 2001. BitTorrent and the EVM are similar in that they are both peer-to-peer networks with no central authority, but they serve different purposes.\n\nFor instance, BitTorrent is great for a singular purpose i.e, sharing files. But EVM goes beyond just file sharing with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe EVM provides a secure and reliable environment for running dApps, which is crucial, particularly while handling sensitive data or financial transactions.\n\nWhat Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Do?\n\nEthereum Virtual machine primarily functions as a runtime environment for smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of EVM as the \u201cbrain\u201d behind the Ethereum network: It executes code and ensures the entire network agrees on the outcome of the code.\n\nEVM powers many decentralized applications and NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Due to the flexibility and security of smart contracts, these dApps range from play-to-earn games to crypto lending and borrowing applications. With EVM, you can build these dApps in any programming language and execute timely transactions.\n\nFurther, EVM is capable of Turing completeness, which means that smart contracts can perform any combination of code and complex calculations. This includes complex computations like AI and cryptography, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum dApps benefit from the security of a decentralized network, plus the flexibility of performing complex computations.\n\nHow the Ethereum Virtual Machine Works\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine can implement smart contract logic and validate ownership of funds. To do so, it uses a stack-based architecture, which means the nodes come in a particular order. Having a strict pre-defined order helps Ethereum resist hacker attacks and increase efficiency. Further, a stack-based architecture is very versatile, and easily supports different types of instructions.\n\nEVM supports different programming languages, but the most popular ones for developers are Vyper and Solidity. This is because developers write smart contracts and decentralized applications using these languages.\n\nHowever, since EVM cannot understand English like humans, the network must translate the code before deploying it. This is where compilers come into play \u2013 software that acts as a translator between the machine and the developer.\n\nCompilers convert human-readable Solidity code to the computer-friendly version in two components: an instruction format called \u201cbytecode\u201d and a specification technique called Contract ABI.\n\nWhile Bytecode is the common language that the entire Ethereum network understands, Contract ABI defines how other applications can interact with each smart contract. Let\u2019s understand how this works in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFirst, each smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain goes through the Ethereum compiler, translating it to bytecode and Contract ABI.\n\nNext, the bytecode and Contract ABI is deployed to the EVM, distributing it across the entire Ethereum network. Each node on the network receives and stores a copy of the bytecode, making it tamper-proof.\n\nNow, the EVM has the job of simplifying the bytecode further for the computer. Each computer has pre-defined sets of instructions known as opcodes. Bytecode sequences correspond to and trigger these opcodes. Next, the EVM executes all of the requests represented by the opcode.\n\nAdvantages of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nBlockchains using the Ethereum Virtual machine are very developer-friendly, and therefore quite popular. EVM allows for a range of capabilities but here are some of the most prominent ones:\n\nCross Blockchain Support\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine can support any blockchain with bytecode-compatible smart contracts. Therefore, several blockchains, such as Polygon and Avalanche, use EVM to power their ecosystems.\n\nIsolated Sandbox\n\nAlthough the EVM uses the same computer network for all applications, it can execute each code separately. There is no impact on the underlying blockchain or other data stored by the node computers. This allows for fast and efficient development.\n\nFlexible Development\n\nEVM can easily execute complex and customized smart contracts, such as those used for transactions on dApps, DeFi, games, and NFTs. It also has a large developer community that makes building software easier.\n\nCross-functional Across Operating Systems\n\nBlockchains have a large number of computers participating in their network, each with different operating systems like MacOS, Windows etc. These operating systems are vastly different from the others, which makes it challenging to develop software. However, EVM allows us to standardize and run programs on multiple operating systems without writing separate code.\n\nDisadvantages of the EVM\n\nWhile building on Ethereum has many benefits, all good things come at a price. And in Ethereum, that price is high crypto gas fees.\n\nThe EVM has scalability limitations, meaning it can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. As a result, when the network is too crowded, the gas fees can shoot up very quickly.\n\nDue to the popularity of Ethereum, it can become expensive to deploy custom smart contracts or bulky applications. You need to optimize your contracts for speed and efficiency, removing repetitive code or unnecessary functions. You also need to account for the fact that storage costs on Ethereum can be equally expensive.\n\nAnother disadvantage of EVM is that once you deploy a smart contract on the blockchain, you can\u2019t change it. This can be a major problem if you discover a bug or vulnerability after deployment. In such cases, you\u2019ll need to redeploy the entire contract, and the extra fees can add up quickly.\n\nThe Future of EVM\n\nThe future of EVM is bright, with growing adoption and exciting developments on the horizon.\n\nFor instance, with other blockchains using a common base such as EVM, interoperability is becoming easier. For instance, developers can easily create dApps compatible with multiple blockchains at once. Further, it\u2019s easier to transfer funds between EVM-compatible blockchains, so new blockchains can scale faster.\n\nAnother exciting development for the EVM is the EOF upgrade in 2023. To explain, EOF stands for EVM Object Format and it will be the first upgrade to the Ethereum Virtual Machine since its inception in 2015. To learn more about the details, make sure you read the EOF documentation. But to give you a basic overview: EOF will significantly change how EVM works, allowing for cheaper and faster smart contracts and an overall increase in security.\n\nYour Wallet on EVM blockchains\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why your address is the same on your Ethereum wallet as it is on Polygon, let\u2019s get into why.\n\nNow, your wallets on EVM blockchains are \u201cExternally Owned Accounts (EOA)\u201d, which means they use traditional key pairs to access them. One of them is the public key, an identifier, and the other is the private key, the passphrase. Wallets are of two types: Software or hardware wallets. Software wallets are digital wallets that store your private keys on your computer or mobile device. On the other hand, hardware wallets store your private keys offline on a physical device.\n\nNo matter which of these wallets you have, all EVM-compatible blockchains use EVM as the base technology. Accordingly, they use the same addressing scheme. Wallet addresses on these blockchains start with \u201c0x\u201d followed by 40 characters of alphanumeric code.\n\nThat means you can use the same wallet address on all EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n\nKeep Your Assets Secure Using a Ledger Hardware Wallet\n\nAlthough software wallets provide easy access, hardware wallets keep your crypto secure from physical or digital attacks. Your private key is stored offline, so your assets are completely in your control.\n\nWhen it comes to security, Ledger\u2019s industry-leading hardware wallets have you covered. Ledger\u2019s devices have an advanced secure element chip, the preferred solution for securing critical data among banks and governments!\n\nSecure your crypto assets with the ultimate protection of a hardware wallet like Ledger."

        "content": "DeGods, the largest Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection by all-time sales volume, started its migration to the Ethereum blockchain on Saturday morning in Hong Kong.\n\nSee related article: Solana NFT sales surge as traders farm for Tensor rewards\n\nFast facts\n\nDespite the migration, activity on the Solana network has been increasing, with the Forkast Solana Composite, a measure of the Solana NFT market, rising by 2.9% over the past 24 hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeGods\u2019 sister project y00ts began its move to Polygon. Around 80% of y00ts had already completed the move, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nDeGods owners completed over US$2.19 million in sales on Friday alone, marking the highest amount since the NFTs were initially minted in October 2021, according to CryptoSlam, the data arm of Forkast Labs.\n\nThe rising activity may indicate traders anticipating DeGods\u2019 price to rise on Ethereum, just as it has with y00ts, whose floor price is up by more than 50% since the NFTs began to land on Polygon, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nThe deflationary collection, which began with a 10,000 NFT mint, had a floor price of 939 SOL (US$19,940), experiencing a 29.6% surge in the 24 hours leading up to 1 p.m in Hong Kong, according to CoinGecko data. DeGods on Ethereum had a floor price of 10.4 ETH (US$19,000).\n\nDeLabs, the Los Angeles-based NFT firm behind DeGods and y00ts, announced the projects\u2019 moves to their designated blockchains in December 2021, which was the same month that Solana\u2019s native coin, SOL, dipped below US$10 for the first time since early 2021. The startup received a US$3 million grant from Polygon to migrate blockchains.\n\nThe migration of DeGods from Solana is expected to drain around US$200 million, the estimated market capitalization of the NFT collection, from the blockchain.\n\nSee related article: Top Solana NFT projects find new homes on Ethereum, Polygon"

        "title": "What the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Means for You, ETH, and the SEC - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn just shy of two weeks, if all goes to plan, Ethereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade will go live, enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH from the blockchain network and effectively completing its years-long transition to proof of stake.\n\nSince December 2020, when Ethereum began that journey to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which users stake cryptocurrency with a network to validate on-chain transactions, and then are rewarded for that participation with newly generated cryptocurrency\u2014network participants have deposited over $32.95 billion worth of ETH with the network.\n\nIn September, Ethereum\u2019s merge event successfully upgraded the network\u2019s mainnet to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, forever changing the way Ethereum transactions are processed and reducing the network\u2019s carbon footprint by 99%, according to figures from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the merge did not grant stakers on the network the ability to withdraw deposited ETH or the rewards generated by those deposits. Those funds remain captive on Ethereum; Shanghai will finally, after over two years, make them accessible.\n\nOn April 12, at 11:27 pm UTC, Shanghai will activate. What will that seismic moment in Ethereum\u2019s history mean for the network, for its participants, and for the broader crypto ecosystem?\n\nETH better have my money\n\nAs a technical matter, Shanghai will be less involved than one might expect. The vast majority of Ethereum stakers, who have deposited their ETH with the network through intermediaries like Lido and Coinbase, won\u2019t need to do anything on their ends once Shanghai goes live\u2014besides wait.\n\nStaked ETH, and the rewards generated by those funds, will be made available for withdrawal by intermediaries at varying dates following Shanghai\u2019s successful implementation. Lido, the largest ETH staking intermediary, recently announced that such capability will be introduced about a month after the upgrade, after a series of audits and safety checks.\n\nCoinbase, meanwhile, has not offered a firm timetable for rolling out staked ETH withdrawals, saying the process could take up to several months for some customers. All Ethereum network participants staking via third parties should check with those companies as to when their funds will be made available.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the smaller number of independent validators who have staked directly with Ethereum (that pool is smaller because Ethereum requires validators to deposit at least 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake with the network), matters will be only slightly more hands-on.\n\nValidators must first provide a withdrawal address for staked funds to be sent to; typically, most validators already submitted that address during the staking deposit process. Once a withdrawal address has been submitted to Ethereum, it cannot be changed.\n\nValidators can then opt for either a partial or full withdrawal. A partial withdrawal will send all funds and rewards generated beyond the minimum deposit amount of 32 ETH to a validator\u2019s withdrawal address. If a validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials are updated, then partial withdrawals will be sent to their withdrawal address automatically.\n\nIndependent stakers can also opt for a full withdrawal, which removes a user\u2019s full stake, including original deposits of 32 ETH, from Ethereum, ending a validator\u2019s participation in the transaction validation process. To fully withdraw from Ethereum\u2019s staking process, a validator need only send a single exit message to the network using their validator keys and validator client.\n\nPartial and full withdrawals will be processed in the order they are received by the network; based on the expected amount of traffic to come immediately following Shanghai\u2019s implementation, that initial queue could last up to 2 to 3 days.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nWhile Shanghai will certainly be a notable event for individual stakers, and carries great symbolic significance as the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transformation to a functional proof-of-stake network, the upgrade will not meaningfully change the way that users interact with Ethereum, nor the underlying economics of the network itself.\n\n\u201cMost people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking tokens, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\u201d Jacob Cantele, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, told Decrypt. \u201cSo I don't actually think [Shanghai] represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of ETH staked with Ethereum has, up to this point, been deposited with the network via third-party intermediaries, including staking pools like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stakefish, as well as centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. This is largely due to the fact, as mentioned above, that an individual validator must possess 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake directly with Ethereum. Intermediary staking services generally allow for ETH deposits of any amount, in exchange for a small service fee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of those intermediaries have issued tokens representing staked ETH to their customers, meaning that a sizable portion of the capital supposedly held captive in Ethereum\u2019s staking deposit contract has been traveling freely around the crypto ecosystem for years. And with Ethereum\u2019s internal mechanisms fully converted to proof of stake since September, the network looks poised to chug along post-Shanghai without much noticeable difference.\n\n\u201cShanghai\u2019s very exciting, but I do think it's just another step in the progression forward,\u201d Alison Mangiero, executive director of Proof of Stake Alliance, an advocacy group for proof-of-stake blockchain networks like Ethereum, told Decrypt.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the broader crypto climate?\n\nBut whereas matters within Ethereum appear likely to look largely unchanged following Shanghai, the political landscape beyond the network\u2019s virtual borders may be much more substantially impacted by the upgrade.\n\nIn the last year, and particularly since the stunning collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, American regulators have cracked down heavily on crypto companies, most recently those offering staking services. In February, the SEC hit centralized crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine, alleging the company\u2019s intermediary staking services constituted illegal securities offerings.\n\nKraken competitors like Coinbase took the opportunity to clarify that their own staking services did not determine rates of return on staked deposits in-house, as Kraken\u2019s had, and therefore should not be considered yield products. Last week, regardless, the SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells Notice, alleging that company\u2019s staking services also constitute unregistered securities. Such a notice indicates that an enforcement action in the form of a lawsuit from the SEC is likely forth-coming.\n\nShanghai\u2019s implementation alone may not immediately change the calculus of the SEC\u2019s escalating war with staking intermediaries. But it could place another, much larger staking-related target in the federal agency\u2019s crosshairs: Ethereum itself.\n\nThe very day the merge successfully transitioned Ethereum to proof of stake in September, SEC chair Gary Gensler, according to the Wall Street Journal, told reporters that proof of stake networks could be considered securities offerings due to their rewards mechanisms, all-but calling out Ethereum by name. Since that date, Gensler has slowly but surely built the case that ETH is likely a security, primarily by suggesting that \u201conly Bitcoin\u201d is a commodity.\n\nIt is possible that the SEC\u2014which has long-defined \u201cinvestment contracts,\u201d a type of security, as investments made with an \u201cexpectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014might use the implementation of Shanghai as evidence of the fulfillment of a securities arrangement between ETH stakers and the core Ethereum team that implemented the upgrade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople aren't going to get the [Ethereum] that they've earned as staking rewards, unless the Shanghai upgrade is successful,\u201d Michael Selig, an attorney specializing in crypto regulation, who previously worked for the CFTC, told Decrypt. \u201cWho's coordinating that? The SEC might have a list of people. It\u2019s the essential efforts being performed by these guys to make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhile Selig adamantly believes such a move on the SEC\u2019s part would constitute a misinterpretation of securities law, particularly given the decentralization of the Ethereum core development team, he fears it may be a path forward to censoring the Ethereum network as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhat do they have to say? \u2018Look, these are investment contracts, and here\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s management or efforts being made by certain people,\u2019\u201d Selig said.\n\nSuch an argument would not likely be made until withdrawals are enabled on Ethereum, and the theoretical contract between Ethereum and its users is fulfilled. Should the Shanghai upgrade fail\u2014an unlikely scenario, given the diligence and track record of Ethereum\u2019s core developers\u2014the SEC would have an even better case, arguing on behalf of swarms of disgruntled stakers that the network failed to fulfill its end of an investment bargain.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC\u2019s appetite for crypto regulation might have grown so large as to attempt to snuff out one of the linchpins of the entire blockchain ecosystem. But whereas April 12\u2014the date of Shanghai\u2019s implementation\u2014will remain a largely symbolic milestone within the crypto industry, symbolism can often have much more tangible repercussions in the realm of politics."

        "content": "Exotic derivatives protocol Cega Finance will be launching on Ethereum mainnet, branching out from its native Solana.\n\nIn traditional finance, exotic options fill the same role, more or less, as regular options \u2014 enabling leveraged longs and shorts on an underlying asset, but they can be used to achieve specific investment goals that cannot be accomplished with American or European options.\n\nFor example, Barrier options have a payoff that depends on whether the underlying asset price reaches a certain barrier level during the life of the option, while Asian options\u2019 payoff depends on the average price of the asset over a period of time.\n\n\u201cExotic options are a natural evolution in an economic market,\u201d Arisa Toyosaki, Cega Finance co-founder, told Blockworks. \u201cThey are a conditional option on top of a vanilla option.\u201d\n\nSeasoned investors can use exotic options to dial in risk preferences while trading a wider range of investment products.\n\nLeveraged options vaults\n\nCega also supports structured vault products pitched to enable yields during volatile market environments.\n\nThe protocol will be offering a leveraged options vault (LOV) strategy, expected to launch within the second quarter. This option will be offered on top of the products which are already available to those on the Solana blockchain.\n\nLOV is an options structured product that Toyosaki believes will resolve capital inefficiency in DeFi as it \u201cdoes not require additional liquidity accessed through redemptions of user-funded margins or overcollateralization.\u201d\n\nLOV\u2019s Gotta Go Fast offering, for example, offers a 21% to 30% APY. The underlying assets will be BTC, ETH and SOL, and Cega says it will offer a 50% principal protection barrier.\n\nToyosaki notes that in order to take a leverage position in the existing market, the amount of capital that must be staked \u2014 but never put to work \u2014 is significant.\n\n\u201cWe created a method for our leverage options vaults that is extremely capital efficient and allows you to get a leveraged return by having a combination of options which can maximize your appetite for the market,\u201d she said.\n\nLOV liquidations work like this, Blockworks Research analyst Ren Yu Kong explains:\n\nA user deposits crypto into a vault for a set time period of time \u2014 for example, 30 days; and\n\nif BTC, ETH, or SOL drop by over 50% across that period, then;\n\nthe 50% principal protection barrier has expired, requiring collateral to be taken.\n\n\u201cFrom there, the vault takes the worst-performing asset. Say BTC decreased by 30%, ETH decreased by 45%, SOL decreased by 60%. Then the vault will return 40% (100-60) of your initial deposit,\u201d Kong said.\n\nOn top of LOV, Cega is also launching a trading firm, Tras Mobian. The entity is designed to resolve one-sided demand issues in decentralized financial markets.\n\n\u201cIf you look at every DeFi option vault in the market, everyone is focused on selling options. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of demand for users buying options,\u201d Toyosaki said.\n\nThis is where Tras Mobian comes in. It will be focused on research and development in the space, according to Toyosaki, with the hopes of creating more demand for both sides of the market.\n\nTas Mobian will run independently of Cega, the company notes. A third-party custodian will manage its multisig and oversee its balance sheets and audits.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cega Finance, one of the leading derivatives protocols in DeFi, announced today that it has launched on Ethereum Mainnet. Cega is also thrilled to announce the launch of Leveraged Options Vaults (\"LOVs\"), a novel options strategy which represents innovation in DeFi primitives, as well as the launch of trading firm Tras Mobian.\n\nEthereum Mainnet Launch\n\nCega has launched on Ethereum Mainnet which brings its innovative, exotic options structured product vaults to the largest L1 blockchain.\n\nCega builds structured product vaults that allow investors to earn safer yields during volatile market environments while providing strong protection against severe market movements. Exotic options differ from vanilla options because they add customized, non-standard features that deliver unique payoffs for investors such as increased yield and principal protection. For example, investors can stake USDC in Cega to trade an exotic options strategy such as \" I will earn 12% APY if BTC or ETH do not decrease more than 50% in the next 27 days\u201d.\n\nOn Ethereum Mainnet, Cega can be easily accessed by leading wallet service providers including Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect which enables Fireblocks and Gnosis Safe users to stake with Cega.\n\nFor new users making their first deposit, staking can be done in three clicks. Users access Cega through its web application at https://app.cega.fi/. From there, users need to connect their Ethereum wallet, choose an options vault strategy, and deposit USDC. Cega offers a variety of vault options strategies that cater to different investment goals and risk appetites, with a range of crypto underlying assets (e.g. ETH, BTC, SOL, and AVAX).\n\nCega\u2019s smart contracts on Ethereum Mainnet have been double audited to eliminate security attack vectors that could compromise user funds and to ensure code security. Cega audits were performed by Ottersec and Zellic, top security auditors in the space formed by former winners of global hacking competitions. In both audit analyses and reports, no critical vulnerabilities were identified and all code security recommendations were implemented to further strengthen the codebase.\n\nLeveraged Option Vaults\n\nCega is launching a novel leveraged options vault (\u201cLOV\u201d) strategy that delivers up to 5x higher yields ranging from 20% APY to 109% APY. This product development was driven by strong feedback from the community who frequently requested additional strategies to earn higher APY. LOVs are currently slated to launch within Q2.\n\nThe Cega team is committed to pushing the boundaries of DeFi innovation. The LOV is an elegant solution that enables leveraged yields without the need for additional collateralization. Instead, LOVs use an options structured product involving a put spread to create a new DeFi primitive. Unlike conventional leveraged products, the LOV does not require additional liquidity accessed through redemptions of user-funded margins or overcollateralization, which solves the issue of liquidity fragmentation and scalability of leveraged products.\n\nCega also remains committed to delivering real yields to users. This means that the LOV strategies\u2019 yields are sourced from actual options premiums, not token emissions. Yields are paid in USDC and there is no impermanent loss risk for users.\n\nThe development of LOVs is already underway on Ethereum, and audits of the smart contract codebase are in progress. The following table indicates the types of LOV offerings and corresponding yields that users can expect:\n\nLOV Product Name APY\n\n(2x to 5x leverage range) Underlying\n\nAssets Principal\n\nProtection\n\nBarrier Gotta Go Fast 21.0% to 30% APY BTC, ETH, SOL 50% Insanic 25.4% to 47% APY ETH, SOL, AVAX 50% Supercharger 39.2% to 109% APY BTC, ETH 30% APY quoted as of 3/24/2023\n\nTras Mobian\n\nCega has also launched a trading firm, Tras Mobian. As Cega has grown rapidly to become a leading derivatives protocol in DeFi, there has been increasing demand for new features and product R&D. In the past, Cega has offloaded all positions to external market makers. However, the Cega team possesses one of the highest levels of knowledge and capabilities in exotic derivatives trading in the market, with a combined experience of 35+ years and having managed over $10 billion trading per year. Therefore, a small team at Cega has spun off to launch a market maker called Tras Mobian.\n\nTras Mobian has four trading mandates:\n\nProviding competitive Cega product liquidity alongside other market makers. Conducting research and development for new products and providing liquidity for other derivative protocols. Providing operational flexibility for Cega users, such as bespoke positions. Pursuing arbitrage opportunities in the market.\n\nIn order to focus on transparency, Tras Mobian acts independently to Cega and its auctions. Cega has also created risk management best practices including the verification of Tras Mobian\u2019s balance sheet health by a third party, audits of all flow-of-funds via a custodian, and having a third party custodian as a multisig signer.\n\nWith Tras Mobian, Cega products will see a competitive market price without front running, as well as accrue additional value to future Cega token holders.\n\nFor those interested in learning more about Tras Mobian, please check out http://trasmobian.xyz\n\nFuture of Cega\n\nCega is thrilled to be at the forefront of building the future of DeFi by expanding the derivatives market through innovative products, and now trading. Cega is committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of DeFi and to empower users to take control of their financial futures. Its mission is to be the #1 provider of DeFi derivatives and also to pioneer new ways to bring greater transparency, accessibility, and opportunities into DeFi. Cega encourages everyone to join its exciting journey to create a more inclusive and decentralized financial system.\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/cega_fi\n\nDiscord: http://discord.gg/cega"

        "content": "Ethereum surpassed Cardano and Polkadot in developers\u2019 count.\n\nTraders are taking ETH positions before the Shapella update.\n\nAhead of the 12 April completion of the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum [ETH] has taken the mantle as the blockchain with the most active developers in the Layer one (L1) and Layer Two (L2) ecosystems.\n\nRecall that projects like Polkadot [DOT], and Cardano [ADA] were mostly at the crest of this activity for the last few months.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe active developers metric, as measured by Token Terminal, tracks the number of GitHub developers engaged in polishing the features of a project.\n\nAccording to the blockchain data and dApp aggregator, Ethereum had 199 developers, while Polkadot could only register 172 in second place.\n\nApart from the top two, L2 projects including the ones getting hyped as Polygon [MATIC], and Arbitrum [ARB] improved in this regard. However, they remained far behind Ethereum. Meanwhile, as Ethereum ramps up preparations to enable staked Ether [stETH] withdrawal, traders seem to get involved in taking ETH positions.\n\nNot a question of \u201cOptions\u201d\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the options Open Interest (OI) across all exchanges had been increasing since 24 March. The options OI reveals the total amount of funds dedicated to opening options contracts.\n\nAnd, at press time, the metric was $7.56 billion. This indicated that traders are increasingly forecasting which direction ETH will head given the blockchain\u2019s forthcoming upgrade.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum fear and greed index was 61 out of a possible 100, at the time of writing. The indicator uses price volatility, market volume, and social trend data to assess if an asset is at a fair price.\n\nEthereum Fear and Greed Index is 61 \u2013 Greed\n\nCurrent price: $1,792https://t.co/w9g6chjUEShttps://t.co/9mfbj9d3uH pic.twitter.com/4be0oO6UxM \u2014 Ethereum Fear and Greed Index (@EthereumFear) March 31, 2023\n\nSo, the current condition implies that market mentions do not see a buying opportunity. Similarly, the sentiment does not expect a notable correction in the short term.\n\nHowever, institutions who trade Over The Counter (OTC) contracts seem not to share the same perceptions with the overall derivatives market. According to the CME Group, ETH\u2019s futures OI was down to 4,246 while the volume increased to 5,103 ETH.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThe goal is to keep providing\n\nEither way, predicting ETH\u2019s price action around developments like this remains a dicey decision. In times past like the year of the Merge, several long positions were open. But unfortunately, most liquidated as the ETH price plunged.\n\nMoreover, the number of ETH 2.0 deposit contracts by staking providers had reached new peaks via different networks and exchanges. And, as expected Lido Finance [LDO] edged out every other protocol while Binance dominated exchange activity."

        "title": "Part II: When You Jump Chains, Do NFTs Stay the Same? Ordinals on the Bitcoin Blockchain - JD Supra",
        "content": "As discussed in Part I of this series, Ordinals are a pioneering new method of utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain that will usher in new and innovative use cases on Bitcoin. As promised, in Part II we will discuss the implications for creators and owners.\n\nImplications of Ordinal NFTs for Creators and Owners\n\nAs with most crypto innovation, capable users quickly flocked to the shiny new object. Copies of popular Ethereum NFT projects began appearing on the Bitcoin blockchain after the Ordinals launch. For example, a clone of CryptoPunks, named Ordinal Punks, popped up and is reportedly gaining traction. Further, the owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club (\u201cBAYC\u201d) #1626 permanently removed the NFT from its spot as one of the most valuable in the space by \u201cburning\u201d it, then inscribing the NFT on Bitcoin using Ordinals. While the owner of BAYC #1626 effectively deleted \u2013 or symbolically transferred \u2013 the NFT, it appears that some NFT creators are not purists and are willing to experiment on Bitcoin. For example, Yuga Labs, the creator behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club Ethereum-based NFT phenomenon, announced that it would release a NFT project called TwelveFold on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn our December article we asked: what do hard forks mean for my NFTs? In this article we ask a similar question: how does a copy of an NFT on completely different chain (Bitcoin, not Ethereum), affect value and licenses?\n\nA number of questions arise. Does the holder of the copycat Ordinal on Bitcoin require a license corresponding to the Ethereum NFT? What happens to the Ethereum NFT purchaser\u2019s rights granted to it under the license, which may or may not include a commercial right to exploit and sublicense? Does an Ordinal inscription of an Ethereum NFT fall under a purchaser\u2019s general non-commercial use and public display rights that are generally given to purchasers on NFT marketplaces? Does the original Ethereum NFT holder hold one set of rights and the holder of the copycat on Ordinals possess any rights that may be in conflict with the original NFT holder\u2019s? Generally speaking, would the value of the NFT be affected if two identical copies exist on two different blockchains? Does the NFT owner or project have a say in which blockchain to recognize? Has any IP infringement occurred?\n\nThese rights are not insignificant, as the holder, depending on the license grant, is typically permitted to display or otherwise use the NFT in a non-commercial manner, and, in some cases, may even be able to commercially exploit, or grant a person(s) the right to commercially exploit, the NFT. Understanding what bundle of rights, and whether others share that bundle, is helpful to valuing the NFT and its underlying IP, as well as brand building.\n\nAs with everything in the constantly-evolving cryptosphere, there will be variability in how licensing agreements these issues. Certain licensing agreements may offer clues for how this issue may be handled. For instance, the terms of one NFT marketplace, Rarible\u2019s Standard Collectibles Sale and License Agreement (the \u201cRaribles Agreement\u201d), indicates that it only recognizes NFTs on Ethereum:\n\n\u201c Collectible \u201d means the combination of: (A) an Ethereum-based NFT having a Uniform Resource Identifier (\u201cURI\u201d) identifying an appropriately configured JSON file conforming to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema, ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema or a similar JSON schema, as applicable (such JSON file, the \u201d Collectible ID\u201d); and (B) the Collectible Metadata specified by such Collectible ID.\u201d\n\n[While the Rarible\u2019s Agreement only recognizes Ethereum-based NFTs, the Agreement does recognize NFTs on each chain after a hard fork]:\n\n\u201c Collector \u201d of a Collectible means at each time, the person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the NFT included in such Collectible, for so long as such person continues to hold such title to and ownership of such NFT. All references to \u201cCollector\u201d include the Collector\u2019s lawful permitted successors and assigns. In the event of an Ethereum Persistent Fork creating copies of the Collectibles at the same addresses at which they were then held on Ethereum, the scope of the term \u201cCollector,\u201d and all licenses granted to and other rights of a Collector under these Terms, shall be deemed expanded to include each person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the copies of such NFTs that are included on the Ethereum Persistent Fork. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a result of the preceding sentence, in an Ethereum Persistent Fork, the aggregate number of the Collectibles may be increased, which could have an adverse effect on the value of each Collectible or the aggregate value of the total Collectibles.\n\nThis raises a second question, what would be the effect be if the Rarible\u2019s Agreement (or any other similar terms of service on an NFT marketplace) was modified to permit an increase in the aggregate number of collectibles as a result of a new enablement on a new protocol, similar to how Rarible\u2019s treats a hard fork?\n\nLike Rarible\u2019s, Yuga Labs, a Web3 developer of NFTs \u2013 including CryptoPunks and BAYCs \u2013 provides a warranty disclaimer that each CryptoPunk NFT exists only by virtue of the ownership record on the Ethereum Blockchain:\n\nEACH CRYPTOPUNK NFT IS AN INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSET THAT EXISTS ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN. ANY TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN, WHICH YUGA LABS DOES NOT CONTROL.\n\nBAYCs includes a similar provision in the Ownership section. As such, under these terms, Yuga Labs has de facto designated Ethereum as its blockchain of choice. However, whereas Rarible\u2019s licensing agreement may result in doubling the amount of \u201cCollectibles\u201d in the event of a fork, Yuga Labs, a Web3 developer of NFTs, reserves the right to designate which fork is valid for their notable Cryptopunks:\n\nThe License applies only to the CryptoPunk NFT on the blockchain that Yuga, in its sole discretion, may designate, which designation shall apply retroactively. Thus, for example, if a fork or other event purports to result in duplicate CryptoPunk NFTs, only the non-fungible token recorded on the blockchain designated by Yuga Labs will be eligible to receive the benefit of the License. Any license purportedly granted hereunder to the owner of a non-fungible token recorded on a blockchain not designated by YugaLabs is void ab initio.\n\nThus, in addition to stating that CryptoPunks exist by virtue of the digital asset record on Ethereum, Yuga labs may designate the blockchain where CryptoPunks exist. In terms of forking, Yuga Labs\u2019 approach is similar to venture capital firm a16z\u2019s approach, which provided five template NFT licenses, each providing for the industry-recognized chain post-fork, merge or duplication.\n\nTransfer and Sublicensing . The licenses granted in these Terms are non-transferrable, except that if you lawfully transfer ownership of your Project NFT, the license to the NFT Media in Section 1.1 to you shall terminate upon the effective date of such transfer, and such licenses will be assigned to the new owner of the Project NFT associated with such NFT Media. As a condition to sales, transfers or similar transactions of the Project NFTs, the transferee agrees upon the acquisition of the Project NFT that (a) the transferee is not a Restricted Party and (b) the transferee accepts these Terms. Further, if you choose to sublicense any of your licensed rights set forth in Section 1.1 above, you are only permitted to do so if any such sublicensees agree (i) that they are not Restricted Parties, (ii) to the same covenant not to assert as set forth in the second to last sentence of Section 1.2, and (iii) that if your licensed rights in Section 1.1 are transferred (such as because you sell your Project NFT), then any such sublicenses you have granted in such licensed rights will automatically terminate. Because virtually all public blockchains are licensed under open source licenses, it is possible that the blockchain may fork, merge, or duplicate the original blockchain that initially recorded ownership of your Project NFT. In such case, any rights granted under these Terms to owners of any Project NFT will only be granted to the lawful owners of such Project NFT whose ownership is recorded on the mainnet version of the blockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported in the blockchain industry as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain (as determined in our sole discretion).\n\nHowever, under this version of the a16z NFT license, a16z does not specify that the only valid ownership ledger is on Ethereum, so arguably the licensing agreement may be used with respect to an Ordinal inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. Further, Bitcoin is neither a fork from, a merge into, nor a duplication of Ethereum, and the license is silent on NFT copies; however, the clear emphasis is that IP licenses will only be granted to the lawful owners of a project on a \u201cblockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain\u201d as determined in the sole discretion of the Creator. It is an open question whether this language would give holders comfort if the argument could be made that their licenses are protected against copycats on a completely separate chain, like Bitcoin.\n\nAlternatively, as a creator may reserve the right to upgrade the NFT\u2019s smart contract in the case of a fork, reserve the right to declare future restrictions on the NFTs use, or stay silent altogether, a creator may also decide to jump entirely to a separate chain. In the absence of a licensing agreement or specific guidelines, Archer v. Coinbase, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 5th 266 (2020), provides some clarity as to how new chains may be handled. In Archer, a user claimed that a cryptocurrency exchange was required to provide him access to all forked versions of the Bitcoin in his exchange account. The California state court disagreed, reasoning that the exchange\u2019s user agreement did not obligate the exchange to support all forks. The court also found that Coinbase\u2019s refusal to support a new form of forked cryptocurrency was not action amounting to conversion as Coinbase did not host the forked cryptocurrency in the first instance, and thus could not have deprived the plaintiff of a property right or exercised dominion over the forked cryptocurrency. Consequently, digital asset trading platforms (token, NFT, or otherwise) tend to expressly reserve the ability to determine which forks they support or otherwise reserve the broad right to place future restrictions on transactions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will become a widely popular chain for NFT enthusiastic and projects. In any event, the revolutionary capabilities enabled by Ordinals bring up novel questions surrounding NFTs and licensing agreements, so NFT issuers and marketplaces should consider what effect Ordinals might have on their business models and also reexamine relevant terms as needed to take into account any future NFT-enabled blockchains.\n\n[View source.]"

Coins with a strong history like Ethereum (ETH) are always good options but so are promising presale tokens like Love Hate Inu (LHINU), DeeLance (DLANCE), Metropoly (METRO), Ecoterra (ECOTERRA), and RobotEra (TARO).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at why traditional giant Ethereum is still a good investment option even if new regulations are brought in to tighten the market.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nAs we can see from the chart above Ethereum enjoyed a very successful Q1 of 2023, but what can we expect for Q2? Well as we mentioned above the CFTC could be about to crack down on some exchanges, which means it could be bad news for cryptos listed on said exchanges. It is therefore very good news that the head of the CFTC has stated that they consider Ethereum as a commodity, what this means in crypto terms is that ETH should be spared any restrictions that may be applied to other coins.\n\nMore positive news for the near future is the Shanghai update that is coming on April 12th. This has been a long time coming and Ethereum users will be very excited to learn it is less than two weeks away. Until now the coin holders could not remove their staked ETH from the ecosystem, well now they will be able to withdraw it along with all the rewards they may have occurred.\n\nSome have worried this could lead to a mass exodus as investors could remove all their investments but this is highly unlikely for two reasons. One, this isn\u2019t some token with very little utility, it is the second biggest crypto on the market that has proved itself as a valuable asset. The second reason is Ethereum has set a daily withdrawal limit so even if investors wanted to remove everything this could not be possible.\n\nSo Ethereum looks like it is set for more growth in Q2 but what about the five coins going through presale we mentioned in the opening? Let\u2019s take a look at them now.\n\nLove Hate Inu- Experts think this will be the hottest-selling meme coin of 2023\n\nWhile it is a meme coin Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is also much more than that, it is also a V2E platform where its users can go to vote on the trendiest and most pressing topics in the world of politics, social issues, and pop culture. What\u2019s especially fun is either side of the vote will be represented by fun angel and devil illustrations representing love and hate.\n\nThe inventors of Love Hate Inu have gone to great lengths to ensure the project is both safe and secure. 90% of the total allocation of coins will be sold during presale which ensures the long-term future of the project and a stake-to-vote system will ensure the polls on their site can not be rigged or spammed in any way.\n\nDeeLance- The crypto that will fix the freelance industry\n\nThe amount of people working as a freelancer in their chosen sector of work has exploded since the pandemic. However traditional websites cause a lot of issues for both the freelancers and employers. With their decentralized platform DeeLance (DLANCE) will solve these issues.\n\nThe main selling point of the platform is how it will fix payment issues, its peer-to-peer payment system means its fees will be much smaller than traditional freelance sites and the blockchain will also allow much faster payment times. DeeLance will use escrow when it comes to payment which means employees need not worry about chasing an employer as the payment will be there for them once they finish their work.\n\nMetropoly- The markets first dedicated real estate token\n\nUntil now no crypto has been solely dedicated to real estate investment and that is likely because no one had as good an idea as Metropoly (METRO). They will bring real estate investment to the masses as for as little as $100 buyers will be able to own their part of some of the most sought after properties from around the world.\n\nHow it works is the properties will be tokenized into NFTs and then from there these will be fractioned and sold off to Metropoly customers, no added paperwork or delays simply choose your property and pay the price. New property owners will be able to earn a passive income just as if they owned the physical location through rent and appreciation.\n\n>>> Buy Metropoly Now<<<\n\nEcoterra- Earn crypto as you save the planet\n\nDespite only just beginning the presale of Ecoterra (ECOTERRA) has already generated a lot of buzz, this is likely because of its rewards for real life recycling. Through their app its users will be rewarded with the native token when they recycle. Simply scan the item you are recycling and watch the ECOTERRA pile up.\n\nEcoterra really has helping the environment as their main priority as the native token can be spent on green activities like cleaning up beaches.\n\n>>>Buy ECOTERRA Now<<<\n\nRobotEra- One of the most exciting P2E games of 2023\n\nRobotEra (TARO) looks like it could be one the most fun P2E games of 2023. The game is set in the Metaverse on the destroyed planet of Taro (also the native currency) which the players are tasked with rebuilding. No coding knowledge is necessary which is great because construction and ingenuity is where players will make their revenue.\n\nPlayers can explore and spend TARO just like they would in a second life game so building amenities or other attractive locations will draw in other players who will pay to enjoy the experience being offered.\n\n>>>Buy RobotEra Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum looks like it is still a safe option even if further regulations are introduced in the coming weeks or months. However the five coins going through presale are likely to pump even more and should give buyers more bang for their buck.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Future of Finance: EY\u2019s Brody on why tech history shows \u2018there can be only one winning blockchain\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Welcome to Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their jobs, how their firm fits into the crypto ecosystem, and what this all means for how we use money.\n\nThe following is from a recent conversation with Paul Brody, the global blockchain leader at EY and author of the upcoming Ethereum for Business: A plain-English guide to doing business on the world\u2019s largest blockchain.\n\nBrody is a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a CoinDesk contributor, and has done stints at IBM and McKinsey. He also has a soft spot for Swedish Fish.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nSo you\u2019re writing an Ethereum book?\n\nI\u2019m getting there. I started in December. I wrote like 10 chapters, and it was really, really tough. And now, there\u2019s, like, six chapters left? The format of the book is how Ethereum works and why\u2014why public blockchains are so important for business\u2014specifically why they\u2019re more important than private blockchains\u2014business use cases, procurement, supply chain management, tokenization, carbon footprint, and why it takes so long for enterprises to adopt technology.\n\nWhen you were at IBM you did some Internet of Things stuff, and some other projects that were cutting edge. Is this sort of a pattern for you, where you want to do the \u201ccool new thing\u201d? Is that just what\u2019s most appealing to you?\n\nThe thing is, I am very driven by intellectual curiosity. I don\u2019t necessarily go after every single new thing, but when I find a thing that\u2019s really, really important, I go after it. When I was in college\u2014I\u2019m dating myself here\u2014I was like, \u201cWireless! Wireless is the thing!\u201d I went to work as a summer job at the first mobile network operator in Africa, in Nigeria, and I took an entire year off to work for them before I came back and went to work at McKinsey, where I can remember just telling colleagues, \u201cMobile data, you\u2019ve got to invest in mobile data.\u201d\n\nThe best perk of being a VP at IBM was you had access to IBM research. And I had a couple of amazing products, and before I did the one that got me into crypto, I did another one, which was immensely fun, around 3D printing. A lot of people do these corporate white papers\u2014they just do a survey, they present it like it\u2019s subjective data that nine out of 10 executives think that not burning down the planet is a good idea\u2014they present it as if it\u2019s factual data, and it\u2019s not really. What I love to do is get a couple layers below that, and what\u2019s really fun is, for instance, we\u2019d ask, \u201cOkay, 3D printing will transform manufacturing, but how will it transform manufacturing?\u201d\n\nWhat happened with that\u2014the 3D printing?\n\nWe picked three products\u2014a smartphone, an electric razor, and a washing machine\u2014and we tore them down, literally one piece at a time, evaluated every single component, scanned them in 3D, and then tried to remanufacture as much of the product as possible using a 3D printer. And that was amazing. We came back with specific data on the carbon footprint of 3D printing, the cycle time with 3D printing, we built the economic model of what your manufacturing scales\u2014it\u2019s quite transformational. And the next project I did after that was IoT.\n\nHow did that lead you to Ethereum?\n\nSo I\u2019m out at Samsung, talking to the head of the multimedia solution center, and he\u2019s like, \u201cPaul, we are going to go broke, the cloud is going to bankrupt us\u2026you\u2019ve got to come up with a better plan.\u201d I thought to myself, this is really bizarre. Imagine a really smart light bulb with the brains of an iPhone, and it\u2019s connected to WiFi. What is your iPhone processor doing? Like nothing, 99% of the time! So why on earth are we paying all this money to maintain massive cloud data centers, when your refrigerator could be providing cloud services, or your phone? So I called a bunch of guys and was like, \u201cWe should be able to make a cloud of computing devices that manage themselves, right?\u201d The cloud should be in the devices.\n\nHalfway through this project, colleagues were like, \u201cI want you to think about using this thing called Bitcoin, because it\u2019s distributed computing. And we\u2019ve had lots of debates\u2014on the one hand, it\u2019s very computationally intensive, but then on the other hand, it\u2019s not like these machines are doing anything else. So John Cohn, an IBM distinguished engineer, comes and says, \u201cPaul, I\u2019ve met this guy, I think you\u2019d really like him. His name is Vitalik [Buterin]. And he wants to do Bitcoin, but instead of for money, for computing. So we built this thing called ADEPT\u2013Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, sort of this decentralized cloud infrastructure\u2014for Samsung, with help from Vitalik. And we showed it at CES in January 2015. That\u2019s how I got into Ethereum. That\u2019s how I got into blockchain. And at that point, I was like, this is going to be absolutely revolutionary.\n\nWhat important lessons or ideas from other projects or jobs have you applied to ones on the blockchain?\n\nWe\u2019re heading toward this world where the marginal cost of almost everything is zero. One of the most brilliant things that I heard when I worked at McKinsey was if you want to think about the future, try to imagine some important process or input is free. Just imagine, like, what if electricity was free? What if airfare was free? What if phone calls were free? Like 25 or 30 years ago, this idea that phone calls would be free, it was ridiculous. And yet, we sort of forget. One of the reasons we liked Ethereum was it comes with account payments and smart contracts. And we used to joke that we don\u2019t know what anybody will actually pay for in the Internet of Things, but, eventually, someone will figure out how to monetize it. And when they do, they\u2019ll be so glad this architecture has payments and contracts built in.\n\nHas embracing the blockchain helped EY from a competitive standpoint?\n\nIn the world of audit, we only have three competitors. So my \u201cfair share\u201d of any sort of global audit market is 25%, but it\u2019s actually been better than that because I don\u2019t think any of our peers have taken this space quite as seriously as we have.\n\nSo where is this leading? Can you tell me more about plans for the blockchain?\n\nA lot of tech systems are natural monopolies. That\u2019s just how they are in a world where the marginal cost is zero for products. And then with Metcalfe\u2019s law\u2014the value of a network grows along with the number of participants\u2014at a certain inflection point, your network becomes so valuable you\u2019re effectively a natural monopoly. And that\u2019s hugely shaped our strategy here because it led me down the path to believe there can be only one winning blockchain. There can\u2019t be 50, can\u2019t be 100, and it almost certainly will be a public blockchain. All paths lead to a dominant chain. And when you look at the history of computing platforms, that dominant chain usually becomes clearly visible within a decade of an ecosystem starting.\n\nAnd Ethereum\u2019s that winner?\n\nEthereum was really the only programmable smart contract chain out there that was really dominant. So I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re making a play.\u201d It\u2019s a theory, a bit of the GE mentality where if I have a limited budget, am I going to spread it around, am I going to be okay with a bunch of different blockchains? Or am I going with the best?\n\nWhat prevents the rest of the Big Four from just copying what you\u2019re doing at some point?\n\nObviously, in a decentralized system, you can\u2019t do that. And that\u2019s really tough. I\u2019ve long accepted that. Even if we win this race, there will be no moment where we can just put our feet up and say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re a monopolist now. Great.\u201d We will have to keep running hard.\n\nWhen clients come to EY, is it more often, \u201cOh, hey, by the way, we hear you have this blockchain guy\u201d? or do they walk in like, \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the blockchain guy\u201d?\n\nIt comes in both forms. All the time, I\u2019ll sit down with clients, and they\u2019ll come over, like, \u201cWe had no idea you guys knew how to do this stuff.\u201d And that\u2019s great. I love that. And it makes me very happy. And, absolutely, you know, our senior people, it\u2019s great when somebody writes to the chairman and says, \u201cI just had this guy, Paul Brody, come in and talk to my clients\u2014totally blew their minds. Like now they think of UI differently.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s next\u2014both on your end, and more generally when it comes to the future of finance?\n\nIf you were to boil down all of our aspirations into a single sentence, it would be this: We believe that blockchain will do for networks and enterprises what ERP did for organizations. It was transformational. Before ERP, the left hand and the right hand didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\n\nWith smart contracts on the public blockchain, I can create tokens that represent all the assets, that connect the buyers and the sellers\u2014and that automatically enforce the processes. Like if you have a volume discount rule, when you achieve your targeted volumes, it automatically gives you a discount. This sounds like a small thing, but, actually, it just happens. No one has to remember. And think about an insurance contract, like in health care, and how after your deductible expires you\u2019ll be referred to specialists, and then the logic just gets more complicated, more challenging. So my goal is to get to the point where we can take any arbitrarily complex business agreement and run it on the public blockchain."

        "title": "The Ethereum Beacon Chain: Explained - Ledger",
        "content": "The Ethereum Beacon Chain: Explained\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 7 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n\u2014 The Beacon Chain was the main component of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain helped improve the network\u2019s security and scalability by introducing staking and allowing for sharding implementation.\n\n\n\n\u2014This article provides a deeper understanding of Ethereum\u2019s core components, allowing for a better understanding of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nIf you know anything about cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve likely heard of what the Ethereum network is. But do you know how it works? Well, the Ethereum network is the second most popular cryptocurrency, and a true pioneer of blockchain use cases. However, did you know that Ethereum changed its whole consensus mechanism?\n\nThe move was dubbed \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d and involved Ethereum transitioning from the legacy Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to an alternative system, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in 2022.\n\nBut to do so it needed the help of a separate chain already using PoS. So, the Beacon Chain launched on December 1st, 2020 to facilitate that transition.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at what it was all about!\n\nWhat was the Ethereum Beacon Chain?\n\nThe Beacon Chain was the backbone of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition from PoW to PoS as it introduced PoS to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIt was created to ensure the PoS consensus logic was sound and sustainable before it could be enabled on the Ethereum Mainnet. That\u2019s why it ran as a parallel chain to the original PoW Ethereum.\n\nWhat did the Beacon Chain do?\n\nA key piece of ETH 2.0, the Beacon Chain was responsible for establishing new parameters for governance, validator operations, staking rewards, and other changes related to the PoS system.\n\nThe Beacon Chain did not process any smart contract transactions. Rather conducted the network of Ethereum stakers before they started validating real Ethereum transactions. Besides overseeing validators and managing ETH, along with the formation of validator committees and recording their votes, it also monitored the behavior of the validators. It rewarded validators for their good behavior while penalizing malicious activity by slashing rewards.\n\nThe Merge: From Beacon Chain To Main Consensus\n\nTo switch from PoW to PoS on Ethereum, the Beacon chain had to be instructed to accept blockchain transactions from the original Ethereum chain. These transactions were then bundled into blocks and organized into a blockchain using the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, the original Ethereum clients turned off their mining, block propagation, and consensus logic, handing all of that over to the Beacon Chain. This event was known as The Merge.\n\nIn Sept. 2022, the Beacon Chain was merged with the original PoW chain to formalize PoS as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism. With The Merge upgrade, there were no longer two blockchains; just one PoS Ethereum chain that you can access with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nThe Ethereum PoS network is run by a group of validators, which are essentially \u201cvirtual miners\u201d. They run the consensus of Eth 2.0. These validators were originally activated by the Beacon Chain, the contents of which included a registry of validator addresses, the state of each validator, and attestations.\n\nTo secure the network, each validator had to stake 32 ETH into the smart contract. Then the Beacon Chain deactivated validators whose balance reached 16 ETH. Randomly chosen validators could then build a block each 12 seconds. At the merge, the Beacon chain became part of the new Ethereum PoS network, and its validators came along with it.\n\nThe Beacon Chain started with 21,063 validators. Post-merge, these are the validators of the Ethereum PoS network and there are over 500,000 of them.\n\nBeacon Chain Impact\n\nNow, let\u2019s see how it impacted the wider Ethereum network.\n\nSecurity: Staking on Ethereum\n\nIn introducing PoS to Ethereum, the Beacon Chain brought staking to the network. If you don\u2019t already know, check out the Ledger Academy article on what crypto staking is. But for the Ethereum network, it involves staking Ethereum by locking ETH in a deposit contract.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the Ethereum Beacon Chain staking contract held more than 16 million ETH tokens at the time of the Merge, which is equivalent to over $22 billion, representing more than 13% of the coin\u2019s market cap.\n\nWhile staking has been live since Dec. 1, 2020, right from the Beacon Chain\u2019s initiation, staked ETH can\u2019t be withdrawn yet. This functionality is expected to be included in the next network upgrade, named Shanghai. The Shanghai upgrade will take place in April 2023, and it will finally allow participants to unlock their ETH.\n\nScalability: Sharding Ethereum Becomes Possible\n\nWith the Beacon Chain merged, the Ethereum community is now equipped to explore different ways of scaling the network.\n\nPreviously, scaling solutions involved rollups or sidechains.\n\nBlockchain rollups rely on the Ethereum mainnet for security, but they are capable of executing transactions outside the main chain. A good example of an Ethereum project using this scaling solution is Immutable X.\n\nThen, sidechains are independent blockchains that communicate with the main chain via a two-way bridge, such as how Polygon does with Ethereum.\n\nHowever, moving to a proof of stake consensus also allows the implementation of another scaling solution: Sharding. Sharding involves splitting the main Ethereum network into multiple chains called \u201cshards,\u201d with each shard chain having its independent state. This would allow the Ethereum network to process more transactions than it currently handles and dramatically improves its scalability.\n\nIt is a multi-phase upgrade that provides secure distribution of data storage requirements, enabling low crypto gas fees while leveraging the security of Ethereum.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe Beacon Chain has made it possible for Ethereum to become one of the most secure and reliable blockchain networks in existence today. Co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin suggested that the Merge and then the Shanghai upgrade are by no means the end of the story for the Ethereum network. In the future, we may see major upgrades to the network\u2019s capabilities, from the Ethereum Virtual Machine to the network\u2019s very consensus."

        "title": "Ethereum's L1 would have no problem interacting with zkEVMs, Vitalik clarifies - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain would expand to a three-layer client.\n\nLatency and data efficiency remained a problem.\n\nEthereum [ETH], plagued by transaction delays and network congestion a few years back, has been on top of solving these challenges, thanks to the plethora of scaling solutions. The last of these is the zero-knowledge integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine [zkEVM], launched by Polygon [MATIC].\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAlthough the Mainnet Beta was inaugurated on 27 March, not many intended participants understand how the L1 project would interact with its L2 counterpart. Due to this blurred view, Vitalik Buterin released a blog post concerning the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a sharing formula\n\nAccording to the Ethereum co-founder, the project\u2019s nodes consisting of the consensus and execution client have been reduced to allow for zkEVM participation. The execution client uses the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to validate data on the blockchain. Conversely, the consensus client is responsible for maintaining the latest database and executing transactions.\n\nNormally, these clients account for two-thirds of the network. But with the introduction of the zk rollups have ensured that it is not the case anymore. Therefore, allowing developers to intervene while the chain stops finalizing blocks. Vitalk noted,\n\n\u201cAs of today, no consensus or execution client makes up more than 2/3 of the network.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Vitalik pointed out that the space freed would mean that zkEVM becomes the third Ethereum client. However, he noted that it won\u2019t be as immediate since the L1 needs to work on using them for verification to verify execution.\n\nOf challenges and fixes\n\nDespite the zk capability, Vitalik mentioned that there were problems that no L2 could solve. He mentioned the latency challenge, which could allow disruption of the chain after a late published block. And data efficiency, which could expose validator signatures. However, he cited that there were possible solutions in the long-term saying,\n\n\u201cThe latency challenge could be addressed by being careful when designing the single-slot finality protocol. The data efficiency issue would have to be addressed by having a separate protocol for aggregating verification-related data.\u201d\n\nFurther insights into the publication made mention of the zk Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKS). As zk proofs allow parties to verify a true statement without revealing any other information, zk-SNARKS allows proof of possession with no interaction between the prover and verifier.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAs Vitalik puts it, the zk-sNARKS and ERC-4337, which makes it possible to create and transact contracts on the blockchain, could also solve the data efficiency issue.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum head conceded that the whole process would take a long time to become reality. He also admitted that slow block execution and verification could be a problem in the initial stages."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: What To Expect From ETH As The Shanghai Upgrade Nears - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum price is at an inflection point as it trades above $1,700 with no clear directional bias. Apart from the market FUD emanating from increasing regulatory crackdowns and a global banking crisis, investors are treading cautiously as they want to see the direction Ether will take once the Shanghai upgrade goes live in the next two weeks.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade To Go Live On April 12\n\nThe long-awaited Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which will enable the withdrawal of staked Ether, is slated for April 12, 2023. The Ethereum devs team announced the launch date through a March 28 tweet saying, \u201cShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from analytics firm Dune, over 16.3 million ETH tokens are staked on the Ethereum network but cannot be withdrawn. The Shanghai upgrade, which has been named Shapella, is designed to give users who staked their ETH on the Ethereum network as early as December 2020 the freedom to withdraw their locked tokens.\n\nIt is believed that enabling withdrawals will reduce the risk associated with holding the staked version of Ethereum, including Frax\u2019s froTH and Lido\u2019s stETH, because they will be redeemable.\n\nHow Will The Ethereum Price Behave Post-Shanghai\n\nThere are mixed expectations on what may happen to the ETH price once the Shapella mainnet is launched. On the one hand, it is expected that some investors may want to cash out on their staking positions for liquid funds. Such a move would see them exit the Beacon Chain. Even if node operators withdraw and sell their ETH, they would want to maintain their staking positions for more yields.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ETH stakers will not be able to withdraw their staked tokens all at once. A withdrawal process has been put in place that first allows holders to directly withdraw their staking rewards. This would represent $1.03 million ETH, worth about $1.8 billion at current rates. Given that Ethereum\u2019s daily volume ranges between US $8-10 billion, chances of negligible selling pressure are high.\n\nIn addition, the amount of ETH staked per validator cannot be withdrawn directly given that a limit of 20,400 ETH ($85M at current rates) is required per day. This is a negligible amount as well when compared to Ether\u2019s daily trading volume.\n\nTherefore, it is safe to say that the ETH price may not be too negatively impacted by the upgrade due to the relatively low selling pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum holders could be motivated by the reduced risks to stake their ETH on the network and earn passive income. Note that staking rewards are inversely proportional to the number of validators. Therefore, if the number of node operators reduces, presumably because of stakers withdrawing their ETH, rewards will surge, attracting more validators. Given that ETH is now deflationary, however, we expect more buying pressure compared to selling pressure.\n\nIf Ether owners \u201cHODL\u201d their tokens and buy more, the equilibrium Ether price could rise because the quantity supplied will be reduced.\n\nEthereum Price Consolidating Before The Upgrade\n\nAfter rising above the $1,700 psychological level on March 17, the Ethereum price has been consolidating in a sideways price action. This points to decreasing volatility as both buyers and sellers fight for control.\n\nThe consolidation and decreasing volatility are illustrated by the choppy price action as well as the constriction of the Bollinger Bands. The more the bands squeeze toward each other, the more the volatility decreases, suggesting that a breakout may happen in either direction.\n\nThe horizontal price movement is also supported by the flattening of the moving averages and the leveling of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) close to the midline. This implies that the buying and selling pressures are balancing out.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nShould the Ethereum price favor the buyers, it would rise from the current level to produce a daily candlestick close above the upper band of the Bollinger at $1,860, confirming a bullish breakout. Such a move would see the buyers collect the liquidity above the said level, bolstering ETH toward the $2,030 range high. This would represent a 13% ascent from the current levels.\n\nShould ETH move in favor of the downside, it would produce a daily candlestick close below the middle band of the Bollinger at $1,740 to seek solace from the $1,700 psychological level. Ethereum\u2019s downside could be capped here in the short term, given that this level has provided support for the token for the last 14 days.\n\nLosing the support at $1,700 could initiate massive sell orders, with the first line of defense emerging from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1,653. Additional support zones could be found at the $1,600 psychological level, the 100-day SMA at $1,540, and the 200-day SMA at $1,436, before reaching the March 10 swing low at $1,370. This would represent a 23% drop from the current price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 7 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is the next major upgrade after \u2018The Merge\u2019 and it\u2019s scheduled for April 12th.\n\n\n\n\u2014 This upgrade will introduce the ability to withdraw staked ETH and rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\n\n\n\u2014More upgrades are scheduled to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network launched in 2015 using a proof of work consensus, much like Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, it can execute smart contracts. This functionality meant more and more projects joined the network. As a result, the Ethereum network became busy, which made transactions both slow and expensive. Ethereum was facing a scalability issue.\n\nSo, you might be thinking \u201cCan\u2019t you just improve the network to handle more data?\u201d And you\u2019d be right because you can\u2026but it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nTo explain, improving the scalability of a blockchain also impacts its decentralization and security. This is what the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, coined \u2018The Blockchain Trilemma\u2019. Essentially, Ethereum chose to solve this problem by changing its whole consensus mechanism from Proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe History of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe concept of a PoS Ethereum was originally called ETH 2.0. But to transition to its new state, Ethereum needed the help of a separate chain that used a PoS consensus. This was named the \u2018Beacon Chain\u2019.\n\nTo explain, PoS blockchains require users to stake their ETH to secure the network. Then these validators have the power to create new blocks and secure the network. In return for their stake, they receive ETH rewards.\n\nSpecifically, the Beacon Chain required users to stake 32ETH to become a validator. However, the validators on the Beacon chain could not unstake this ETH or receive their rewards until it merged with the mainnet. The Merge took place in September 2022 and following that, the beacon chain became part of the new PoS Ethereum mainnet. However, the staked ETH remained locked up.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is the next major upgrade after \u201cThe Merge\u201d. Also known as the Shapella upgrade, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is an important step towards the continued development of the Ethereum protocol. In short, it finalizes Ethereum\u2019s move from PoW to PoS.\n\nWhat does the Shanghai upgrade mean for the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade has the potential to increase accessibility and flexibility for users and improve the overall scalability and security of the network. Plus, it opens the door to new developments in Ethereum\u2019s future. However, the main impact will be the ability to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain \u2013 the feature everyone has been waiting for.\n\nUnstaking ETH from the Beacon Chain\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will allow the phased withdrawal of Ether (ETH). In short, the upcoming upgrade will allow validators to withdraw their ETH and cash out their rewards.\n\nSince many participants staked their ETH and nobody could withdraw it, there\u2019s a lot of liquidity at stake. To avoid transactional chaos, there will be some limits. For example, there will be a limit on the number of withdrawals in each block. Fortunately for validators though, they won\u2019t have to pay gas fees to withdraw.\n\nThose who wish to withdraw their ETH have two options \u2013 partial withdrawals or full withdrawals. Partial withdrawals involve withdrawing only the rewards, which can be withdrawn to any Ethereum wallet. However, the validator account will still be active on the beacon chain, and you will continue to validate transactions as usual.\n\nA full withdrawal, on the other hand, involves withdrawing your entire staked balance, including the 32 ETH required to become a validator, plus any rewards earned. To initiate a full withdrawal, you must submit a voluntary exit message with your validator keys. This message will start the process of exiting from staking, and your validator account will be placed in the exit queue. The time it takes to exit will depend on how many others are planning to do the same thing.\n\nOnce the exit process is complete, your validator account will no longer be responsible for validating transactions, and you will no longer be eligible for rewards. At this point, your account status changes to \u201cwithdrawable,\u201d and you can provide your withdrawal credentials.\n\nFollowing that, you\u2019ll receive your full account balance at the withdrawal address.\n\nWill the Shanghai Upgrade Impact ETH Price?\n\nThere is no way of telling if the Shanghai Upgrade will impact the price positively or negatively.\n\nHowever, upgrades to the Ethereum network often create a buzz that can increase demand. Furthermore, as the Ethereum network becomes more efficient and accessible, it attracts more users. With increased network functionality, new use cases arise. And this innovation usually leads to further demand. So perhaps, the Shanghai upgrade will spark off a whole new wave of Ethereum projects bringing something new to the table. Since ETH has been deflationary since the Merge, some believe it could lead to bullish price action.\n\nOn the other hand, some anticipate a selling wave as unlocking staked ETH will increase the circulating supply of ETH. This could potentially lead to a decrease in price due to selling pressure. However, Ethereum has a staking ratio of 14%, meaning only that percentage of its circulating supply is locked up. That might not mean much to you, but it\u2019s much less than the Solana network\u2019s 70%.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to approach any speculation about the impact of the upgrade on ETH price with caution, as market dynamics are complex and can be difficult to predict with certainty. One thing is certain, though, approximately 1 million ETH in rewards will be available for withdrawal once the upgrade goes live.\n\nWhat Else Could The Upgrade Impact?\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade may also impact liquid staking services like Rocketpool and Lido. But why?\n\nWell, staking on Ethereum requires you to lock up 32ETH for a specific length of time. For example, Kiln uses this method to allow users to fund a validator through Ledger Live and earn rewards.\n\nLiquid staking services, however, allow you to unstake at any time. However, instead of unstaking ETH, you get a token representing the staked ETH instead. You can use these tokens to participate in various DeFi activities just like regular ETH. But in fact, the service still has the staked ETH. Considering liquid staking accounts for 41.69% of the ETH staking market share, and there will be so much ETH flooding into the market, it may impact the price of these platforms\u2019 tokens. That said, how the upgrade will affect these platforms and the wider ecosystem is still hard to predict.\n\nWhen will the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade happen?\n\nThe last test before the upgrade took place on 28th February, when the Goerli Test network forked successfully. While it processed deposits just fine, the test wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Allegedly, some validators did not update their client software, leading to a small delay. That said, the rest of the event was a success, with the mainnet upgrade scheduled for some time in April.\n\nThe Next Ethereum Upgrade: EOF\n\nAfter Shanghai, Ethereum will prepare for its next big change: The EOF upgrade. To explain, EOF stands for EVM Object Format. While its name is very technical, the upgrade itself will allow for practical functionality.\n\nIn short, the upgrade will focus on improving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is the virtual machine responsible for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. If you want to learn more, check out the Academy article on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. But without getting too technical, the EOF upgrade is the first major upgrade to the EVM since its inception in 2015.\n\nIt consists of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to make EVM execution more efficient and easily upgradeable. It will introduce a new binary format for smart contracts, making it easier to create, execute, and upgrade them. This will ultimately lead to better performance and more efficient use of resources on the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, the EOF upgrade has been delayed and will launch a few months after the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nLaying the Foundation for Sharding\n\nEOF will allow the Ethereum network to implement sharding. To explain, sharding is a scaling solution that will dramatically improve Ethereum\u2019s capacity, gas cost, and transaction speed. Sharding allows for the parallel processing of transactions across multiple shards or smaller partitions of the Ethereum network. By using sharding, the Ethereum network can handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) than it currently does, making it more suitable for widespread use in mainstream applications.\n\nFuture Ethereum Upgrades\n\nBesides Shanghai and EOF upgrades, Ethereum has several other major upgrades in the pipeline. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated ETH\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 is only 55% completed after the merge.\n\nSo, the future Ethereum upgrades include the following:\n\nSurge \u2013 This will bring sharding to Ethereum later this year, leading to improvements in scalability, gas costs, and transaction speeds.\n\nVerge \u2013 This one will focus on optimizing storage on the network and reducing node size to improve scalability further.\n\nPurge \u2013 This will help reduce the amount of space required to store ETH on a hard drive, freeing up space for developers.\n\nScourge \u2013 This one aims to provide censorship resistance and avoid centralization and other risks associated with MEV.\n\nSplurge \u2013 This upgrade includes various miscellaneous innovations to make Ethereum better.\n\nThere is no concrete schedule for these upgrades yet, but they may be completed around 2025.\n\nHow to Stay Safe when Interacting with the Ethereum Network?\n\nStaking ETH doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. For those ready to get stuck in already, you can also find staking options directly through Ledger Live.\n\nVia the discover feature, you can fund a validator and earn rewards with Kiln. Or you could even take part in Liquid Ethereum staking with Lido.\n\nThe Ethereum Network is at your fingertips through the power of the Ledger Ecosystem. Firstly, you can also access countless blockchain apps directly through Ledger Live. Through this single app, you can access countless web3 services to help you with staking, trading, and lending crypto \u2013 and even managing NFTs.\n\nSecondly, Ledger devices help you protect any value you accrue. Ledger devices keep your private keys offline, and therefore your assets secure. Not only that, these hardware wallets offer you full custody over your belongings. This means that no matter what happens to any service you use, or even to Ledger itself, you still have control over your assets, and thus your Ethereum network experience."

        "content": "A recent report by on-chain data analysis platform, Santiment, shows that the two most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), are actively being pulled from cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance.\n\nAccording to Santiment, crypto holders are moving their assets from custodial centralized exchanges to cold storage wallets where they have control of the coins\u2019 private keys.\n\nPrivate keys are important seed phrases for signing transactions, sufficient proof that the sender owns coins.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1659830319724519425?s=20\n\nOn-chain data shows that the supply of these two major cryptocurrencies on leading crypto trading platforms has been decreasing and shifting to self-custody.\n\nSpecifically, the amount of bitcoin on crypto exchanges stands at 5.84%, the lowest level since December 2017. Meanwhile, ethereum on exchanges is at 10.1%, a 8-year low and a level last recorded during the mining of the Ethereum genesis block in July 2015.\n\nIn hard numbers, only 1.1m of the 18.3m BTC in circulation are held in exchanges. Similarly, only 12.1m ETH are on centralized crypto trading platforms.\n\nYou might also like: MicroStrategy bitcoin holdings keep growing: what it means for crypto\n\nRun on exchanges may be precursor to bull market\n\nSantiment also noted that while coin outflow from centralized ramps is not a perfect indicator, it does point to potential bull runs.\n\nEven so, bulls need to hold on until the two digital assets play out over time.\n\nFurthermore, it may illustrate a growing need for investors to have complete control over their crypto holdings and provide assurance that they are secure, given the distrust for exchanges caused by the collapse of FTX last year.\n\nIn March, withdrawals from Binance,the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, skyrocketed following a recent spat between the crypto exchange and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nSince September 2022, crypto investors have been moving coins in droves to self-custody addresses. The process was accelerated in November 2022 following the disastrous collapse of FTX. The failure of the now-defunct exchange eroded user trust in centralized platforms.\n\nPresently, some investors appear to be hurrying to transfer their holdings from Binance to cold wallets after the CFTC threatened to sue the exchange for allegedly breaking local trading laws.\n\nAccording to media reports, Binance clients pulled out $400m in the 24 hours following the CFTC\u2019s statement.\n\nParallel data further revealed that Binance users withdrew about $850m from the platform in the 12 hours preceding the CFTC issue.\n\n1/ Large on-chain movements prior to the Binance indictment\n\n\n\nA few hours before the Binance CFTC Indictment, there were large stablecoin withdrawals across centralized exchanges, totaling almost $1.5B in just 12 hours\n\n\n\nNotably, Binance itself saw an $850M outflow. pic.twitter.com/yLD7f1cgmB \u2014 An Ape's Prologue (@apes_prologue) March 27, 2023\n\nEarlier, Binance had to deal with significant withdrawal requests in Q4 2022. This is after federal prosecutors in the United States said they could launch money laundering charges against the ramp.\n\nDespite fears, the exchange didn\u2019t fail on their withdrawal obligations and completed all transactions without incident.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, dismissed assuaged user fears that all claims were a plot to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market.\n\nRead more: US presidential candidate accepts campaign donations in bitcoin\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe news earlier this week that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, and its CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, could have rocked crypto markets.\n\nInstead, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum briefly wobbled after the news broke on Monday, then recovered. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 3% over the past week to $28,410 as of Saturday morning, and Ethereum (ETH) is up 4.2% to $1,825.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies are in the same boat, with no substantial change in either direction over the last seven days, but two names posted hefty rallies: Stellar (XLM) leaped 22% and currently trades at nearly $0.11, while XRP blew up 20% to $0.53 thanks to \"investor hope\" among the XRP army that Ripple's endless case with the SEC might go Ripple's way.\n\nThe CFTC is the United States\u2019 leading derivatives regulator. According to the lawsuit filed with a Chicago federal court, the federal agency accuses Binance of unauthorized derivatives trading by offering futures, swaps, and options on many leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe suit claims the exchange is offering these services to U.S. clientele despite not having registered with the regulator. It added: \u201cBinance has taken a calculated, phased approach to increase its United States presence despite publicly stating its purported intent to \u2018block\u2019 or \u2018restrict\u2019 customers located in the United States from accessing its platform.\u201d\n\nOther allegations in the suit accuse the exchange of having insufficient anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, knowingly evading or helping U.S. clients evade regulators, and, rather damningly, trading against its own customers.\n\nFor its part, Binance told Decrypt on Monday that the lawsuit is: \u201cunexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years.\u201d\n\nCoin politics\n\nOn Wednesday the state of Texas introduced Senate Bill 1751, a bill that seeks to protect the state\u2019s grid during peak electricity loads, but the proposal could mean that local mining operations may soon lack the incentives that have made the state an attractive location for miners.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bill restricts Bitcoin miners from participating in a state-run demand response program that rewards miners for giving power back to the grid at peak times.\n\nIt also blocks \"virtual currency mining from tax abatements given that the large scale of growth in virtual currency mining is already projected to occur in the state,\u201d according to the bill\u2019s sponsor Senator Lois Kolkhorst during Tuesday's testimony, who argued there\u2019s no need to subsidize the growth.\n\nThat same day U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler testified at the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government and said that rules for making crypto compliant already exist\u2014in response to repeated calls by the industry for clearer guidelines\u2014but that the industry is still \u201crife with noncompliance.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, Gensler stuck to his guns in reiterating his belief that most cryptocurrencies are unlicensed securities: \u201cFrankly, of the ten or twelve thousand tokens, there are very few that don\u2019t have a group of entrepreneurs in the middle that the public is counting on. Those are securities under the securities law.\u201d\n\nFinally, across the pond, the Bank of England\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) lead Katie Fortune said that CBDC\u2019s can be a \u201cbridging asset\u201d between TradFi and crypto.\n\nCBDC\u2019s are an envisioned form of centrally-issued cryptocurrency pegged and backed by the state currency, in this case, a digital sterling.\n\nIn a talk at the Citi Digital Money Symposium, she said: \u201cWhat you have today is, I have a Santander account, I can go to a cash machine and take out the same cash my friend with a Barclays account takes out. I think that could be really powerful in a world of stablecoins and other digital forms of money to have a central bank digital currency that can be a bridging asset between all these different forms of money.\""

        "title": "DeFi TVL Bounces Back Even as Active Users Decline in Q1 - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "Ethereum and its Layer2 ecosystem took the lead.\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nTotal assets deposited in decentralized finance rebounded this past quarter, despite the number of daily users slumping by double-digits.\n\nDeFi\u2019s TVL rose by over 37% in three months to tag $83.3B while the number of unique wallets interacting with DeFi applications each day fell by nearly 15% over the same period, compared with a 10% drop in web3 dapp users overall, according to DappRadar\u2019s Q1 2023 Industry Report.\n\nThe report noted increasing interest in scaling platforms and the price of ETH contributed to the growth in the TVL.\n\nThe rise in popularity of scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Fantom, and Optimism have contributed to the rise in DeFi TVL, DappRadar said, with the much-expected Arbitrum airdrop as one of the main drivers for trading activity.\n\nThe failing of U.S. banks and subsequent USDC de-pegging led to a TVL drop of just under 10%. But the market stabilized quickly after depositors were able to recover their funds.\n\nUsers Converge On Ethereum\n\nEthereum and its Layer 2 ecosystem grew at at the expense of rival Layer 1s networks in the past quarter. Ethereum has strengthened its position as the leading smart contracts platform, accounting for 67% of total DeFi TVL.\n\nDaily active users on Ethereum grew 55% to 126,000 from 81,000 quarter-over-quarter, while Polygon users increased 25% to 197,000 and Arbitrum users proliferated 125% to 46,000. Ethereum now represents two-thirds of DeFi TVL.\n\nThe spike in L2 activity was driven by anticipation for Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop and the mainnet beta launch of Polygon ZkEVM, Polygon\u2019s new zero-knowledge rollup. However, the daily user base for Optimism, the second-largest L2 by TVL, shrank 21% to 26,000 in Q1, despite its TVL surging 85% over the same period.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, BNB Chain daily users fell 28% to 449,000, while Solana posted a 40% decline to 74,000, and Eos slumped 22% to 27,000.\n\nBNB Chain accounts for nearly 21% of DeFi TVL. BNB Chain\u2019s top dApp, PancakeSwap, is the most popular DeFi protocol with 1.37M wallets interacting with it in March.\n\nNFTs Bounce Back\n\nNonfungible tokens were among the strongest performing web3 sectors of the past quarter, with trade volume rocketing to $4.7B after bottoming out at $1.9B during Q4 2022. The total number of sales also increased by 8.5%.\n\nDappRadar noted the liquidity mining rewards offered by the upstart marketplace, Blur, likely inflated volumes at the start of the year. Blur drove $2.7B in trades for the quarter, compared to OpenSea\u2019s nearly $1.5B.\n\n\u201cWhile Blur\u2019s rise to dominance is impressive, the marketplace needs to be careful in how it manages its user base and perceives its loyalty,\u201d the report said. \u201cToken farming is not a new concept, and it would be a mistake for Blur to presume that the wallets driving its phenomenal rise right now will do anything but jump ship if another platform offers them a better financial incentive to do so.\u201d\n\nNearly 90% of NFT sales volume took place on Ethereum, followed by Solana, Polygon, and Immutable X.\n\nThe CryptoPunks NFT collection enjoyed a spike in volume of more than 10 times, driving $241M worth of sales. Collections from Yuga Labs represented more than a third of total NFT volume.\n\nNFT applications hosted 8% of total dApp users, posting a slight increase of 0.2% compared to Q4 2022."

        "title": "What is Staking? Crypto's Most Common 'Passive Income' Strategy Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Crypto Staking is one of the blockchain industry\u2019s most misunderstood concepts. Staking has become a buzzword that entices holders and investors to lock up their tokens with the promise of generous passive income and crypto rewards.\n\nMany staking reward contracts and platforms don\u2019t technically offer any staking at all. You can\u2019t stake Bitcoin (BTC), for example, so take care around any provider who tells you it\u2019s possible.\n\nCrypto staking is a broad topic, with different blockchain networks living by slightly different staking rules. What is true for Ethereum (ETH) staking is not set in stone on Cardano (ADA).\n\nWith the SEC cracking down on crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase over their staking programs, there\u2019s never been a better time to revisit the basics.\n\nWhat is staking in cryptocurrency? What on earth does Proof-of-Stake even mean and what are the risks?\n\nWhat Is Crypto Staking?\n\nStaking cryptocurrency is a popular way to earn passive income on your digital assets. Many crypto investors like to see it as a kind of savings account, where you can earn an attractive APY (annual percentage yield) by staking coins.\n\nDespite the inherent volatility of the crypto market, staking helps holders grow their crypto investment over a long period of time. They don\u2019t need to actively trade or inject fresh capital into their portfolio to increase their exposure.\n\nBut as the saying goes: \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u2019\n\nWhere do these generous interest rates and seemingly endless staking rewards come from?\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is, unfortunately, not a group of friends that tell you whether or not your beef is rare or medium-rare. It\u2019s the process used by several blockchains to secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nGenerally, a network validator is someone who locks up staking coins to a blockchain to help decentralize the network and verify transactions. For ensuring the security of the network and producing new blocks, validators earn staking rewards. These rewards are generally new tokens entering the supply based on the network\u2019s emission schedule.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work blockchain, like Bitcoin, miners solve complex computational puzzles to compete for the right to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. This is why successful Bitcoin miners consume so much energy.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nTo give you an idea of just how much energy a PoW chain uses, Ethereum reduced its consumption by 99% after transitioning to a PoS consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, PoS chains randomly select a validator for each new block. This process uses considerably less energy than PoW and incentivizes crypto investors to stake more crypto assets, increasing their chances of winning the staking reward.\n\nThis exercise is a win-win, the blockchain attracts a greater variety of stakers and decentralizes network operation, while stakers earn cryptocurrency rewards and help support the ecosystem.\n\nHow Much Cryptocurrency Can I Earn Through Staking Rewards?\n\nCryptocurrency staking interest rates vary between different blockchains, providers and lock-up periods. Generally speaking, rewards fluctuate between 4-18% APY. Sites like StakingRewards.com aggregate data to tell us where the best pure staking opportunities are. However, it doesn\u2019t include options from centralized exchanges.\n\nIn some cases, cryptocurrency exchanges will offer staking rewards at boosted rates to entice holders to lock-up their staking coins for longer periods of time.\n\nFor example, this crypto exchange is offering 35% APY if we\u2019re willing to lock up our Cosmos (ATOM) tokens for 120 days, but just 1% for a flexible deposit.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Staking?\n\nLike in every corner of the crypto space, staking comes with its own risks. For example, if you\u2019ve delegated your tokens to a bad validator, you might be at risk of \u2018slashing.\u2019 Slashing is a defense mechanism used by staking protocols to ensure that validators are behaving properly and fulfilling their tasks.\n\nIf a PolkaDot (DOT) validator is misbehaving and running malicious software, its stake is at risk of being \u2018slashed.\u2019 If this happens, a portion of their stake is forcibly removed and given to the protocol treasury.\n\nEach network and staking protocol has its own slashing rules, so if you\u2019re running a validator it\u2019s worth checking what might put you at risk.\n\nOther risks include loss of value due to price volatility. If you\u2019ve locked up your staking coins for a long period of time, you might find yourself unable to sell quickly in case of a black swan event.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nRemember when LUNA crashed from $80 to a few cents in a few days? Thanks to the 14 day unlock period, thousands of LUNA stakers could do nothing but watch their holdings burn to the ground before their eyes.\n\nThe same goes for those who stake their coins through centralized exchanges. When FTX collapsed, anyone staking their crypto through FTX staking pools had zero access to their assets.\n\nCrypto Staking Myths and Misconceptions\n\nLike any misunderstood crypto topic, there is plenty of misinformation that can lead you astray. Some of this confusion is centered around the definition of staking drifting away from its original purpose and being loosely applied to any circumstance where you deposit tokens in exchange for rewards.\n\nLet\u2019s shed light on some of these misconceptions.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake My Tokens in DeFi Apps to Earn Other Tokens\u201d\n\nWhile you can deposit certain tokens in DeFi apps, like liquidity farms, to earn other tokens, this isn\u2019t technically staking. In this example, PancakeSwap says we can earn tokens by staking their native CAKE token in staking pools.\n\nWhat we\u2019re actually doing here is depositing CAKE into a smart contract and earning emissions of other tokens. We\u2019re not helping to secure the non-existent CAKE blockchain. DeFi apps like PancakeSwap offer these \u2018staking pools\u2019 because it brings utility and demand to the CAKE token.\n\n\u201cStaking My Tokens Means I Don\u2019t Control Them Anymore\u201d\n\nIn many cases, staking cryptocurrency means delegating them to a validator who uses them on your behalf. However some networks, like Cardano, don\u2019t follow this rule.\n\nStaked ADA never leaves your crypto wallet, making it one of the most secure staking protocols in the market.\n\n\u201cStaking Rewards Are Fixed and Accurate\u201d\n\nJust because staking emissions are fixed and regular, doesn\u2019t guarantee that your validator will be randomly selected and receive their estimated rewards. This is a question of statistics more than anything, so if you\u2019re staking long term, you probably won\u2019t even notice.\n\nSource: Solana Docs\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that staking APY doesn\u2019t take into account token inflation and emissions. For example, Solana\u2019s token inflationary emission rate means that SOL\u2019s supply increases by anywhere from 1.5-5% each year.\n\nEven though you might be earning 6-8% APY by staking SOL, the supply is still inflating and potentially losing value. Some crypto enthusiasts prefer to calculate their staking rewards by subtracting a tokens inflation rate from the original APY.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake NFTs to Earn Crypto Tokens\u201d\n\nLike PancakeSwap, this is a liberal use of the phrase \u2018Stake.\u2019 Yes, you can deposit your Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT into a smart contract to earn $APE tokens, but you\u2019re not helping anyone secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nCyberkongz earn $BANANA, DeGods earn $DUST, Neo Tokyo Citizens earn $BYTES, the list goes on. Why do so many NFT collections do this?\n\nDepositing NFTs in staking contracts takes them off the market and makes the available supply look scarcer. A collection with only 2% of its total supply listed looks like a much more desirable asset than a collection with 20% of its pieces up for sale.\n\nCrypto Staking Pros and Cons\n\nCryptocurrency staking is a pretty nuanced subject, with a lot of moving parts and specific rules. To make it easier to wrap your head around why staking might be interesting to you specifically, here are the benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nPassive Income \u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.\n\n\u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.

This also helps to distribute ownership and governance of the chain itself. Increase token scarcity \u2013 Staking cryptocurrency takes your coins off the market and reduces the number of tokens available for buyers. In a bullish market scenario, this creates a good environment for price appreciation.\n\nCons\n\nLock up periods \u2013 To get the juiciest staking rewards, you\u2019ll usually need to lock up your tokens for a long period of time. This is problematic if you find yourself needing to sell quickly\n\n\u2013 To get the juiciest staking rewards, you\u2019ll usually need to lock up your tokens for a long period of time. This is problematic if you find yourself needing to sell quickly Relinquish full control of your funds \u2013 In most cases, staking means you need to deposit your crypto into a staking contract. To be honest, this sounds a lot scarier than it really is. Slashing and validator hacks are uncommon, and operators have a vested interest in the security of the chain they\u2019re validating.\n\nHow Can I Start Staking My Cryptocurrency?\n\nAlmost every crypto exchange under the sun offers staking in some shape or form. If you want to get started with crypto staking for the first time, this is by far the easiest method.\n\nYour preferred crypto exchange should have an \u2018Earn\u2019 section where you can browse available staking subscriptions. All you need to do is search for the crypto you\u2019d like to stake and choose a lock-up period that you\u2019re happy with.\n\nRunning your own validator is a different story. This can be quite complicated, especially if you don\u2019t have a background in development. The best place to start looking for answers is in the developer documents of the blockchain of your choice.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCrypto staking, like any financial growth strategy, has its risks. Everyone loves getting free cryptocurrency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should trust everything at face value. Take care when choosing your staking provider.\n\nAs explained above, the term \u2018Staking\u2019 has drifted away from its technical definition. These days, staking is used to describe most circumstances where you deposit digital assets in exchange for some kind of token reward, rather than contributing to a Proof-of-Stake network.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nStaking your cryptocurrency helps decentralize and support your favorite blockchain ecosystem while rewarding you with tokens. It\u2019s important to understand what staking is and how it works to ensure that you\u2019re \u2018putting your crypto to work\u2019 safely.\n\nFAQs"

He pointed out that, going back to the 1920s, there has not been a generation as committed to the \"Buy the dip\" (BTFD) strategy as the one we are witnessing today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy, which involves purchasing assets during temporary market declines, has brought the biggest profits to investors since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn simple terms, the BTFD strategy encourages investors to view market downturns as opportunities to accumulate more of an asset at a lower price, with the expectation that the asset will eventually rebound and appreciate in value. This approach has gained significant traction among investors in recent years, particularly in the context of the strong performance of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nGoing back to the 1920s, there has been no BTFD generation like you. Congratulations. pic.twitter.com/iAGN0CqmjD \u2014 Cassandra B.C. (@michaeljburry) March 30, 2023\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the BTFD strategy has been highly lucrative for investors since the 1920s, with buying the S&P 500 Index during drawdowns proving to be one of the most profitable strategies of the past century. This suggests that the current generation of investors has been highly successful in capitalizing on market fluctuations and leveraging them to their advantage.\n\nInterestingly, Burry also admitted that he was wrong when he advised his followers to sell in February. Usually, the Buy the Dip strategy is recommended for beginner investors who are not able to follow sophisticated macroeconomic reports or learn technical analysis. However, it has proven to be an efficient strategy for those who are willing to accumulate assets instead of trying to catch short-term gains."

        "title": "The Power of The Crypto Community! How Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogetti Are Thriving Through Community Support - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Revolutionary Meme Coin Presale Dogetti (DETI) has announced an upcoming community challenge on Twitter! With the community in mind, its worth trying to understand why community is such an important part of Dogetti\u2019s goals, as well as why community support is necessary for the success of a project as a whole by taking a look at two top altcoins that owe a lot of their achievements to the community, Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Community\n\nAs the biggest blockchain network in the world and the second highest ranking crypto on the market, Ethereum has always been a huge project that attracts many to it. Regardless of its recognisability, it actually has proven utility that stretches across multiple different projects as the host to most of the other coins alongside its own native Ether. On top of that, it has acted as inspiration for all of the blockchain network and protocol projects that have followed it such as Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC). With such a necessary function that has led to a substantial amount of the market\u2019s growth, Ethereum would\u2019ve likely been a high-ranking project anyway, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten to where it is today without its community.\n\nWith a dedicated community hub that allows the hundreds of thousands of crypto enthusiasts involved in Ethereum to communicate and take part in the improvement of the network, Ethereum has managed to consistently make improvements based on its users\u2019 wants and needs. The team also regularly interacts with the community, creating a real sense of personal connection.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s Community\n\nLitecoin is a crypto that has had an interesting journey regarding its growth towards becoming the strongest Bitcoin fork available. On the market for over a decade and regularly moving up and down in the top 20 ranked crypto, Litecoin has proven itself to be a success but at times struggles to remain stable. Despite this, its community sticks beside it throughout it all. As a peer-to-peer platform, personal involvement is inherent to its functionality, which is why the community continue to work together to keep it strong. This has especially worked out so far this year, with Litecoin experiencing multiple spikes over the past few months.\n\nDogetti\u2019s Community\n\nIf you take anything from the Dogetti presale, it is that community is the MOST important thing to the project. Calling its community the \u201cDogetti Family\u201d, the team wants to instil a shared feeling of real comradery among the members of it, where they all work together to send Dogetti to the top of the meme coin space. Both owned and controlled by this community, they will have a say in every move that is made to make sure this vision becomes a reality. In return, 6% of the overall token supply will be redistributed, with 2% of that being extra tokens given to holders simply for being members of the community!\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Shanghai Upgrade may not simplify staking on Ethereum \u2013 InfStones fills the gap, allows users to increase computing power with APIs and cloud-based nodes\n\nDALLAS, Texas, April. 12th, 2023 at 8:00 am \u2013 Today, InfStones, a leading blockchain infrastructure provider offering scalable PaaS, announced the release of its highly secure Ethereum validator service, designed to arrive just in time to serve the growing needs that will arise as a result of Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade which is currently expected to take place in April 2023.\n\nimage.png\n\nWith more than 16.4 million ETH currently staked on the Ethereum network, the eagerly awaited Shanghai upgrade aims to inspire numerous users who previously harbored reservations about participating in ETH staking to get involved. This software upgrade is designed to enable stakers to finally withdraw their ETH and all accumulated rewards, spanning the past three years since the pivotal Beacon Chain launch when Ethereum formally started the transition away from its original Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). Up until this point, ETH stakers have had the ability to stake their ETH directly on the network without being able to unstake their tokens.\n\nInfStones aims to address the heightened market demand for staking on Ethereum that will be spurred by the Shanghai upgrade. Recognizing the potential impact of the upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem, InfStones is committed to offering a seamless and secure staking experience, allowing users to benefit from the network\u2019s expanded capabilities. By providing a cutting-edge, feature-rich platform that simplifies the staking process, InfStones aims to empower a wider range of participants to join the Ethereum network while fostering increased decentralization and contributing to the overall growth and success of the Ethereum community.\n\nWhile the Shanghai hard fork will enable the unstaking of locked assets on Ethereum, one important technical issue still remains, which InfStones is helping to address with its validator service \u2013 Ethereum has not yet solved its scalability problem. This has led to many technical bottlenecks in the past, and will continue to be a significant barrier in the future. Institutional entities who intend on either setting up thousands of new validators or withdrawing their funds by closing all their existing validators will probably be doing so one at a time. In addition, most of the popular ETH staking platforms are both centralized and custodial, which goes against the Ethereum protocol\u2019s vision of decentralization that it was intended to support.\n\nHow InfStones works\n\nInfStones\u2019 cutting-edge validator service presents an elegant solution to these challenges and will enable an optimal user experience for staking on Ethereum after the Shanghai Upgrade. By harnessing APIs and cloud-based nodes, it amplifies users\u2019 computational capabilities. The sophisticated scalability platform delivers exceptional throughput and decentralization, tapping into the strength of over 80 interconnected blockchains. This ensures unparalleled uptime and network stability, while empowering users to operate their own nodes and independently confirm and verify transactions after utilizing the setup service. The robust blockchain infrastructure provided by InfStones effectively eliminates bottlenecks arising from heavy traffic on Ethereum during peak periods of staking withdrawals or concurrent blockchain transactions.\n\nOne-click setup\n\nAs the longest-running validator service provider in the global market, InfStones boasts an impressive track record of operating Ethereum validators for over 19,000 consecutive hours and counting. To stake ETH on the InfStones platform, users can effortlessly set up their own validator node with the simple click of a button. The platform is crafted to enable a seamless experience with minimal need for customer support. However, a dedicated and experienced customer service team stands ready to assist 24/7, should any issues arise. Upon the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, users will be able to conveniently withdraw all of their ETH staked through the InfStones platform at any time by the simple click of a button.\n\nBatch up to 1000 validators\n\nThe InfStones platform caters to large, institutional entities by offering the capability to batch up to 1,000 validators for ETH staking in a single click. Upholding a high standard of security and trust, InfStones never gains access to users\u2019 wallets. Instead, it establishes a direct connection to the smart contracts that facilitate staking, ensuring a seamless non-custodial and secure experience for all participants.\n\nStake less than the current minimum of 32 ETH\n\nMany platforms require a minimum of 32 ETH (presently valued at approximately $53,000 USD) to partake in ETH staking. However, following the Shanghai Upgrade, InfStones will accommodate staking amounts below this threshold. By offering this flexibility, InfStones opens the door for participants with less than 32 ETH to join the Ethereum PoS network as well.\n\nCommenting on InfStones\u2019 Ethereum validator service, Founder and CEO Dr. Zhenwu Shi remarked, \u201cOur Ethereum validator service enables anyone to securely launch Ethereum validator nodes for staking purposes with just a few effortless clicks.\u201d\n\nUsers staking ETH through InfStones\u2019 validator service retain complete control over their tokens at all times, thanks to the utilization of non-custodial wallets for staking on the InfStones platform and the absence of a centralized token pool. Additionally, users can access detailed reports of all their validators and reward details around the clock.\n\nProminent Web3 industry leaders such as Binance, Lido, imToken, and Gate place their trust in InfStones\u2019 Ethereum validator service. With more than 20,000 Ethereum validators already established and a flawless record of zero slashes, the company has garnered significant support, previously securing over $110 million in funding from top-tier investors like Softbank and GGV Capital."
