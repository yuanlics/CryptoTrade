        "title": "Ethereum price pinned below $1.9K, and data suggests it's unlikely to change in short\u2013term - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price has been stuck below $1,920 for the past 16 days, which is especially concerning since the latest breakout attempt on May 6 lasted less than 24 hours. Excluding this brief price pump, Ether\u2019s (ETH) journey below $1,920 was initiated on April 21, over 30 days ago.\n\nOne can likely blame the Ethereum network\u2019s $8.80 average transaction fee for investors\u2019 diminished appetite, but the macroeconomic environment has also played an important role. On May 22, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said it is impossible to predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, designed to curb inflation.\n\nAs CNN reported, Dimon added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the United States debt ceiling standoff between Joe Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress is the probable cause for the worsening sentiment among institutional investors toward cryptocurrencies. According to CoinShares\u2019 latest \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows Report,\" outflows across digital asset investment products hit $232 million over the past five weeks.\n\nFurthermore, there are two indicators that impact Ether\u2019s price and signal reduced demand for its decentralized finance ecosystem, in addition to weak leverage buying activity from professional traders.\n\nTotal Ethereum deposits are stable, but there\u2019s a catch\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s limited processing capabilities have been causing high gas fees, which greatly reduces the demand for smart contract usage. For the past five weeks, the average transaction fee has remained above $8, although at first sight, no impact was felt.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in the network remained stable at 15.1 million ETH versus four weeks prior, but it is nearing the lowest levels since August 2020. As a comparison, the TVL on the BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while TRX (TRX) deposits on the Tron network declined by 12%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain flips Ethereum\u2019s lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum has historically been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, but it all changed in the week ending May 21.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s DEX market share drastically dropped from a 75.5% peak on March 5 to 22.3% on May 21. Meanwhile, BNB Smart Chain was the biggest beneficiary, growing to 61.1% from 5.6%.\n\nThe number of active addresses interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) is also in a slump. Over the last 30 days, the top 12 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 11% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the high transaction costs.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nData shows drop leverage traders using derivatives\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 4 to 8% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, Ether professional traders have avoided leveraged longs (bullish bets) for the past four weeks. Moreover, not even the brief rally toward $2,000 on May 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bullish sentiment.\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal bearishness \u2014 namely, the record-low DEX market share, the declining addresses engaging with DApps and a lack of leveraged buying demand.\n\nMaybe investors were expecting some kind of announcement out of Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin\u2019s appearance at Edcon 2023 in Montenegro, which wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 the fact is there\u2019s no imminent driver to justify a sustainable rally above $1,920 in the short term.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin urges caution when it comes to re-staking on Ethereum - The Block",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about overcomplicating the Ethereum consensus mechanism beyond its original design, specifically in terms of re-staking.\n\nIn a new blog post, Buterin voiced reservations about initiatives that could unnecessarily introduce risks into the ecosystem and complicate the roles of Ethereum validators beyond their primary duty of verifying the core protocol rules. Buterin was concerned about re-staking, a mechanism being developed by Eigen Layer, among others, which broadens the responsibilities of Ethereum validators to include securing external chains. He was worried that re-staking might introduce risks that could affect the safety of the network.\n\n\u201cWe should tread lightly when application-layer projects aim to extend the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus beyond the validation of essential Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin stated in the post.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model, validators are selected based on the number of ether they hold and are willing to stake. The network has the largest validator set among all proof-of-stake chains, both in terms of the number of validator entities and the total value of staked ether, some 18 million ETH (~$34 billion). This considerable size has prompted the development of systems to leverage this network security to secure third-party chains. However, Buterin advocated for a cautious approach.\n\nThe risk of re-staking\n\nButerin noted that while re-staking can be used for low-risk purposes, there are situations where it could compromise the mainnet\u2019s security, such as when Ethereum validators face slashing on third-party chains. Slashing is a punitive measure for validators who engage in undesirable activities, like improperly maintaining their stake or incorrectly processing transactions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\u201cWe should instead preserve the chain\u2019s minimalism and support uses of re-staking that do not seem like slippery slopes towards extending the role of Ethereum consensus,\u201d Buterin suggested.\n\nButerin\u2019s comments elicited responses from Sreeram Kannan, co-founder of Eigen Layer. Kannan agreed with Buterin\u2019s analysis and acknowledged that Eigen Layer should avoid building complex financial primitives with the help of re-staking, as they \u201ccan spiral out of control.\u201d Nevertheless, he stated that re-staking can be used for \u201clow-risk\u201d scenarios.\n\nKannan agreed that Eigen Layer can extend the functionality of validators beyond Ethereum but said these should be developed without the need for \u201cslashing,\u201d which would introduce unnecessary complexity. He further emphasized that Eigen Layer is cautious about not impacting Ethereum\u2019s security in any way, aligning with Buterin\u2019s blog post.\n\nButerin discussed a 2015 proposal from Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis, for an \u201cultimate oracle,\u201d deriving security from ETH stake. In the context of smart contracts, oracles are vital as they supply off-chain data. However, Buterin said that if the security of these data feeds were intertwined with Ethereum\u2019s stake, it might contribute to increased complexity.\n\nButerin suggested that such expanded roles or \u201cduties\u201d added to Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism could magnify the challenges and risks involved in operating as a validator. He emphasized, \u201cValidators are required to exert significant human effort in terms of monitoring, running, and updating additional software to ensure their adherence to any newly implemented protocols.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Death Sentence: Fact or Fiction?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike have been buzzing with rumors that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is on the verge of collapse.\n\nSome skeptics claim that the Ethereum network\u2019s high gas fees and scalability issues have rendered it obsolete, while others believe that Ethereum\u2019s future remains bright.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look closer at Ethereum\u2019s current state and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe Controversy Surrounding Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nEthereum has been a hot topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community lately. The network\u2019s scalability issues have resulted in high gas fees, making it difficult for small investors to participate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has also been criticized for inefficiency. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that the network\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) will address these issues and ensure its longevity.\n\nDuring the cryptocurrency frenzy, skeptics are raising eyebrows and questioning the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe debate heats up with critics voicing concerns about their viability, potential manipulation, environmental impact, and outdated technology.\n\nDiscover the eight reasons why some experts believe these digital assets may become relics and explore the emerging alternatives that could reshape the investment landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum\u2019s PoW algorithm requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. This process consumes significant energy and has been criticized for contributing to climate change.\n\nEthereum 2.0, the network\u2019s upcoming upgrade, will transition to PoS, eliminating the need for miners and reducing energy consumption. PoS allows network participants to secure the network by staking their cryptocurrency, with rewards proportional to their stake.\n\nIs Ethereum dead?\n\nDespite the criticism surrounding Ethereum, the network remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s decentralization and its role as a platform for decentralized applications (dapps) have contributed to its popularity.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have made it difficult for small investors and dapp developers to use the network. The network\u2019s scalability issues have also resulted in slower transaction times, further hindering its adoption.\n\nWhat the Experts Say About Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nSource: Business Today\n\nMany experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, despite its current challenges.\n\nThe network\u2019s transition to PoS will improve its scalability and energy efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nThe Relationship Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, Ethereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supporters argue that its versatility and potential for innovation make it a more valuable asset than Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage and wider adoption have contributed to its dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum vs. Competitors: Where Does Ethereum Stand?\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms, including Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Cardano.\n\nWhile these platforms offer similar functionality to Ethereum, they have different approaches to scalability and consensus.\n\nBinance Smart Chain, for example, uses a delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, while Cardano uses a proof of stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that its established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential for long-term growth\n\nDespite its current challenges, Ethereum\u2019s potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS is expected to improve its energy efficiency and scalability, making it more accessible to small investors and dapp developers.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for DeFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023? Examining the Possibilities\n\nPredicting the future of any cryptocurrency is challenging, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and the continued development of the network\u2019s infrastructure could lead to a significant recovery in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, the growing adoption of DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens. While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s potential for growth remains strong.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in the Crypto Market\n\nEthereum is pivotal in the cryptocurrency market, serving as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The network\u2019s versatility and potential for innovation have attracted significant investment and development, making it a valuable asset for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for the network\u2019s associated tokens, further increasing their value.\n\nConclusion: Is Ethereum Dead?\n\nIn conclusion, are Ethereum and Bitcoin dead? Not really.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, its potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in developing DeFi and NFTs could significantly increase demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nAs such, ETH\u2019s future remains bright despite the rumors of Ethereum being dead."

        "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technology is witnessing renewed worldwide and cross-industry interest sparked by the release of ChatGPT, the text-based AI platform has proven its worth in analyzing the cryptocurrency market to provide insights into the future price trends of assets such as Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn this context, Finbold has asked ChatGPT to share its predictions on the potential trading range of Ethereum by the end of 2023, and after dutifully stating that it could not predict future prices, it has provided multiple factors that could affect ETH price by the year\u2019s end.\n\nFactors affecting ETH price\n\nSpecifically, as for some of these factors, ChatGPT has singled out the overall sentiment and perception of Ethereum within the crypto community and general market, arguing that \u201cpositive sentiment, increased adoption, and growing interest from investors may potentially drive the price higher.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the AI chatbot explained that \u201cthe development and implementation of new features, upgrades, and improvements to the Ethereum network can impact its price,\u201d such as the Ethereum 2.0 update, as well as highlighted the influence of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nChatGPT on Bitcoin affecting Ethereum price. Source: ChatGPT\n\nOn top of that, ChatGPT said that Ethereum had \u201ca large and active community of developers, users, and supporters,\u201d the growth of which, along with the continued development of decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform, could also positively impact the price.\n\nAccording to the AI language model, other influential factors include regulatory changes and government policies related to cryptocurrencies, economic conditions and geopolitical events, as well as social media platforms, news articles, and influential figures within the crypto space.\n\nAI ETH price prediction\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto price prediction platform CoinPriceForecast has been able to deliver specific figures on the possible price of Ethereum for the coming years, including by the end of 2023, with the current projection standing at $2,142, which would represent an increase of 15% to the price of the digital asset as of May 23.\n\nEthereum 2023 price projection. Source: CoinPriceForecast\n\nInterestingly, the latest year-end numbers are close to the earlier long-term forecast from February 2023, when the same platform placed the price of Ethereum at $2,146 by the end of 2023, although the mid-year figures were a lot more bullish, as Finbold reported on February 23.\n\nMore recently, in April, a poll of 32 fintech and crypto experts projected that the price of Ethereum could reach its peak in 2023 at around $2,758. However, after that, they expect the price to start dropping again in the second half of 2023, sinking to the still bullish $2,342 by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently trading hands at the price of $1,856, recording an increase of 2.18% in the last 24 hours and a 2.13% gain over the previous seven days, as it moves to reverse the 0.84% decline on its monthly chart. Since the year\u2019s start, ETH has grown 54.56%.\n\nEthereum year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Ethereum truly manages to push toward the projected price by the end of 2023 will, indeed, depend on the factors enumerated by ChatGPT, particularly the positive sentiment that could be driven by developments such as record-breaking staking returns after the recent \u2018Shapella\u2019 upgrade.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum's consensus is 'fragile' and should not be stretched - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin warned in a blog post today that Ethereum\u2019s consensus is fragile and should be used \u201csparingly\u201d because of the high risk of forks in the chain.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n\u201cThere is a natural urge to try to extend the blockchain\u2019s core with more and more functionality, because the blockchain\u2019s core has the largest economic weight and the largest community watching it, but each such extention makes the core itself more fragile.\u201d\n\nButerin added that we should be wary of projects that seek to increase the \u201cscope\u201d of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules as this could lead to more \u201cmandates\u201d over time and an increased risk of forking the chain.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has over half a million validators securing the network that have collectively staked 18.5 million ETH, worth more than $34 billion. These validators finalize blocks every 6.4 minutes on the Ethereum network. The process is secured and sophisticated so that the chain recovers to the correct state even if a bug hits or a 51% attack occurs.\n\nStretching the consensus system for other purposes can introduce \u201chigh systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted,\u201d Buterin wrote. He added:\n\n\u201cDual-use of validator staked ETH, while it has some risks, is fundamentally fine, but attempting to \u201crecruit\u201d Ethereum social consensus for your application\u2019s own purposes is not.\u201d\n\nButerin further explained that so long as a protocol kept its losses contained to the validators and users in case of a complete collapse, it is \u201clow-risk.\u201d But, if the protocol is designed in a way that the original Ethereum chain has to fork or reorganize to solve its problems, then it is \u201chigh-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist all attempts to create such expectations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThere could be a middle ground, Buterin suggested, if protocols in the low-risk category incentivize participants to slide into the higher-risk category. He also suggested using SchellingCoin-style techniques, a consensus mechanism where participants are asked to guess the average value of a certain parameter, like price, and those whose guesses are closest to the average are rewarded.\n\nWhat are the risks of extending Ethereum\u2019s consensus?\n\nAccording to Buterin:\n\n\u201cAs soon as a blockchain tries to \u201chook in\u201d to the outside world, the outside world\u2019s conflicts start to impact on the blockchain too.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if Ethereum validators start voting on things like price oracles that include the currency of a country in the middle of a political crisis, it could lead to a split of the Ethereum chain.\n\nButerin added:\n\n\u201c\u2026once a blockchain starts incorporating real-world price indices as a layer-1 protocol feature, it could easily succumb to interpreting more and more real-world information.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, introducing Layer 1 price indices could change blockchains from neutral technical platforms to explicitly financial tools. This, in turn, could attract legal trouble for blockchains, Buterin said.\n\nFurthermore, it is not just price indices that pose a risk. Buterin wrote:"

A decentralized application is called a Dapp (also spelled DAPP, dApp or DApp) for short. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): Ethereum allows you to create these for democratic decision-making.\n\nThese are the most important features of Ethereum and before going deep into the Ethereum tutorial, let\u2019s discuss each of these features in more detail.\n\nEther\n\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency. Basically it is the fuel that runs the network. It is used to pay for the computational resources and the transaction fees for any transaction executed on the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoins, ether is a peer-to-peer currency. Apart from being used to pay for transactions, ether is also used to buy gas, which is used to pay for the computation of any transaction made on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso, if you want to deploy a contract on Ethereum, you will need gas, and you would have to pay for that gas in ether. So gas is the execution fee paid by a user for running a transaction in Ethereum. Ether can be utilized for building decentralized applications, building smart contracts and making standard peer-to-peer payments.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are revolutionizing the way how traditional contracts worked, which is why it is important for you to know about them in this Ethereum tutorial. A smart contract is a simple computer program that facilitates the exchange of any valuable asset between two parties. It could be money, shares, property or any other digital asset that you want to exchange. These contracts can be created by anyone on the Ethereum network. The contract consists primarily of the terms and conditions mutually agreed on between the parties (peers).\n\nThe primary feature of a smart contract is that once it is executed, it cannot be altered, and any transaction done on top of a smart contract is registered permanently\u2014it is immutable. So even if you modify the smart contract in the future, the transactions correlated with the original contract will not get altered; you cannot modify them.\n\nThe verification process for the smart contracts is carried out by anonymous parties of the network without the need for a centralized authority, and that\u2019s what makes any smart contract execution on Ethereum a decentralized execution.\n\nThe transfer of any asset or currency is done in a transparent and trustworthy manner, and the identities of the two entities are secure on the Ethereum network. Once the transaction is successfully done, the accounts of the sender and receiver are updated accordingly, and in this way it generates a trust between the parties.\n\nSmart Contracts vs. Traditional Contract Systems\n\nIn traditional contract systems, you sign an agreement, then you trust and hire a third party for its execution. The problem is that in this type of process, data tampering is possible. With smart contracts, the agreement is coded in a program. The result is not verified by a centralized authority; it is verified by the participants on the Ethereum blockchain-based network. Once a contract is executed, the transaction is registered and cannot be altered or tampered, so it removes the risk of any data manipulation or alteration.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example in which someone named Zack has given a contract of $500 to someone named Elsa for developing his company\u2019s website. The developers code the agreement of the smart contract using Ethereum\u2019s programming language. The smart contract has all the conditions (requirements) for building the website. Once the code is written, it is uploaded and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEVM is a runtime compiler to execute a smart contract. Once the code is deployed on the EVM, every participant on the network has a copy of the contract. When Elsa submits the work on Ethereum for evaluation, each node on the Ethereum network will evaluate and confirm whether the result given by Elsa has been done as per the coding requirements, and once the result is approved and verified, the contract worth $500 will be self-executed and the payment will be paid to Elsa in ether. Zack\u2019s account will be automatically debited, and Elsa will be credited with $500 in ether.\n\nThe Ethereum tutorial video includes a demo on the deployment of a Ethereum smart contract.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\n\nEVM, as mentioned above in this Ethereum tutorial, is designed to operate as a runtime environment for compiling and deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts. Basically, EVM is the engine that understands the language of smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity language for Ethereum. EVM is operated in a sandbox environment\u2014basically, you can deploy your own stand-alone environment, which can act as a testing and development environment, and you can test your smart contract (deploy it) \u201cn\u201d number of times, verify it, and then once you are satisfied with the performance and the functionality of the smart contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum main network.\n\nAny programming language in the smart contract is compiled into the bytecode, which the EVM understands. This bytecode can be read and executed using the EVM. One of the most popular languages for writing a smart contract is Solidity. Once you write your smart contract in Solidity, that contract gets converted into the bytecode and gets deployed on the EVM. And thereby EVM guarantees security from cyberattacks.\n\nHow Does EVM Work?\n\nSuppose person A wants to pay person B 10 ethers. The transaction will be sent to the EVM using a smart contract for a fund transfer from A to B. In order to validate the transaction, the Ethereum network will perform the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nThe miner nodes on Ethereum will validate this transaction\u2014whether the identity of A exists or not, and if A has the requested amount to transfer. Once the transaction is validated, the ether will be debited from A\u2019s wallet and will be credited to B\u2019s wallet, and during this process, the miners will charge a fee to validate this transaction and will earn a reward.\n\nAll the nodes on the Ethereum network execute smart contracts using their respective EVMs.\n\nProof of Work\n\nEvery node in the Ethereum network has:\n\nThe entire history of all the transactions\u2014the entire chain\n\nThe history of the smart contract, which is basically the address at which the smart contract is deployed, along with the transactions associated with the smart contract\n\nThe handle to the current state of the smart contract\n\nThe goal of the miners on the Ethereum network is to validate the blocks. For each block of transaction, miners use their computational power and resources to get the appropriate hash value by varying the nonce. The miners will vary the nonce and pass it through a hashing algorithm\u2014in Ethereum, it is the Ethash algorithm.\n\nThis produces a hash value that should be less than the predefined target as per the proof-of-work consensus. If the hash value generated is less than the target value, then the block is considered to be verified and the miner gets rewarded.\n\nWhen the proof of work is solved, the result is broadcast and shared with all the other nodes in order to update their ledger. If other nodes accept the hashed block as valid, then the block gets added to the Ethereum main blockchain, and as a result the miner receives a reward, which as of today stands at 3 ethers. Plus the miner receives the transaction fees that have been generated for verifying the block. All the transactions that are aggregated in the block\u2014the cumulative transaction fees associated with all the transactions\u2014are also given as a reward to the miner.\n\nProof of Stake\n\nIn Ethereum, a process called proof of stake is also under development. It is an alternative to proof of work, and is meant to be a solution to minimize the use of expensive resources spent for mining using proof of work. In proof of stake, the miner\u2014who is actually the validator\u2014can validate the transactions based on the amount of cryptocoins he or she holds before actually starting the mining. So based on the accumulation of cryptocoins the miner has beforehand, he or she has a higher probability of mining the block. However, proof of stake is not widely used as of now compared to proof of work.\n\nGas\n\nJust like we need fuel to run a car, we need gas to run applications on the Ethereum network. To perform any transaction within the Ethereum network, a user has to make a payment\u2014shell out ethers\u2014in order to get a transaction done, and the intermediary monetary value is called gas. On the Ethereum network, gas is a unit that measures the computational power required to run a smart contract or a transaction. So if you have to do a transaction that updates the blockchain, you would have to shell out gas, and that gas costs ethers.\n\nIn Ethereum, the transaction fees are calculated using a formula (see screenshot below). For every transaction, there is gas and its correlated gas price. The amount of gas required to execute a transaction multiplied by the gas price equals the transaction fees. \u201cGas limit\u201d refers to the amount of gas used for the computation and the amount of ether a user is required to pay for the gas.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the Ethereum network showing the transaction cost. You can see for this particular transaction, the gas limit was 21,000, the gas used by the transaction was 21,000, and the gas price was 21 Gwei, which is the lowest denomination of ether. So 21 Gwei * 21,000 gave the actual transaction fees: 0.000441 ethers, or about 21 cents as of today. As mentioned, the transaction fee goes to the miner who has validated the transaction.\n\nTo understand the gas limit and the gas price, let\u2019s consider an example using a car. Suppose your car has a mileage of 10 kilometers per liter and the price of petrol is $1 per liter. Then driving a car for 50 kilometers would cost you five liters of petrol, which is worth $5. Similarly, to perform an operation or to run code on Ethereum, you need to obtain a certain amount of gas, like the petrol, and the gas has a per-unit price, called gas price.\n\nIf the user provides less than the amount of gas to run a particular operation, then the process will fail and the user will be given the message \u201cout of gas.\u201d And Gwei, as noted above, is the lowest denomination of ether used for measuring a unit of a gas price.\n\nEthereum Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining\n\nThe hashing algorithm is the primary difference between Ethereum mining and Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin uses SHA-256, and Ethereum uses Ethash. The average time taken on Bitcoin for mining a block is 10 minutes, whereas on Ethereum it is 12 to 15 seconds. As of today, the mining reward for Bitcoin is 12.5 bitcoins; for Ethereum it\u2019s 3 ethers plus the transaction fee\u2014the cumulative transaction fees of all the transactions of a block. As of April 10, 2019, the value of 1 bitcoin is $5249.03, whereas 1 ether is $180.89.\n\nHow is Ethereum mining different from Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin Ethereum Hashing Algorithm SHA-256 Ethash Time taken to mine a block An average of 10 minutes An average of 12-15 seconds Reward 12.5 BTC 3 ETH USD - 04/10/2019 1 Bitcoin = 5249.03 1 Ether = 180.89\n\nBelow is a screenshot of an Ethereum reward that has been given to the miner of the block. As you can see, the reward is 3 ethers plus the total accumulated transaction fees of all the underlying transactions in this block, which are 0.0666 ethers.\n\nDecentralized Applications (Dapps)\n\nLet\u2019s compare decentralized applications with traditional applications. When you log in to Twitter, for example, a web application gets displayed that is rendered using HTML. The page will call an API to access your personal data (your information), which is centrally hosted. It\u2019s a simple process: your front end executes the backend API, and the API goes and fetches your information from a centralized database.\n\nIf we transform this application into a decentralized application, when you log in, the same web application gets rendered, but it calls a smart contract-based API to fetch the information from the blockchain network. So the API is replaced by a smart contract interface, and the smart contract will fetch the information from the blockchain network, which is its backend.\n\nThat blockchain network is not a centralized database; it\u2019s a decentralized network in which the participants of the network (the miners) validate (verify) all the transactions that are happening using the smart contract on the blockchain network. So any transaction or action happening on a Twitter-type application that has now been transformed will be a decentralized transaction.\n\nA Dapp consists of backing code that runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network. It is a software designed to work in the Ethereum network without being controlled by a centralized system, as mentioned, and that is the primary difference: it provides direct interaction between the end users and the decentralized application providers.\n\nAn application qualifies as a Dapp when it is open-source (its code is on Github) and it uses a public blockchain-based token in order to run its applications. A token acts as fuel for the decentralized application to run. Dapp allows the backend code and data to be decentralized, and that is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\n\nEquip yourself with the structure and mechanism of Ethereum and Hyperledger with the Blockchain Certification Training! Enroll now!\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nA DAO is a digital organization that operates without a hierarchical management; it operates in a decentralized and democratic fashion. So basically a DAO is an organization in which the decision-making is not in the hands of a centralized authority but rather in the hands of certain designated authorities or a group or designated people as a part of an authority. It exists on a blockchain network, where it is governed by the protocols embedded in a smart contract, and thereby, DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making\u2014or, we can say, decentralized voting systems\u2014within the organization. So before any organizational decision can be made, it has to go through the voting system, which runs on a decentralized application.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. People add funds through the DAO, because the DAO requires funding in order to execute and make decisions. Based on that, each member is given a token that represents that person\u2019s percentage of shares in the DAO. Those tokens are used to vote in the DAO, and the proposal status is decided based on the maximum votes. Every decision within the organization has to go through this voting process."

The Ethereum co-founder, however, warned against such a notion and explained,\n\n\u201cIt is natural for application-layer projects to attempt such a strategy, and indeed such ideas are often simply conceived without an appreciation of the risks, but its result can easily become very misaligned with the goals of the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nIn the latest blog post titled, \u2018Don\u2019t overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus,\u2019 Buterin offered some potential solutions to address risks such as price oracles, either \u201cnot-quite-cryptoeconomic decentralized oracles\u201d or validator-voting-based oracles that explicitly commit to their emergency recovery strategies being something other than appealing to L1 consensus.\n\nButerin also pointed out that more complex truth oracles could be counted as a solution as the focus would be on reporting facts more subjective than price. He added that it would be \u201csome kind of decentralized court system\u201d built on a not-quite-cryptoeconomic DAO.\n\nMinimizing reliance on cross-chain bridges is also important since these protocols have become an attractive target for malicious entities.\n\nMinimalism\n\nButerin said that any expansion of the \u201cduties\u201d of Ethereum\u2019s consensus triggers an increase in costs, complexities as well as risks of running a validator. He argued that preserving the chain\u2019s minimalism should be the focus which can be achieved by supporting uses of re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of helping developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a lengthy blog post warning of the dangers of \u201cstretching\u201d Ethereum\u2019s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nEthereum consensus is the process whereby blocks are validated by the proof-of-stake mechanism implemented in September 2022 with \u201cthe Merge.\u201d\n\nIn a May 21 blog post titled \u201cDon\u2019t overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus,\u201d Buterin warned that using Ethereum\u2019s network consensus for other things could bring \u201chigh systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder was essentially promoting the preservation of the blockchain\u2019s minimalism.\n\nButerin noted that over the years, a number of proposals or ideas had floated around that suggested using the Ethereum social consensus for other purposes, such as price and data oracles, re-staking initiatives and using layer-1 soft forks to recover layer-2 projects should they have issues.\n\n\u201cThere is a natural urge to try to extend the blockchain\u2019s core with more and more functionality because the blockchain\u2019s core has the largest economic weight and the largest community watching it, but each such extension makes the core itself more fragile.\u201d\n\nButerin said that a certain subset of these techniques could bring \u201chigh systemic risks\u201d to the ecosystem, such as bugs or an intentional 51% attack.\n\nSome high-risk examples include creating ETH/USD price oracles in which ETH (ETH) holders or validators can be bribed to vote on, which may result in a \u201cfork out the bad participants' money\u201d if there is disagreement.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged a need for better oracles, proposing a case-by-case approach because various problems are \u201cinherently so different\u201d from each other.\n\nOverall, Buterin said that any expansion of the \u201cduties\u201d of Ethereum's consensus increases the costs, complexities, and risks of running a validator.\n\nRelated: Buterin weighs in on zk-EVMs\u2019 impact on decentralization and security\n\nApplication-layer projects \u201ctaking actions that risk increasing the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d should be treated with caution, he said, summarizing:\n\n\u201cWe should instead preserve the chain\u2019s minimalism, support uses of re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus, and help developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum consensus mechanism switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September last year. Additionally, staked Ethereum has only just been released for withdrawal with the Shapella upgrade on April 12. This explains the increased scrutiny of validator roles and security risks on the world\u2019s largest smart contract network.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "Machine learning algorithm sets Ethereum price for June 1, 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable stability in its price movements, in contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which has experienced a decline and fell below the $27,000 mark. However, it is crucial to note that Ethereum, as the second-largest market capitalization asset, has displayed resilience and exhibited signs of strength during this period.\n\nThis stability in Ethereum\u2019s price suggests a certain level of confidence and investor trust in the asset. It signifies that despite the overall market fluctuations, Ethereum has managed to hold its ground, attracting potential investors and maintaining a relatively steady value.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithms over at the cryptocurrency analytics and prediction platform Price Predictions, which set the price of ETH at $1,792 on June 1, 2023, according to the latest data accessed on May 22.\n\nETH 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe algorithms, which rely on technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), average true range (ATR), and Bollinger Bands (BB), predict a decline of -1.3% to Ethereum price at press time, which is price expected to continue gradually decline over the end of the month.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $1,816, reflecting a slight increase of 0.06% for the day. However, over the course of the week, ETH has experienced a decline of 0.56%. These price movements indicate a relatively stable performance with some downward pressure in recent days.\n\nETH 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAnalyzing the support and resistance levels, we find that $1,720 acts as a crucial support level for Ethereum, indicating a price point where buying interest is expected to be strong and potential downward movements may be limited. On the other hand, $1,894 represents the resistance level, serving as a price point where selling pressure may intensify, potentially limiting upward movements unless surpassed.\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, Ethereum boasts a total market cap of $218.5 billion, highlighting its significant position within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMeanwhile, the technical analysis over at TradingView suggests a largely bearish sentiment around ETH. Indeed, according to the analysis, the one-day gauges indicate a \u2018sell\u2019 at 10, which is the summary of oscillators in the \u2018sell\u2019 zone at 2, and moving averages with a \u2018sell\u2019 at 8.\n\nETH technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nWhether the machine algorithm-based projections come true or ETH manages to turn the tide will depend on its further developments in the space and how long Ethereum can continue to show strength as Bitcoin struggles to break resistance at $27,600.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his concerns over blockchain consensus overloads in a lengthy blog post published on May 22.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe raised this concern after proposals were made to employ Ethereum's consensus for varied applications, such as validating truth through voting mechanisms and assisting in the recovery of Layer 2 projects (additional networks built on top of Ethereum). Although these proposals were made in good faith, Buterin warns that this could bring significant systemic risks.\n\nWhile dual use of validator-staked ETH might be fine, he believes that overloading Ethereum's consensus could be dangerous.\n\nButerin cited a series of examples to illustrate his argument, explaining that low-risk scenarios might involve using the status of Ethereum validators for things like social network verification or proving wealth.\n\nHigh-risk scenarios, however, could involve plans to coerce the broader Ethereum community to make changes to solve problems with specific projects. Ultimately, he argues that such high-risk ventures should be strongly resisted.\n\nIn simpler terms, Buterin is cautioning against putting too much pressure on Ethereum's security system, fearing it could buckle under the strain, leading to splits within the community and damaging the very heart of Ethereum.\n\nHe encourages maintaining the blockchain's simplicity, focusing on its core functions, and assisting developers in finding alternative strategies to reach their security goals."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency sector, is currently captivating traders\u2019 attention as volatility gauges indicate an intriguing shift in market dynamics.\n\nContrary to the customary pattern, these indicators are suggesting that Ether may experience relatively smaller near-term price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis unexpected reversal has injected a fresh element of anticipation and curiosity among investors, who are now closely monitoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index.\n\nNarrowing Gap Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Volatility\n\nThe T3 Ether Volatility Index, an innovative tool, lies at the core of this phenomenon. It has emerged as an indispensable barometer for assessing and foreseeing price volatility in the Ether market.\n\nThe data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that the difference in volatility between Ether and Bitcoin, as measured by the 180-day realized or historical volatility, is currently at its smallest since 2020. Furthermore, this difference is only marginally positive, indicating a remarkably close alignment between the volatility of Ether and Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ether Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index.\n\nCaroline Mauron, co-founder of crypto derivatives platform OrBit Markets, told the publication:\n\n\u201cLower volatility typically helps institutional investors to allocate more capital to crypto, as it becomes cheaper to buy protection and manage exposures\u2026 the volatility spread compression may drive more exposure to Ether from long-term investors.\u201d\n\nImplications Of Ethereum Price Fluctuation\n\nThe changing flux of Ether\u2019s volatility behavior have significant implications. Notably, the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes, which rely on options pricing, have experienced declines after reaching recent highs in March.\n\nHowever, Ether\u2019s implied volatility has decreased at a faster pace. Additionally, a broader measurement of cross-asset fluctuations in global markets has also witnessed a decline.\n\nThe implications of Ether\u2019s changing volatility behavior are multifaceted. The faster decline in Ether\u2019s implied volatility suggests that market participants have become less uncertain or less anxious about the future price movements of Ether compared to Bitcoin. This could be influenced by various factors such as regulatory developments, market maturity, or growing investor confidence in Ether\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,812. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurthermore, the broader decrease in cross-asset swings indicates a potential reduction in risk aversion among investors, as they perceive a more stable and predictable market environment. This could impact investment decisions and trading strategies, as market participants may adjust their risk management approaches and allocation of resources based on the evolving volatility landscape.\n\nThe changing volatility of Ether, as reflected in the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes and the broader measure of cross-asset swings, highlight the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n-Featured image from Coinnounce\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Trading volumes and investor deposits on zero-knowledge blockchains have soared over the past week.\n\nBut some attribute the increased activity to users attempting to game potential token airdrops.\n\nDeFi users are flocking to Ethereum-based blockchains that use \u201czero-knowledge proofs.\u201d Their likely motive? The possibility of striking gold with lucrative airdrops worth thousands of dollars, all by being early adopters of these cutting-edge chains.\n\nData from DefiLlama shows that activity on these buzzy blockchains \u2014 zkSync Era, Starknet, and Polygon zkEVM \u2014spiked considerably over the past week.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic technique gaining popularity in the crypto industry. They allow blockchains to process information while maintaining privacy and security by not revealing the actual data.\n\nNOW READ: \u2018Not over yet\u2019: Tornado Cash attack rages on with $1m in jeopardy\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOver the past year, blockchain projects Optimism and Arbitrum \u2014 which do not use zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 both airdropped tokens to early and frequent users. As a result, speculation has soared regarding the potential for upcoming projects to follow suit and unleash a similar flurry of rewards for those who get in early.\n\nNumbers go up\n\nThe prevailing speculation has led to a substantial increase in investor deposits and attracted a growing number of traders.\n\nDecentralised exchanges on ZkSync Era, currently the biggest zero-knowledge blockchain with over $120 million deposited onto it, have registered an 88% increase in trading volume over the past week. Earlier this month, however, developers of one of the chain\u2019s five decentralised exchanges \u201cpulled the rug\u201d on investors by stealing over $1.8 million worth of deposits.\n\nSyncSwap is the largest decentralised exchange on zkSync Era by total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nStarknet, another zero-knowledge chain, was not far behind, with a 48% increase in trading volume on its decentralised exchanges. But the biggest growth happened on Polygon zkEVM, a relatively new chain, which launched on March 27. The trading volume on its decentralised exchanges is up 230% this week.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn addition to the increase in trading volume, more DeFi users are moving their assets over to these new chains.\n\nThe total value locked, a measure of the assets deposited in a blockchain network\u2019s DeFi protocols, increased 16% on Starknet this week, while zkSync Era is up 13%. But as with exchange volumes, Polygon zkEVM is the standout winner with a 219% boost to its total value locked.\n\nJediSwap is the largest decentralised exchange on Starknet by total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nAirdrop farming\n\nMany in the DeFi community have pointed out that the primary driver behind the heightened activity on zero-knowledge-based blockchains may be attributed to the practice known as \u201cairdrop farming,\u201d where users create multiple wallets and engage in small transactions to register activity, all in the anticipation of securing valuable token airdrops as a future reward.\n\nNOW READ: MakerDAO members set to approve controversial \u2018whistleblower bounty\u2019 to enforce anonymity\n\n\u201cAirdrop and token speculation is always something protocols and application development teams have to be aware of,\u201d Anthony Rose, senior vice president of technology at Matter Labs, the company behind the zkSync Era blockchain, told DL News.\n\nRecent hints have also helped reignite speculation. In a May 10 tweet, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, winked at the possibility of a token airdrop for early users of Polygon zkEVM.\n\nSer I think its more an insight on impact of airdrop anticipation on adoption than anything related to zk.\n\nI guess you overlooked another prominent zkL2 which has 250mn tvl cuz of the airdrop expectation.\n\n\n\nAlso good things take time. Remember Arbitrum one took 1 year+ to fully\u2026 \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon \ud83d\udc9c (@sandeepnailwal) May 10, 2023\n\nSince then Twitter has been a buzz with talk of farming the possible airdrop, which may help account for the network\u2019s dramatic uptick in usage.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Polygon zkEVM that\u2019s become a target for airdrop farmers. There are also dozens of recent Twitter threads dedicated to gaming potential token airdrops on zkSync and Starknet, too.\n\nBut Rose isn\u2019t concerned about a potential influx of inorganic activity from airdrop farmers. \u201cAs much traffic as we see today, it isn\u2019t even a rounding error on what we will see on the system if we are successful,\u201d he said.\n\nTricky measurement\n\nBut some say DeFi\u2019s conventional metrics may not do justice to reality.\n\nUri Kolodny, co-founder and CEO of Starkware, the company behind Starknet, said he was sceptical about metrics like exchange trading volume and total value locked, which can become artificially inflated due to airdrop farmers.\n\n\u201cI think that total value locked is, in a way, open to misinterpretation,\u201d Kolodny told DL News in an interview. Instead, Kolodny said, he prefers metrics that highlight developer activity \u2014 such as Electric Capital\u2019s Developer Report platform \u2014 as a better gauge of how well a blockchain is doing.\n\nAccording to the Developer Report, as of April 1, Starknet had 6,784 monthly commits \u2014 developer-speak for changes and updates to code. In comparison, zkSync registered 2,533. Although Starknet has more monthly commits, zkSync has approximately 20% more commits overall.\n\nBut they all have increasingly more airdrop farmers."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appears to be on the verge of a potential reversal.\n\nTechnical analysis shows a compelling case for Ethereum\u2019s potential reversal toward the $1,900 mark. The coin has shown signs of finding support at its current levels, and with mounting buying pressure, a bullish trend could be on the horizon.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes are now on Ethereum and its potential reversal.\n\nDecreasing Volatility, Trading Volume Indicate Potential Reversal For Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s price charts reveal a notable decline in volatility, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Volatility, which measures the frequency and magnitude of price fluctuations, is on the decline, suggesting that the bearish sentiment surrounding Ethereum may be losing steam.\n\nThis drop in volatility often precedes trend reversals and signifies a market that is maturing and finding consensus among investors.\n\nAccompanying the decreasing volatility, Ethereum has also experienced a decline in trading volume, a crucial indicator of market activity and investor interest. The reduced trading volume is significant as it signifies a decrease in selling pressure, creating an environment conducive to potential price spikes.\n\nFor Ethereum, the diminishing trading volume sets the stage for a bullish reversal and hints at the possibility of an upward price surge.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAmidst these positive indicators, Ethereum continues to ride the wave of success, with CoinGecko reporting an impressive price of $1,862, reflecting a remarkable 3.1% rally in the past 24 hours alone. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency demonstrates a promising seven-day increase of 2.8%, adding to its growing momentum.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nMixed Signals: Staking Inflows Down\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s positive price momentum and decreasing volatility, recent data from CryptoQuant reveals a decline in staking inflows. On Sunday, staking inflows stood at 93,952 ETH but dropped to 71,648 ETH on Monday. Although still higher compared to recent dips, the decrease in staking inflows suggests a potential shift in investor behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the total value staked continues to climb. This indicates that while the rate of increase has slowed down, there is still ongoing interest in staking Ethereum, potentially driven by the prospect of earning passive income through staking rewards.\n\nETHUSD currently at $1,861 on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the withdrawal profile, which has presented mixed signals. Overnight, there was a notable spike in principal withdrawals, indicating a bearish sentiment. However, projections for the morning session suggest a more bullish outlook, with expectations of principal ETH withdrawals falling to below-normal levels.\n\nThese withdrawal patterns contribute to the overall uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s short-term market outlook. While staking inflows decrease and withdrawal activity remains inconsistent, investors and analysts are closely monitoring these indicators to gauge the direction of the market and the sentiment of Ethereum holders.\n\n-Featured image from WSJ\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Is the Ethereum Network Too Slow for it to Surpass Bitcoin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot. With major developments on the horizon for the Ethereum network the signs are positive for the future, but will they make the difference that is needed? In this article we look at some of the facts in the Ethereum vs Bitcoin debate and let you make up your own mind.\n\nIs the Ethereum Network Really Slow?\n\nOne of the biggest pointers against Ethereum\u2019s speed is its ability to handle large amounts of traffic on the network. As Ethereum gained popularity at the same time as all of the crypto space did, its network became increasingly clogged. And without the right infrastructure in place, this led to higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times slowing down processes for users. During peak periods, such as when popular applications are hammered by heavy usage or during token launches or sales, network congestion can significantly impact transaction speed. This can happen with new token sales or when a certain coin or token experiences a surge in price \u2013 either up or down. Users can keep an eye on coin prices like the Loopring Price to understand these movements and also keep an eye on gas fees and all the latest news in the crypto space to make an educated decision on how to invest or which network to use.\n\nSome lay the blame for the drag on speed at the feet of Ethereum\u2019s current consensus mechanism, otherwise called the Proof of Work, which requires substantial computational resources, leading to slower block validation times. If we look at Bitcoin in comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work algorithm is optimized for security and has a longer average block time, making it less prone to network congestion during high transaction periods. Gas fees can be high and unpredictable, which is a significant issue for Ethereum users. Network congestion can also slow down the network and increase gas fees.\n\nThe good news however is that Ethereum is actively working on ways to improve scalability. The biggest development is clearly the introduction of Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. Additionally, Ethereum switched from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, which, due to the practicalities of the practice, takes far less energy from technology or man. Warehouses full of servers were retired and as a result, the Ethereum coin is gaining speed.\n\nThese developments are still in progress though and until these solutions are fully implemented, Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed may continue to be dragged down. Ethereum 2.0 is being released in phases and while there are still some questions on the effectiveness of the upgrade, many point to this watershed moment as the reason for Ethereum\u2019s potential to surpass Bitcoin. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will change the consensus mechanism for Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the goal of reducing the amount of computational resources. Shard chains are one of the biggest changes to the 2.0 upgrade that will hopefully have the biggest impact on the network overall.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Ecosystem Drives Innovation\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s main strengths is its fantastic ecosystem of applications and smart contracts. This highly developed ecosystem attracts developers and users, fostering innovation and driving adoption. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the demand for its network may increase, spurring the development of scalability solutions and potentially enhancing transaction speeds. With such an active development initiative, the Ethereum community has a vibrant and active developer base constantly working towards improving the network\u2019s performance in the race to beat Bitcoin. This community of developers are dedicated to optimizing the Ethereum blockchain, creating layer 2 solutions, and exploring innovative scaling techniques. Their ongoing efforts indicate a commitment to overcoming the network\u2019s current limitations and enhancing transaction speed.\n\nFlexible for The Future\n\nAlthough there are issues, the good news is that Ethereum\u2019s design allows for easier upgrades compared to Bitcoin. This flexibility for future development provides the potential to bring on new ways of working and as the network evolves, upgrades can be implemented, which of course have the potential to improve Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed. Align this to the dedication and passion of the development community to improve the Ethereum network and the signs are good for the future. Ethereum 2.0, when it arrives, will usher in a brave new world for crypto and blockchain networks, but will it be enough to let Ethereum take over Bitcoin? That remains to be seen but as the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow it will be important for Ethereum to work on its current issues if it is to stand any chance of success.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot. With major developments on the horizon for the Ethereum network the signs are positive for the future, but will they make the difference that is needed? In this article we look at some of the facts in the Ethereum vs Bitcoin debate and let you make up your own mind.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Digital dreams collide with digital memes in the crypto space! Learning the language of cryptocurrencies unlocks the secrets of a digital treasure chest. Every phrase in this space carries a special meaning \u2013 from hodling (holding onto your coins for dear life) to moonshots (price surges that shoot the coin to the moon).\n\nMeme coins in particular have brought a whole other type of language to the crypto industry. These quirky tokens, inspired by viral memes and pop culture, bring a fun, light-hearted punch to the otherwise dull and confusing cryptocurrency lingo.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll go through the classic \u2018lingo\u2019 of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the new, cool \u2018lingo\u2019 of meme coins like DogeMiyagi.\n\nThe Language of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a pioneering cryptocurrency that has captivated the world with its revolutionary concepts and mysterious origins. It is a virtual currency designed to be a decentralised form of money and payment, removing the need for intermediaries in financial transactions.\n\nCreated in 2009 by an enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a household name and the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency. What sets Bitcoin apart? It has a secret language known to its dedicated followers.\n\nFirst, we have the blockchain, the foundation of Bitcoin\u2019s power. A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a secure database that stores information. Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, with each new block linking to the previous one, creating an unbreakable chain. This process is made possible by the hard work of miners, the valiant warriors of the network who verify transactions and ensure their legitimacy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unique lingo continues beyond there. HODL, a term born from a typo, has become an anthem for Bitcoin enthusiasts. It stands for \u201cHold On for Dear Life,\u201d embodying the steadfast belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin, even during turbulent times.\n\nThe Verbiage of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest player in the cryptocurrency arena. Ethereum\u2019s claim to fame lies in its introduction of smart contract functionality, which has paved the way for decentralised apps (dApps) and decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum operates on its own native token Ether (ETH). ETH serves as the fuel for all network transactions, known as gas fees.\n\nThe advent of smart contracts has propelled Ethereum\u2019s growth, enabling the flourishing ecosystem of dApps and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These self-executing software programs operate autonomously, revolutionising how digital assets are created, traded, and managed.\n\nIn terms of Ethereum\u2019s unique lingo, it embraces concepts like gas fees, smart contracts, dApps, and the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). These terms reflect the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and the potential it offers for decentralised applications, revolutionary financial systems, and the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Lingo of DogeMiyagi\n\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu dominate the meme coin world, but a formidable contender is on the horizon \u2013 DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI). Meme coins are cryptocurrencies based on viral internet jokes, and MIYAGI is no exception. DogeMiyagi is in its presale phase, which is the initial phase of a cryptocurrency launch where tokens are sold at a significant discount. So far, MIYAGI has raised $145,726.\n\nDogeMiyagi merges the wisdom of Mr Miyagi from The Karate Kid with the ever-popular \u2018doge\u2019 meme. Fostering a vibrant and supportive community, DogeMiyagi embodies the principles of energy efficiency and resourcefulness, echoing Miyagi-sensei\u2019s teachings of fighting opponents intelligently.\n\nBy selecting a blockchain that prioritises energy efficiency, DogeMiyagi proves its dedication to energy conservation is genuine and sets an example for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFind out more about DogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the past, major precious metals have been viewed by investors as safe-haven assets during the development of financial crises. However, the rise of digital financial technology has given rise to a new type of digital gold: Bitcoin. This was highlighted by a recent analytical review by Bitcoinist experts who compared the dynamics of gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhile gold prices are up 9 percent this year, bitcoin is up more than 70 percent, according to the analysis. Despite the U.S. banking crisis, Bitcoin has continued to gain momentum, rising 30% in the past week alone, from $19,000 to $28,500.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has lagged behind, with prices up just 13% over the past seven days.\n\nExperts from Bitcoinist point out that more and more investors are considering investing in the cryptocurrency space these days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise as digital gold is due to its scarcity, decentralization, and security. These factors, along with a growing number of institutional investors, have contributed to the incredible growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies and their mining are certainly risky, the potential rewards are enormous. With the right knowledge and resources, it is possible to generate substantial profits and benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf you want to try Bitcoin mining \u2013 it would be wise to focus on accumulating affordable mining hashrate before the price starts to rise. You can now choose your bitcoin mining contract in Idmining.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the dynamics of gold, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies evolve over time as the world continues to embrace digital financial technologies. Invest in Bitcoin while it is still cheap to get into Bitcoin mining and avoid future regrets for missed opportunities.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of investing in cloud mining contracts:\n\nWhen investing in BTC, you need to understand fundamental analysis to know when is the best time to buy or sell cryptocurrency. Cloud mining all but eliminates this need for investors. When buying a cloud contract, the revenue becomes passive: the company takes over the maintenance, repair and tuning of the mining machine, while the client simply withdraws the profit; Miners can hedge risk by selling BTC during growth and buying new contracts when the price drops (and becomes cheaper), or simply store the cryptocurrency in a secure wallet until growth resumes; Also, under the current blockchain hash rate conditions, when you buy a mining contract, it turns out that the BTC price will be lower than the price you buy on a crypto exchange. If you invest $2,000, you can only buy 0.13 BTC for this amount. But you can mine twice that amount \u2013 0.3 BTC for the same amount of money.\n\nTherefore, investing in cloud mining is more flexible, profitable and secure, especially in the long-term.\n\nA legitimate cloud mining business was established in the UK in 2016 under the name IDMining. Like any legitimate hash provider, IDMining has commercial properties with a sizable tech park of specialized Bitcoin mining equipment.Brazil & Windhoek & Kazakhstan all have data center locations. Nowadays, IDMining pays out cryptocurrencies to more than 4,90K users from around the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSign up to get $5 immediately.\n\nAutomated daily payouts.\n\nNo overhead or electricity fees.\n\nAn affiliate program with 3% lifetime rewards.\n\nDifferent Crypto contracts to choose from.\n\nDDos and SSL protect the system.\n\n24-hour online support.\n\nNew Crypto Mining Plans\n\nContract Price Contract Terms Fixed Return $100 1 Day $100+$2 $300 3 Days $300+$20.7 $800 7 Days $800+$140 $1300 15 Days $1300+$546 $8200 40 Days $8200+$10496 $15800 60 Days $15800+$29388\n\nFor more IDMining details, please visit https://idmining.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Cautions Against Overloading Consensus | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin warned against overloading the network\u2019s consensus. While Ethereum\u2019s consensus is highly secure, Buterin said overloading it would expose the ecosystem to high systemic risks.\n\nButerin\u2019s post follows massive congestion on the Bitcoin network, which led to a surge in transaction fees.\n\nPossible Risks of Consensus Overload\n\nCrypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum use the consensus mechanism to validate transaction authenticity and maintain the security of the underlying blockchain.\n\nThis consensus mechanism influences how a blockchain network verifies transactions while determining network fees, transaction speed, and more.\n\nAmid surging transaction fees on the Bitcoin network due to congestion, Buterin asked users not to overload Ethereum validators to preserve the consensus mechanism.\n\nIn his blog post, the co-founder warned against the dangers of overworking Ethereum\u2019s consensus. He said some proposals suggested using Ethereum consensus for other purposes, such as price oracles and re-staking. And some even suggested using layer-1 forks to recover layer-2 projects in the event of unexpected occurrences.\n\nWhile the urge to expand the blockchain\u2019s core functionality is high, Buterin said such an extension would render it fragile. He pointed out that a certain subset of these techniques brings high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be resisted and discouraged.\n\nIf validators get overloaded, the ecosystem could face such risks as bugs or 51% intentional attacks initiated by actors who advocate for a fork to protect their deposits. These risks include creating ETH/USD price oracles where ETH holders or validators could receive bribes to vote.\n\nAccording to Buterin, a case scenario where participants receive money to offer the wrong answer would cause honest people to lose money. In that case, Ethereum can only fork to recover users\u2019 funds, which is a high risk.\n\nHowever, while Buterin disagrees with price oracles, he acknowledged the need for better Oracles amid high bug risks. Buterin believes various problems are inherently different and should have unique approaches.\n\nButerin Advices Against Extending Ethereum Consensus Functionality\n\nOverall, Buterin\u2019s article kicks against the expansion of Ethereum consensus functionality as that would cause increased costs, complexities, and risks in running a validator.\n\nIn addition, he advises the community to be cautious of application-layer projects that may increase the scope of blockchain consensus outside core Ethereum protocol rules.\n\nHe urged the Ethereum community to preserve the blockchain\u2019s minimalism and support re-staking without slippery slopes that could extend the roles of Ethereum consensus. The founder asked users to help developers find alternative strategies to achieve their security goals.\n\nAfter transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus last year, Ethereum recently witnessed the Shapella upgrade on April 12.\n\nThe upgrade commissioned a phased release of staked Ether, increasing activities and transactions on the network. That explains the increased concern for security and validator risks on the network.\n\nFeatured image from YouTube and chart from Tradingview"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2018s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has issued a warning to the Ethereum community regarding potential threats to the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s crypto-economic consensus is robustly fortified, with a staggering $34 billion worth of ETH actively validating blocks every 6.4 minutes. Buterin cautions, however, against the misuse of the consensus system, especially in scenarios where its stability could be jeopardized.\n\nVitalik Buterin on misusing the Ethereum consensus system\n\nProposals have been advanced over time suggesting alternative uses for Ethereum\u2019s validator set and social consensus.\n\nSome of these concepts include \u2018ultimate oracle\u2019, a voting system based on ETH where the majority gets rewarded with the minority\u2019s share; and \u2018re-staking\u2019, a system allowing Ethereum stakers to use their stake as a deposit in another protocol.\n\nButerin, however, cautions against certain techniques he sees as potentially hazardous to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. The co-founder firmly warns against \u201crecruiting\u201d Ethereum\u2019s social consensus for individual applications\u2019 purposes.\n\nMisuse of social consensus in this way, he argues, may lead to systemic risks and jeopardize the integrity of the entire ecosystem. Therefore, he suggests the community should be cautious about these actions and actively discourage them.\n\nHighlighting different examples, Buterin makes a clear distinction between harmless re-use of validators and potentially dangerous overloading of social consensus. In one example, he describes a low-risk scenario where a Web3 social network verifies its users by requiring proof that they control an Ethereum validator\u2019s key.\n\nConversely, he highlights a high-risk situation where project leaders for a similar protocol expect the Ethereum community to hard-fork and delete malicious validators. In this case, the broader Ethereum ecosystem is roped into solving the problems of one application, which Buterin considers a high-risk strategy.\n\nThe dangers of stretching Ethereum consensus\n\nButerin further illustrates the pitfalls of stretching Ethereum\u2019s consensus with a hypothetical situation set in 2025. A new ETH/USD price oracle is introduced, with validators voting on the price hourly.\n\nTo incentivize active participation, the system heavily penalizes votes that deviate significantly from the median retrospective vote.\n\nIn this scenario, despite initial resilience and stability, a political crisis in Brazil in 2034 creates a split in the consensus due to differing perspectives on the legitimacy of two opposing political factions.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum, designed as a refuge from geopolitical issues, finds itself at the mercy of a single nation\u2019s internal issues.\n\nButerin argues that a blockchain\u2018s \u201cpurity\u201d is a significant advantage. As soon as a blockchain tries to incorporate real-world factors, it opens itself up to the conflicts and instabilities of the external world.\n\nThe co-founder stresses that the Ethereum community should resist attempts to incorporate real-world indices into the blockchain\u2019s protocol.\n\nThe best way to counter these problems, according to Buterin, is through case-by-case solutions. For example, price oracles could either be non-cryptoeconomic decentralized oracles or validator-voting-based oracles that have predefined recovery strategies.\n\nMoreover, he suggests Layer 2 protocols should rely on multiple proving systems, while cross-chain bridges should be minimized as much as possible. Buterin also proposes a move away from independent chains entirely, in favor of validiums anchored into Ethereum.\n\nThe warning from Buterin is timely and provides the Ethereum community a chance to address these potential risks and ensure the stability and integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nWith his insights, Ethereum\u2019s stakeholders are better equipped to safeguard the network and its consensus system against manipulation and misuse.\n\n**You can read Vitalik\u2019s blog post here."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin shared concerns regarding restaking\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nVitalik Buterin shared his views on the risks that come with restaking.\n\nThe Ethereum founder also shared concerns about overcomplicating the network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin believes restaking and other such ventures might overcomplicate the platform\u2019s consensus mechanism. In particular, Buterin expressed concerns about ETH restaking.\n\nRestaking allows users to stake assets they receive in exchange for staking ETH on platforms like Lido. In a blog post, the Ethereum founder shared his concerns, highlighting several use cases that could risk the Ethereum network, including restaking.\n\nButerin clarified that he was fine with the \u201cdual-use of validator staked ETH,\u201d but to use Ethereum\u2019s social consensus for another application might invite trouble.\n\nVitalik Buterin warned that restaking could overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nFor example, Buterin noted a scenario where eCash switched to proof of stake and allowed users to duel stake. However, the protocol expects Ethereum to undergo a hard fork if validators decide to harm the protocol.\n\nWhile it might sound good, Ethereum has multiple L2 blockchains running on top of it. As a result, if a number of them face problems, the Ethereum ecosystem would be split into multiple chains due to the hard forks.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin highlighted that global political events could also force a hard fork in the chain. The Ethereum founder cited a possible scenario where political interest in Brazil led to the creation of two CBDCs on different chains.\n\nAs soon as a blockchain tries to \u201chook in\u201d to the outside world, the outside world\u2019s conflicts start to impact on the blockchain too Buterin noted\n\nMoreover, re-staking, even in low-risk situations, might culminate in a situation that compromises the Ethereum main net\u2019s security.\n\nIncidentally, restaking protocol Eigen Layer\u2019s founder Sreeram Kannan welcomed Buterin\u2019s thoughts, calling the post an \u201cexcellent analysis of the different kinds of risks\u201d involved in restaking.\n\nETH Price Continues To Consolidate\n\nMeanwhile, ETH price has been consolidating above $1,800 as bulls aggressively defend the 100-day EMA (blue wave) support level near $1,770. Moreover, the lack of volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price action indicates indecision amongst market participants.\n\nETH price faces trouble breaking above the 20-day EMA (red wave) and 50-day EMA (purple wave) resistance confluence. However, needling above the confluence resistance might help the Ethereum token price rally to $1,870.\n\nETHUSD daily chart with RSI. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nBreaking and consolidating above the immediate resistance level could see ETH price challenge resistance near $1,970 before downside corrections pare gains.\n\nConversely, a breakdown from the consolidation level might result in the ETH price dropping to its 100-day EMA support level. Breaching the immediate support level could result in the Ethereum token price testing support near $1,680 before recovering.\n\nThe RSI for ETH remained neutral, clocking at 45.69 on the daily charts."
