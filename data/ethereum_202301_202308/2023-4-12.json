        "content": "Ethereum traded above $2,000 for the first time since May 2022 after the successful Shappella upgrade.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate\u2019s data, ETH rose more than 6% in the last 24 hours to trade as high as $2,007. The digital asset has since retraced to $2,001 at the time of writing.\n\nDuring the period, Ether outperformed Bitcoin\u2019s price performance which only rose by less than 1%.\n\nCoinglass data showed that ETH\u2019s positive performance liquidated almost $40 million in short positions within the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are up over 81% and 60% year-to-date, respectively.\n\nThe success of the Shappela upgrade mostly influenced ETH\u2019s positive price movement. The Shappella upgrade is the first major Ethereum network update since the Merge and will enable validators to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nWhile some analysts predicted that the unlock would place more selling pressure on ETH, the asset\u2019s current performance showed that their fears were unfounded.\n\nData from Token Unlocks showed validators had withdrawn over 130,000 Ethereum at the time of press. The data further shows that roughly $1.8 billion worth of ETH is pending withdrawals.\n\nLiquid staking tokens rally\n\nLiquid staking tokens have risen by roughly 3% in the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nExcept for Rocket Pool (RPL), the other cryptocurrencies in the sector gained all recorded gains during the reporting period.\n\nAccording to the data, StakeWise (SWISE) gained 6.62%, while Frax Share\u2019s FXS rose by roughly 3%.\n\nOther protocols like Lido (LDO), ANKR, pStake Finance (PSTAKE), and Stafi (FIS) posted gains of less than 1%, respectively. Overall, the market cap of the crypto tokens in this sector sits at $3.97 billion as of press time.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, DeFillama data shows that the total value of assets locked (TVL) on the top liquid staking protocols rose by an average of 4%. According to the data, over 8 million ETH tokens \u2014 worth $16.03 billion \u2014 are staked through these platforms.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether are crypto\u2019s blue chips. And much like tech giants Apple and Microsoft, they\u2019ve attracted distinct and loyal communities, leading to a natural rivalry.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are also increasingly correlated. In fact, they\u2019re moving more in tandem than ever before.\n\nBut BTC is still the market leader. It commands almost half of the entire crypto capitalization, its dominance now at one-year highs. That\u2019s still less than the 2018-2019 bear market, when bitcoin dominance was as high as 71%.\n\nETH meanwhile makes up nearly 20%, more than double what it was when the market bottomed last cycle. Comparing returns since Apr. 2018 shows bitcoin outstripping ether for most of that interim \u2014- until May 2021.\n\nBitcoin was just coming down from reaching $60,000 for the first time, while ether was correcting after attempting to break $4,000. At that point, bitcoin had returned around 550% since the first inning of the previous bear market, going from $7,900 to nearly $51,000. Ether had just eclipsed bitcoin, having jumped more than 700%.\n\nBitcoin and ether are practically even over the past five years\n\nEther would hold onto that lead for practically the entire bull market and then some. Bitcoin has gained ground though, thanks to a falling ETH-to-BTC ratio (down 13.5% over the past year).\n\nBTC is now a whisker away from topping ETH over the past five years \u2014 the former returning 279% to the latter\u2019s 289%.\n\nSimple charts like these suffer from a certain amount of time bias (the five-year returns may look completely different in another three months).\n\nStill, Bob Ras, co-founder of tokenized securities startup Sologenic, explained that the narrative has shifted somewhat when it comes to Bitcoin and Ethereum since the 2021 bull run.\n\n\u201cThere was so much strength behind the Ethereum ecosystem because of all the utility enabled by DeFi, NFTs, ENS and other applications,\u201d Ras told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cDuring the bull run, there were a lot more users around who were toying with various digital asset applications, and so it made sense for Ethereum to have been the key driver of growth.\u201d\n\nThe three-year chart tells a different story: ETH has dominated BTC over the past three years (1,085% to 327%)\n\nBitcoin has performed less bad than ether\n\nThe macro situation has changed since the 2018 bull market, capped off by the recent US banking crisis.\n\nRas noted that the Federal Reserve will have to pivot away from its tightening policy soon, which could inject more liquidity into the market to prevent a credit crunch.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now rivaling gold and other stores of value when it comes to hedging against these likely forthcoming liquidity injections, which will ultimately contribute to the debasement of the dollar and other fiat currencies,\u201d Ras said.\n\n\u201cBTC is the hardened, reliable asset right now. The narrative could shift again, of course, but it seems likely that the ETH/BTC ratio could trend downwards for some time \u2014 perhaps until the next bull market fully kicks in.\u201d\n\nZooming in to just the past year shows where those \u2018gains\u2019 have been made\n\nBTC has outperformed ETH easily since April 2022, weeks before Terra would depeg, causing chaos for crypto. BTC is down almost 26% while ETH has fallen 37%.\n\nAlthough, it would be more accurate to say bitcoin has performed \u201cless bad,\u201d considering neither have boosted portfolios over the past year.\n\nZooming out to encompass all-time returns however, bitcoin blows ether out of the water.\n\nBitcoin has returned a pearl-clutching 4-billion percent since its earliest recorded price in late 2009 ($0.00076392).\n\nEther has \u201conly\u201d risen 66,544% since it first launched in 2015.

        "content": "In this issue\n\nEthereum: Upgrade anxieties Apple: Bitcoin hideout Hong Kong: Wooing Web3\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, When it comes to showing the extent to which digital assets have become integrated into our lives, the metaphors don\u2019t come much more vivid than the news that the Bitcoin white paper has been hidden in Apple\u2019s MacOS operating system for the past six or so years. And the fact that the white paper has been slipped into an Apple technology rather than into another form of tech doubles down on that message: Like cryptocurrencies currently are to traditional finance, Apple was once an underdog in its industry. Its evolution into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies demonstrates the transformative power of innovation, and a similar sense of pioneering innovation hints at the possibilities for crypto and other digital assets. Yet regulators are still playing catch-up. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside other authorities, has this year launched a series of occasionally controversial enforcement actions against crypto companies, despite a slew of unanswered questions and official disagreements on how to regulate digital assets. Bitcoin is an excellent example of the regulatory muddle. The original crypto was defined as a virtual currency and a means of payment by the U.S. Treasury a decade ago, classified as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a year later \u2014 when the Internal Revenue Service designated it as property \u2014 and treated as physical cash in the Biden Administration\u2019s infrastructure bill, which became law in 2021. If Apple\u2019s technology had been subject to such confusing, conflicting regulatory reasoning, alongside enforcement action that some in the crypto industry \u2014 and even some in the regulatory community \u2014 consider little more than arbitrary, would it ever have grown into one of the most successful companies of all time? For digital assets to develop to the extent that their untapped potential is fully realized, the regulatory roadblocks must be cleared and rules must be made rational and predictable \u2014 as is required for the development of any young industry. A good place to start would be settling the ongoing impasse between the SEC and the CFTC over whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities. We are the custodians of a brave new era in the evolution of finance that\u2019s already embedded in our financial ecosystem. We must not let its promise be diminished because regulating it is challenging. Digital assets present authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere with a challenge, but, more importantly, an opportunity. They need to step forward and take it. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Fork up\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade will offer increased utility for stakers, but it has prompted concerns over possible downward pressure on the token\u2019s price. Image: Canva\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrade, also known as the Shanghai hard fork, is scheduled for mainnet activation on Thursday, April 13, at 6:27 a.m. Hong Kong time, at epoch 194048, according to an announcement by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum holders have been looking forward to the Shapella upgrade, which promises to enable stakers to withdraw their ETH from the Beacon Chain for the first time while claiming staking rewards.\n\nThe upgrade is the most significant since The Merge transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to its current proof-of-stake setup last September.\n\nDaily ETH staking deposits shrunk from 55,456 ETH on March 31, to as low as 11,728 ETH on April 11, according to BeaconScan data.\n\nInvestors worry that the upgrade could significantly increase selling pressure on ETH, since more than 18.2 million ETH worth US$34.16 billion is staked on the Beacon Chain, or 15.15% of the token\u2019s total supply, according to Dune.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary [validator] exit count surges higher as Shanghai approaches,\u201d tweeted James Straten, a data analyst at CryptoSlate, adding that there may be \u201ca lot of potential sell pressure,\u201d due to the large sum of staked ETH.\n\nHowever, crypto exchange Gate.io said the impact of sales \u201cmight be small,\u201d as only 1% of the circulating ETH supply consists of staking rewards, with a high probability of withdrawal.\n\nLido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol, will enable staking withdrawals only from early May, Lido developer Kadmil.eth said in a Twitter space on April 6. That could further reduce selling pressure because more than 31% of total staked ETH was staked through the protocol.\n\nEther fell 2.4% in the past 24 hours to US$1,874 and is overall flat for the past week, according to CoinGecko. ETH remains 37.4% lower than its prices a year ago and is down 61.6% from its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Most Ethereum upgrades are strictly crypto affairs, but the upcoming Shanghai upgrade has exacerbated a split between regulators in the United States. That\u2019s because ETH\u2019s move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, allowing users to stake and earn interest on their holdings, is now considered \u2014 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, at least \u2014 to make it a security. Historically, the SEC was satisfied with ETH\u2019s designation as a commodity. But the arrival of staking rewards has changed that. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has publicly stated that interest-bearing contracts fundamentally change what ETH is, because those contracts are essentially financial services, making them securities instruments. But the Commodity Futures Trading Commission begs to differ. It has held the view since 2014 that ETH is a commodity and has been saying as much in Senate hearings. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has stressed that the derivatives watchdog would not have allowed ETH futures products to be listed on exchanges it regulates \u201cif we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d The outcome of this regulatory rift is likely to shape the future of crypto more broadly. If ETH is designated a security, all the companies offering staking services \u2014 such as Coinbase, Binance, Ledger and eToro \u2014 are likely to have broken the law. Some have already faced legal challenges for offering these services. If ETH is classified with certainty as a commodity, it\u2019s likely to become a magnet for hedge funds and other large finance sector players awaiting regulatory clarity. For now, however, ETH\u2019s future remains subject to some uncertainty.\n\n2. Buried treasure\n\nBitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper has been secretly distributed to MacBook users for the past six years, but may be removed from future versions of MacOS. Image: Canva\n\nThe Bitcoin white paper, the theoretical outline of the network underpinning the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, has been hidden inside every version of the operating system used by Apple\u2019s Mac computers shipped since at least 2018.\n\nThe white paper was hidden within MacBook\u2019s Virtual Scanner II, a function disabled by default.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear who hid the paper in the system, it was first discovered by MacOS community forum user bernd178 and shared in April 2021. However, the document\u2019s concealment only came to widespread attention with its re-discovery by blogger Andy Baio, who wrote a blog post about it last week.\n\nBaio said he didn\u2019t know why the paper was hidden in the operating system, but suggested that an engineer had put it there.\n\n\u201cA little bird tells me that someone internally filed it as an issue nearly a year ago, assigned to the same engineer who put the PDF there in the first place, and that person hasn\u2019t taken action or commented on the issue since. They\u2019ve indicated it will likely be removed in future versions,\u201d Baio wrote.\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency has risen 6.6% since a week ago, to US$30,029, and has climbed 36% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko. But it\u2019s still 24.1% lower compared to a year ago, and more than 56% lower than its all-time high of US$69,045 in November 2021.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin has always had admirers, and it seems an engineer at Apple is one of them. While some are interpreting this as further evidence of the wild theory that Steve Jobs was Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, the answer is probably a little less exciting. Software engineers have long hidden things inside operating systems for other engineers or curious users to discover. Jokes by program designers were inserted into the code of MS-DOS as long ago as the 1980s, It seems the white paper, located inside a folder with assets used for internal testing by Apple engineers, was a prank in the same vein. The same folder also contains other random images and PDF files that are used to simulate the process of scanning and exporting documents and images with the app, without actually needing a scanner. Although Apple was aware of the issue, it seems the engineer in charge of removing the white paper hasn\u2019t gotten around to the task of removing it yet. Is it a sign of Nakamoto\u2019s return? Don\u2019t bet your BTC on it.\n\n3. Chan-neling positivity\n\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan\u2019s naming of Web3 as a policy priority reinforces recent moves by authorities to develop the city as a digital asset hub. Image: GovHK/Canva\n\nPaul Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, has proposed further Web3 development as one of three key themes in the city\u2019s fiscal budget and that now is the \u201cbest time\u201d to do so, according to a blog post published on the website of his office.\n\n\u201cThe digital economy and the application of Web3 have great potential for development and have triggered a positive response from society,\u201d Chan wrote.\n\nChan added that he is optimistic about Web3 development despite \u201cvirtual assets having fluctuated significantly\u201d and the recent closures of virtual asset exchanges.\n\nChan\u2019s comments come two months after Hong Kong detailed a new licensing regime for crypto service providers that is set to take effect in June. The framework may eventually extend to retail crypto trading, which has been restricted in the territory.\n\nThe finance secretary added that the Web3 push will prioritize developing industry regulations while focusing on real-world use cases such as the tokenization of green bonds and using blockchain to \u201csimplify the supply chain process and reduce costs.\u201d\n\nChan made his remarks ahead of a busy week for the city\u2019s Web3 industry, with the Hong Kong Web3 Festival under way on Wednesday, and the government hosting a two-day Digital Economy Summit starting Thursday."

        "content": "\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is live, allowing validators to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Retrieving your staked ETH through Ledger Live with Lido or Kiln apps is not immediate. You will be able to unstake them around May 2023.\n\n\n\n\u2013 For Ledger Enterprise clients, the Shanghai upgrade will provide new incentives for institutions and corporates to stake their Ethereum assets as they will be able to unlock and withdraw their rewards, which significantly de-risk them as an investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Merge, a successful software upgrade that took place in September 2022, shifted the Ethereum protocol from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain. This upgrade was the initial phase of the five stages of Ethereum\u2019s development, as outlined by Vitalik Buterin, including \u201cThe Merge,\u201d \u201cThe Surge,\u201d \u201cThe Verge,\u201d \u201cThe Purge,\u201d and \u201cThe Splurge.\u201d\n\nIf you want to explore Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, read this article where Charles Guillemet, CTO of Ledger, provides critical insights into the future of Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is The Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork. This software upgrade implements EIP-4895, allowing validators to withdraw their staked ETH. So far, the staked coins remain blocked on the protocol, meaning users couldn\u2019t retrieve their rewards.\n\nAs the upgrade is now live, validators can:\n\nUnlock and withdraw their staking rewards.\n\nUnstake ETH and gain access to their entire balance.\n\nEarn rewards that will be distributed automatically.\n\nRe-stake to sign back up and start earning more rewards.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also includes three other improvement proposals that tackle high gas fees, slow transaction processing time, and the overall performance of the network.\n\nFor Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade marks the completion of the blockchain migration to Proof of Stake, as well as a significant milestone in the evolution of Ethereum. This upgrade will bring more liquidity to the market and encourage those who were previously hesitant to stake their ETH due to uncertainties around locking time. It also highlights the Ethereum community\u2019s remarkable ability to update its protocol seamlessly.\u201d\n\nRead our Ledger Academy article to learn more about the implications of this significant upgrade.\n\nShanghai Upgrade: what does it mean for Ledger Live users?\n\nStaking with Lido through Ledger Live:\n\nWhile the upgrade is live, Ledger Live Lido users will only be able to withdraw their staked ETH from their Ledger Live app around May 2023. stETH holders will be able to unstake their stETH and in return receive ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nWithdrawals will be handled through the following Request and Claim process:\n\nRequest: A user locks stETH as a withdrawal request.\n\nFulfillment: The protocol sources ETH to fulfill the withdrawal request, locks the ETH, burns the locked stETH, and marks the withdrawal request as claimable.\n\nClaim: The user claims their ETH.\n\nStaking with Kiln through Ledger Live:\n\nJust like with Lido users, Kiln users on Ledger Live will also be able to withdraw their staked ETH around May 2023 by following these simple steps:\n\nUnlock and connect their Ledger device to the Ledger Live app. Navigate to the Discover section. Select Kiln. Go to the Rewards tab and select the validator(s). Click Unstake. Review and verify the transaction using their Ledger device.\n\nOnce the validator goes through the exit and withdrawal queues, you can return to the Rewards tab, click the Withdraw button and claim your ETH.\n\nShanghai Upgrade: what does it mean for Ledger Enterprise clients?\n\nFor Ledger Enterprise clients, the Shanghai upgrade will provide new incentives for institutions and corporates to stake their Ethereum assets as they will be able to unlock and withdraw their rewards which significantly de-risk them as an investment. Unlocking rewards can also open new financial opportunities with the possibility to compound rewards though pool staking.\n\nFor Alex Zinder, Head of Ledger Enterprise, \u201cwith the coming clarity on the timing of the update, there is no better time than now to add ETH staking to your institutional yield strategy. Ledger is seeing great demand for ETH staking from its retail users, so, if you want to bring secure and compliant ETH staking to your retail audience, contact Ledger Enterprise.\u201d\n\nBy staking your digital assets with Ledger Enterprise, you can access a seamless, secure, all-in-one digital asset management platform, a fully customizable governance framework, real digital ownership, and 100% auditable and regulatory-friendly reporting.\n\nLearn more about how to stake with Ledger Enterprise here."

Source: beaconcha.in\n\nCurrently, around 44% of validators, or 248,043 of the total active 559,549, can request a partial or full withdrawal.\n\nThe majority of withdrawals at this time range between 2.8 to 3.2 ETH, which suggests that it\u2019s mostly staking rewards that are being withdrawn at this time.\n\nThe Ethereum Shapella upgrade has been activated and withdrawals are processing! pic.twitter.com/Krly5GB2K7 \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) April 12, 2023\n\nThe withdrawals come as only 3,996 validators signed up to the exit queue moments before the Shapella hard fork took effect, according to data from Rated Network Explorer.\n\nOf the total amount of withdrawable Ether, crypto exchange Huobi holds the largest share at 30%, followed by the decentralized autonomous organization PieDAO at 17.7%, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.\n\nTotal number of withdrawable Ether by entity.

        "title": "How Shanghai Could Change Institutional Appetite for Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is expected to complete its highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade just minutes from now.\n\nThat means the network behind the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency will finally allow users to withdraw the ETH that has been locked up over the past two years.\n\nBut what does that mean for institutional investors? Will they be more attracted to the asset? Will big money be more attracted to the new, improved blockchain?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA bit of background first: Ethereum used to run on a proof-of-work blockchain\u2014just like Bitcoin. This energy-intensive consensus mechanism uses miners to solve complex equations with massive computers, all to generate new blocks and earn digital currency rewards.\n\nBut Ethereum last year moved to a proof-of-stake blockchain, which eliminated the need for miners and instead replaced them with validators: people who pledge Ethereum (Ether\u2014or ETH) to keep the network running.\n\nThe latest network upgrade will allow those validators to withdraw the ETH they\u2019ve staked to the network\u2014currently over $34.7 billion in cryptocurrency. Before the upgrade, those who\u2019d pledged ETH to the network could not take it out.\n\nThe upgrade means that there will now be more liquidity with investments, and this is attractive to large, conservative investors, according to Diogo M\u00f3nica, the co-founder of digital asset trust bank Anchorage Digital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nM\u00f3nica told Decrypt that the lack of liquidity previously scared funds away from Ethereum. But with this upgrade, institutions which previously didn\u2019t stake cryptocurrency (and instead just bought ETH and sat on it) would now be interested in pledging ETH.\n\n\u201cI expect a flip to happen: the large majority of them [institutions] will stake and very few of them are going to have unstaked Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the move will also attract big funds focused on having an ESG (environmental, social and governance) investment strategy: Ethereum is now far-more energy efficient\u201499.95% more, according to the Ethereum Foundation\u2014and therefore a greener digital asset.\n\nLachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Australian blockchain consultancy Labrys, echoed M\u00f3nica\u2019s comments, and told Decrypt that he \u201cexpects more, not less, ETH to be staked\u201d in the long-term by institutions.\n\nThe upgrade \u201cshould alleviate risk for investors because their assets aren\u2019t locked, as they were prior to the upgrade,\u201d said Feeney.\n\n\u201cPreviously, institutional investors would likely have been reluctant to lock their assets without the option to withdraw,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that such an option exists, it de-risks their investment, removing the deterrent that previously existed.\u201d\n\nMarc Arjoon, a research associate at investment firm CoinShares, told Decrypt that hedge funds will be more attracted to Ethereum because they will be able to delta neutral hedge ETH\u2014an investment strategy that aims to reduce risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset.\n\nThis is because hedge funds that are shorting the price of Ethereum (betting on its future price to go down) will have some protection because they will be earning rewards on the staked crypto anyway, he explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s upgrade goes according to plan tonight, many are betting that the cryptocurrency will attract more mainstream, traditional investors, which could prove bullish for the price of the asset long term. Since the start of the year, ETH is up 60%, currently trading for around $1,916."

        "title": "Predicting the Impact of Stake Withdrawals on Ethereum's Market Dynamics - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "An Opinion From SenseiNode Based on Blockchain Data\n\nBy: Alberto Guerrero Montilla and Pablo Larguia \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi Research\n\nAs the Ethereum network prepares for the anticipated Shanghai update, which introduces stake withdrawals for users participating in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the potential impact on market dynamics and user behavior remains a hot topic.\n\nBy evaluating key on-chain metrics such as total staked ETH, the number of validators, staking rewards, withdrawn stake, ETH price, daily transaction volume, and gas prices, we can form an educated opinion on the potential consequences of the Shanghai update.\n\nThis data-driven approach will help users, investors, and stakeholders navigate the evolving Ethereum landscape.\n\nCurrent State of Ethereum\n\nAs of April 2023, approximately 19,177,797 ETH are staked, representing a significant portion of the total supply, and over 563,803 active validators contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization.\n\nWith an annual percentage return (APR) of about 5% for stakers, Ethereum offers attractive incentives to users. However, the Shanghai update could lead to a decline in staked ETH and potentially impact the network\u2019s security and staking rewards. The update could also influence the number of active validators, as existing validators may choose to withdraw their stakes, while new validators may still join the network.\n\nStake Withdrawals and Market Dynamics\n\nOnce stake withdrawals are enabled, monitoring the amount of Ether withdrawn from staking contracts will provide valuable insights into user behavior. Increased market liquidity due to stake withdrawals may cause short-term price volatility.\n\nHowever, if the additional liquidity attracts more users to the Ethereum network, it could positively impact Ethereum\u2019s long-term value. For instance, the increased liquidity may lead to a higher trading volume, potentially drawing in new investors and supporting Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nNetwork Efficiency and Scalability\n\nAnalyzing the daily transaction volume on the Ethereum network offers insights into network usage and potential stake withdrawal impacts. If stake withdrawals lead to a surge in transactions, it could cause network congestion and increase gas prices temporarily.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s PoS system is expected to maintain efficiency even under increased demand. The implementation of EIP-1559 has already contributed to relatively stable gas prices, and Ethereum\u2019s PoS system is designed to maintain network efficiency and handle increased demand, mitigating potential long-term impacts on gas prices.\n\nRole of Staking Rewards\n\nStaking rewards play a crucial role in incentivizing users to participate in staking. If stake withdrawals lead to a decrease in the total staked ETH, remaining stakers may receive higher rewards. This could attract new participants, helping to maintain the network\u2019s stability and security.\n\nConsequently, the balance between stake withdrawals and new users joining the staking ecosystem will be critical in determining the overall health of the Ethereum network.\n\nDeFi and NFT Market Impact\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the potential impact of stake withdrawals on the thriving DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFT (non-fungible token) markets within the Ethereum ecosystem. As the staking rewards and market dynamics shift, users might decide to reallocate their funds to DeFi or NFT projects, which could create additional market volatility. Monitoring these trends will be essential for understanding the broader implications of stake withdrawals on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBased on the analysis of various on-chain metrics, we can draw several data-driven conclusions:\n\nWithdrawals of staked ETH may lead to short-term price volatility. However, this could also attract new users and investors, potentially benefiting Ethereum\u2019s long-term value. The number of active validators and staking rewards might fluctuate due to stake withdrawals, but the PoS system is designed to maintain network security and stability by adjusting incentives for new and existing participants. Stake withdrawals could temporarily increase daily transaction volume and gas prices. However, Ethereum\u2019s PoS system is expected to maintain efficiency and scalability, mitigating any long-term effects on network congestion and transaction costs. The impact of stake withdrawals on the DeFi and NFT markets within the Ethereum ecosystem should be monitored closely, as users may reallocate their funds, creating additional market volatility.\n\nAs the Shanghai update approaches, it is vital for the Ethereum community to consider the potential effects of stake withdrawals on market dynamics.\n\nWhile stake withdrawals may lead to short-term price fluctuations, network congestion, and increased gas prices, the PoS system\u2019s inherent design aims to maintain efficiency, security, and stability.\n\nAlberto Guerrero Montilla is the head of growth at SenseiNode, and Pablo Larguia is the CEO of SenseiNode, a blockchain infrastructure provider in Latin America."

        "content": "In a development that may trigger a wave of selling, Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrade is poised to commence today at around 22:00 UTC.\n\nThe big news: Users will be able to unlock Ether deposited into the blockchain\u2019s staking contract for the first time since December 2020.\n\nShapella will let stakers withdraw 18.2 million of previously locked Ether, currently worth over $34.1 billion. Many of the Ethereum faithful maintain the event could drive increased activity across the blockchain.\n\nSelloff fears\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nYet the release has raised fears of a decline in the price of the second most valuable cryptocurrency if the stakers cash in their unlocked Ether.\n\nEthereum staking is essential in validating transactions and maintaining the decentralisation of the world\u2019s top smart contract blockchain. Anyone with 32 Ether can spin up a validator on their computer, stake their coins, and receive a yield for helping process transactions.\n\nDepending on network conditions, stakers stand to earn between 4 to 6% annually, paid automatically by the network in Ether.\n\nNOW READ: Arbitrum reels from voting drama as concerns over decentralisation loom large\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBefore Shapella, many potential stakers worried that they may never be able to withdraw their Ether after staking it. Others cited delays to the staking withdrawal upgrade or unexpected bugs in the upgrade\u2019s code as additional risks.\n\nBut as long as the Shapella upgrade is successful, these concerns should be alleviated.\n\n\u201cThe main benefit of the [Shapella] upgrade is the reduction of risk associated with staking,\u201d Valerie Tetu, the head of go-to-market strategy at liquid staking provider Lido Finance, told DL News.\n\n\u2018The main benefit of the upgrade is the reduction of risk associated with staking.\u2019 \u2014 Valerie Tetu\n\nAccording to Tetu, the upgrade will support the growth of staking activity, and motivate more staking tools and services to emerge and compete.\n\nLido is currently the biggest Ethereum liquid staking provider, with $11.52 billion worth of Ether staked through the protocol. It is also the top DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nTotal assets staked through Lido\n\nDaniel Dizon, founder of the liquid staking protocol Swell, said Ether staking will benefit from an \u201cimproved risk-reward profile\u201d once withdrawals are active. He said that the upgrade will result in \u201chigher staking rate participation, further bolstering the economic security of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nOne-way trip\n\nEthereum staking was, until now, a one-way trip. Users could deposit Ether into the blockchain\u2019s staking contract to earn yield, but could not realise any of their gains, or withdraw their initial stake.\n\nDizon said he expects liquid staking derivatives \u2014 tradable tokens which represent staked Ether \u2014 to rise in use following Shapella. He said liquid staking tokens have become popular among DeFi users because they let holders earn a yield on their Ether through staking and use it across other DeFi protocols.\n\nNOW READ: Recovering scammed assets should be easier with blockchain data but it\u2019s not\n\nNow that early depositors can queue their staked Ether for withdrawal, many in the Ethereum community worry about a surge in profit taking. That\u2019s because since staking went live in December 2020, the price of Ether has almost quadrupled.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to ignore the possibility of added selling pressure around and after the upgrade based on the unlock mechanism,\u201d Josh Olszewicz, head of research at crypto asset management firm Valkyrie Investments, told DL News.\n\nOlszewicz said his \u201cneutral to bullish scenario\u201d is that most stakers will submit partial withdrawals for the yield they have generated, while leaving the majority of their Ether staked.\n\nStaking pools\n\nHowever, Olszewicz also said the greatest selling pressures may come from defunct crypto lenders or exchanges who have assets that need to be sold in order to recoup funds for creditors or interested parties.\n\nSpecifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered centralised exchange Kraken to shut down its staking activities for US retail customers in February. Kraken currently accounts for 6.8% of all staked Ether, a large portion of which it will likely need to unstake and return to US customers.\n\nNOW READ: Litigator who challenged Operation Choke Point rallies crypto to fight \u2018illegal\u2019 regulatory crackdown\n\nShapella, which blends changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer (Shanghai) and consensus layer (Capella), is what industry insiders call a \u201chard fork\u201d \u2014 a radical change to a blockchain that requires all users to upgrade to the latest version.\n\nThe upgrade is the most substantial change to Ethereum since The Merge last September, which transitioned the blockchain from the energy-intensive Proof of Work validation system to the greener Proof of Stake approach.\n\nIn addition to enabling staking withdrawals, Shapella also introduces five EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) which make changes and improvements to the code used to create programs on the blockchain, and an update to the network\u2019s engine API."

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is an Ethereum Price Target of $10,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH 1.60%) is up 60% for the year, and all eyes are now on the blockchain's pending Shanghai upgrade. This is the first major upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge, and has been highly anticipated for months.\n\nThe Ethereum bulls, of course, think that Shanghai will be a huge win for Ethereum, and are getting ready for a huge rally. Some are even predicting a $10,000 price for Ethereum by 2025. But just how realistic is that target? After all, the record high for Ethereum ($4,891.70) is less than half that level.\n\nWhat happens to Ethereum after Shanghai?\n\nBoth bulls and bears agree that the Shanghai upgrade is pivotal to what happens next with Ethereum. The upgrade is directly related to Ethereum's transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain last year. As soon as that change took place, Ethereum had to consider the implications for staking, which is the process of locking up crypto on the blockchain in exchange for rewards.\n\nCurrently, the lockup period for Ethereum is indefinite. You can stake your Ethereum and earn rewards, but you cannot unlock it and take it out of the blockchain. The primary purpose of Shanghai is to make it possible to withdraw this staked Ethereum, some of which has been locked up since December 2020.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum bulls, the Shanghai upgrade is going to result in huge new flows of capital coming into the blockchain. That's because Shanghai will de-risk staking on the blockchain and pave the way for more individual investors to get involved. If you look at how much Ethereum has been staked, it is only about 16% of the crypto's entire market cap, compared to levels of 60% to 70% found on other blockchains. So it does make sense that the Ethereum staking ratio will one day align with the percentages found on other proof-of-stake blockchains because investors no longer will face an indeterminate lockup.\n\nHowever, that's over the long term. In the short term, the upgrade could spur a huge retreat from Ethereum as investor who have been locked up take flight. This could lead to a huge price dump. Nearly 1 million Ethereum tokens will be available for immediate unstaking in April, and this means that nearly $2 billion worth of Ethereum could be dumped on the market. That doesn't even take into account what happens to the other 18 million Ethereum tokens (worth an aggregate of $36 billion) that have been staked.\n\nWill Ethereum finally get its promised upgrades?\n\nWhat many investors don't realize is that Ethereum's digital transformation is really only halfway to completion. It did not end with The Merge. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, originally promised 100,000 transactions per second. And he also promised that Ethereum gas, or user, fees would decline markedly after The Merge, making the blockchain much more attractive. But what's the reality? Ethereum still has a transaction processing speed of less than 50 transactions per second, which is glacially slow. And gas fees are not much improved, either.\n\nSo, it could take until 2025 before Ethereum reaches higher functionality. In November 2022, Buterin published an updated roadmap, and the future development of the blockchain consists of at least five more stages. Given how long it took to implement The Merge, and how many delays there were along the way, this could be a very long process.\n\nUltimately, these delays and accompanying uncertainty could have a negative impact on the price of Ethereum. Investors are going to get tired of waiting, and when people finally realize that Ethereum still relies heavily on Layer 2 scaling solutions by other cryptos even after The Merge, there could be a move to embrace other blockchain solutions that don't come with Ethereum's legacy proof-of-work problems.\n\nWhat is a realistic Ethereum price target?\n\nThat said, I'm still bullish on Ethereum for the long haul. But not so much in the short term. It will take time to deal with the ramifications of Shanghai, especially if there is a short-term price dump. Any price volatility could panic investors if it lasts too long. And it will take time to push through all the really big blockchain innovations that are the keys to Ethereum ultimately boosting its transaction processing rate and lowering its transaction fees.\n\nA more realistic price target, in my opinion, is $3,000. Ethereum last hit this price a year ago in April 2022. Based on today's prices, that represents a gain of more than 50%. If and when Ethereum ever hits that target, that's when investors can have a discussion about a $10,000 price target."

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade prompts Ether withdrawals, but no stampede for exits - Forkast News",
        "content": "Holders of Ether, the native token of the US$231 billion Ethereum blockchain, started withdrawing the cryptocurrency after the so-called Shanghai upgrade was completed in the early morning of Thursday in Asia, but the price of Ether held up and analysts said the withdrawn amounts were in line with expectations.\n\nThe main feature of the upgrade is the capability for users known as validators to withdraw their staked Ether, or tokens deposited to support the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, the world\u2019s second-biggest, in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.\n\nAs of noon in Hong Kong, over 53,320 Ether (US$102 million) had been withdrawn, with another 558,4420 held by 268,820 validators awaiting withdrawal, according to data from Token Unlocks. The data tracker estimates withdrawals may reach 105,680 Ether in the next 12 hours. About 3,000 Ether were staked in the network post-upgrade.\n\nEther was changing hands at US$1,916 around Thursday noon in Hong Kong, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency has risen about 60% so far this year.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal amount we are seeing is something we [and the community] expected given that these stakers had committed their funds without a certain timeline for withdrawal,\u201d Jonathon Miller, managing director of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken Australia, told Forkast in an emailed comment on Thursday. Some large movements and volatility were expected, he said.\n\nCharlie McGlynn, head of decentralized finance trading at XREX, a Taipei-based fiat-crypto exchange, echoed those views. \u201cAll things considered, there is far from a massive rush to exit as many surmised would take place,\u201d he told Forkast on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a strong derisking event as users can now feel at ease to stake and unstake,\u201d McGlynn said. \u201cNew staking deposits can be expected to increase in the coming days and weeks.\u201d\n\nWith around 18 million Ether \u2013 worth about US$34.5 billion and about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged that holders could rush to sell Ether to lock in profits, which would drive prices lower. According to Coin Metrics estimates cited in a Tuesday Bloomberg report, users may withdraw 1.2 million Ether in the five days after the upgrade.\n\nHowever, Guilhem Chaumont, chief executive officer of crypto-financial service Flowdesk, points out that daily system limits on how much staked Ether can be withdrawn could itself prevent a sell off in the token. Only 115,200 withdrawals can be processed per day, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day, so while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip,\u201d he said in an emailed comment earlier this week.\n\nKen Timsit, head of Cronos Labs, the accelerator of the Cronos chain that links the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains, has cautioned that Ether stakers would monitor withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade is completed and may potentially overreact if there is significant withdrawal demand.\n\n\u201cOnce short-term volatility has been smoothed out, however, it is likely that the outcome will be neutral given that this upgrade has been priced into Ether value for some time,\u201d Timsit said in an emailed comment earlier this week."

In other words, nearly $200 million in potential selling pressure has entered the market.\n\nETH deposits vs. withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nBut Ether\u2019s price rise since Shanghai suggests that the market has had no problem absorbing any selling pressure arising from this event so far. It\u2019s also possible that most users have decided to hold onto their ETH staking rewards rather than sell them in anticipation of further gains.\n\nAbout 15% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply in circulation, nearly 120.4 million ETH, is currently staked.\n\nInterestingly, more than 70% of the ETH staked is still underwater compared to current price levels, according to data gathered by Dune Analytics.

The upgrade, also known as Shapella, was tested on the Sepolia and Goerli testnets and was finally implemented on the third and final Goerli testnet on March 15, 2023.

This upgrade is crucial for those who wish to become validators on the Ethereum 2.0 network, as they were required to stake at least 32 ETH to the network, which was sealed indefinitely. With the Shapella enhancement, this issue will be resolved.\n\nIt should be noted that the Shanghai-Capella upgrade launch was delayed by one month due to Sepolia testnet execution delays. Nevertheless, the upgrade is eagerly anticipated, as it represents a major move forward in Ethereum\u2019s evolution into a more efficient and scalable blockchain platform.\n\nIt is worthwhile to review Ethereum\u2019s recent transition from proof-of-work consensus mechanisms to proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. On September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent the Merge, one of the most significant transitions in the history of cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "Ethereum's Shapella upgrade is live, allowing stakers to withdraw ETH for first time in 28 months.\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nBreaking News\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrades are now live, allowing those who staked ETH in the blockchain network to withdraw their cryptocurrency for the first time.\n\nOn April 12, Ethereum Shanghai and Capella forks, colloquially called \u201cShapella,\u201d upgraded the network\u2019s execution and consensus layers respectively at epoch 194,048 to support Beacon Chain withdrawals.\n\nShapella is a major step in Ethereum development, introducing vital functionality to the network. ETH stakers, responsible for securing the Ethereum blockchain, are now able to withdraw their crypto from the Beacon Chain for the first time, 28 months after staking first went live, as part of Ethereum\u2019s transition to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm from Proof of Work.\n\n\u201cThe Shapella Upgrade represents a game-changing development that positions Ethereum for sustained growth and success,\u201d Chen Zhuling, Founder and CEO of RockX, a Proof of Stake node collective.\n\nShapella was Ethereum\u2019s first upgrade since The Merge transitioned the network to Proof of Stake consensus from Proof of Work, which reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.9% and new ETH issuance by more than 90%. Proof of Stake requires participants in the network to deposit the blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, while Proof of Work requires node operators to contribute energy.\n\nStakers in the Ethereum network get rewarded in ETH in exchange for their deposits. Ethereum stakers now must decide what to do with their accumulated rewards and initial position \u2014 a bond of 32 Ether.\n\nWill Stakers Exit Ethereum en Masse?\n\nThe implications of Shapella were fiercely debated by the crypto community as April 12 approached, with many pundits tipping that the upgrade could lead to a flood of ETH getting dumped on the open market.\n\n\u201cThere are a significant amount of accumulated rewards since the genesis of Ethereum, and node operators will now have access to them,\u201d Darren Langley, general manager of decentralized staking provider, Rocket Pool, told The Defiant, adding that stakers will have \u201cseveral options available to them.\u201d\n\nBut Langley thinks a post-Shapella staker exodus is unlikely, predicting that the majority of validators will choose to re-stake their to accumulate more rewards.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that operators will withdraw from staking in any great numbers,\u201d Langley continued. \u201cNode operators can exit now and be first in the queue to withdraw but we are not seeing exits build-up, which suggests most will continue to stake.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nSuperphiz, an organizer for the EthStaker community, told The Defiant that staking is bound to increase after Shapella. \u201cThe current participants took a huge risk that withdrawals would eventually be enabled,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that staking is de-risked, institutional investors are sure to experiment in the process.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s devs also placed a limit on the number of validators that can withdraw each day. The limit is 1,800, equating to 57,600 ETH or less than 0.05% of Ether\u2019s supply, according to Glassnode.\n\nStaking Participation\n\nEthereum is currently the largest PoS network by staked capitalization with $35.8B, despite the figure only representing 15.6% of ETH\u2019s supply, according to Staking Rewards.\n\nFor comparison, more than 60% of the circulating tokens for Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche, the second, third, and fifth-ranked PoS networks, are currently staked.\n\nDaniel Bar, the founder of Bitfwd Capital, told The Defiant that enabling validators to withdraw at any time will lead to greater rates of staking participation.\n\n\u201cWhile some believe it\u2019ll lead to an increase in sell pressure, I see it the other way around: [Shapella] will strengthen the confidence market participants have in staking ETH to generate yield,\u201d Bar said.\n\nMike Silagadze, the CEO of Ether.fi, a liquid staking platform, said there is \u201cno question\u201d that Ethereum staking participation will increase post-Shapella.\n\n\u201cI think there are a huge number of folks who have been interested in staking, but have stayed on the sidelines because they were worried that ETH staking withdrawals might never be enabled,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cWith that FUD addressed, I think we\u2019re going to see a steady influx of newly staked ETH in the coming weeks that far outstrips withdrawals.\u201d\n\nWill the Price of Ether Hold Up?\n\nWhile the price of ETH was up 20% in 30 days, some analysts fear Shapella will result in the market falling as some validators move to sell off their stake.\n\nThe latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report from CoinShares suggests institutional investors are waiting to see how Shapella will impact the markets before betting on the markets. According to the report, only $600,000 flowed into institutional ETH products over the week of April 11.\n\n\u201cDespite the Shapella upgrade occurring on the Ethereum network on April 12, [ETH] inflows have been relatively minor,\u201d CoinShares told The Defiant.\n\nBut Evans said Shapella will have a comparatively small impact compared to macroeconomic forces.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, told The Defiant that fears that Shapella will drive violent short-term price volatility are \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a cap on the amount of withdrawal actions that can be executed per block, which greatly limits the overall speed at which staked ETH can be withdrawn,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cFolks will also be staking additional ETH now that withdrawals are enabled and they know they can get it back. Combined, these flows paint a murky picture as to what the magnitude of the sell pressure will actually be.\u201d\n\nEvans said Shapella will have a comparatively small impact compared to macroeconomic forces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll likely see some volatility over the next few days and weeks as the market adjusts to the new functions that allow for withdrawals, but this will pale in comparison to broader market movements that remain sensitive to macroeconomic news,\u201d Evans said.\n\nMark Monfort, the director of web3 venture firm, NotCentralised, said that many stakers may have locked up their Ether at higher prices and be unwilling to realize a loss. \u201cWith the current price of Ether lower than when many users staked their funds, it\u2019s also possible that these holders may not want to sell at a loss, which could limit the impact on the market,\u201d Montfort told The Defiant.\n\nHsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of Blocto, said the long-term benefits Shapella will deliver to stakers and other staking service providers will significantly outweigh any short-term volatility caused by Ether withdrawals.\n\n\u201cExpectations of short-term price volatility\u2026 will give way to major market gains in intermediaries such as staking pools and crypto exchanges, notwithstanding incremental institutional interest in the asset class,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Does Shapella Mean for LSDs?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), which allow users to access liquid tokens representing underlying staked Ether while earning staking rewards, posted impressive growth amid the absence of staked Ether withdrawals.\n\nThe TVL of Lido, the largest LSD protocol, surged 92% to $11.3B since the start of the year, while its decentralization-focused rival, Rocket Pool, is up 112% at $1.2B, according to DeFi Llama. Their respective tokens, LDO and RPL, also rallied 138% and 120% since the start of January, according to CoinGecko.\n\nHowever, whether LSD protocols can sustain their impressive growth in a post-Shapella world is unclear, as the activation of staked Ether withdrawals solves one of the core problems underpinning the value proposition of LSDs.\n\n\u201c[Shapella] could have both positive and negative implications [for LSDs],\u2019 Monfort said. \u201cOn the one hand, the ability to withdraw staked Ether could make liquid staking less attractive for some users, as they no longer need to rely on a third-party provider to access their funds. On the other hand, liquid staking providers may still offer benefits such as liquidity and convenience, which could continue to attract users.\u201d\n\nThe LSD tokens offered by leading providers like Lido and Rocket Pool enjoy numerous integrations with leading DeFi protocols, such as Aave, MakerDAO, and Curve, providing yield opportunities that are not available to regular Ethereum stakers.\n\n\u201cMany stakers who withdraw will re-stake the bulk of their ETH rewards back to liquid staking providers like Lido and Frax,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThese players are in the best position to capture these flows, as they provide potential for immediate liquidity through on-chain pools, expansive utility of liquid staking tokens as collateral across DeFi, and convenient accessibility to innovative restaking primitives like EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s next major upgrade is expected to focus on EIP-4844, also known as proto-dank sharding. The fork is expected to take place around the start of 2024.\n\nResearchers anticipate that EIP-4844 will reduce the costs associated with transacting on Ethereum Layer 2. The upgrade will replace the blockspace-intensive \u201ccalldata\u201d currently tied to transaction data with \u201cblobs.\u201d Unlike calldata, Blobs do not compete with Ethereum transactions for gas usage, significantly reducing the blockspace needed to process transactions on L2.\n\nIn a recent appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Carl Beekhuizen of the Ethereum Foundation said the cost of storing data on-chain is the primary bottleneck restricting the scalability gains available at Layer 2.\n\n\u201cIf you scale to thousands and thousands of transactions, then all of a sudden it costs a lot just to [store the data] on-chain,\u201d Beekhuizen said. \u201cThe idea behind Danksharding and EIP-4844 is to provide really cheap data storage\u2026 so the L2s can provide cheap transactions to their users.\u201d\n\nOnce the upgrade takes effect, the Ethereum network will begin deleting historic transaction data that is older than 30 days, with infrastructure providers like the Etherscan block explorer expected to take on the responsibility of storing older data.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the Ethereum consensus protocol is not to guarantee storage of all historical data forever,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cRather, the purpose is to provide a highly secure real-time bulletin board, and leave room for other decentralized protocols to do longer-term storage.\u201d\n\nEIP-4844 will also pave the way for Ethereum to become sharded, where Ethereum\u2019s computational load is split across its L2 ecosystem and processed in parallel to deliver further scalability gains."

It has unlocked over $34 billion worth of ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain, allowing validators to withdraw their funds.\n\nAs of writing this article, there is $34 billion worth of ETH in the Beacon Deposit Contract (about 15% of Ethereum\u2019s entire circulating supply), which could have massive implications for the price of Ethereum should a large part of the funds be sold.\n\nIn this article, we are going to discuss how the sudden influx of newly released liquidity could impact Ethereum\u2019s price and examine what are the technical aspects of the Shanghai update.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai update key takeaways:\n\nThe Shanghai update for Ethereum launched on April 12, unlocking staked Ether (ETH) withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe price of Ethereum jumped over 3% in the hours post update, reaching an 8-month high price point of $1,990.\n\nThere is currently over $34 billion worth of Ether staked in the deposit contract, prompting concerns about what could happen to ETH\u2019s price if they find their way on exchanges.\n\nAbout 15,000 validators have already requested their ETH to be withdrawn and are currently in the exit queue. In other words, 480,000 ETH (about $1 billion at current prices) will be withdrawn from the deposit contract in the upcoming days.\n\nIn addition to unlocking staked ETH, the Shanghai upgrade has integrated several other EIPs designed to enhance the performance of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn recent months, Shapella has become the favorite name for the upcoming hard fork among the devs. It is a combination of Shanghai (the name of the upgrade of the execution layer) and Capella (the simultaneous upgrade of the consensus layer).\n\nWhat is the Shanghai update?\n\nThe Shanghai update is a hard fork for Ethereum that has, among other things, unlocked ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that launched in late 2020. The Beacon Chain can be thought of as the backbone of the Ethereum network, providing the consensus layer necessary for the Ethereum protocol to operate as a PoS system.\n\nThe ability for validators to withdraw their ETH is just one of the improvements that went live with the Shanghai update \u2013 here\u2019s the entire overview of EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that have been implemented as a part of the Shanghai update:\n\nEIP-3651 \u2013 Change the \u201cCOINBASE\u201d address to start as warm at the start of transaction execution to lower the gas cost.\n\n\u2013 Change the \u201cCOINBASE\u201d address to start as warm at the start of transaction execution to lower the gas cost.

EIP-6049 \u2013 Deprecate the use of the \u201cSELFDESTRUCT\u201d command due to a breaking change planned to this feature in the future.\n\nThe implications of staked ETH withdrawals\n\nMore than 18 million ETH (worth over $34 billion at the time of writing) has been deposited in the Ethereum staking contract since its 2020 launch. Source\n\nWith the launch of the Shanghai update, about $34 billion that has been locked on the Beacon Chain over the years has been unlocked. The first Ethereum validators deposited their funds on the Beacon Chain in December 2020, when Ethereum was trading at around $600.\n\nSince Ether is currently trading about 3 times higher, it is not unreasonable to assume that early ETH stakers might be looking to sell their staked funds for a profit. This could introduce massive selling pressure and decrease the price of ETH.\n\nAbout 480,000 ETH, worth close to $1 billion at the current market rates, have been requested for withdrawal on the first day after the mainnet update. Source\n\nIn fact, over 15,000 validators (480,000 ETH in total) have already requested their funds to be unstaked and are currently in the exit queue, according to data from Parsec.\n\nStaked ETH Withdrawal Limit: A maximum of 1350 validators (with 32 ETH per validator) per day will be able to withdraw their staked Ethereum, which amounts to about 0.2% of all staked assets. This should significantly reduce the potential impact of withdrawals on ETH price and ensure a sufficient number of validators is always available to support the network\u2019s uninterrupted operations.\n\nOn the other hand, validators not having their funds locked on the Ethereum blockchain might actually increase the demand for ETH. The reason for this is that many Ethereum holders might find staking Ethereum more attractive post-Shanghai, since their funds won\u2019t get locked and will be freely available for withdrawal.\n\nIn the long run, Shanghai could improve Ethereum\u2019s investment prospects and increase the number of users participating in securing the network by staking their coins. The end result would be a more robust proof of stake consensus and, subsequently, a more secure smart contract platform as a whole.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Shanghai, Capella, and Shapella?\n\nFor the longest time, the upgrade meant to bring staked Ethereum withdrawals was referred to as the \u201cShanghai\u201d update. However, in recent months, some other names started to emerge related to the upgrade \u2013 such as \u201cCapella\u201d and \u201cShappella\u201d \u2013 causing some confusion among Ethereum users.\n\nThe Shanghai update has different names depending on where it is implemented \u2013 either the execution or the consensus layer. Here\u2019s how that works:\n\nShanghai is the name of the upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s execution layer.\n\nis the name of the upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. Capella is the name of the Shanghai upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nis the name of the Shanghai upgrade on the consensus layer. Shapella is basically the combination of Shanghai and Capella, meant to describe the upgrade across both the execution and consensus layers.\n\nWhen did the Shanghai update launch?\n\nThe Shanghai update launched on April 12, 2023, at 6:27 PM ET. In terms of blockchain data, the upgrade was deployed on the mainnet at block height 6209536.\n\nInitially, the update was set to launch in March 2023, but the release date back got delayed. It is worth noting that the upgrade has previously been successfully implemented on Ethereum testnets \u2013 on the 28th of February on Sepolia, and on the 14th of March on Goerli.\n\nEthereum Shanghai upgrade price prediction: A bounce back to a new ATH?\n\nEthereum is predicted to nearly double its previous ATH and surpass $9,000 in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our algorithmically generated Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum could see notably positive price activity over the next 12 months and reach as high as $9,400 in April 2024. The road there could be bumpy, however.\n\nThe algorithm predicts the price of ETH to first increase to $2,500 in May, and then drop to $1,050 in the next 3 months. After that, a massive rally could commence that could see Ethereum nearly double its previous all-time high.\n\nThe bottom line: Shanghai update is ushering in a new era for Ethereum\n\nLast year, the historic Merge upgrade saw Ethereum transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism, reducing the power expenditure of Ethereum by over 99%. This year, the Shanghai update has taken Ethereum a step further, enabling validators to withdraw their ETH, which could turn out to be a major turning point for Ethereum\u2019s price in the long term.\n\nThe Shanghai update has earned Ethereum the top spot on our weekly-updated list of best cryptocurrencies to buy and the number one ranking in our selection of best altcoins to invest in."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) price has increased by 58% year to date, but it has far underperformed the market leader Bitcoin (BTC). In fact, the ETH/BTC price ratio has dropped to 0.063, its lowest level in nine months.\n\nAnalysts believe that the majority of the movement can be attributed to the Ethereum network's upcoming Shapella hard fork, which is scheduled for April 12 at 10:27 p.m. UTC.\n\nEther / Bitcoin price ratio at Binance. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum network upgrade will allow stakers to unlock their Ether rewards or stop staking entirely. By April 11, over 170,000 ETH withdrawals were requested, according to the analytics firm Glassnode. However, the total staked on the Beacon Chain exceeds 18.1 million ETH, which has traders fearful until more information on ETH\u2019s potential selling pressure becomes available.\n\nIs the price impact of the Shapella fork already priced in?\n\nThe staking unlock was widely known and expected, so traders could have anticipated the movement. Some analysts have gone so far as to call the hard fork a \u201cbuy the news\u201d event.\n\nLiterally everyone: \u201cEthereum Shanghai is a buy the news event because everyone thinks it is a sell the news event\u201d pic.twitter.com/TpyL1TDnPj \u2014 HORSE (@CanteringClark) April 9, 2023\n\nUsing a meme, trader CanteringClark is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the theory, but to invalidate the hypothesis, one must investigate potential reasons for ETH\u2019s underperformance other than the much anticipated hard fork.\n\nFor starters, the Ethereum network\u2019s average transaction fee has been above $5 for the past five weeks, and the Shapella fork does not address the issue, despite minor improvements. This alone lowers the chances of a bullish breakout following the upgrade, as most decentralized applications (DApps) and projects will continue to prefer second-layer and competing networks.\n\nFurthermore, volume at Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) has fallen by 84% since a weekly peak of $38.2 billion on March 5. The most recent data for the week ending April 2 was $6.4 billion, according to DefiLlama. In the same period, competing blockchains saw 60% lower volumes on average, a sign that Ethereum lost market share.\n\nAccording to Paul Brody, EY\u2019s global blockchain leader, one reason for Ether\u2019s price underperformance relative to Bitcoin could be \u201cthe battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized.\u201d Brody cites exchanges as highly centralized custodial validators, as well as some semi-centralized players and staking pool operations that invest funds from tens of thousands of individual crypto wallets.\n\nEther derivatives display balanced bets between bulls and bears\n\nLet's examine Ether derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders. For example, the open interest in Ether options for the weekly expiry on April 14 is $510 million, with neutral-to-bullish call instruments outnumbering protective put options by 36%.\n\nThose ETH options bulls could come up empty-handed because 60% of their bets were placed at $2,000 or higher. As a result, if Ether\u2019s price remains between $1,800 and $1,900 on April 14 at 8:00 am UTC, the outcome is balanced between call and put options. Furthermore, an expiry price between $1,900 and $2,000 represents a mere $100 million advantage for bulls, which is unlikely to justify the cost of a price pump.\n\nFutures markets should also be examined to determine whether the Shapella hard fork has caused investors to become more risk-averse. Ether quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, and they typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe premium on Ether futures is currently 2%, down from 4% the previous week. Despite being below the 5% neutral threshold, it shows no excessive short demand.\n\nRelated: Validator service to use API for ETH staking process\n\nTraders should monitor staking unlock requests\n\nBased on Ether derivatives, there is no reason to believe professional traders expect a significant price correction as a result of the staking unlock. Nonetheless, given the high transaction fees and declining DEX activity, the chances of a \u201cbuy the news\u201d event are slim.\n\nProfessional traders would have used derivatives instruments to bet against Ether\u2019s price because the event was widely publicized, which hasn\u2019t happened given the ETH futures\u2019 premium. There are no obvious reasons for a rally, but derivatives traders do not anticipate any panic selling. So, unless the number of staking unlock requests significantly increases, Ether should remain near $1,900 for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" often passes for sound fiscal advice.\n\nNot today.\n\nIn the minutes following the successful implementation of Ethereum's historic Shanghai upgrade, which Wednesday evening enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH by the network's participants, the price of ETH remained largely unchanged, even ticking slightly upwards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nETH stayed steady in the minutes following the merge, crawling up just a hair\u2014.21%\u2014 to $1919.50 at writing, according to CoinGecko. That's up roughly 3% since yesterday evening.\n\nMore significant than those paltry gains is the fact that ETH did not drop sharply in price following Shanghai's successful implementation, as was widely expected. Often, traders buy up stocks or cryptocurrencies in anticipation of a major event impacting that asset, then sell it off en masse once the event occurs.\n\nThat's what happened in September, when the merge event transitioned Ethereum to proof of stake. Despite the event's remarkable technical success, ETH plummeted some 8% immediately following the news, as traders offloaded their positions.\n\nShanghai, while certainly significant to the Ethereum ecosystem, appears to have avoided making the same impact on ETH. The upgrade completed Ethereum's shift to a proof of stake network\u2014in which users stake ETH with the network to validate on-chain transactions, and are reward for that participation with newly generated ETH\u2014by enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH from the network. Previously, the $35 billion worth of ETH deposited with Ethereum had been locked up and inaccessible.\n\nMaking a dip in ETH's price post-Shanghai even more likely was the fact that the upgrade would permit tens of billions of ETH to be withdrawn, sold, and flood the market. Analysts expected more than $300 million worth of ETH to be liquidated immediately following Shanghai's launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut neither that factor, nor Shanghai's position as a notable, tradable moment in Ethereum's history, appear to have impacted ETH's price whatsoever, at least not yet. Why?\n\nOne reason may be that the majority of staked ETH has been deposited with Ethereum via intermediary staking pools and centralized crypto exchanges, many of which issue staking tokens to customers. In that sense, much of the capital supposedly kept hostage pre-Shanghai has actually been liquid for some time.\n\n\"Most people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking programs, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\" Jacobc.eth, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, previously told Decrypt. \"So I don't think [Shanghai] actually represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\"\n\nMatthew Niemerg, co-founder of privacy-enhancing blockchain network Aleph Zero, recently concurred: \u201cTo be more direct, it's priced in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe difference between Shanghai's market impact, and that of the merge in September, could also be seen in how both events impacted ETH's price in the days leading up to their execution. In the five days preceding the merge, ETH's price dropped 10%. It would go on to drop another 15% in the days following. In the five day leading up to Shanghai, however, ETH climbed up 3%."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s Shapella upgrade, scheduled for around 10:30 pm UTC on April 12, has induced significant uncertainty among traders, according to a report by Kaiko.\n\nThe upgrade will enable staked Ether (ETH) withdrawals from the Beacon Chain for the first time since its launch in December 2020. According to previous estimates, the upgrade will add nearly 1.2 million to 3 million worth of ETH selling pressure in the first few weeks. This is one of the main reasons traders appear to be taking a cautious stance ahead of the upgrade.\n\nKaiko\u2019s report shows that ETH is lagging behind Bitcoin (BTC) in spot and futures trading volumes, while options market data shows traders are actively adding short-term hedging positions.\n\nEther displays muted trading data\n\nEthereum\u2019s market share in U.S. dollar trading volume compared to Bitcoin declined to March 2021 lows near 30%, per Kaiko data, showing that Ether has \u201cstruggled to maintain pace\u201d with Bitcoin spot volumes. During Ethereum\u2019s last big upgrade, the Merge, its market share relative to Bitcoin reached a high of 53%.\n\nSimilarly, the relative increase in the open interest (OI) volumes for Bitcoin has surpassed Ethereum considerably with the April 10 price surge above $30,000.\n\nOpen interest volumes for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Source: Kaiko\n\nThe ratio between Ethereum\u2019s spot and perpetual trading volumes also reflects the lack of trading interest. The ratio has dropped below the levels attained before the Merge.\n\nLastly, the options market also reflected the uncertainty around the upgrade. The report found that the implied volatility for Ethereum options contracts expiring in April has trended higher than all timelines for Bitcoin. It suggests that an increasing number of traders are looking to hedge their positions.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin implied volatility. Source: Kaiko\n\nWhen the demand for options increases, it implies that the market expects greater price swings in the underlying asset and, therefore, higher implied volatility.

The ETH/USD pair faces resistance at $2,000 from the technical and psychological points of view. The Moving Average Convergence and Divergence indicator, a momentum oscillator, has remained flat through Ether\u2019s latest price rise, showing a lack of bullish momentum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s falling market share compared with Bitcoin and muted trading interest relative to the Merge highlights the uncertainty in the market due to potential selling pressure after Shapella.\n\nThe lack of trading volumes and high options implied volatility can induce significant price volatility over the course of the month, especially when considering that sell pressure is expected to last for three to eight weeks after the upgrade.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nETH withdrawals are now live.\n\nAt 6:27 pm EST, Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade was successfully implemented, enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH and effectively finalizing the network\u2019s years-long transition to proof of stake.\n\nLast September, Ethereum successfully executed its highly anticipated merge event, forever changing both how ETH is created and how transactions on the Ethereum network are validated. The upgrade saw Ethereum transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in which users stake ETH with the network to validate on-chain transactions, and are rewarded for that participation with newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking debuted in 2020, participants have deposited over $34.56 billion worth of ETH with the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose funds, however\u2014and the rewards generated by them\u2014were not accessible to users, even after the merge. Only now, with Shanghai\u2019s implementation, are those funds available for withdrawal. And only now can Ethereum\u2019s transformation to a proof-of-stake network be considered complete.\n\nThe road to Shanghai has been a long one, marked by repeated concessions made by Ethereum\u2019s core developers to hasten the upgrade\u2019s release. Shanghai was originally meant to include numerous other improvements to the Ethereum network, including proto-danksharding\u2014a streamlined data-sampling process that would make layer-2 transactions on the network substantially cheaper and faster\u2014and EOF, a suite of much-needed updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the mechanism underlying the network that deploys smart contracts.\n\nThose updates were nixed from Shanghai, however, to ensure that ETH withdrawals were rolled out as quickly as possible. Even minute tweaks to Ethereum\u2019s encoding methods were punted from the upgrade, despite the fact that such decisions could mire the network in years of technical debt.\n\nThe pressure to release Shanghai made sense: the security and accessibility of tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency were on the line. And any flaws in the upgrade's execution could have spelled massive trouble for the network\u2014not just from upset users, but also from massive intermediaries like Lido and Coinbase that currently represent the majority of staking power on Ethereum. Government regulators are no doubt also watching closely.\n\nLuckily though, those immediate concerns are now in the rearview mirror. Once Ethereum reached its 194,048th epoch at 6:27 pm EST, the network's mainnet began forking to integrate the Shanghai upgrade. During the epoch, eight slots were missed, a standard amount typically representing nodes that had not yet updated their clients for Shanghai. But the Ethereum network continued processing transactions, the signal of a successful upgrade. Immediately thereafter, staked ETH withdrawals began processing smoothly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Shapella Upgrade was a STUNNING SUCCESS \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 WE MADE IT! \u2014 Ethprofit.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Ethprofit) April 12, 2023\n\nStakers who directly deposited at least 32 ETH (roughly $61,000 at writing) with Ethereum will now be able to withdraw the profits reaped by their deposits, or their entire deposit. That process is expected, due to demand and limited block space, to take several days.\n\nStakers who deposited their ETH through intermediary staking pools or centralized crypto exchanges will have to wait a bit longer. Lido has said staked ETH withdrawal capability will be introduced for customers in about a month; Coinbase, for its part, said its customers may have to wait several months before their staked ETH is accessible. Each intermediary ETH staking service will unroll withdrawals on its own timeframe."

Because obviously, we're seeing at least today, Ethereum off to the races here versus Bitcoin. I mean, up about almost 6% on the day. What are your takeaways from that? Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn't do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000. But anyone who staked that 30 to Ethereum had no guarantee they would even be able to withdraw.\n\nThese are the people who are the biggest believers, the maximalists of Ethereum, who really wanted to help secure the network. So now that they're getting the opportunity to withdraw, they're going to continue staking. I think there were more people. And I can speak to this anecdotally from fund managers that I speak to in institutions.\n\nThere are a lot more people who are actually waiting to deposit because they would then know that they would be able to withdraw at some point. So we're actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It's going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we've obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It's a internet of value. And I think that we're starting to see that separation in people's minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine. You don't have to really choose. I think that they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such."

Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan said that while proof-of-stake (PoS) took some time, the loop was finally complete.\n\nAt the Shapella watch party hosted by the Ethereum Foundation team, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said that the network is now in a \u201creally good place.\u201d He explained that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a stage where the hardest and the fastest parts of the Ethereum protocol\u2019s transition are basically over. Very significant things still need to be done, but those can be done at a slower pace.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, crypto singer Jonathan Mann celebrated the new update with another song performance at the Shapella watch party.\n\nCan we make this image a meme? pic.twitter.com/vC2pwKkLXd \u2014 songadaymann.lens (@songadaymann) April 12, 2023\n\nWhile some celebrated the event, others looked forward to the network\u2019s future. Ethereum community member Anthony Sassano reminded the community that the next major feature would be EIP-4844, which aims to enhance the scalability of rollups on Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price turns bullish ahead of next week\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades\n\nMeanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode expects that even though the Shapella update will unlock staked ETH, less than 1% are planning to sell. The analytics company said that only 253 validators had signed up to exit. Apart from this, there are also mechanisms in place to prevent a massive flood of ETH supply from being dumped in the markets at the same time.\n\nOne of the expected effects of the Shapella update is the onboarding of more institutional investors to Ethereum. Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, foresees that there may be more interest in ETH staking opportunities from larger investors since there\u2019s a clear withdrawal option in place now.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Recover? Here\u2019s What Will Help ETH Go Up Again - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Will Ethereum Recover? Here\u2019s What Will Help ETH Go Up Again\n\nMany cryptocurrency investors are wondering if Ethereum will recover from the bear market and reach new all-time highs.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading about 60.6% down from the all-time highs it reached in November of 2021. In order to evaluate Ethereum\u2019s chances of closing this gap and ascending to new highs, we\u2019ll analyze what has been happening in the ETH markets and point out some of the key fundamental factors which could drive Ethereum\u2019s recovery.\n\nBefore we tackle the question of whether Ethereum will recover, let\u2019s take a look at the context in which the Ethereum market finds itself right now. One of the more important questions we should ask ourselves is whether ETH has already found a price bottom in 2022 or if we could see even lower price levels in the future.\n\nHas Ethereum bottomed out already?\n\nEthererum has already recovered to some extent from the bear market lows it hit in June 2022. The price of ETH bottomed out at around $940, which was reached on June 18, 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at about $1,870, which is an increase of 98.9% compared to the June 2022 low. This makes it quite likely that the $940 price level was the bottom of the ETH bear market.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that there is a chance ETH could still explore new lows. The 2022 ETH crash was significant, but quite a bit softer than the price drop ETH saw in 2018. If history is going to repeat itself, ETH could find a bottom below $940 before the next crypto bull run.\n\nEthereum reached its all-time high in the 2021 cryptocurrency bear market, when ETH hit a peak of $4,850 in November 2021. When Ethereum hit its $940 low in June 2022, that represented an 80.6% decline from peak to bottom.\n\nIn the previous market cycle, Ethereum reached a peak of $1,570 in January of 2018. It bottomed out in December 2018 at a price of $84. This was a decrease of 94.6% from peak to bottom.\n\nFactors that will help Ethereum\u2019s recovery\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether Ethereum will go back up in the future, let\u2019s take a look at some of the main catalysts that could have a positive impact on the ETH price.\n\nLayer 2 technologies are making Ethereum much cheaper and faster to use\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest issues so far has been its lack of scalability. This became painfully evident in the 2021 bull market, when very strong demand for transactions on the Ethereum network resulted in exorbitant transaction fees. This provided a tailwind for competing blockchains like BNB Chain, Avalanche and Solana, which attracted users with lower fees and faster transactions. Even though competing chains often made compromises regarding decentralization, the fees on Ethereum were high enough that many users were willing to take the trade-off.\n\nOne of the main ways in which developers are approaching Ethereum scalability is by creating layer 2 platforms that leverage the security of the highly decentralized Ethereum network while performing some operations off-chain for increased efficiency.\n\nSo far, most Ethereum layer 2s have been using optimistic rollups technology\u2014this category includes the likes of Optimism, Arbitrum and Boba Network. However, there are also layer 2 projects based on zero-knowledge rollup technology, which is more difficult to implement but could deliver much bigger efficiency improvements. Some examples of such projects include ZKSync, Scroll and Polygon zkEVM.\n\nThere\u2019s also efforts on the Ethereum base layer to improve scalability. For example, the EIP-4844 proposal, also known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d, seeks to made it cheaper for rollup-based layer 2s to add data to Ethereum blocks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s successful move to Proof-of-Stake and reduced ETH issuance\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum moved away from its previous Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and adopted Proof-of-Stake. This did not only make Ethereum much more friendly to the environment, but has also made ETH a better investment.\n\nThe reason why the transition to Proof-of-Stake has made ETH a better long-term hold is that the new Proof-of-Stake system needs to issue much fewer ETH to sustain itself.\n\nWhen Ethereum had Proof-of-Work consensus, the protocol had to issue around 13,000 ETH daily in order to reward miners. Meanwhile, only about 1,600 ETH needs to be issued per day to compensate stakers in the new Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nCombined with the previously introduced EIP-1559 upgrade, the transition to Proof-of-Stake is providing deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH. According to ETH supply tracker ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by 83,989 ETH since the upgrade to Proof-of-Stake. If Ethereum were still using Proof-of-Work, the supply would have increased by 2.34 million ETH in the same time period.\n\nEthereum is firmly positioned at the top of the smart contracts sector\n\nEthereum has established itself as a center of innovation in the crypto and blockchain space, as major developments like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens were initially popularized on Ethereum before other blockchain projects also came on board.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum represents close to 60% of the decentralized finance ecosystem in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), according to DeFi aggregator DeFiLlama. Ethereum-based rollups have also seen traction in DeFi, with Arbitrum ranking as the 4th largest DeFi platform and Optimism taking 6th place.\n\nAnother measure of Ethereum\u2019s dominance is the amount that users are willing to pay in fees in order to transact on the Ethereum network. According to cryptofees.info, the Ethereum network has collected $5.8 million in daily fees on average over the last 7 days. The next closest blockchain, Bitcoin, has collected about $750,000 in daily fees in the same time period.\n\nIf we are going to see another cryptocurrency bull market, it\u2019s likely that Ethereum will be one of its biggest beneficiaries.\n\nEthereum has already established a dominant position in the smart contracts sector, and has a development community and ecosystem that\u2019s unmatched in the crypto and blockchain space. With the rapid improvements we\u2019re seeing in Ethereum layer 2s, Ethereum is poised to offer sufficient scalability for the next generation of decentralized protocols.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth highlighting that ETH gained a lot of strength against BTC in the 2021 bull market, and the ETH/BTC pair has kept most of its gains even during the crypto bear market.\n\nEthereum 2023 price prediction\n\nNow that we\u2019ve taken a look at the most important fundamental factors that could help Ethereum\u2019s recovery, let\u2019s check out what the price prediction algorithm is suggesting in terms of ETH price action.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price prediction for 2023 is forecasting that the price of Ethereum will drop in June and July of 2023, although it is not predicting new lows in the Ethereum market. Per the prediction, the lowest price ETH will reach in 2023 is around $1,050.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price prediction on CoinCodex is a lot more optimistic over a longer time period, and is even predicting that ETH will break new all-time highs and approach the $10,000 mark in 2024.\n\nOf course, making a prediction becomes increasingly difficult the further into the future the algorithm is trying to forecast, so it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these projections are based on past price performance and current technical indicators.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say for sure whether ETH will go back up, but we can safely say that Ethereum\u2019s chances are as good as any other cryptocurrency\u2019s.\n\nIn the coming months and years, Ethereum is expected to see significant improvements in scalability, which will allow it to serve a larger number of users in the next cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nEthereum is also likely to be at the center of any major innovations in the blockchain space, as it\u2019s the most obvious place to build blockchain-based applications thanks to its strong ecosystem of developers and development tools.\n\nETH could also be one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold over the long term due to the deflationary pressure introduced by the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the EIP-1559 upgrade. In addition, Ethereum staking provides an extra incentive for users to hold on to their ETH."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a noteworthy resurgence, breaking the $2,000 price barrier for the first time since August 2022. The Bitcoin (BTC) rival has seen a 4% increase over the past 24 hours. It is currently trading at $2,004 on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage by tradingview.com\n\nSeveral key factors have contributed to this remarkable rise, renewing investor interest in the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nFirst, the successful launch of Shapella, Ethereum's first major upgrade since The Merge, has played a significant role in the price surge. Shapella enables validators to withdraw their staked Ether (ETH). Notably, the chief altcoin has defied market expectations of increased selling pressure.\n\nSecond, recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand declined by 0.5% in March. This drop in inflation, which surpassed the estimated 0.1% and the previous month's -0.1%, has potentially influenced the ETH rally.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics, a U.K.-based economic research consultancy, recently predicted that good PPI numbers could prevent another Federal Reserve rate hike, which could potentially bode well for risk assets."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s planned Shanghai hard fork is nearly here. Planned for April 12, this is the first major upgrade since the Merge in September 2022. The \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade (a combination of the two major proposals, Shanghai and Capella), includes EIP-4895, which enables validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain (Consensus layer) to the EVM (execution layer). The execution layer is the fun and friendly Ethereum thausers have come to know and love.\n\nWhy is this a big deal? With just over 18 million ETH currently staked (valued at just over $33 billion at the time of writing), some of which has been locked up for years, the possibility of these tokens flooding an already teetering market is enough to get some holders ready to sell the news once withdrawals are enabled.\n\nFor holders who are both long and short ETH post-withdrawals, it\u2019s likely to be a significant event, and on-chain activity suggests many feel the same: activity around liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) can be a useful gauge for what the market might do post-unlock.\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives could exert influence over Beacon Chain unlocks\n\nWhat are liquid staking derivatives? They are a relatively new financial instrument born of DeFi that functions like bearer instruments for staked ETH. Similar to how borrowing and lending protocols give users a share token to represent locked collateral (think Aave\u2019s a-tokens), staking ETH generates a wrapped asset used to claim the equivalent amount of Ethereum from the staking platform. When a staker deposits ETH with major platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Frax, Stakewise and now Coinbase, they receive a platform-specific flavor of LSD. Because staked tokens are illiquid, these wrapped assets allow stakers to continue earning rewards while securing the network without completely giving up the opportunity to participate in other activities within DeFi.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives aim to solve these problems by allowing staked assets to be traded on secondary markets. This means that stakers could access the value of their staked ETH before the Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawals or, in the future, while maintaining their staked position. For example, a staker could use their wrapped ETH as collateral on another platform, or cover an unexpected expense by selling their LSD on a secondary market.\n\nRocket Pool, Lido, Coinbase and Frax\n\nThough the markets have seen what seems to be an increasing string of green days, with Ethereum rapidly catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date performance, ETH's gains are set against a backdrop of volatility among LSDs and staking tokens.\n\nLido\u2019s LDO hasn\u2019t recaptured its high from early March and has maintained a resistance at $2.75. The largest staking protocol by nearly an order of magnitude, Lido currently offers some of the highest staking rewards among major providers, with an average APY around 10%. The high rewards are no surprise: Lido took in nearly 50 million ETH in fees and 5 million in revenue in March, with April on track to meet or exceed those numbers.\n\nLDO versus ETH price. Source: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s RPL fared much better, with a 25% increase over the last thirty days. The wrapped asset issued by the number three staking provider by TVL, rETH, has historically traded at a premium to ETH and other LSDs, likely a result of the provider\u2019s reputation as the most decentralized staking solution available to holders today, making rETH a desirable LSD to hold.\n\nOver the last thirty days, Rocket Pool has seen over $46 million in inflows, with many likely hoping to cash in on rETH\u2019s premium when withdrawals are enabled. Rocket Pool\u2019s average APY according to DeFiLlama is around 3.65%, which isn\u2019t as high as other providers, but with over 1,800 active Rocket Pool nodes, the decentralized nature of the protocol is attractive. Addresses holding RPL have been steadily increasing as well.\n\nConversely, LSDs from the two top staking providers, Lido and Coinbase, both trade at a discount to spot ETH. Together representing nearly 90% of all staked ETH, it\u2019s unsurprising that Lido and Coinbase have both come under scrutiny as centralizing entities given their concentration of staked ETH.\n\nEthereum LSD providers share of staked ETH. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nDespite RPL\u2019s impressive performance and StakeWise\u2019s native token SWISE\u2019s 15% gain, Frax seems to have come out as the winner.\n\nFrax Ether has seen the most significant jump in total value locked over the last 30 days compared to the other top 10 staking providers at 14% growth for a $244 million valuation. Despite the increase in TVL, Frax totaled only $3.1 million in inflow over thirty days, putting the protocol just above StakeWise\u2019s $2.6 million.\n\nTotal value locked in Frax. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nLiquid staking derivatives like the wrapped Ether offered by staking providers is an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem much like plasma is an essential part of human blood. DeFi, NFT trading and GameFi are all interlinked, sometimes more subtly than others.\n\nLSDs perform an important function of maintaining liquidity within the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently, over 15% of all Ether that exists is staked with a Beacon Chain validator (meaning this doesn\u2019t include any ETH being used as collateral on borrowing/lending platforms).\n\nConsidering that a non-trivial amount of that ETH has been locked for years, through one of the toughest bear markets on top of that, indefinitely freezing this much capital (worth over $33 billion at the time of writing) would have a lasting and noticeable effect on the entire ecosystem.\n\nOver the last 30 days though, trying to hedge against the chaos post-Shapella by holding unstaked ETH didn\u2019t perform much better than holding an LSD: ETH is up 31% compared to stETH\u2019s 30%, rETH\u2019s 30%, while Coinbase\u2019s cbETH is up 32% and Frax\u2019s LSD is up 34%.\n\nOverall, liquid staking derivatives are an important development in the staking ecosystem, as they help to address some of the challenges associated with staking, while also expanding the pool of potential participants in the ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Ethereum traders show uncertainty ahead of April 12\u2019s Shapella hard fork: Report\n\nWithdrawals being enabled for staked Ethereum on the Beacon Chain means that proof-of-stake Ethereum has reached a point of sufficient stability and security, and the stakers who participated in securing the network will be able to retrieve their staked funds.\n\nRegardless of the immediate impact of enabled withdrawals, proof-of-stake Ethereum\u2019s continued success relies on incentivizing ETH holders to validate the network, and liquid staking derivatives have proven to be an effective mechanism to do so.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Uniswap is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange that supports swaps between Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. Unlike existing centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges do not have an order book, and numerous liquidity providers deposit Ethereum or ERC-20 tokens in a 'liquidity pool' to provide transaction liquidity.\n\nGyeongmin Kim, CMO of RIPPLEREUM, said, \"On the RIPPLEREUM platform, users can register various types of cards they have on and off-line 'RIPPLEREM (RPRM) Smart Card', and with one RIPPLEREUM smart card, they can expand and use the app ecosystem.\"\n\nThe ultimate goal of the RIPPLEREUM project is to build a smart card that can be used more conveniently in real life by building a network that enables fast remittance through business modeling of Ripple.\n\nThe RPRM Card Wallet, which will be supported in the future, will be expanded and developed in a hybrid form to enable services such as payment, exchange, remittance, and withdrawal operated and managed under the principle of free market transaction of legal currency and cryptocurrency through the RPRM Payment Platform Gateway.\n\nIn addition, RPRM Payment will first apply closed blockchain-based operation and FIDO security to protect personal information and prevent forgery/falsification of data, and store and manage transaction contents without loss. Through technological advancement, RPRM Payment Platform for all members and consumer-oriented smart card system is established through smart cards based on a new payment platform called RPRM. In addition, we are trying to decentralize by converting to an open block chain, such as introducing a policy voting system, and preparing to issue a service-type card for transportation and living convenience and a multi-function card.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to announce the RIPPLEREUM token to users around the world through the Uniswap Exchange listing on April 17th,\" he said, adding that he is continuously pushing for listing on other cryptocurrency exchanges since the listing on the Uniswap exchange.\n\nStory continues\n\nSocial Links\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ripplereum_RPRM\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/ripplereum_rprm\n\nMedia Contact\n\nBrand: Ripplereum\n\nContact: Gyeongmin Kim\n\nE-Mail: rprm@ripplereum.io\n\nWebsite: http://ripplereum.io\n\nSOURCE: Ripplereum"

        "title": "What Is Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade? ETH Staking Withdrawals Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade will unlock millions of ETH currently being staked.\n\nNot all locked ETH will be unlocked at the same time.\n\nShapella also consists of smaller upgrades that will go live on Wednesday.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most used blockchain in the industry, will undergo a historical upgrade to its network in a few hours. The Shanghai upgrade is set to enable ETH staking withdrawals and permanently move Ethereum to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nHowever, not everyone understands what this upgrade actually means. Let\u2019s look at the Shanghai upgrade and its implications for Ethereum and its users.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain that will take place on April 12 at 11:27 PM UTC. The Shanghai upgrade will come bundled with Capella, another upgrade. The two upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), are called Shapella.\n\nIt's happening \ud83c\udf8a\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023 \ud83d\udcc6\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is known chiefly for enabling ETH staking withdrawals. Until today, Ethereum users had to deposit and lock 32 ETH to become validators and help secure the Ethereum network.\n\nWith the Shanghai fork, also known as EIP-4895, validators can finally withdraw their staked ETH for the first time since 2020. There are currently over 18.1 million ETH, worth $34 billion at the time of writing, locked in the Beacon Chain deposit contract.\n\nDoes this mean that all 18.1 million ETH will be available for withdrawal immediately? No, validators will be able to withdraw only 43,000 ETH per day, potentially limiting the impact on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOther Upgrades Inside Shapella\n\nWhile EIP-4895 is the most known upgrade within Shapella, there are other minor upgrades that the Shapella fork will bring.\n\nOne of them is EIP-3651, aimed at lowering gas costs related to Maximal Extractable value (MEV) payments when accessing the COINBASE address (COINBASE doesn\u2019t refer here to the crypto exchange but to a piece of software that allows developers to receive new tokens).\n\nAnother upgrade is EIP-3855. This upgrade introduces a new instruction PUSH0, which lowers gas costs for developers. EIP-3860 limits developer gas costs in specific cases, and EIP-6049, deprecates the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to limit gas costs.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade will take place on April 12 at 11:27 PM UTC. Readers can watch it live on YouTube and follow it on social media platforms like Twitter.\n\nShapella Watch Party\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nNo one knows exactly how the price of ETH will react to ETH staking withdrawals being enabled.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai/Shapella upgrade is one of the biggest upgrades in recent years. Ethereum validators will finally be able to withdraw their staked ETH. If the event negatively impacts the price, investors can scoop up some cheap ETH.\n\nRead more about ETH staking withdrawals:\n\nEthereum Staked ETH Withdrawals Coming Next Week: What It Means for You\n\nRead more about the rising NFT sales on Polygon:\n\nPolygon NFT Sales Surpass Solana, Now Trail Only Ethereum"

        "title": "More Than $300 Million in Ethereum Will Be Sold After Shanghai, Analysts Say - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Analysts at Glassnode estimate that roughly 170,000 Ethereum, worth approximately $326 million, will be sold following today's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade, also known by its consensus layer name \"Capella,\" will finally let users withdraw ETH that has been locked up on the Ethereum network over the last two years.\n\nEthereum began its transition to a proof-of-stake network in December 2020, enabling validators and other interested stakers to begin earning passive rewards on ETH pledged to the network. It completed the transition last September following the \"merge,\" an upgrade that combined the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake beacon chain.\n\nUsers who've staked their Ethereum, however, haven't been able to withdraw their initial deposits or rewards. But all that changes later today.\n\nGlassnode researchers today stated in a report that of the newly unlocked sum, approximately 70,000 ETH will come from validators exiting the network, pulling their staked holdings with them. The report indicates that there are 253 depositors waiting to do precisely this, but analysts added that \"withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position.\"\n\nThe remaining 100,000 ETH is expected to come from users withdrawing their staking rewards to sell on the market. Glassnode analysts said they only expect roughly $133 million worth of ETH to \"actually become liquid\" following the activation of withdrawals.\n\nProof-of-stake networks work by having validators secure the network, as opposed to miners on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin. Anyone can become a validator on Ethereum by staking 32 ETH (roughly $60,000) and begin earning rewards for doing so. If a validator acts maliciously, they face a penalty known as \"slashing\" that deducts ETH from their staked sum.\n\nDespite projecting upwards of $326 million in Ethereum potentially hitting the market, Glassnode's report concludes that the move \"is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be,\" adding that should the Shanghai upgrade go off without a hitch, it \"will bolster a growing staking industry.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also worth noting that withdrawal requests will enter a queue, and not all withdrawal requests will be processed on day one. Individual stakers may have to wait at least two or three days before receiving their funds, and stakers making use of pooling services such as Lido or centralized providers like Coinbase might need to wait weeks if not months. This means that any ETH being withdrawn from the staking contract won't hit the market all at once.\n\nWho's selling staked Ethereum?\n\nOther analysts, including CoinShares research associate Marc Arjoon, agree that the effects of Shanghai on the Ethereum market will likely be muted in the short term.\n\nArjoon told Decrypt that this has a lot do with liquid staking solutions such as Lido Finance\n\nThough withdrawals for Lido Finance are also contingent on withdrawals on Ethereum also becoming available, users have been able to swap their staked Ethereum tokens (stETH) for ETH on exchanges like Curve Finance.\n\nWhen depositing Ethereum on a liquid staking platform, users get an equivalent staked version of Ethereum that can be used elsewhere in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), such us non-custodial lending and trading platforms.\n\nWhy Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD\n\n\"If those takers wanted to exit the market, they could simply sell their tokens on the secondary market for a one-to-one ratio,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nArjoon also believes that many of the \"tech-savvy\" stakers who have the 32 ETH needed to become validators are unlikely to sell their stashes.\n\n\"They decided to stake their ETH with an indefinite lockup period, and that's likely because they believe in using ETH as a store of value,\" said Arjoon. \"That\u2019s why I also think that that cohort majority is unlikely to sell.\u201d\n\nSo who's dumping their staked ETH? \"Different entities like businesses, colleges, and other things that just can't be identified using the [wallet] addresses,\" are the most likely to sell, said Arjoon. \"To be conservative, I would say that 50% of those entities would withdraw and sell their ETH.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

However, ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nAs a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $1,900 level. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,850 swing low to the $1,938 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also showing a few bearish signs below the $1,865 support.\n\nIf there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The main resistance is now forming near the $1,925 and $1,940 levels.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,925 level with a follow-up move above $1,940 might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. The next major resistance might be $2,120. Any more gains could set the pace for a test of the $2,200 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,850 swing low to the $1,938 high.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 zone, below which ether price might decline toward the $1,825 level. If there is a break below $1,825, the price might extend its decline toward $1,780.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,880\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The surge comes after the successful Shapella upgrade implemented at 10:27 pm UTC on April 12.\n\nEther hitting the $2,000 mark. Source: Cointelegraph Price Index\n\nThe upgrade allows staked ETH withdrawals for users who previously had no way to take back their funds after staking. Even though a new supply of ETH hit the markets, suggesting a potential dump, the price of ETH still managed to hit $2,000 and currently maintains the level at the time of writing.\n\nOn April 12, crypto analytics firm Glassnode predicted that only around 1% of staked ETH may hit the market after Shapella goes live. According to the firm, only 253 depositors have signed up to withdraw their staked ETH positions. The firm expressed confidence that the newest update on the network will not have a \u201cdramatic\u201d effect on the price of Ether.\n\nAfter the hard fork was seamlessly executed on the Ethereum mainnet, a total of 12,859 ETH, worth almost $26 million at the time of writing, was unlocked in 4,333 withdrawals just within the first hour after withdrawals were enabled.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price turns bullish ahead of next week\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades\n\nRight after the upgrade, the community celebrated the new milestone with various sentiments. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in a livestream that Ethereum is currently in a \u201creally good place.\u201d Buterin highlighted that there is a lot more to be done, but it can be done at a slower pace.\n\nCrypto exchanges have also expressed their support for ETH unstaking. Coinbase and BitGo have already enabled withdrawals on their exchanges. Binance said that it will support withdrawals on April 19. Meanwhile, Kraken started withdrawing validators for United States users on April 11 and started processing as soon as the Shapella upgrade was implemented.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "content": "In recent months, Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in price, surpassing multiple resistance levels. However, the bullish momentum appears to be fading, and the cryptocurrency is currently having difficulty in continuing its upward trend. As of now, ETH is struggling to maintain its position and surpass a significant resistance region.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a significant rally when it found support at the 200-day moving average of $1.4K. However, as the price approached the crucial resistance level of $2K, the bullish momentum began to wane.\n\nBecause of that, the strength of the $2K resistance zone, and the divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, ETH seems more likely to enter a consolidation correction zone soon. It\u2019s essential to keep a close eye on the RSI indicator, as it\u2019s nearing the overbought zone, which could increase the chances of a correction or reversal.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe rally came to a halt when it reached the upper trendline of the ascending channel in the 4-hour timeframe. Although the price tried to surpass the trendline a second time, it was rejected, leading to a slight drop. If the cryptocurrency manages to break through the $2K resistance region and the upper threshold of the channel, it could spark a bullish rally toward the next resistance level.\n\nHowever, if the price declines, the mid-boundary of the channel and the $1.7K level will serve as crucial support zones. Notably, ETH has formed a double-top price action pattern at the $2K resistance region, confirming the bearish scenario.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has increased in recent months, approaching the $2,000 level. While some investors are optimistic that the bear market is ending, the futures market shows a concerning signal.\n\nThis chart displays the Taker Buy Sell ratio for Ethereum, which determines whether the bulls or the bears are executing their orders more aggressively and helps forecast short-term market movements. Positive values are considered bullish, while negative ones are interpreted as bearish.\n\nCurrently, the Taker Buy Sell ratio has been consistently decreasing and has fallen below zero. This suggests that a pullback or even a reversal in Ethereum\u2019s value may occur in the following weeks. It is important to monitor this metric closely as it provides valuable insights for the short term."

        "content": "Ethereum mainnet successfully completed the Shapella upgrade on April 12, meaning that Ethereum validators can finally withdraw their staked Ether on the Beacon Chain.\n\nA total of 126,955.07 ETH were withdrawn by validators at the time of writing. Presently, 248,043 out of the 559,549 active validators, or about 44% of them, have the ability to request a partial or full withdrawal. The majority of withdrawals currently vary between 2.8 to 3.2 ETH (ETH), indicating the majority of the validators are only withdrawing their staking rewards.\n\nTotal staked ETH withdrawal.

The ETH price is currently trading just under $2,000 with the price acting as key resistance.\n\nStaked ETH data and exchange holdings. Source: Nansen\n\nMajor crypto exchanges have announced their support for the ETH unstaking with several exchanges already processing withdrawal requests.

Congratulations to the @Ethereum community! ETH unstaking is now enabled on https://t.co/bCG11KNnW0. https://t.co/JcTxAVphGZ \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) April 12, 2023\n\nBitGo chief operating officer Chen Fang took to Twitter to announce that the custodian has upgraded to Shapella successfully, and ETH withdrawals are now live on the platform.\n\nKraken, on the other hand, started withdrawing validators for their United States customers on April 11 and began processing withdrawals of ETH after the completion of the Shapella upgrade. The early withdrawal of validators by the exchange is caused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission action brought against Kraken\u2019s Ethereum staking product back in February.\n\nFor clarity:\n\n\n\nValidators are currently able to exit but the associated 32 ETH stake and consensus layer rewards are not able to be withdrawn (aka moved around) until Shapella goes live in around 12 hours\n\n\n\nWhat Kraken is doing right now is exiting their validators \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) April 12, 2023\n\nRelated: Upcoming Shapella upgrade fuels liquid staking growth \u2014 AMA with Swell\n\nKraken Australia Managing Director Jonathon Miller told Cointelegraph that even though such a high quantity of ETH unstaking might cause some price volatility it will bring users to the ecosystem in the long run. He explained:\n\n\u201cWhilst this unlocking event may create conditions for an exodus from the staking protocol, the ability to freely stake and unstake (in accordance with bonding periods specified by the protocol) could equally attract many ETH holders. The move to unstaking could see a massive movement of assets into Ethereum staking pools.\u201d\n\nBinance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volume, said it would support the Shappela upgrade and start the withdrawal processing requests starting from April 19.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Pending For Withdrawal Rise Rapidly, Uptrend In Jeopardy? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The long-awaited Shanghai and Capella update of Ethereum officially went live yesterday at 6:30 am EST. The hard fork has gone off without a hitch and is the first major upgrade to the protocol since \u201cThe Merge\u201d on September 15, 2022.\n\nFor the first time in over two years, stakers and validators are able to withdraw their staked ETH from the Beacon Chain. And contrary to some alarming fears, the ETH price has so far failed to plummet.\n\nThe Latest Numbers On Pending Ethereum Withdrawals\n\nAccording to token.unlocks, about two hours after the Ethereum upgrade, about 17,350 ETHs were withdrawn, and 128 ETH were deposited. The number of ETH waiting for withdrawal at that time was around 319,000 ETH (about $563 million).\n\nSince then, however, the number has increased significantly. As of press time, there were 704,416 ETH waiting to be withdrawn, according to data from Nansen. The total number of staked ETH on the Beacon Chain including rewards was 19,227,545 ETH. This means that about 3.6% of all staked ETH are currently waiting to be withdrawn.\n\nThe number of validators waiting for a full exit was 19,621, with the total number being 567,209 validators. The net outflow since the update was activated is -55,438 ETH.\n\nIt is worth noting that the average price of all stakers is $1,973, according to Nansen, which is just above the current price. ETH thus only needs to increase by 3% for the average staker to be in profit.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics tools, Huobi ranks first with 27.5% of entities waiting to unwind their staked ETH, followed by others (19%), PieDAO (15.7%), Kraken (13.6%), and Heavy Dex Trader 0xa3d (10.1%).\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the large number of ETH withdrawals on Huobi is mainly related to the transfer of new and old shareholders, as reported by Chinese journalist Colin Wu. After the withdrawal is completed, the former owner of Huobi, Li Lin, has to do a handover. \u201cSome ETH may be withdrawn and then deposited again.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official Ethereum website, no transaction fee is required for the withdrawals, as the withdrawals do not compete with the execution level block space. Moreover, the website states that a maximum of 16 withdrawals can be processed in a single block.\n\nThis means that 115,200 withdrawals will be processed by validators in a single day. Subsequently, Ethereum predicts that 400,000 withdrawals will take 3.5 days, 600,000 withdrawals will take 5.2 days, and 800,000 withdrawals will take 7 days.\n\nETH Price Trends Up\n\nThe current data suggests that there is no rush among investors to unstake ETH. Thus, fears about an ETH dump appear to be proving unwarranted. With the current numbers, the initial withdrawals could be fully settled in as little as a week. The impact on the price is likely to be rather marginal.\n\nAccordingly, the ETH price currently looks very bullish. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,921, eyeing a break above $2,000.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "There\u2019s never a dull moment on the blockchain. Here\u2019s what you need to know this week:\n\n\uec24 Ether revisited $2,000 after a major upgrade. What the Shapella update means for Ethereum, and the next steps on the blockchain\u2019s roadmap. \uec24 Key cryptoverse quotes. Rep. Tom Emmer\u2019s searing remarks to SEC Chair Gary Gensler during a congressional hearing, and reactions to a new stablecoin bill. \uec24 Noteworthy numbers. The price tag for a pair of digital Air Force 1s, and other key stats from the week.\n\nRAISE THE STAKES\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade was a success. What\u2019s next for the blockchain?\n\nLast Wednesday, Ethereum pulled off its second major upgrade in less than a year, known as Shapella. This latest technical milestone \u2014 following last September\u2019s Merge \u2014 enabled ETH stakers to withdraw locked-up ETH for the first time ever, finalizing the blockchain\u2019s transition to the 99% more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system for verifying transactions. But Ethereum still has an extensive roadmap of improvements ahead, including updates that will enhance its scalability, security, and usability.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how ETH\u2019s price reacted to Shapella and what\u2019s coming next on its roadmap.\n\nHow has ETH\u2019s price responded since the upgrade?\n\nIn the days since the upgrade, ETH has risen roughly 10%, hovering above $2,000 for the first time since May 2022. This came as a surprise to some analysts who believed that ETH was going to face major selling pressure after the upgrade, due to pent-up demand for withdrawals; ETH staking was first introduced in December 2020, and more than $32 billion was locked up before Shapella went live.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t there been a surge of ETH withdrawals?\n\nLess than 5% of the total staked ETH has been withdrawn since April 12. Stakers are potentially staying put for a significant, yet simple, reason: about half of the nearly 18 million staked ETH is operating at a loss and holders are likely hesitant to withdraw and sell in the red.\n\nExcessive sell pressure and withdrawals were also constrained by limits on how many withdrawals can be processed by Ethereum\u2019s network at a time. Currently, 800,000 withdrawals can be processed per week. Additionally, staked ETH is just 15% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply, compared to a 60% average for other PoS networks, leading some to believe there will actually be a surge in staking, not withdrawals.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming up on ETH\u2019s roadmap?\n\nThe final transition to PoS is just the first of many post-Merge network improvements that aim to make Ethereum more usable and scalable. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has outlined several of the blockchain\u2019s next (rhyming) phases:\n\nThe Surge, tentatively scheduled for late 2023 or early 2024, will increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability through a practice called \u201cdanksharding,\u201d which essentially divides large pieces of data into smaller ones, allowing more transactions to be processed. Buterin\u2019s goal is for Ethereum to be able to process 100,000 transactions per second, up from about 30 right now.\n\nThe Scourge is the most recent addition to the roadmap, and it involves improvements that would prevent censorship of transactions and exploitative bot-driven trading. Both are seen as centralization risks for Ethereum, which is a decentralized network.\n\nThe Verge refers to technical upgrades that will allow users to become network validators \u2014 computers responsible for verifying ETH transactions \u2014 without having to store massive amounts of data.\n\nThe Purge will remove old network history to ease bottlenecks and further reduce the amount of hard drive space required for validators. This means that services like Etherscan, which makes it easy to access historical data on the network, will be expected to take on the responsibility of storing older data.\n\nWhy it matters\u2026 The second major network upgrade in less than a year is a monumental accomplishment for Ethereum, especially after years of delays leading up to the Merge. Now, all eyes will turn to whether the forthcoming upgrades can fulfill Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision of Ethereum as a \u201cfully scaled, maximally resilient platform.\u201d\n\nTAKES\n\nGary Gensler gets grilled, Shaq gets served, and more notable quotes from the cryptoverse\n\nHot seat\u2026 \u201cSEC rules make no sense for blockchain companies. You've been an incompetent cop on the beat,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) to SEC Chair Gary Gensler during a tense hearing held by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee about the SEC\u2019s strategy of regulating crypto via enforcement. Crypto proponents in Congress were especially critical of Gensler for supposedly operating outside the regulatory authority of the SEC in the absence of a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill.\n\nSaga genesis... \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I went to anything but a phone \u2026.everything I do, I start with my phone, except for web3,\u201d was how the lead software engineer at Solana Mobile explained one of the core use cases for the Solana Saga, a new Android phone from Solana Labs which comes integrated with web3 functionality. (Read Decrypt\u2019s review of the Saga smartphone.)\n\nStable thoughts\u2026 \u201cWhile comprehensive, there are clearly open and challenging issues with the bill as proposed, and now is the time for our country and political leaders to really dig in and get this right,\u201d was Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire\u2019s reaction to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee\u2019s recently released draft of a stablecoin bill, marking the first piece of major crypto regulation to be proposed in 2023.\n\nYou got served\u2026 \u201cBasically, the largest man is hiding from our lawsuit,\u201d was how lawyers described their unsuccessful efforts to serve legal papers to former NBA star Shaquille O\u2019Neal as part of a class-action lawsuit against celebrities who had promoted FTX. O\u2019Neal, who is named in the suit alongside A-listers like Tom Brady and Larry David, was finally reached this week after what the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer alleged was \u201cmonths of running from us.\u201d\n\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n\n$104 million\n\nThe amount of money investors moved into institutional Bitcoin funds last week, according to a Monday research report from CoinShares.

        "content": "This is a guest post from Temujin Louie, VP of Marketing and Growth at Wanchain. All opinions shared here are his.\n\nUndoubtedly Ethereum is one of the most important blockchain networks in the world. Ethereum continues to play a significant role in shaping the future of the industry. It\u2019s known as the birthplace of smart contracts and decentralised applications. In fact, Ethereum remains the de facto choice for many blockchain projects. That\u2019s due to the network\u2019s unmatched developer community and user base.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s incredible popularity has proven to be a double-edged sword. Ethereum has introduced millions of new users to the potential of Web3. Yet, this unprecedented demand has put pressure on the network\u2019s capacity, resulting in slow transaction times and high fees. This has given rise to several sidechains and Layer 2 networks. Their goal is to lower the Ethereum network\u2019s load by processing transactions off-chain before settling them on-chain. These secondary networks are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and inherit the mainnet\u2019s security apparatus. Networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nBridging from ETH to its Layer 2s\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are separate networks that operate independently from Ethereum. You cannot do a direct transfer of ETH and other Ethereum-based assets to these networks without the use of bridges. As such, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon each offer an in-house bridge to Ethereum. Unfortunately, these in-house bridges have several shortcomings that limit their usability. Namely:\n\nThey are slow.\n\nThey are expensive.\n\nAnd they do not allow for transfers between the various Ethereum Sidechains and Layer 2 networks. It\u2019s like driving in a city that only has one-way streets. You can\u2019t go from Arbitrum to Polygon without going through Ethereum first. And it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon emerged to address Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings. And like them, third parties have also emerged to improve these in-house bridges. The fastest, cheapest, and most secure of these is without doubt Wanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows.\n\nA better way to bridge: ETH XFlows by Wanchain\n\nETH XFlows is a decentralised cross-chain solution that enables native-to-native cross-chain transfers between blockchains. This includes networks that settle transactions on Ethereum. In other words, where native ETH is. It leverages the power of Wanchain\u2019s cross-chain bridges to\n\nprovide fast, easy, and cheap non-custodial ETH transfers between chains\n\nAnd without the need for centralised exchanges or wrapped tokens.\n\nIn other words, when using ETH XFlows to move native ETH between chains, the user always receives native ETH on the destination chain.\n\nETH XFlows is currently live on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nETH XFlows vs in-house bridges\n\nHere is how Wanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows compares to the in-house bridges on speed and cost.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is the best combination of speed and cost, outperforming the in-house options in every route, all without sacrificing decentralisation.\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon\u2019s in-house bridges allow users to move ETH to-and-from Ethereum. But that\u2019s all. They won\u2019t let you connect to the various sidechains and Layer 2 networks. This is understandable as each is motivated to promote the usage of their own Ethereum scalability solution.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is not bound by these conflicting motivations. Our motivation and design are only to maximize benefits to users. As such, ETH XFlows also supports direct transfers between Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is the best choice for people looking to move their ETH to, from, and between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon! It\u2019s fast, cheap, decentralized, and seamless. And Wanchain is non-custodial too. It is the perfect tool to take advantage of the best Web3 opportunities on all networks.\n\nSo why wait?

Those withdrawals fall into two main categories: partial withdrawals, which allow validators to collect their rewards and leave at least 32 ETH deposited to keep generating rewards, and full withdrawals, which pull everything off the network.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, crypto exchange Huobi, decentralized exchange PieDAO, decentralized finance protocol Staked.us, and crypto exchange Kraken were among the entities to be in line to make withdrawals, according to a Nansen dashboard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKraken is among the firms that waiting to withdraw a substantial portion of the ETH it had staked on the network.

But it's still offering staking to customers in other parts of the world.\n\nMarco Santori, Kraken chief legal officer, told Decrypt during an interview for an upcoming podcast that the SEC knew Kraken would have to wait until withdrawals became available to make good on that part of the settlement.\n\nNon-U.S. customers can choose to keep their ETH in the Kraken staking pool, but U.S. customers will have their funds unstaked.\n\n\u201cThe settlement was pretty clear on that point,\u201d Santori said. \u201cAnd like we said, we want to put that affair behind us. So no, we won't be offering staking in the U.S. for ETH.\u201d\n\nBefore the settlement and Shanghai update, Kraken was among the most popular staking pool options for people who didn\u2019t have 32 ETH to stake on their own. In early September, 30% of staked ETH was controlled by Lido Finance, 15% by Coinbase, 8% by Kraken, and another 7% by Binance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, there were roughly 14 million ETH staked as the network prepared to upgrade to proof of stake on September 15. Deposits had grown to 18 million ETH, worth approximately $35 billion, by the time the Shanghai update went live on Wednesday.\n\nBut that growth wasn\u2019t spread out equally across staking pools. Decentralized liquid staking protocol Lido was the only one to see its share of depositors increase, albeit by 1 percentage point. Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance all saw their share of depositors shrink, according to Nansen.\n\nCoinbase is facing its own looming fight with the SEC. In March, it received a Wells Notice from the securities regulator, warning that the SEC had found potential violations in several of its products\u2014including Coinbase Earn, its staking pool. But the SEC hasn\u2019t yet filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and the company has said it intends to fight whatever charges may be coming its way.\n\nA Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment on the Shanghai upgrade beyond what the exchange had already shared on Twitter and in blog posts, warning customers that it could take a while actually receive their funds.\n\n\u201cCustomers may need to remain patient,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process unstaking requests immediately following the upgrade.\u201d\n\nThe exchange said on Wednesday that customers whose ETH is in the queue to be withdrawn will continue to earn rewards until they receive their funds.\n\nMeanwhile Binance, which runs the next largest ETH staking pool after Coinbase, is now the subject of a sweeping lawsuit from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The lawsuit doesn\u2019t make any mention of the company\u2019s staking products, but legal experts have said that the penalties the CFTC is seeking could cripple the company.\n\nSo, to recap: The SEC has already forced Kraken to remove U.S. customers from its ETH staking pool and alleges Coinbase has committed violations with its own staking products. And the CFTC is seeking massive damages in its complaint against Binance, which it says committed derivatives violations and traded against its own customers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you squint hard enough, it almost looks like U.S. regulators are working to create more decentralization among the validators securing the Ethereum network.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that Kraken is not fully exiting as a validator on the Ethereum network and that the exchange's U.S. customers will have their ETH unstaked.\n\n"

        "content": "Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies following Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade.\n\nNotably, ARB price gained 4.28% to hit $1.36 on April 13, its highest level in two weeks. This also amounts to 18% gains from its $1.15 low a day prior when the Shanghai upgrade enabled staking withdrawals on Ethereum.\n\nARB/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTo summarize, Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution that aims to reduce network transaction congestion and transaction fees. As a result, the market typically perceives Ethereum\u2019s growth as a boon for L2 chains.\n\nHere are three reasons why ARB could continue its bull run in Q2 to retest its record high of $1.60.\n\nMore utility for ARB\n\nArbitrum generated $2.5 million in profits in March 2023 via sequencing, according to Messari.\n\nArbitrum financial performance in 2023. Source: Messari\n\nNotably, sequencer profits represent the difference in fee revenue generated by the L2 chain and the fee expense paid to the base L1 chain \u2014 all calculated in Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH) token, not ARB.\n\nThese profits will eventually go to Arbitrum\u2019s community-managed DAO, ArbitrumDAO, as it grows to become more decentralized in the future.\n\nSequencers can create maximal extractable value (MEV) by arranging users\u2019 transaction requests \u2014 a feature missing from Arbitrum.\n\nHowever, ArbitrumDAO may end up monetarizing MEV by auctioning off rights to produce blocks once they launch decentralized sequencing, asserted Kunal Goel, a researcher at Messari. This would open up opportunities for ARB as a staking token.\n\n\u201cThe DAO will likely enforce ARB staking for sequencers to economically align incentives and to allow for slashing in case of any misbehavior, similar to validators in Proof-of-Stake networks,\u201d noted Goel, adding:\n\n\u201cThis will add value to the token as users demand greater security from the protocol.\u201d\n\nCapturing Optimism\u2019s market share\n\nArbitrum has outperformed its top Ethereum L2 rival, Optimism, on almost all the key metrics throughout most of 2022 and 2023.\n\nFor instance, in 2022, Arbitrum generated $22 million in sequencer revenue and $6 million in profits. Meanwhile, Optimism made $18 million and $4 million in sequencer revenue and profits, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the first quarter of 2023 saw Arbitrum outperforming Optimism\u2019s revenue by $4 million in revenue and $3 million in profits.\n\nArbitrum vs. Optimism key metrics. Source: Messari\n\nArbitrum also had a higher total value locked (TVL) through most of 2022 and 2023, with its dominance increasing further after the ARB airdrop in March.\n\nAs of April 13, Arbitrum's TVL was $2.27 billion compared with Optimism's $930 million.\n\nOptimism versus Arbitrum TVL. Source: Defi Llama\n\n\u201cAt current market prices, ARB trades at a discount to OP across all valuation multiples,\u201d Goel noted.\n\nARB price in descending triangle breakout\n\nThe ongoing run-up in Arbitrum price has broken above what appears to be a continuation pattern.\n\nRelated: ARB price to $2? Ethereum L2 rival Arbitrum will double in April, fractal suggests\n\nDubbed descending triangle, the pattern develops when the price consolidates between a falling trendline resistance and horizontal support. It resolves after the price breaks out of the range, pursuing the direction of its previous trend.\n\nARB entered a similar breakout stage on April 13 after rising above its triangle\u2019s upper trendline with convincing volumes.\n\nARB/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ARB/USD pair is now on a run up toward $1.60 in Q2, its best level to date, and up 20% from current price levels. This upside target is measured after adding the maximum distance between the triangle\u2019s trendlines to the breakout point.\n\nConversely, ARB price risks short-term correction due to its overbought relative strength index on the four-hour chart. In this case, the triangle\u2019s upper trendline will be the likely downside target at around $1.20.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Explaining ETH Drab Performance After The Shapella Upgrade - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The Ethereum Shapella upgrade finally took place last night, April 12. As many had predicted, it turned out to be a non-event, if Ether\u2019s price performance is anything to go by. Minutes after the upgrade, Ethereum was up only 1% with negligible fluctuations as it oscillated around $1,900.\n\nJust a little over 5 hours later, Ether\u2019s price is at $1,917, a mere 0.12% hourly increase and 2.65% up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nShapella Hard Fork Officially Goes Live On The Ethereum Mainnet\n\nThe long-awaited Shanghai/Capella upgrade, christened the ETH staking unlock event, which had been widely advertised since late 2022, was finally executed on the Ethereum mainnet at 10.27 pm UTC on April 12 at epoch number 194,048.\n\nAccording to Ethereum block explorer beaconchai.in, a total of 12,859 Ether were unlocked in 4,333 withdrawals within the first hour of the hard fork. Five hours later, these figures stand at 81,249 ETH tokens which have already been unlocked in over 30,400 transactions.\n\nAs the unlock event drew closer, the crypto community expected the demand for ETH to surge as investors \u201cbought the rumor\u201d with the hopes of turning the upgrade into a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event once it goes live. Others believed that there would be no significant price action from Ethereum referring to the Shapella upgrade as a non-event, and advising investors to focus on other macroeconomic issues.\n\nSHANGHAI UPDATE IS A NON EVENT.\n\n\n\nYOU SHOULD ALL BE FOCUSING ON THE SAUDI UPDATE.\n\n\n\nSAUDIS APEING 20M ON A REGISTRATION PLATE.\n\n\n\nWHAT'S A FEW BILLION IN MARKET BUYS ON ETH AND BTC TO A SAUDI. THEY DONT CARE.\n\n\n\n1M PER BTC ISN'T A MEME ANYMORE, THEYRE MAKING IT A REALITY.\n\n\n\nLAMBO SZN \u2014 Jamma Pelson (@JammaPelson1) April 12, 2023\n\nSince the total stake on the Beacon Chain is still above 18.1 million ETH, there are growing concerns about the potential selling pressure that may arise as the unlocking continues.\n\nSo, why has the Ethereum price ignored this historic event? Here are a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain remains high, staying above $5 for more than one month now. It is important to note that the Shapella upgrade does not fully address this issue. This reduces the possibilities of a positive Ether price action after the hard fork as most decentralized applications (dApps) and projects opt for Layer 2 and rival networks that offer better rates.\n\nIn addition, decentralized exchanges running on the Ethereum network have been experiencing a decline in trading volume which has dropped by 84% from a weekly high of $38.2 billion at the beginning of last month.\n\nAccording to data from DeFiLlama, the DEX volume on Ethereum had plunged over 23% over the last seven days to $5.93 billion. Meanwhile, rival networks recorded an average of 15% drop in volumes on average over the same timeframe, indicating that Ethereum was losing its share of the market.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis \u2013 Can ETH Rally Higher?\n\nEther\u2019s price slid into the four-hour Future Growth Value (FVG), extending from $1,845 to $1,808, triggering an upswing to areas above $1,900. This move will likely propel ETH to its next significant hurdle at the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s lack of volatility has slipped the price into a range-bound movement. As long as the $1,845 support level holds, the bulls have nothing to worry about.\n\nETH/USD Four-hour Chart\n\nNote that Ethereum was trading above the major simple moving averages (SMAs), an indication that it enjoyed robust support on the downside. The SMAs were also facing upward, suggesting that the market still favored the upside.\n\nWhile the upward outlook makes logical sense, a reentry into the $11,800 and $1,700 support zone would spell trouble for the Ethereum price. In such a case, ETH could revisit the midpoint at $1,750 or the range low at $1,687.\n\nEven though there are no clear signs of a rally, traders also do not expect any panic selling. This means that unless there is a significant increase in the number of staking unlock requests, Ether\u2019s price could remain near $1,900 for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the mean time, the Shapella upgrade remains a non-event.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "By Elizabeth Howcroft\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Cryptocurrency investors are facing delays to withdraw funds deposited on the Ethereum blockchain after its major software upgrade, highlighting persistent headaches for Ethereum which aims to have the technology widely used for instant payments.\n\nThe software upgrade, known as \"Shapella,\" was set to unlock more than $30 billion worth of ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, which investors had deposited on the Ethereum blockchain in return for interest.\n\nEther rose above $2,000 for the first time since August 2022 on Thursday.\n\nUntil Wednesday's upgrade, investors could not withdraw funds they had deposited via this method, known as \"staking\", on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of Thursday, ether worth around $1.4 billion was stuck in a withdrawal queue, blockchain data firm Nansen said.\n\nThe delays are an example of the limits in the transactions that Ethereum can process, highlighting its potential shortcomings as it strives to become a widely-used financial infrastructure.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a body that speaks for the network and describes itself as a \"non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting Ethereum\", did not comment.\n\nThe delays are due to limits in the amount of transactions the blockchain can process, Nansen analyst Martin Lee told Reuters via email. It can process approximately 1,800 validator withdrawals, or 57,600 ether worth of exits per day, he said - that's approximately $115 million.\n\nThe limits on validator withdrawals were in place for security reasons, Lee said.\n\n\"In an extreme scenario, if there\u2019s no limits, and a large majority of validators exit, the Ethereum network would be vulnerable to attacks and bad actors,\" he said.\n\nEthereum has grown popular for offshoots of the crypto market such as so-called decentralised finance or NFTs, but it has yet to become used in mainstream payments, finance or commerce.\n\nThe major Binance exchange said users would be able to withdraw their ether from its staking product from April 19, and that it may take \"15 days to several weeks\" to process these transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Due to the processing limitations on the Ethereum network, Binance will set a daily ETH redemption quota for each Binance user,\" Binance said on its website.\n\nNansen's Lee said the backlog will likely take weeks to clear, after which depending on what the average daily \"unstaking\" amount is, it would take just hours or a couple of days.\n\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft, editing by Tom Wilson and Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Kirsten Donovan)"

Secure your seat today\n\nEther (ETH) continued its recent strength Thursday afternoon, climbing above $2,000 a day after Ethereum successfully completed the long-anticipated upgrade.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at $2,015, up more than 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, also called the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork, continued the transformation of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that started in September\u2019s Merge upgrade.\n\nIn the weeks leading to Shapella, market observers had diverged over ETH\u2019s price reaction, with some predicting selling pressure would send the price down but others seeing little impact or even an increase in price.\n\nDiogo Monica, president and co-founder of institutional crypto platform Anchorage Digital, told CoinDesk in an interview after the upgrade that investors would be more comfortable locking in ETH, leading to decreased supply. Monica noted that \u201cthere's liquidity on the chain directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, demand is increasing with every successful upgrade that we have on the Ethereum network, which are two main reasons why the price is not going to drop massively,\u201d he said.\n\nMonica added that validators looking to exit the chain would have to join an exit queue, and that as a result, institutional investors would \u201cstay on the sidelines\u201d from staking \u2013 at least for the moment.\n\n\u201cHow the exit queue behaves\u201d in the next few weeks and whether \u201cwe get to a pattern of liquidity such that we can start being comfortable staking for the people that aren't staking\u201d are questions that institutional investors currently have in mind, along with the next potential next move of EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, he added.\n\nETH's performance around the Shanghai fork will depend less on \u201ctechnicals\u201d and more on \u201cwhat risk actually does at that time,\u201d according to a report from Coinbase Research prior to the upgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to un-stake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side,\u201d analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.\n\nElsewhere in markets\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 1.8% for the day to change hands at around $30,375 Thursday afternoon. Among institutional investors, for years the key question has been whether BTC is an uncorrelated asset, according to Mike Belshe, CEO of custody provider BitGo, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cWe're now witnessing the proof that indeed, when the Federal Reserve stops manipulating markets with infinite money supply, bitcoin stands alone \u2013 uncorrelated,\u201d Belshe wrote, adding that institutional adoption is \u201cabout to kick into high gear,\u201d despite regulatory headwinds.\n\nBitcoin, Ether, S&P 500, Gold 7-Day Returns (CoinDesk Research)\n\nLiquid staking derivatives' token prices rose on Thursday. Lido DAO\u2019s LDO recently spiked by over 7% in the past 24 hours to around $2.43. Rocket Pool\u2019s RPL was up over 9% to trade at around $46.19, while Stader\u2019s SD was up over 4% to roughly $1.33, according to CoinGecko\u2019s data.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ethereum scaling system's ARB token has also been rallying. ARB is trading up 15% over the last 24 hours at around $1.37 \u2013 making it one of the day\u2019s top-performing digital assets. Earlier Thursday, Uniswap announced a mobile wallet app that includes support for Arbitrum. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 3% for the day.\n\nEquities edged up Thursday afternoon, a day after mildly promising inflation data. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq recently rose by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was recently trading up 1%. The two-year Treasury yield was flat to sit at around 3.97%. Gold rose above $2,050, inching toward its record high, as investors continued their recent penchant for assets that hold value.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool showed that currently 66% of traders see the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 25-basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meeting on May 3.\n\nLyllah Ledesma contributed to this report."

One of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market is Ethereum (ETH), which has seen a surge in demand from both individual and institutional investors. Recently, an ETH whale that purchased billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens last week has now started to buy RenQ Finance (RENQ), indicating a growing interest in the platform. In this article, we will explore the details of this whale\u2019s investment in RENQ and what it could mean for the platform\u2019s future.Over the past week, the values of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have declined by almost 3 percent, causing a significant impact on the market capitalization of all meme tokens. However, crypto whales were quick to take advantage of the drop, with some making purchases of billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. Whalestats, a platform that tracks cryptocurrency whale activity, reported that an Ethereum (ETH) whale address called \u201c\u201d acquired 131.4 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $1.48 million in a single transaction. This purchase was made during a period when the price of SHIB had dropped by 10% over a week. As of writing, the average price for SHIB was $0.00001098, and its 24-hour trading volume had declined by 55% to $130.4 million. Further analysis shows that Shiba Inu has the highest monetary worth of all tokens owned by the top 100 ETH holders, with a total of SHIB tokens worth $601 million, accounting for 11.94% of their overall assets. Despite the decline in its burn rate by around 4% over 24 hours, the Shiba Inu coin has entered the top 10 most-bought tokens list, which tracks the activity of the largest cryptocurrency buyers in the last 24 hours. Additionally, the dead wallet received around 31.5 million SHIB tokens. It is noteworthy that the same Ethereum whale that purchased billions of SHIB tokens last week has now started purchasing RenQ Finance (RENQ) tokens, indicating a growing interest in the project and its potential for growth and profit. As the RenQ Finance platform moves towards its mainnet launch, investors are optimistic about its potential and the value it can provide.The same ETH whale has started to invest in RenQ Finance (RENQ). The exact amount of RENQ tokens the whale has purchased is unknown, but their investment has generated a lot of buzz in the crypto community. RENQ is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers a range of financial products and services, such as non-custodial trading, staking, and liquidity provision. The platform uses a multi-chain approach, meaning it is built on several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, making it an attractive option for investors looking to participate in DeFi.The ETH whale\u2019s investment in RENQ is a significant indication of the platform\u2019s potential for growth and profitability. The whale\u2019s investment is likely due to the platform\u2019s innovative technology and its potential to solve some of the major challenges faced by traditional finance systems. Additionally, RENQ\u2019s ability to attract investments from significant players in the crypto market bodes well for its future success. As RENQ\u2019s presale stage four closed earlier than expected and stage five began with great force, raising $7,930,204 out of $9,335,000, investors are optimistic that the ongoing stage will sell out fast too. The launch of RenQ Finance\u2019s mainnet is also highly anticipated and is expected to offer users a full range of DeFi products and services.The investment by the ETH whale in RenQ Finance (RENQ) is a positive sign for the platform and its potential for growth and profitability. RENQ\u2019s multi-chain approach, non-custodial platform, and support for financial products set it apart from other decentralized exchanges in the market. With the ongoing presale stage, RENQ\u2019s strong community support, and significant investments, the platform is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the DeFi space.

DeFi giant RenQ Finance (RENQ) has closed its Presale Stage 4 four weeks ahead of schedule, raising over $6.5 million in total.Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is set to undergo a significant upgrade known as the \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade. This upgrade will introduce several new features, including a reduction in the gas fees required for transactions and the implementation of new security measures. Furthermore, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum, also known as the Shapella upgrade, is set to take place on April 12, 2023. One of the major developments associated with this hard fork is the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which will allow validators to withdraw their staked ETH from as far back as December 2020. The Shapella upgrade is expected to significantly enhance the user experience for Ethereum users and attract new investors to the network. Allowing validators to withdraw their assets, it will provide greater flexibility and accessibility, making the network more user-friendly. This upgrade is part of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to remain a leader in the DeFi space and maintain its position as one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market. With the implementation of EIP-4895 and other proposed improvements, Ethereum is poised to continue its growth and expansion in the years to come. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been experiencing positive market sentiments as investors continue to pour money into the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady upward trajectory, with its price reaching new highs in recent weeks. The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price can be attributed to several factors, including increased institutional adoption, a reduction in supply due to halving events, and positive sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Additionally, the increasing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) has also played a role in Bitcoin\u2019s growth, as investors seek out alternative investment opportunities in the market. In general, the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market has shifted from neutral to positive. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced almost a 70% rise in value this year and is currently hovering around the fresh levels of $28,000. In March, BTC surged by 19.8%, marking its best month since January 2023 when it gained 38.7%.RenQ Finance (RENQ), a DeFi platform that offers innovative financial products and services, has closed its Presale Stage 4 four weeks ahead of schedule, raising over $6.5 million in total. The platform has gained popularity among investors due to its commitment to security and interoperability, as well as its innovative approach to DeFi. RenQ Finance\u2019s successful presale is a testament to the growing interest in DeFi platforms and the potential for these platforms to revolutionize the financial industry. With the presale closed, the platform is expected to launch its mainnet in the coming weeks, offering users access to its suite of DeFi products and services.The cryptocurrency market continues to experience positive growth and market sentiments, with Ethereum gearing up for its Shanghai upgrade, Bitcoin experiencing steady growth, and RenQ Finance closing its presale stage ahead of schedule. As the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to increase, we expect to see more innovative platforms like RenQ Finance gain popularity and attract new investors to the market.

        "content": "Ahead of the Shanghai Upgrade, Ethereum charts have spiked to $1.8k. Experts note that Ethereum hikes often tend to bring up the values of Alt Coins, and this could mean the next Alt Season is around the corner. Our team has rounded up a list of contenders to look out for, including Lido DAO, Solana, and the upcoming Big Eyes Coin, ending their presale on June 3rd!\n\nEthereum Stabilizes at Eight-month High\n\nThe much awaited Shanghai hard fork is just days away. The upgrade, launching April 12, will allow users to withdraw staked ETH, around 1.1 Billion ETH in rewards, worth 2 billion USD at the time of writing.\n\nThere is much hype around Ether, which has also led to a surge in its value to an eight-month high. In early April, Ethereum was trading at $1.8k, much to the delight of the Ethereum community, especially after its bearish run during the turbulence in the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the ETH/BTC graph also rose by 4.75% month-to-date, meaning Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin, crediting to the growing buzz around the Upgrade. Experts think of the Upgrade to lead Ether into a prolonged bullish run. The conditions are favorable for a surge, possibly a sustained stance in the $1.8k-$2k in April.\n\nUptrends in the ETH/BTC charts have statistically led to similar trends in the Altcoin market, notes Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher. As it turns out, ahead of the Shanghai Upgrade, \u201cgreenshoots\u201d have started to appear in the Alt market, as pointed out by GSR CEO Rich Rosenblum. Our experts have rounded a list of the top 3 crypto assets for investors to look out for this Alt Season: Lido DAO, Solana, and the brand new Big Eyes Coin.\n\nLido DAO to rise with Ethereum\n\nAs one of the platforms that allows the staking of Ethereum, the token for Lido Finance, Lido DAO (LDO) is guaranteed to benefit from the Shanghai upgrade. The coin has witnessed increased buyer momentum due to the upgrade already. LDO may overcome the next block at $2.92, but in the event of a highly bullish scenario, it may overcome the resistance level at $3.27. This value would be a 30% increase from its current price of $2.50. However, the Altcoin remains at risk of profit-taking and increased selling pressure, which will adversely affect its course, leading to a decline of about 20% in value.\n\nSolana may prepare for Breakout\n\nThe track record for the price of Solana (SOL) reveals an inverse head-and-shoulders setup, meaning two peaks, called shoulders, separated by a low called the head. A trendline connecting the two peaks, called the neckline, shows the resistance level. If the price reaches above the neckline, it indicates a strong, bullish breakout for SOL. With the recent surge that finished just below the line, analysts are predicting an uptrend to $37.21, which would signify an increase of 71.09%. However, a breakdown of the $18.66 support level due to any macroeconomic event might negatively skew the price of the altcoin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin to end Presale on June 3rd\n\nThe up and coming feline memecoin, Big Eyes (BIG) has just announced the end of its presale. Spanning across 12 stages, this has been the biggest presale for a memecoin in two years, having raised a staggering $33.5 million.\n\nThe memecoin has always created quite the stir with its innovative and user-centric features. For instance, transactions with BIG are exempt from buying and selling tax, the initial supply, 80% of which will be available on launch, will be locked in a liquidity pool for 2 years, and 5% of their collection will go to a charity wallet that supports ocean sanctuaries.\n\nAdditionally, Big Eyes also introduced the Lootbox Scheme, wherein users can buy Lootboxes to win random rewards that are always worth more than the price of the Lootbox itself. Recently, the scheme was paired with a card collection, which can be minted as NFTs.\n\nHowever, our team recommends BIG\u2019s next scheme, the final one before the launch itself. Users can win a bonus of upto 250% if they buy BIG or Lootboxes. With a high ROI, this is one offer not to be missed.\n\nAll users need to do is use the code BULLRUN250.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the Shanghai Upgrade is around the corner, Ethereum is witnessing a significant surge, and is predicted to sustain it. This can directly affect the price of altcoins, kickstarting what may be the next Alt Season. As a liquid-staking platform that supports the staking of Ether, Lido DAO will benefit from the Shanghai upgrade, and in case of a highly bullish run, increase by 30% from its current price. However, increased selling pressure and profit-taking may adversely affect it. Solana prices seem to show an inverse head-and-shoulder setup, and if it were to make it past the neckline, it can establish a bullish breakout.

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies to Keep an Eye on in 2023: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the Red-Hot Collateral Network ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As we venture further into 2023, three cryptocurrencies are stealing the spotlight: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rapidly rising Collateral Network (COLT), which has surged 40% recently.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT), a crowdlending DeFi platform utilizing AI for asset valuation and algorithmic lending rates, is currently in its second presale stage, offering tokens at $0.014 each.\n\nExperts anticipate a staggering 35x increase in COLT\u2019s price before summer, making it a must-have in the crypto space.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is approaching $1.9k, up 1.42% in the past week and 28.27 percent in the past month. The highly anticipated Ethereum (ETH) Shanghai-Capella hard fork is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nThis update will grant access to $31 billion in Ethereum (ETH) staked since December 2020. Despite the long-term favorable outlook for Ethereum (ETH), investors are concerned about the potentially unleashed Ethereum (ETH) sell-off.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $229.06 billion and a 24-hour volume of $10.45 billion, Ethereum (ETH) confronts ambiguity as the upgrade will discharge 18 million Ethereum (ETH), of which only 1.1 million ETH will be promptly withdrawable as staking rewards.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has been on a remarkable ascent, increasing 10.96% in the previous week and 28.96% this month. The high momentum breakout of its long-awaited resistance means Solana (SOL) is approaching a sentiment shift.\n\nA potential retest of the broken trendline could present an entry opportunity for speculators. Solana (SOL) has outperformed the rest of the already bullish market by experiencing a significant price increase.\n\nLaunched by Solana (SOL) Labs in March 2020, Solana (SOL) is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network that enables the creation of various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives.\n\nSolana (SOL) has a market capitalization of $9.16 billion and demonstrates solid performance, attracting the attention of investors seeking to capitalize on the rising prominence of layer-1 networks like Solana (SOL).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is an decentralized crowdlending network in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. This initiative has the potential to shake up the traditional lending business by providing more easily available loans at lower interest rates.\n\nUsers of Collateral Network (COLT) may lend modest sums of money to debtors at a fixed interest rate using asset-backed NFTs which then get fractionalized. In addition, borrowers may use their personal property as collateral for loans without having to sell the items or go through any unnecessary formalities.\n\nFor example, say Jane has a painting worth $80k and needs a short-term loan. She would: send the painting to Collateral Network (COLT), the painting is stored securely, and an NFT representing it is minted, making it 100% asset-backed.\n\nThe NFT is then fractionalized, allowing investors to lend smaller amounts at a fixed interest rate for a set period (fractional lending). The borrower repays the loan and interest. The NFTs are burned, and the painting is retrieved from storage.\n\nAt the second round of the presale, Collateral Network (COLT) tokens may be purchased for $0.014 each. Experts predict a 3500% growth in Collateral Network\u2019s value during the next six months (COLT). Hence, benefit from this alternative currency now, before its price skyrockets.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The crypto market continues it's gaining spree with the leader Bitcoin reaching near $30,500 levels, and Ethereum picking up by over 6%. There are a host of positives for cryptocurrencies. These would be sharp cooling in US inflation, and also Ether's Shapella upgrade which is set to be released. Globally, the market witnessed strong demand in both value and volume.\n\nAt the time of writing, on CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market traded at $1.25 trillion up by 2.29% over the previous day. The total volumes in cryptocurrencies zoomed nearly 20% to $48.78 billion over the previous day.\n\nThe market's biggest booster is inflation data. The US consumer price index of all items stood at 5% by end of March 2023 --- which is the lowest since May of 2021. It is also better than Street's expectations of 5.2%. However, inflation continues to stay above US Fed's target levels.\n\nBitcoin traded near $30,225 up by nearly a percent. The crypto has touched an intraday high of $30,462.48 --- which is the 7-day high and also a 1-month high. The crypto hit a 3-month high of $30,509.08 earlier.\n\nCoinDCX Research Team earlier said that if March CPI will be lower than previous months, which could potentially benefit Bitcoin if the Federal Reserve decides to pause rate hikes.\n\nFurther, Ethereum which is the second largest cryptocurrency, traded near $1,982 up by 6%.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether have recorded around 8% and 6% jump in 7 days.\n\nOn the latest cryptocurrencies performance, Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, CoinDCX said: \u201cThe ETH Shapella upgrade is important on 3 counts: security, improved user experience, and more control. The upgrade involves making changes to two important layers in the network - the execution layer and the consensus layer. One of the most important changes being introduced - EIP-4895 - is a new mechanism that will improve the security of the Ethereum network. The ETH network will now be more efficient and reliable and provide an improved customer experience.\"\n\nGupta added, \"Hopefully this will also inspire other blockchain platforms to make the transition to more sustainable consensus algorithms. This upgrade will enable users to stake, earn ETH rewards distributed automatically, unstake to regain full access to their accounts or restake to start over. Post this upgrade, the investor can expect high transaction speed and lower gas fee.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch said, \"The much-awaited Shanghai upgrade and the US\u2019s CPI data have hardly impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Despite the expectation from investors of an aggressive response from markets, BTC continued trading in the $30k zone and went below the mark multiple times in the last 24 hours, while ETH is in the $1.9k zone.\n\nIn alignment with Glassnode\u2019s prediction, Chaturvedi added, \"We don\u2019t see any selling pressure on ETH, which is up ~1% in the past 24 hours, as of around 8 AM today. Around half an hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, around 285 withdrawals had been processed for about 5,413 ETH ($10 million worth). In high spirits, investors and blockchain developers have already begun mapping the next steps, i.e., the Verge, Purge, and the Scourge.\"\n\nIn other news, CoinSwitch stated that Argentina has made an official move in crypto by authorising its National Securities Commission (CNV) to launch a bitcoin (BTC) index-based futures contract. Additionally, El Salvador granted its first license for digital asset service providers to BitFinex yesterday. We can expect such moves to positively impact investor sentiment and boost market performance.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to remain strong, he said.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

        "content": "What is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade and What Does It Mean For Staking?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade (also known as the \u201cShapella\u201d) will take place on April 12, 2023. This is the last step in Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and it represents a major upgrade for users looking to stake ETH.\n\n\u200d\n\nShanghai or \u201cShapella\u201d consists of several different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), but the most notable difference is that it will enable withdrawals, or unstaking, of ETH that was previously locked in a smart contract. This opens a range of new possibilities for staking and has already generated a great deal of excitement within the industry.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitbuy users?\n\nBitbuy is celebrating the Shapella upgrade by providing boosted ETH rewards for one month. For one month following Apr 12, Bitbuy ETH stakers can earn 4.07% - 6.0%*, which are the highest staking rewards of any regulated exchange in Canada.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you are already staking at Bitbuy, then you do not have to take any action. Your staking will automatically receive boosted staking rewards for the upcoming month. If you haven't staked on Bitbuy yet, learn more on how to start staking Ethereum and earn rewards!\n\n\u200d\n\nAs a Bitbuy user, you will now have the flexibility to unstake your Ethereum in-app. When you initiate the unstaking process, your funds will move into an exit queue, where they will remain for about a week, before becoming liquid. You may not want to unstake if you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, or if you want to take advantage of our boosted rewards rates.\n\n\u200d\n\nWe want you to maximize and compound your returns. As a result, your rewards will be automatically restaked, allowing you to continue earning rewards, until you decide to unstake. It is important to note that any re-staked ETH will go through the network\u2019s standard bonding period of 45 days (subject to change) before they start earning additional rewards. Any amounts that are already staked will not need to go through the bonding period.\n\n\u200d\n\nBy staying informed about the details of your investments, you can make thoughtful decisions that help you maximize your potential returns. New bonding and unbonding periods will be introduced for ETH staking. With a bonding period of 45 days (subject to change), users will start earning rewards on their staked ETH after the bonding period is over. And with an unbonding period of 7 days, users will have the flexibility to unstake their funds when they need to and receive them back into their account after 7 days. Plus, any rewards accrued during the bonding period will be automatically released to the user's wallet and restaked, maximizing their returns with a compounding effect.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you have any other questions, check out the FAQs on the upgrade or contact our Support team.\n\n*Boosted ETH staking rewards promotional period ends on May 12th at 11:59PM EST, and the promotional staking reward rate of 4.07% - 6.0% is calculated on a yearly basis.\n\n\u200d\n\nOverview of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d Upgrade and its Impact on Staking\n\nThe name \u201cShapella\u201d comes from a mix of Shanghai \u2013 the city-host of the ETH Devcon 2 conference, and Capella \u2013 the brightest star in the northern constellation of Auriga.\n\n\u200d\n\nEthereum has two layers \u2013 the execution layer and the consensus layer. The Execution used to be the main layer, while the consensus layer was introduced as part of the initial merge to Proof of Stake. Shapella consists of upgrades to both layers simultaneously, each with a distinct name (Shanghai and Capella). This upgrade is expected to improve the efficiency and security of the network, leading to a more seamless user experience.\n\n\u200d\n\nEven though Ethereum is the world\u2019s largest Proof of Stake blockchain, currently only 15% of Ethereum is staked, while other blockchains have a staking participation closer to 50%. Until now, users who have staked their ETH have not been able to unstake their ETH, and the added flexibility is expected to make staking more attractive for investors.\n\n\u200d\n\nUnlock the potential of crypto staking with a secure and regulated platform with Bitbuy.

Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin (BTC) hung precariously around $30,000 Wednesday afternoon after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation cooling slightly but not by as much as economists had expected.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently at $30,030, off a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk\u2019s data. BTC\u2019s price reached as high as $30,548 earlier Wednesday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 much-watched inflation reading showed the CPI rising 0.1% increase in March, slower than economists' 0.2% forecast for the month and then February\u2019s 0.4% reading. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 5%, down from 6% in February and against expectations of 5.2%.\n\nBTC's profit-taking is \"intensifying\" following the report, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.\n\n\u201cIt seems the momentum rally for bitcoin might be over for now,\u201d Moya wrote. \u201cInflation hedge and or a breaking of its correlation from equities might subside for a while.\u201d He added that BTC looks poised to consolidate as \"it will clearly need a robust catalyst to keep the rally going.\u201d\n\nEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently trading at $1,914, up 0.3% from Tuesday, same time.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down 0.2% for the day but rose by 2.2% in the past seven days.\n\n(CoinDesk Research)\n\nEquity markets turned mixed on Wednesday afternoon. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were recently trading up 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was almost flat."

After enduring the recent downturn, many traders are reaping modest profits and eagerly anticipating greater returns in forthcoming bull runs.\n\nIn this piece, we will delve into price projections for three of the most buzzworthy cryptocurrencies currently dominating the market: Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and DigiToads (TOADS).\n\nEthereum Price Outlook\n\nEthereum, one of the most dominant forces in the altcoin market besides Bitcoin, often leads the charge regarding price uptrends. Currently trading at around $1900, its highest level in six months, Ethereum\u2019s performance could significantly impact numerous other altcoins. However, an upcoming upgrade presents potential challenges to Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nDevelopers have announced the Shanghai Upgrade, which will make all 16 million staked ETH available for withdrawal. This could lead to considerable sell pressure, potentially dampening ETH\u2019s price growth.\n\nNonetheless, considering the overall bullish trend emerging in the DeFi market, it seems more likely that Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency, will maintain its upward trajectory, and any temporary bearish effect on Ethereum\u2019s price will ultimately pave the way for explosive gains in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding the price predictions, some analysts predict that by the end of 2023, ETH\u2019s price could surpass an average level of $2,519.85, with a minimum expected price of $2,445.51 by the end of the current year. The price of this veteran DeFi project could even reach a maximum level of $2,786.58.\n\nBinance Coin Price Projection\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) has experienced a tumultuous year, with the token\u2019s price dropping from $500 to $245 before recovering to $316. However, the challenges may not be over, as traders have raised concerns about the project\u2019s reserves following the FTX exchange collapse.\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s recent lawsuit also alleged that Binance violated US derivatives laws by offering derivative trading services to US customers without registering with the appropriate market regulators, prioritizing commercial success over regulatory compliance. The Australian government has also cancelled Binance\u2019s license to operate its local branch. These unfavourable situations surrounding the exchange have undoubtedly impacted BNB\u2019s performance.\n\nDespite these challenges, the technical analysis for Binance Coin appears relatively positive, considering the token\u2019s extensive utility and Binance\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAnalysts predict that by the end of 2023, Binance Coin (BNB) will have a minimum price of $341.52, potentially reaching a maximum price of $406.74. The average trading price is anticipated to hover around $383.99.\n\nDigiToads Price Prediction\n\nDigiToads, an innovative meme coin based on play-to-earn elements, has rapidly gained traction despite being a recent entrant to the market. The presale phase has only been live for a few weeks. Still, this exciting ERC20 token has already raised over $1 million, successfully selling out the first two presale stages, which account for 85 million TOADS tokens in total. One of the main driving forces behind this impressive momentum is the dynamic structure of the presale.\n\nFor More Information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale or join the community.\n\nAs the whitepaper indicates, the TOADS price is set to grow ten times progressively. Users have already experienced two price increases, with eight more scheduled before the presale concludes.\n\nThose who infuse now can anticipate up to a 250% price growth when DigiToads goes live, and the price reaches $0.055. To put it in numbers, if you were to invest $1,000 today, your acquisition could potentially grow to $2,500 by the time of the launch, which is practically impossible by any other digital asset currently available on the market.\n\nClosing Notes\n\nObserving its past price performance, hedging power against market volatility, and future price projections is crucial when searching for the best cryptocurrency. TOADS offers excellent growth potential; the best part about it is a guarantee. These price increases are fixed and scheduled, meaning any moment you join the presale, you are already a winner at the launch date.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "title": "Kraken Begins Withdrawing All Staked ETH Ahead of Shapella - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "With the long-awaited Shapella upgrade just around the corner, crypto exchange Kraken is preparing to withdraw all staked ETH on behalf of its clients as soon as possible after the update rolls out.\n\nThe event will bring Kraken\u2019s staking as a service product to a complete close, after being forced by regulators into shuttering the program in February.\n\nKraken Withdraws its Stake\n\nIn a Twitter response on Wednesday, Kraken\u2019s support team confirmed that the platform\u2019s locked ETH will \u201cautomatically enter the unstaking process\u201d for U.S. clients after Shapella goes live.\n\nThe upgrade, scheduled for block 6209536 at 10:27:35 PM UTC on April 12, will let Ethereum stakers finally withdraw their ETH from the network\u2019s staking contract for the first time since December 2020. There are currently over 18 million ETH locked in the contract, of which over 1,247,000 belong to Kraken, according to Glassnode data.\n\nPopular Ethereum educator sassal.eth on Twitter said that Kraken\u2019s staking withdrawals have already begun ahead of the upgrade and that other validators are capable of withdrawals as well. However, the exchange won\u2019t be able to withdraw its initial 32 ETH deposit required for staking, nor its associated rewards, until after Shapella takes place.\n\nSome investors have feared that the unlocking withdrawals could trigger a massive amount of ETH onto the market, potentially crushing its price. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggests that a tiny fraction of validators have chosen to withdraw their stake so far.\n\n\u201cWhat Kraken is doing right now is exiting their validators,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are doing this because of the SEC action brought against Kraken\u2019s Ethereum staking product back in February.\u201d\n\nSEC VS Staking\n\nTwo months ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Kraken $30 million for failing to register its staking product as a security. While the enforcement action was not short of criticism from industry leaders and crypto-supportive politicians, other exchanges like Coinbase are prepared to be sued for offering a similar product.\n\nStaking as a service lets retail customers conveniently access staking rewards without any technical know-how, and without needing to cross the 32 ETH threshold for running a personal validator. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has warned that such services, as well as proof of stake cryptocurrencies more broadly, may qualify as securities under the Howey Test."

        "content": "The software that underpins the second-biggest crypto coin ether was upgraded on Wednesday and is online, cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe move will give investors access to more than $30 billion (roughly Rs. 2,45,877 crore) of the digital tokens.\n\nKnown as Shapella, the latest upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain since its Merge upgrade will enable investors to redeem an offshoot of ether tokens that they have deposited in return for interest on the blockchain network over the past three years.\n\nSuch so-called \"staked ether\" tokens currently account for about 15 percent of all ether tokens, according to data firm Dune Analytics, and are worth some $31 billion.\n\n\"The Shanghai/Shapella Upgrade is complete. Deposits & withdrawals for ETH, OP, ARB and ERC-20 tokens via the Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum networks are now back online,\" Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe changes will likely lead to heightened volatility for ether, investors have predicted.\n\nSome believe that widespread redemptions could lead to a wave of selling, in turn weighing on the price of ether, whose market value of about $230 billion is topped only by bitcoin.\n\n\"The release of this previously unrealised investment may lead to significant downward price pressure if it is immediately liquidated,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nIn its last significant upgrade, Ethereum in September drastically reduced its energy usage - a move proponents said would give Ethereum an advantage as it seeks to surpass bitcoin.\n\nBut ether has continued to lag its larger rival, gaining just under 60 percent this year versus a more than 80 percent jump for bitcoin.\n\nAfter trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto market in a bruising 2022, the sector has rallied in 2023 on expectations that central bank interest rate hikes are slowing.\n\nEthereum has grown popular in so-called decentralised finance applications, which offer financial services while avoiding traditional industry gatekeepers such as banks.\n\nIt remains, however, little used in mainstream commerce or finance.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2023\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Published: 13 Apr 2023 \u2022 15:00\n\nAs cryptocurrency evolves, many investors and traders closely monitor the potential for high returns. Two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market, Ethereum (ETH) and Conflux (CFX) have seen significant growth in recent years, and many are curious about what the future holds for them. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the Collateral Network (COLT), a project that aims to unite these two platforms and discuss how it may provide investors with a potential 35x return in the coming years.\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nAccording to CryptoPredictions.com, Conflux (CFX) is predicted to start in April 2023 at $0.43460598428125 and finish the month at $0.4312193485653. During April, the maximum forecasted CFX price is $0.54986459497704, and the minimum price is $0.37390792458439.\n\nAnother prediction by ambcrypto.com suggests that Conflux\u2019s price for April 2023 should range between $0.043 to $0.05, and the average price of CFX should be around $0.046.\n\nCoinCodex predicts that the price of Conflux Network will decrease by -1.51% over the next month and reach $0.323603 by April 24, 2023.\n\nThe expected price range for Conflux is $0.3584222366319 to $0.41092858638443 for May 2023. The highest and lowest predicted CFX prices for May are $0.52709152445868 and $0.3584222366319, respectively.\n\nIt is anticipated that Conflux will begin trading in June 2023 at $0.40271001465674 and end the month at $0.51986842733983. The highest and lowest predicted CFX prices for June are $0.53017742292786 and $0.36052064759095, respectively.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe minimum price of Ethereum in 2023 will be $1,988.01, according to a technical analysis of anticipated price changes. The highest point that the price of ETH can go to is $2,434.86. The anticipated average market price is $2,063.30.\n\nAfter researching Ethereum prices in 2023, experts in the field are prepared to share their projected trading for June 2023: $1,745.26. The ETH price ranges between $1,669.96 and $1,906.12, respectively.\n\nThe price of Ethereum will trade at an average amount of $1,888.40 in the middle of fall 2023. According to cryptocurrency experts, the price of ETH in September 2023 may range between $1,813.10 alongside $2,141.10.\n\nThe most recent information indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price is currently $1,774.36 and is currently rated No. 2 in the whole crypto market. With a capitalisation of 122,373,866 ETH, Ethereum has a $217,135,815,125.30 circulation quantity.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency\u2019s current value has grown by $63.70 over the last day. Ethereum has been in a strong upward trajectory over the past week, rising by 1.31%. Recently, Ethereum has demonstrated very powerful potential, so now might be a good time to jump in and make an investment.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) against physical assets like property, rare pieces of art, etc. The NFTs are then fractionalized to allow the community to fund the loans.\n\nIt is designed to simplify the crowd-lending process, providing borrowers with access to loans from cryptocurrency investors, who can generate a passive income with their capital by funding the loan via the NFT fractions.\n\nImagine how difficult it would be to go through the protracted, complicated process of getting a loan from a conventional bank. Collateral Network (COLT), a peer-to-peer lending system that seamlessly links lenders and borrowers in the Web3 space, was created to address this issue.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) stands out for its innovative use of tangible assets as lending collateral. Imagine Alex possesses a priceless $50,000 rare watch and requires a loan for home renovations. On the Collateral Network (COLT) system, Alex can mint the watch as an NFT and fractionalize it to enable decentralised peer-to-peer lending.\n\nThe native token of Collateral Network, COLT, provides owners with various advantages, including lower interest rates, trading costs, staking rewards, governance rights, and more.\n\nThe Collateral Network (COLT) presale offers a special investment opportunity because it aims to transform the conventional lending industry. Experts anticipate that this ground-breaking cryptocurrency, which is currently trading at $0.014, up 40% from its initial price of $0.01, will rise to 3500% during the ongoing presale, demonstrating the enormous future possibilities of Collateral Network. Impressively, presale buyers enjoy a 40% deposit bonus, further showing the immense potential of Collateral Network (COLT)\u2019s presale.\n\nRead more about the COLT presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

Do note that Bitcoin currently remains confined in an up-trending channel. This setup appears ripe for a healthy pullback.\n\nWhenever the #BTC Monthly RSI rebounded from the red bottom trendline...

Starting today, users will be able to withdraw the rewards earned from staking Ethereum. Additionally, all staking nodes will be able to withdraw their staked capital of 32 Ether coins. However, this process is expected to proceed at a snail\u2019s pace, given the backlog involved.\n\nBy allowing free movement of staked coins, the Shapella upgrade is expected to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem in the long run. However, in the short run, it might lead to elevated selling pressure.\n\nICYMI: We see exiting depositors are predominantly those with only one validator, and those who deployed their stake in the pre-launch phase or first quarter of the Beacon Chain lifespan.

Moreover, 70,000 staked Ether coins ($133 million) will likely be sold in the aftermath of the upgrade. The report goes on to note:\n\n\u201cEven in the extreme case where the maximum amount of rewards and stake are withdrawn and sold, the sell-side volume still falls within the range of the average weekly exchange inflow volume. Therefore, we conclude that even the most extreme case will have an acceptable impact on the price of ETH.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think remains in store for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the weeks ahead?

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bruce Lee Estate will establish a Web3 presence for the late, legendary martial artist and actor thanks to a new partnership with Shibuya, an NFT-driven video platform.\n\nThe plans were teased on social media Tuesday with a classic video interview clip of Lee, in which he transforms from live footage into an anime-style rendition. At 11 am ET today, Shibuya will release an open edition Ethereum NFT\u2014which means that an unlimited number can be purchased before the mint ends\u2014for 0.008 ETH each, or about $15.\n\nThe \u201cHouse of Lee: Genesis\u201d NFT features artwork of Lee that was hand-drawn by Emily \u201cpplpleasr\u201d Yang and designed in collaboration with Shannon Lee\u2014the late icon\u2019s daughter, and founder and President of the Bruce Lee Estate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy last name is Lee.

In Shibuya\u2019s first project, the anime-style White Rabbit animated series, NFT holders can choose the next narrative path at the end of each segment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the recent \u201cDominion X: Level 2\u201d series created by musician Steve Aoki and actor Seth Green\u2019s Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, NFT owners could vote on the conclusion to each new stop-motion animated segment produced on a weekly basis. Shibuya announced a $6.9 million seed round in December co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Variant Fund.\n\nWhether Shibuya plans to create Bruce Lee video content within a similar model remains to be seen, but the teaser clip already shows that they\u2019re working on Bruce Lee animation. The clip will also be shown on a Times Square video billboard this week in New York City amid the NFT.NYC conference."

        "content": "By Tom Wilson\n\n(Reuters) -The software that underpins the second-biggest crypto coin ether was upgraded on Wednesday and is online, cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe move will give investors access to more than $30 billion of the digital tokens.\n\nKnown as Shapella, the latest upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain since its Merge upgrade will enable investors to redeem an offshoot of ether tokens that they have deposited in return for interest on the blockchain network over the past three years.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSuch so-called \"staked ether\" tokens currently account for about 15% of all ether tokens, according to data firm Dune Analytics, and are worth some $31 billion.\n\n\"The Shanghai/Shapella Upgrade is complete. Deposits & withdrawals for ETH, OP, ARB and ERC-20 tokens via the Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum networks are now back online,\" Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe changes will likely lead to heightened volatility for ether, investors have predicted.\n\nSome believe that widespread redemptions could lead to a wave of selling, in turn weighing on the price of ether, whose market value of about $230 billion is topped only by bitcoin.\n\n\"The release of this previously unrealised investment may lead to significant downward price pressure if it is immediately liquidated,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nIn its last significant upgrade, Ethereum in September drastically reduced its energy usage - a move proponents said would give Ethereum an advantage as it seeks to surpass bitcoin.\n\nBut ether has continued to lag its larger rival, gaining just under 60% this year versus a more than 80% jump for bitcoin.\n\nAfter trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto market in a bruising 2022, the sector has rallied in 2023 on expectations that central bank interest rate hikes are slowing.\n\nEthereum has grown popular in so-called decentralised finance applications, which offer financial services while avoiding traditional industry gatekeepers such as banks.\n\nIt remains, however, little used in mainstream commerce or finance.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson in London and Shivani Tanna in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely and Sonali Paul)"

The market expects a 71 percent chance that the US Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting.

        "content": "Arbitrum has emerged as a fresh and promising addition to the Ethereum blockchain, offering a revolutionary approach to transacting on the network. Serving as a Layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum utilizes an innovative technique called optimistic rollups, which drastically enhances the speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Ethereum transactions.\n\nIf you have experienced Ethereum 1.0 as being sluggish, cumbersome, and costly, then Arbitrum may be the solution you have been searching for! This piece will examine the Arbitrum ecosystem, detailing its origins, attributes, advantages, and impact on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nWho Founded Arbitrum?\n\nOff-Chain Labs, a New York-based development firm established by three former Princeton University researchers \u2013 Ed Felten, Steven Goldfeder, and Harry Kalodner, is responsible for creating Arbitrum, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The team brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, thanks to their expertise in computer science and blockchain, and their academic and research backgrounds.\n\nEd Felten, who holds a computer science professorship at Princeton, is the Chief Scientist and co-founder of Off-Chain Labs. Steven Goldfeder, a computer scientist, serves as the CEO and co-founder, while Harry Kalodner is the co-founder and CTO of Off-Chain Labs.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Distinctive Characteristics\n\nArbitrum\u2019s optimistic roll-up approach is unique for multiple reasons, notably, its capacity to deliver rapid and effective smart contract execution. Being completely compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it enables Ethereum developers to utilize their existing tools and smart contracts without requiring any alterations.\n\nMoreover, the system is decentralized and secure and does not rely on centralized operators to sequence transactions. In addition, the platform offers versatility by allowing developers to deploy programs written in commonly-used programming languages.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Native Cryptocurrency\n\nArbitrum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ARB, was launched on March 23, 2023, with 12.75% of the total token supply distributed among eligible recipients and DAOs. The ERC-20 token is primarily used for paying transaction fees and accessing other services on the Arbitrum Network. By holding ARB tokens, users have the power to participate in network governance by voting on proposals that impact the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova Chains.\n\nThese proposals include important decisions such as the allocation of bounties and grants, integration of new features, chain upgrades, and the use of funds from the DAO treasury. The total maximum supply of ARB tokens has been set at 10 billion.\n\nA Meme Token With Great Potential: The Promising Future Of Big Eyes Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is an ERC-20 token that has caught the attention of the crypto community with its unique approach. Despite being a meme token, Big Eyes Coin aims to offer more than just a cute image. The presale of the token has raised an impressive $32.5 million and is close to reaching its $50 million target.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of Big Eyes Coin is to give back to its community. The token has a focus on charity, offers exciting loot boxes, and hosts NFT clubs. Furthermore, BIG is currently running a promotion that provides a 250% return to those who enter the code \u201cBULLRUN250\u201d after purchasing BIG tokens or loot boxes.\n\nAlthough Big Eyes Coin may appear to be another meme coin, the team behind it is genuinely dedicated to creating a community-centric and charitable experience for its users.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Comparing Arbitrum, Optimism And Polygon: How Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchains Are Impacting Upcoming ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchains are increasingly gaining popularity in the crypto industry, and they have become an essential service for investors. L2s are designed to make transactions on the Ethereum network more cost-effective compared to Layer 1 blockchains. The crypto industry has witnessed the emergence of several L2 blockchains that compete for market share on the Ethereum blockchain, and the top three are Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. These three L2s have experienced significant support in the market, but their performances vary, and this report takes a look at their respective performances to determine the best performer.\n\nRise in Total Value Locked (TLV)\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) on the top three Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains has grown significantly since their inception. However, there has been a substantial difference in usage and TVL on the blockchain. Arbitrum, which is the latest blockchain to gain widespread popularity, has taken the lead in terms of TVL and usage.\n\nThe Layer 2 upgrade presently boasts the fourth largest total value locked (TVL) in decentralised finance (DeFi), surpassing $2.2 billion. Of the three L2 networks, Arbitrum has the highest TVL, with over $2.2 billion locked, while Polygon has a TVL of only $1.07 billion, which is over 50% lower than Arbitrum. Optimism has the lowest TVL of the three, with $923 million.\n\nOptimism beats Arbitrum And Polygon\n\nIn terms of usage, Arbitrum is the leader, with a 24-hour trading volume of $583 million, whereas Polygon has a 24-hour trading volume of $148 million, and Optimism has a trading volume of $38 million. With the release of tokens for all three L2 networks, their performance can be evaluated against one another. Although some networks have performed better than others, the margin between them remains quite narrow.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s price has surged 10% in the last day to $1.26. However, Optimism has done even better, with its price crossing $2.28, a 10.39% increase in the same time period. Polygon is the worst performer of the three, with an 8% gain that has brought its price to $1.14. Despite underperforming, Polygon still holds the largest market capitalization among the three, amounting to $10.35 billion, while ARB and OP have market capitalizations of $1.6 billion and $716 million, respectively.\n\nHow Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 Supports New Crypto\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) Layer 2 upgrade has contributed to a significant price increase of 4% for Ethereum (ETH) in the past month. This upgrade is expected to have a positive impact on smaller cryptocurrencies that rely on the Ethereum (ETH) network for transactions and activities. One such promising meme currency that falls into this category is Dogetti (DETI).\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new entrant in the meme coin market that is trying to compete with the giants Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Similar to other meme coins, Dogetti (DETI) focuses on accessible, irreverent marketing, cute characters representing the token\u2019s community, and relies heavily on the Ethereum (ETH) network\u2019s solid foundation.\n\nWith the upcoming Layer 2 upgrade and other improvements and extensions that the Ethereum development team is working on, Dogetti (DETI) could emerge as one of the winners in the meme coin presale sub-market niche. It is an excellent opportunity to look into Dogetti (DETI) and other similar coins that leverage the reputable and long-standing Ethereum network.\n\nThe three top Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains have made significant progress in the crypto industry, providing a very needed service to investors. However, their performances vary significantly, and Arbitrum is currently leading the way in terms of TVL, usage, and token price, followed by Polygon and Optimism. As L2 blockchains continue to evolve and gain wider acceptance, it will be interesting to see how their performances evolve and which one will come out on top in the end. One is that these developments will definitely boost upcoming altcoins like Dogetti.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The next Ethereum? 5 cryptocurrencies poised for massive growth in 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "After the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC), people started to realize that blockchain \u2013 its underlying technology \u2013 could be used for other purposes, giving rise to Ethereum (ETH) and making it a powerful competitor to the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset. With time, more networks and cryptocurrencies appeared, threatening to unseat Bitcoin\u2019s runner-up.\n\nIn this context, there are several such digital assets that have stood out as potential \u2018Ethereum killers\u2019 due to the challenge they present to the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, as well as their perceived capability to possibly even replace the Ethereum coin as the second most famous asset on the crypto market.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has emerged as a strong contender to Ethereum\u2019s domination thanks to its lower gas fees and high transaction rates (although Ethereum is catching up with its network updates), as well as the use of the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism with other more conventional algorithms.\n\nAs things stand, Solana is currently changing hands at the price of $24.04, up 1.35% in the last 24 hours, in addition to gaining 14.59% over the previous seven days after it revealed a new solution promising to reduce the cost of on-chain storage. It has also gained 18% on its monthly chart, as well as a whopping 142.31% since the year\u2019s turn, according to data retrieved on April 13.\n\nSolana year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nDescribing itself as a \u2018Layer 0 blockchain,\u2019 Polkadot (DOT) has recently filed a trademark application for the blockchain communication platform \u2018Polkadot Converse\u2019 as well as updating its ecosystem with Kagome 0.9.0, a Polkadot Host implementation written in C++.\n\nIts price at press time stood at $6.42, increasing 2% in the past 24 hours, 0.26% over the previous week, as well as 5.21% on its monthly chart. In terms of its year-to-date (YTD) gains, Polkadot has added 46.73% to its value, as the recent charts demonstrate.\n\nPolkadot year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAnother Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ecosystem like Ethereum, Avalanche (AVAX) integrates three interoperable blockchains together, providing greater scalability. On April 6, the team launched its Cortina upgrade on the protocol\u2019s testnet, promising improved Avalanche\u2019s X-Chain support for crypto exchanges and faster development, among other benefits.\n\nCurrently, Avalanche is changing hands at the price of $28.54, which demonstrates a 2.38% climb in the last 24 hours, in addition to increasing its value by 3.03% across the week and 12.59% in the previous month, whereas its gains since January 1 amount to 69.89%.\n\nAvalanche year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nLayer 2 scaling solution that uses the Ethereum blockchain, Polygon (MATIC) has had a massive surge in gaming activity in March, making it the second-largest gaming blockchain after WAX (WAXP), according to the report by DappRadar.\n\nAt present, Polygon is changing hands at $1.12, recording a 2.35% increase in the past day, although it has lost 2.04% during the previous week and 6.16% across the last 30 days. However, those losses are offset by the year-to-date (YTD) gains of 46.69%\n\nPolygon year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nTezos (XTZ)\n\nA self-upgradable and energy-efficient PoS blockchain that also deploys Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPOS), Tezos (XTZ) has had multiple positive news this year, as well. First, it announced a partnership with Google Cloud, and then it unveiled the Mumbai protocol, one of its most significant upgrades to date, promising to push Tezos ahead of its competition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tezos price chart has been slightly choppy in recent days, at press time trading at the price of $1.11, up 0.53% on the day, despite losing 2.85% in the last seven days. On its monthly chart, however, Tezos has gained 1.30%, adding up to the 2023 increase of 52.54%.\n\nTezos year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the future growth in the value of digital assets can depend on multiple factors, the highlighted cryptocurrencies and their teams have demonstrated the capability to justify their status as Ethereum\u2019s main competitors, guaranteeing more progress this year, accompanied by strengthening prices.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH will Rally to $3000 on Shanghai Upgrade | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum has given a lukewarm performance this year, despite the market racing to reclaim its lost value. But it looks like ETH is back in the game, climbing 20% on the monthly chart. The coin broke past $1900 briefly on Wednesday and sits at $1,876.62 now.\n\nThe rally will gain momentum in the coming days, with the Shanghai upgrade around the corner. A steep ascent to $2250 can\u2019t be ruled out, given the relevance of the milestone. And if the market continues in recovery mode and the network development goes as planned, ETH is on the path to $3000 by the third quarter of 2023.\n\nHere is a closer Ethereum price prediction and how you can make the most of the upcoming ETH rally.\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade is Scheduled for 12 April\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade, or Shapella Upgrade to be more precise, will activate on the Ethereum network at epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023.\n\nThe milestone is much-awaited, as it marks the completion of Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. More importantly, it follows The Merge and enables validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. In addition, it will bring new functionality to both the execution and consensus layers.\n\nShapella Upgrade combines changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella) and the Engine API. The smart contracts and protocol rules depend on Shanghai, whereas Capella ensures that all network validators follow these rules. Validators who have had to stake their ETH to add blocks to Ethereum for its transition to a PoS consensus mechanism can now unstake them. That essentially means that ETH which have long been locked up are entering the market again.\n\nEthereum three-month price history, 7 April 2023, source: CoinMarketCap\n\nWhile increased supply should be a cause of concern usually, that is not the case here. The flexibility of deposits and withdrawals will instill more confidence in holders to stake. The Shapella Upgrade will urge more ETH holders to stake and participate in the consensus mechanism. It goes without saying that the development milestone reaffirms faith in the blockchain and its ecosystem, fuelling demand for the coin as an investment, as we have seen in the last few days.\n\nWhile Ethereum has not caught up with Bitcoin in terms of price performance so far this year, that won\u2019t be the case this quarter, with increased ETH liquidity.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Touch $3000 this Quarter?\n\nETH\u2019s quick jump from $1379 in March to $1900 in April reveals the market\u2019s excitement about the upcoming milestone and what to expect. The altcoin is reversing the losses made in 2022, while reclaiming its status as the blue-chip crypto by driving solid demand and growth.\n\nAs the blockchain approaches the Shanghai Upgrade, it can climb to $2250, which is only ~$350 up from where it is now. The relevance of the milestone justifies the short and steep hike. But the real question is whether ETH can retain the value and continue the journey upward.\n\nIf the coin continues to strengthen the buying momentum, it has the potential to cross $3000 by the end of the quarter. The fact that ETH accumulation by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance has increased in recent weeks substantiates the price prediction. Their ETH holdings have increased by 0.5% in March alone.\n\nETH supply distribution among investors with 1,000 ETH or above, source: Santiment\n\nWhen it comes to 1 million-10 million ETH (brown) and the 10 million \u2013 100 million ETH balance groups, the numbers come to 0.4% and 0.5%. Here is another optimistic stat \u2013 the net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address has crossed 18M after soaring 3.5% in March.\n\nEthereum: ETH 2.0 Total Value Staked [ETH], source: Glassnode\n\nThat said, Ethereum can plunge to $1550 if there are glitches in the upgrade or the broader market lets down. A post-Shapella dip is well expected too, although it will be short-lived.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023\n\nEthereum has a lot to look forward to in 2023 as it continues to improve the network speed, security, transaction costs, and user experience.\n\nOne of the key milestones includes Proto-danksharding, which will reduce transaction costs. Currently, Rollup data is stored on Ethereum permanently. It is expensive and accounts for more than 90% of the transaction cost users pay on rollups. The plan is to move the data into a new temporary \u2018blob\u2019 storage. They are cheaper as they can be deleted if no longer needed. Blob transactions will be added to Ethereum in an upgrade known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d, which will be shipped in late 2023, according to the project\u2019s official roadmap.\n\nThat can kindle a strong Ethereum bull run. Even if the coin doesn\u2019t ascent to its all-time high of $4,878.26, it can set a bottom at $4,000 for 2024.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment?\n\nEthereum is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. It is an asset backed by an established project which continues to grow, expand, and improve. As the blockchain sector grows, so will Ethereum. If you\u2019re looking for a blue-chip crypto with a low risk-reward ratio, Ethereum makes an excellent choice. As the world\u2019s biggest altcoin, Ethereum has a massive market cap of $224B, despite the huge drop in value last year.\n\nThat leaves ETH with little room for growth. The highest it can climb this year is 2X. So, it is a good idea to diversify your portfolio with emerging assets that can go 5X to 10X. We have listed below three underrated cryptocurrencies, based on their utilities, market relevance, and credibility.\n\n1. Love Hate Inu \u2013 Meme Coin Ready to Explode\n\nMeme coins have a history of kindling some of the biggest crypto rallies. They can turn you into a millionaire or wipe out your wallet overnight. Their strength lies in the solidity of the community. But the lack of utility, common among meme coins, has proven to be detrimental to their sustainability.\n\nSo meme coins remain a risky investment.\n\nLove Hate Inu aims to change the narrative. It is one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this year, and for the right reason. The vote-to-earn crypto, now in the presale phase, has managed to penetrate a broad market.\n\nAs the name gives it away, a vote-to-earn crypto lets you vote on a wide range of topics from politics to pop culture and sports and earn rewards in return. Rooted in the fast-growing online survey market, Love Hate Inu introduces a transparent voting platform integrated with crypto incentivization.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company, the global online survey software market has exploded from $2.79 billion in 2022 to $3.2 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 14.6%. The market will grow to $5.69 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 15.5%.\n\nGiven that businesses are increasingly using surveys as a means to understand customer behavior, interests, and spending patterns, Love Hate Inu is stepping into a fertile market. Blockchain-powered smart contracts will mitigate the element of fraud and manipulation, which are common in traditional markets.\n\nLove Hate Inu features a robust staking mechanism that makes the voting process both verifiable and anonymous. The authenticity of the poll, results, or reward distribution can be verified on the blockchain, which is out for anyone to see. While the team will create the polls in the initial phases, Love Hate Inu is building a community-first vote-to-earn ecosystem. So eventually, the community will create the polls.\n\n#LoveHateInu Voters, Creators and Followers!\ud83d\ude4f The time has finally come, we have reached 3M!!!\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Get ready for the phenomenal CEO reveal!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc40 As always we thank you for all the support you have given us!\u2764\ufe0f Join us today!\ud83d\udd25https://t.co/Pu2Bo8WOUy#Trump #AndrewTate pic.twitter.com/t6J7r6gGvH \u2014 Love Hate Inu (@LoveHateInu) April 6, 2023\n\nIt is also important to note that 90% of the LHINU supply will be sold in the ongoing public presale to ensure that the community holds the majority of the tokens. This decision will come to the advantage of the project in the coming months, as the future of a crypto meme coin largely lies in the hands of the community.\n\nThat said, Love Hate Inu is not a meme coin built solely on community power. It has an ambitious roadmap:\n\nThe Love Hate Inu (LHINU) presale has crossed the $3M milestone within days of going live. The meteoric progress of the presale strengthens the possibility of a meme coin rally upon its token launch. It\u2019s not too late to buy LHINU.\n\nYou can still get it for presale discounts. The earlier you get in, the higher the discounts.\n\nPresale started March 7, 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, Transak Chain Ethereum Min Investment N/A Max Investment N/A\n\nBUY LOVE HATE INU\n\n2. DeeLance \u2013 The Best Utility Token of 2023\n\nDeeLance is a Web 3.0 freelancing and recruitment platform. It brings transparency and decentralization to the freelancing market, which is riddled with scams and manipulation. DeeLance aims to radically innovate the industry by providing decentralized, secure tools and ownership rights to users in a digital economy.\n\nA report finds that more than 65% of employed people want to work full-time as remote employees. The global gig economy is expected to cross $450 billion in 2023 and the freelancing industry to surpass $12 billion by 2028.\n\nYou will need no browser plugins, third-party apps, credit card details, or wallets-linking to access the platform, which is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy. It taps into the true potential of blockchain technology, by knocking out predatory intermediaries from the equation.\n\nAnother key highlight of the platform is the control over data. It offers an excellent blockchain alternative to traditional freelancing platforms that sell user data to marketing and advertising companies. The automated dispute system of the platform stores all buyer and seller reputations on the public blockchain. Secure escrow accounts implement trustlessness into the ecosystem, ensuring that freelancers receive payment for the services they provide.\n\nDeeLance allows you to convert the work submitted on the platform into NFTs. The feature ensures that the employer has full rights to the work they\u2019re paying for, which in turn mitigates copyright violations. The platform also charges much lower fees when compared to legacy competitors, since it brings employers and freelancers under one umbrella.\n\nThe presale of DLANCE, the native cryptocurrency of the platform, is now live on the official website. You can purchase DLANCE using ETH, USDT, or a credit card. Get them early for the best discounts. The project will use the funds secured from the presale to build the DeeLance NFT marketplace and metaverse app and to establish its credibility through global networking.\n\nPresale Started 30 March 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, Credit Card Chain Ethereum Min Investment $10 Max Investment None\n\nBUY DEELANCE\n\n3. Ecoterra \u2013 Green Crypto Backed by a Recycle-2-Earn App\n\nWe wrap up this list with Ecoterra, a first-of-its-kind Recycle2Earn application that reinvigorates the green market using Web 3.0. The ecosystem underpinned by a crypto reward system motivates individuals and institutions to join the fight against climate change.

It is one of the best green crypto projects to enter the market in recent times, as it acknowledges the importance of rewards and recognition in climate action. The project has the potential to implement more transparency and efficiency in climate action.\n\nThe project can climb anywhere from 3X to 5X upon its launch, later this quarter. The best way into the project is the ongoing Ecoterra presale. Since the price of Ecoterra will increase as the presale moves to the next stages, get in early for high discounts.\n\nSymbol ECOTERRA Network Ethereum ERC-20 Total Supply 2 Billion Buy with ETH, USDT, Card\n\nBUY ECOTERRA"
