Since then the price trend turned sideways and remained within the range of the aforementioned red candle.\n\nThe $1890 resistance and $1830 support are the crucial levels that can influence the near future trend of ETH coins. Currently, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum trades at $1868, with a bullish candle of 0.3% gain.\n\nIf the overhead supply continues to pressure the market participants, a breakdown below the pattern support trendline and $1830, will increase the selling momentum.

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains make web3 more accessible and easier to use by providing a human-readable wallet address for Ethereum users.\n\nUsing lengthy addresses for transactions or smart contracts helps secure blockchain networks but isn\u2019t user-friendly, especially for beginners and non-tech-savvy enthusiasts. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) aims to simplify the user experience with Ethereum addresses and make the network more accessible.\n\nRead on to learn more about ENS and how to get an ENS domain.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Name Service?\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, open naming system on the Ethereum blockchain. It maps machine-readable identifiers, which are long public addresses such as (0x40qp126b\u2026), to human-readable names that are easy to remember, like unchained.eth.\n\nENS shares a similar purpose to Domain Name System (DNS), which simplifies Web2 IP addresses to human-readable names.\n\nENS and DNS have key architectural differences where ENS is a distributed domain name provider while DNS depends on centralized servers. You can register domain names for decentralized websites on ENS and import DNS names you own to ENS.\n\nHow Does ENS Work?\n\nLike DNS, Ethereum Name Service uses hierarchical names (domains) that give you complete control over subdomains.\n\nThe ENS has three principal components: registry, resolver, and ENS name.\n\nThe registry is the core smart contract that has the list of domains and subdomains and maps them to Ethereum addresses. When you create a name, the contract registers a new entry that associates the new name with your Ethereum address.\n\nResolvers permit updates of domain names to Ethereum addresses. They are responsible for resolving names on ENS through inquiries to the registry to find records of the name.\n\nThe ENS name is registered after you get a confirmation of your entry to the registry with the domain name and Ethereum address. The smart contract will store the domain name mapped to your address on the Ethereum blockchain , where it is tamper-proof and visible to the public.\n\nYou can also register domain names for decentralized websites (dApps) by creating an entry with your website\u2019s InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) hash. IPFS is a peer-to-peer file system supported by web browsers, including Brave, MetaMask, or Opera.\n\nHow to Get an ENS Domain\n\nBefore you can get your hands on a personalized ENS domain, you will need a crypto wallet and some ETH.\n\nSpecifically, you need a non-custodial Ethereum wallet that supports ENS. The wallet address will link to your domain name on ENS. You should choose a wallet that is accessible through browser extensions and can access Web3-based sites. The wallet will aid in purchasing your ENS domain.\n\nAdditionally, you need ether (ETH) in your wallet to pay for domain registration and cover transaction fees (gas fees). There are several options for you to buy ETH so you can send it to your non-custodial wallet.\n\nYearly renewal fees on ENS are $5 for domain names five characters or longer, names with four characters cost $160 per year, and names with three characters cost $640 per year. These costs don\u2019t include gas prices.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the steps to get an ENS domain.\n\n1. Connect your non-custodial wallet to ENS\n\nGo to https://app.ens.domains/ and connect your preferred wallet to the site through the \u2018connect\u2019 option. Follow the pop-up instructions on connecting the dApp to your wallet.\n\n2. Search for your .eth name\n\nThe ENS domain platform has a search bar where you can see if the name you want is still available. If the name is in use, you can check who its current owner is and when its registration expires. If available, you can pick a period (in years) you\u2019ll register for it and move to the next step.\n\n3. Purchase your domain name\n\nYou will get the estimated registration and gas fees for your selected name, depending on its character length. Sign the transactions once you request to register and wait for confirmation that no one else is registering the name.\n\n4. Complete registration and set resolver\n\nOnce your transaction is confirmed, complete registration and get your ENS domain. Lastly, set the resolver to allow dApps to use your ENS name instead of your wallet address.\n\nENS makes Ethereum more accessible to cryptocurrency beginners and reduces the chances of error when performing transactions using addresses."

        "content": "Patrick Hansen, a Circle executive, is concerned that entities involved in Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) activities on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms might be banned from operating in the European Union (EU) once the Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation comes into effect.\n\nMiCA, adopted by the European Parliament on April 20, 2023, marks a significant milestone as the first clear legislation governing the issuance and provision of services related to crypto-assets and stablecoins. Its enforcement is scheduled between mid-2024 and early 2025.\n\nAlthough progressive, MiCA\u2019s Article 92, which aims to prevent and prohibit market abuse involving crypto-assets, is particularly interesting. Specifically, lawyers and industry stakeholders have drawn attention to this provision, as it holds potential implications for MEV participants operating within the EU.\n\nFlashbots & everyone else involved in MEV should pay close attention to MiCA Art. 92 that could deem MEV to be illegal market abuse (transaction ordering).\n\n\n\nESMA will publish technical standards on the topic in Q1 24. I highly encourage people involved to engage early-on. pic.twitter.com/zDa5E9BY7L \u2014 Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) July 29, 2023\n\nTitle VI of MiCA highlights the \u201cprevention and prohibition of market abuse involving crypto-assets\u201d and applies to all transactions, orders, or behaviors related to any crypto-asset traded on exchanges. Notably, this regulation covers activities regardless of whether they occur on a trading platform like Kraken, for example, or within the on-chain ecosystem like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.\n\nYou might also like: PancakeSwap aims to enhance platform availability with Google Cloud integration\n\nBased on this interpretation, MEV, the practice of extracting the maximum value from block production by manipulating transaction order, is now under scrutiny due to MiCA. The regulation allows agencies to examine certain MEV practices that could be construed as market manipulation, mainly if they involve artificial price inflation or deceptive transactions.\n\nBeyond market manipulation, MiCA also addresses wash trading, another form of illegal market abuse that deliberately inflates trading volumes. Observers say this may present challenges for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and platforms, including exchanges approved to operate in the region, ensuring market liquidity for leading tokens while concurrently complying with the stringent MiCA requirements.\n\nYou might also like: Stablecoin issuers in Europe advised to start complying before 2024\n\nTaking account of this broad interpretation, though enforcement is still months away, experts predict heightened scrutiny for MEV teams within the EU. If MiCA bans MEV practices in Europe, its effect might be filled across the decentralized finance (defi) and crypto ecosystem, possibly impacting liquidity.\n\nStill, MiCA\u2019s proactive approach to regulating market abuse in the crypto sphere underscores the EU\u2019s commitment to managing the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Therefore, as the global community watches the impact of MiCA\u2019s implementation, other jurisdictions will likely draw insights and adapt their regulatory frameworks accordingly.\n\nIn a recent Series B funding round led by Paradigm, Flashbots, a research and development startup focused on Ethereum, secured $60 million. The funding will be used to continue developing their Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression (SUAVE) network, which aims to reduce the negative impact of MEV.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

All requests are labeled with \"Awaiting Approval\" status. The deadline for the SEC to declare its verdicts is in mid-October 2023.\n\nThe commentators below the announcement are also waiting for $9 trillion asset management giant Blackrock to join the club of six Ethereum Futures ETF pioneers in the U.S.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the world's first exchange traded fund backed by \"physical\" Ethereum (ETH) was launched in Canada in April 2021.\n\nLocal asset manager Purpose Investments with $15 billion in AUM released this ETF on Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nExperts are optimistic about ETFs outside Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nFutures and spot ETFs on cryptocurrencies are considered as game-changers for the investment world. They will eliminate the necessity for companies to store Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) physically in digital custody.\n\nAs such, wealth managers will be able to invest in crypto just like they do with \"regular\" exchange-traded products. This, in turn, might trigger the injection of capital into the sphere and can be a possible catalyst for a cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, seasoned crypto VC Vance Spencer stressed that the launch of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF would result in many other crypto-based products being greenlighted.\n\nThese major announcements might land as soon as this year, he opines."

        "content": "Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says that Ethereum (ETH) still isn\u2019t ready for its moment to truly shine, based on historical data.\n\nIn a new video update, Cowen takes a look at Ethereum\u2019s historical average monthly return on investment (ROI), which suggests that Q3, or summer months, are generally not the best times to accumulate or hold ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, the analyst says that late Q4 or early Q1 have historically been the best times to accumulate Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe one-year timeframe shows you that December and January are best, on average. So on average, going back throughout all of ETH\u2019s history, if you bought ETH with a goal to sell it one year later, December and January have historically been the best.\n\nThe worst month was July. If you think about it, think about where ETH was last July. It wasn\u2019t at a very different price than what it is today, I mean you\u2019re talking pretty much the same price, maybe plus or minus a couple of hundred dollars but that\u2019s where we were last July. And you can see there\u2019s this sort of lull in even the one-year ROI buying in that April, May, June July timeframe but as you get further out into Q4, it tends to go up.\n\nIf you go out to two years (ROI), you\u2019ll see the same type of thing: June and July are the worst, and January and December are the best.\u201d\n\nCowen says there\u2019s clear seasonality associated with Ethereum, one that suggests that investors who accumulate ETH at the end of the year to January have performed better than others on average.\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,858.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But the attackers didn't get away with the entire stash.\n\nSomeone used the exploit in Curve\u2019s CRV-ETH liquidity pool\u2014where Ethereum can be swapped for the exchange\u2019s governance token, Curve DAO (CRV)\u2014to, in a sense, exploit the exploiters. The transaction cost about $32 worth of crypto in transaction fees but yielded 2,879 Ethereum\u2014a profit of around $5.4 million.\n\nThe 2,879 Ethereum was ultimately returned to Curve by a bot bearing the name \u201cc0ffeebabe.eth,\u201d according to Etherscan. Ethereum addresses are a long string of alphanumeric characters by default, but the bot\u2019s owner gave it a human-readable name using the Ethereum Name Service. PeckShield also attributes the bot with having nabbed another $1.6 million from synthetic asset protocol Metronome, and a representative of the security firm told Decrypt that 90% of those funds have also now been returned.\n\nThe bot's action was a lucrative, split-second arbitrage play, involving flash loans and the decentralized exchange Uniswap, Yixin Cao, lead data scientist at the DeFi analysis platform EigenPhi told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of actors can do this type of thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of sophisticated attackers out there, but this kind of arbitrage requires very in-depth knowledge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUniswap and Balancer\n\nEigenPhi\u2019s breakdown of the transaction outlines 16 distinct steps taken by the bot\u2014but the play hinged on two distinct DeFi projects.\n\nC0ffeebabe.eth\u2019s split-second trade first tapped Balancer, a liquidity protocol, for a flash loan of 100 Ethereum. Flash loans are uncollateralized and require debtors to pay them back within the same transaction.\n\nThen, Uniswap was essential, Cao said, because it allowed c0ffeebabe.eth to capitalize on the discrepancy between CRV\u2019s price on Uniswap and Curve it planned to create by using the Vyper bug. The bot swapped 70 Ethereum for over 190,000 CRV using Uniswap.\n\nAn initial burst of 30,000 CRV directed at Curve\u2019s CRV-ETH pool caused the Vyper bug to throw it out of balance. The pool\u2019s unbalanced state allowed c0ffeebabe.eth to exchange its remaining CRV for 2,949 Ethereum\u2014317 times what it would have otherwise been able to get without the exploit.\n\nAfter the flash loan was repaid, that left c0ffeebabe.eth with a sizable profit.\n\nThe Vyper exploit turned what would\u2019ve been a small play into a massive one, Cao said. Without leveraging the vulnerability, c0ffeebabe.eth would\u2019ve walked away with only 9.3 Ethereum based on a simulation conducted by EigenPhi.\n\nOn-chain Hope\n\nNot long after the deed was done, c0ffeebabe.eth broadcast a message using Internal Data Messages (IDM), which allows messages to be sent on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\n\u201cMoving funds to cold wallet for now, affected protocols can contact via etherscan chat,\u201d the person behind the bot said on-chain, signaling they would hold the stolen funds in a digital wallet securely that has private keys isolated from the internet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDeployer from Curve,\u201d one Ethereum account responded on-chain, identifying itself as part of the Curve team. \u201cOne tx you front-ran was a hack of CRV/ETH pool. Can refund?\u201d\n\nSeveral blockchain security experts told Decrypt that c0ffeebabe.eth\u2019s trade did not appear to be an example of front-running. Regardless, the bot eventually parted with what would\u2019ve been its biggest payday ever.\n\nPrior to Sunday, c0ffeebabe.eth had amassed around $29,000 in profit across different arbitrage transactions, according to EigenPhi\u2019s account profiler. Even though Sunday\u2019s takeaway overshadowed the bot's performance to date, it didn\u2019t prevent c0ffeebabe.eth from fulfilling its selfless, white-hat service.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to include comment from PeckShield."

This pushes it past palladium and brings it to just $17 billion behind platinum, indicating a notable surge among global assets.\n\nBitcoin also retains a substantial rank as the 12th largest global asset by market capitalization, with a valuation of approximately $570 billion. Although it\u2019s still significantly away from the top group\u2014occupied by tech stocks and precious metals such as silver and gold\u2014its stature remains among the world\u2019s leading assets.\n\nThese advancements highlight the growing impact of cryptocurrencies on the global financial stage. Specifically, Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory underscores the evolving character of the market as it establishes its position alongside traditional assets like precious metals.\n\nInvestors and market watchers alike will likely continue to closely monitor the progress of both Bitcoin and Ethereum as they challenge conventional asset classes and potentially reshape the hierarchy of global market capitalizations."

Powell\u2019s home in Los Angeles was reportedly searched by the FBI, and his electronic devices were seized.\n\nSpecifically, according to a report by Finance Magnates, Powell is being probed for allegedly blocking access to the emails and computer accounts of the Verge Center for the Arts. Besides that, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California has reportedly been investigating Powell.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Powell, who stepped down as Kraken\u2019s CEO last year, was removed from the Board of Directors of Verge. However, he filed a lawsuit against the non-profit organization contesting his dismissal.\n\nIRS Targets Kraken\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Kraken was ordered by the federal court to submit information related to historical transactions and users\u2019 accounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The tax agency is reportedly examining whether there are any underreported taxes by the exchange.\n\nIn February, the IRS filed a petition before a federal court in the Northern District of California seeking customer data that transacted more than USD $20,000 between 2016 and 2020 on Kraken. Additionally, the tax agency accused the crypto exchange of failing to comply with the sermons issued earlier."

        "content": "On July 31, a report by the Financial Times reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested Coinbase to cease all cryptocurrency trading, including Ethereum, with Bitcoin being the only exception, before taking legal action against the company.\n\nOn July 31, a report by the Financial Times reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested Coinbase to cease all cryptocurrency trading, including Ethereum, with Bitcoin being the only exception, before taking legal action against the company.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong disclosed the SEC's stance, stating that we believe all assets except Bitcoin are securities, but the regulatory body did not clarify how this conclusion was reached.\n\nArmstrong further explained that the SEC had proposed this course of action the previous month, prior to filing a lawsuit against the Nasdaq-listed company. The basis for the lawsuit was Coinbase's failure to register as a broker. Armstrong expressed his belief that compliance with the SEC's request might have established a precedent, potentially compelling most U.S. crypto companies to operate outside legal boundaries unless registered with the commission.\n\nThe SEC's allegations against Coinbase include engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program since 2019. On June 6, 2023, the SEC formally charged Coinbase with operating its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC accused Coinbase of failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program, a platform that enables customers to profit from the \"proof of stake\" mechanisms of specific blockchains. The SEC's complaint seeks a range of legal remedies, including injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and other equitable relief. The announcement of the lawsuit led to a 12% decline in Coinbase's stock on that day.\n\nIn its case against Coinbase, the SEC identified 13 smaller cryptocurrencies traded on the platform as securities. These include SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO. The SEC contends that by offering these cryptocurrencies, the trading platform falls under regulatory jurisdiction, further complicating the legal landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Ethereum is about to get crushed by liquid staking tokens - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Before we know it, liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are going to replace Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). The LST market is already worth approximately $17 billion, and it has grown continuously since Ethereum\u2019s Merge.\n\nWhile LSTs are just beginning to hit their stride, their advantages over traditional ETH will soon become clear to liquidity providers (LPs), toppling ETH from its throne and ushering in a new era of LST domination.\n\nSince the Merge, ETH can now be staked to produce a roughly 4% annual yield, depending on factors of network activity, total ETH staked, number of validators and the value captured by maximum extractable value. This development is significant because of the nature of ETH as a generally stable asset. Many cryptocurrencies are more volatile, so owners have to consider both yield and whether the price of that asset will appreciate or depreciate. Alternatively, ETH now offers yields from both staking and gradual price stability and appreciation.\n\nRelated: Lower costs, higher speeds after Ethereum\u2019s Merge? Don\u2019t count on it\n\nThe new capacity to stake ETH and earn yield means that those who hold ETH today must decide: Should they provide liquidity with their ETH and hope to earn fees, or would they be better off staking that ETH and earning a surefire yield?\n\nLSTs solve this dilemma for LPs. Unlike regular staked ETH, which is illiquid in the Ethereum staking contract, LSTs unlock the inherent value of staked tokens, giving LPs a liquid \u201creceipt\u201d token that can be freely traded and utilized as collateral within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Because LSTs make staked assets liquid, they offer flexibility for tokenholders to engage in other activities across different networks while still earning ETH staking rewards.\n\nThis means that LPs can now earn the yield from staked ETH while simultaneously using LSTs to provide liquidity in automated market makers (AMMs). Critically, LSTs also offer a much lower cost to entry than regular ETH staking, which is appealing for reaching new audiences and smaller dollar investors.\n\nThe argument that LSTs will replace ETH in DeFi is evident: Any LP who chooses to supply ETH to an AMM instead of an LST is sacrificing roughly 4% APR. What kind of sense would that make for folks looking to maximize their yield?\n\nThere are undoubtedly some in this space who would argue that ETH is ETH \u2014 that it\u2019s the second biggest token in the cryptocurrency landscape and that it\u2019s not going anywhere. But crypto is quick to evolve. This community is always looking for the next technical development that makes earning yield easier and more efficient, and when it comes down to it, LSTs offer a more effective way to earn yield.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Merge will affect more than just its blockchain\n\nThe transition to LSTs will come swiftly, but right now, it\u2019s still very early days. Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which enabled ETH to be unstaked for the first time, only happened in April. But LSTs have a much larger market potential than their current market share represents. As people become more comfortable with staking ETH now that it can be easily unstaked, I believe that we will see a rapidly growing adoption of liquid staking platforms.\n\nThe beginning of this transition can already be seen in staking trends in the post-Shanghai world. In 2023 alone, the ETH deposited with the Lido protocol has increased from 4.9 million to 8 million, representing more than 30% of all staked ETH. The Swell Network, which launched in mid-April, already has more than 43,000 ETH staked on its platform.\n\nETH staked on Swell as of July 30, 2023. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nThis shift could mean LSTs will take over as the dominant asset in decentralized exchanges and eventually replace ETH entirely as the go-to token in crypto. The sweeping growth of \u201cLSTFi\u201d could usher in an age in which all ETH will be staked through liquid staking protocols and users will do all trading and other activities using LSTs.\n\nYes, ETH is the more familiar asset. But familiar doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cbest.\u201d Before settling into purchasing ETH and then having to make decisions about what financial opportunity to forfeit via providing liquidity vs. staking, folks in DeFi should take a spin through the up-and-coming LST ecosystem. Right now may be the last real chance to get in on the ground floor and maximize the impact of their investments.\n\nUltimately, an LST takeover would be a positive thing for the industry. Many crypto users left during our \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d and there\u2019s been a noticeable slowdown in garnering interest from new users. LSTs are a more accessible option to attract new users and could be the new breath of life this industry needs.\n\nBob Baxley is a core builder for the Maverick Protocol.

Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, began life with an ICO price of around $0.31, showcasing its astronomical growth over the past eight years.\n\nThis event marks yet another time in recent months that an Ethereum whale has stirred from slumber. In late May, another Ethereum holder, dormant since the ICO eight years ago, suddenly transferred all of their 8,000 Ether (approximately $14.7 million) into a new account.\n\nThese large-scale transactions by early Ethereum participants have ignited speculations and conversations within the crypto community.\n\nDespite their significant holdings, it is highly unlikely that these whales could introduce significant volatility into the market if they decided to sell large amounts of ETH.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these early Ethereum adopters' activities will have any substantial impact on the broader crypto market."

        "content": "Fixed-term lending protocol Term Finance is slated to launch on the Ethereum mainnet today.\n\nThe protocol enables non-custodial, fixed-rate lending with collateral using the tri-party repurchase, or repo, model commonly used in traditional banking.\n\nTri-party repo is a repurchase transaction involving three parties. In TradFi, security dealers will find short-term repos to manage both their own assets and their client\u2019s assets. In the case of Term Finance, the security dealer will be replaced by smart contracts.\n\nBilly Welch, the co-founder of Term Labs, the team behind Term Finance, told Blockworks its ability to scale fixed-term lending sets it apart from other fixed-term lending protocols.\n\nMany existing fixed-term lending protocols today utilize automated market makers and liquidity pools to originate fixed-term loans.\n\n\u201cFrom a borrower\u2019s perspective, when you\u2019re trying to borrow (for example) $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, there is significant slippage,\u201d Welch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not scalable for an institutional level user, then from [a liquidity provider] or lender\u2019s perspective, you only make returns as borrowers interact against that pool. So your real returns are half a percent per year.\u201d\n\nTerm Finance, on the other hand, uses a double-sided blind auction process where the protocol matches borrowers and lenders depending on how much they are willing to bid, Welch said.\n\n\u201cWe conduct these auctions where borrowers and lenders can submit their bids and offers to borrow and lend over a period of time, and once the auction closes, we take the bids and offers and create a supply-demand curve,\u201d Welch said. \u201cAny borrower that\u2019s willing to bid at or above the clearing rate gets a loan, and any lender willing to receive the clearing rate or less makes a loan.\u201d\n\nWith this model, liquidity providers will not have to trap their liquidity in an automated market maker for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is lock it up for the period of when you submit your bid, if you get done in an auction you get a loan, and if you don\u2019t you can take your tokens back and send it to another DeFi lending protocol and get variable rate lending in that capacity,\u201d Welch said.\n\nThe first public auction on Ethereum mainnet will be a one-month loan maturing Aug. 31 on wstETH collateral borrowing USDC. The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n\u201cThe long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. This can serve as a basis for a DeFi native benchmark yield curve,\u201d Welch said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The recent Curve Finance exploit has reportedly led to one of the largest ever maximal extractable value (MEV) reward blocks of 584.05 Ether (ETH).\n\nOn July 31, Ethereum core developer \u201ceric.eth\u201d reported that \u201ctoday has produced some of the largest MEV reward blocks in Ethereum\u2019s history,\u201d adding it was caused by the exploit of Curve Finance stable pools on July 30.\n\nData shows a larger MEV reward block of 692 ETH was recorded in March.\n\n\u201cA bot notices an incoming hack in the mempool, reproduces the tx [transaction] and front runs it\u201d, he explained before adding, \u201cTo do so they pay the block producer a lot of ETH to be front of the line.\u201d\n\nToday has produced some of the largest MEV reward blocks in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nSlot 6,992,273: 584 ETH\n\nSlot 6,993,342: 345 ETH\n\nSlot 6,992,050: 247 ETH\n\nSlot 6,993,346: 51 ETH \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) July 30, 2023\n\nA MEV bot is designed to generate extra revenue by reordering and/or inserting transactions in an otherwise normal block to generate arbitrage opportunities.\n\nMEV bots can also see pending liquidation transactions and front-run them to buy the liquidated assets first at a discount.\n\nThe validator gets to propose a block using a relay that outsources their block production to entities specialized in extracting this extra revenue. They will get a cut of this revenue in exchange for allowing the MEV bot to front-run the transaction.\n\nThis is known as the \u201cblock reward\u201d and some huge ones have been logged over the past few hours.\n\nThe highest MEV bot block reward was 584.05 ETH, valued at around $1 million, confirmed at 1.34 am UTC on July 31, according to Beaconcha.in. There were also block rewards for 345 ETH and 247 ETH around that time.\n\nRelated: Vyper vulnerability exposes DeFi ecosystem to stress tests\n\nMoral questions were raised among the responses to the tweet and the implications of potentially illicit funds being used to pay validators to allow the front-running of transactions.\n\n\u201cAnd this is where the morality of MEV rewards going to miners gets pretty shady. These are effectively hacked funds.\u201d\n\nIn April, a Subway-themed trading bot made millions in extractable value by using \u201csandwich attacks\u201d during the memecoin trading frenzy.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Should crypto projects ever negotiate with hackers?

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has recently emphasized the financial advantage of Cardano over Ethereum when it comes to transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crypto mogul pointed to a tweet claiming a transaction of 56 assets on the Cardano network cost just $0.14, a fee he claims could never be matched by Ethereum.\n\nIn his tweet, he hints that the lower costs may be attributed to the unique features of Cardano's blockchain architecture including extended UTXO (Eutxo), native assets, and its smart contract language Plutus.\n\nExtended UTXO refers to the underlying ledger model of Cardano. Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform\u2019s smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the \"Japanese Ethereum,\" is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson's comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as \"a dumpster fire\" and suggested that it could become obsolete."

Discover SCENE\n\nThis morning, Curve Finance said that apart from several Ethereum pools, an Arbitrum-based liquidity pool may have also been \"potentially affected\" over the weekend.\n\nCurve Finance is a popular decentralized exchange (DEX), letting users swap like-assets such as Ethereum for Staked Ethereum, or Tether's USDT for Circle's USDC. It can be a helpful arbitrage tool for many traders should those assets decouple in price from one another.\n\nPer initial reports, the platform was exploited on Sunday for over $24 million. However, blockchain security firm PeckShield has updated the stolen amount to $52 million as the hack unfolds in real-time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decentralized exchange\u2019s team wrote in the tweet that four liquidity pools for tokens paired with Ethereum (ETH) and Curve governance token CRV, and several ERC-20 tokens issued on Alchemix (alETH), Metronome Synth (smETH), JPEG\u2019d (pETH) \u201cwere hacked\u201d due to an \u201cissue in Vyper compiler\u201d versions.\n\nVyper is a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The programming language\u2019s core team tweeted this morning some older versions of the Vyper programming language were vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nPSA: Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 are vulnerable to malfunctioning reentrancy locks. The investigation is ongoing but any project relying on these versions should immediately reach out to us. \u2014 Vyper (@vyperlang) July 30, 2023\n\nA lead contributor for the programming language also took to Twitter, saying that the hackers likely spend \"weeks to months to find\" the vulnerability.\n\nThe latest tweet by Curve's team highlighted another knock-on effect on the Vyper-based liquidity pool on its deployment on the layer-2 solution Arbitrum. The team said that Tricrypto, made of three tokens: USDC, wBTC, and ETH was \u201cpotentially affected.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe tweet read that while security experts like auditors and Vyper devs have not yet found a way for a \u201cprofitable exploit,\u201d the pools remain vulnerable and advised liquidity providers to \u201cexit that one.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, another BNB Chain-based DEX Ellipsis has reported an exploit of stable swap pools on BNB Chain.\n\nA small number of stablepools with BNB using an old Vyper compiler have been exploited. We are assessing the situation and will update the community on any further findings. https://t.co/pxkhRRSr5w \u2014 Ellipsis (@Ellipsisfi) July 30, 2023\n\nSouth Korean crypto exchange Upbit announced the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals of CRV tokens as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe exchange wrote in the press release that, \u201cUpbit will continue to monitor this situation, and members are advised to pay attention to the increase in price volatility of Curve.\u201d"

        "content": "After a remarkable journey of eight years since its inception, Ethereum (ETH) stands steadfast as the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.\n\nIts flexible blockchain infrastructure continues to underpin a myriad of applications, ranging from DeFi platforms to robust supply chain systems. Moreover, the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model holds promise in addressing scalability concerns and environmental impact.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is eyeing a crucial milestone at the $1,900 level, considering its recent trading activity characterized by a tight consolidation over the past week. In light of this, Finbold has sought insights from the widely-used price prediction tool on PricePredictions.com, which harnesses the power of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to assess the digital asset\u2019s potential value by the end of August.\n\nNoteworthy findings from the tool indicate a projected trading price of $1,785 for ETH on August 31, 2023, based on the data retrieved by Finbold on July 31.\n\nMachine algorithm\u2019s ETH price prediction for August 31, 2023. Source: PricePredictions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above forecast is based on several key technical indicators, including the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and more.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,866, experiencing a marginal decline of 0.4% for the day, mirroring a similar trend observed throughout the previous week.\n\nThe cryptocurrency encounters a support level at $1,811, which is essential in preventing further downward movements, while facing resistance at $1,926, acting as a barrier to potential upward surges. Notably, ETH is positioned above its 200-day simple moving average, indicating a positive long-term trend in its price movement.\n\nETH 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past 30 days, Ethereum has witnessed only 12 green days, representing 40% of the time, signifying a relatively moderate bullish momentum during this period.\n\nAdding further insight to the analysis, the 1-week technical analysis (TA) demonstrates a mixed sentiment towards Ethereum, suggesting a \u2018neutral\u2019 rating of 10 in their summary. This is derived from oscillators currently residing in the \u2018sell\u2019 zone at 2, implying a balanced view of the asset\u2019s price action. Additionally, the moving averages (MA) exhibit a \u2018buy\u2019 signal at 10, reinforcing some positive outlook for ETH\u2019s future performance.\n\nETH technical analysis 1-Week gauges.

The sweep of key lows could trigger a rally in later in the week, but investors need not hold their breath. The aura of this dormancy that penetrated altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), could likely end if BTC makes a strong recovery rally to $30,000.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin teases $29.5K, Ether drops as 'accumulator season' begins\n\nBitcoin price shows saturation as momentum falls\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is edging west, with neither bulls nor bears showing the upper hand. The king of crypto is showing signs of diminishing volatility that puts it at a standstill tethered to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $29,349.\n\nNevertheless, trending markets can only hold out for so long, and the next move could present soon. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) lower than 50 and tipping south, and the histograms of the Awesome Oscillators (AO) in the negative, Bitcoin price is more likely to head lower as momentum continues to fall.\n\nPossible inflection points for Bitcoin price are the $28,930 level or in the dire case the 200-day EMA at $28,464 on the 12-hour chart below. Failure to turnaround at these buyer congestion levels could expose BTC to a cliff, potentially toward the $27,000 range.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, bulls coming in at the aforementioned levels could revitalize Bitcoin price, fueling a breach from the 100-day EMA foothold at $29,349. An increase in buyer momentum beyond the 50-day EMA at $29,646 would be ideal, as a flip of this supplier congestion level into support would clear the path for a possible move to $31,462.\n\nA decisive move past this level would solidify an uptrend for Bitcoin price.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin hovers below $30,000 as Coinbase CEO recalls SEC's request before the lawsuit\n\nEthereum price mimics BTC\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is moving in harmony as BTC, consolidating sideways as domination under the 50-day EMA at the $1,870 level continues. As the Bitcoin influence weighs down on ETH, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could be due for a fall as volatility grows.\n\nWith the RSI momentum indicator below the 50 level, Ethereum price could lose the immediate support offered by the 100-day EMA at $1,842. A fall through this support level could see ETH revisit the June 21 lows marked by the support confluence between the horizontal line and the 200-day EMA at $1,782. Such a move would constitute a 5% drop from current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day chart\n\nConversely, if bullish momentum builds above the 100-day EMA, Ethereum price could ascend to flip the 50-day EMA back to support. An increase in buyer momentum could push ETH above the $1,953 resistance level, but for a confirmed uptrend, ETH must decisively breach the $2,019 hurdle.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum logs $1M MEV block reward amid Curve Finance exploit\n\nRipple price to drop before the next climb\n\nRipple (XRP) price eyes a 3% drop to collect buy side liquidity that remains uncollected under the $0.684 support level. Such a move could then see XRP turnaround to the north, with the developed price action providing a possible reentry point for willing investors.\n\nHowever, an uptrend would only be confirmed upon a strong move above the $0.826 resistance level. Notably, both the RSI and AO still favor the bulls, and with the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs at $0.615, $0.556 and $0.506 respectively heading north, the odds favor the bulls.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nNot ignoring the consequences of early profit-taking, there is also a likelihood of Ripple price falling below the $0.684 support and giving back all the ground covered in the July 13 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton considers XRP ruling the most significant non-fraud SEC enforcement action"

        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem has continued to see fascinating developments in the past weeks. Among the most notable is the sudden movement from a participant in Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO), who, after a roughly eight-year slumber, has sprung into action due to a reason.\n\nThe Ethereum ICO participant, whose address remained inactive for 2,922 days, stirred up by transferring 641 ether, an amount currently valued at nearly $1.2 million.\n\nAn Unexpected Move In The Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nThe intent behind these transactions was revealed through on-chain analytics X (Twitter) account Lookonchain, noting that the Ethereum ICO participant had moved the funds to stake them. This reason has raised speculation among the crypto community as some suggest that the whale behind this move might know something they don\u2019t.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If ETH Fails To Surpass $1,900\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 8 years of dormancy, transferred 641 $ETH out, and started staking. He received 2K $ETH($3.7M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hGoCb22LVr pic.twitter.com/ZO09r9uFMd \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2023\n\nJust over eight years ago, the same address received exactly 2,000 ETH from Ethereum\u2019s Genesis. This amount of ETH at the time was worth $620 as the Ethereum network arranged an exceptional sale event then that made ETH sell for $0.31 per ETH.\n\nThis event was before the network commenced its own token generation, providing a platform for early participants and co-founders to accrue pre-mined ETH. However, fast forward to nearly a decade later today, this same amount of 2,000 ETH is currently valued at over $3.72 million, showcasing the meteoric rise in the value of ETH since its inception.\n\nNotably, the awakening of this long-dormant Ethereum participant is not an isolated incident. It falls into a recent trend, observed over the summer, where several early ICO participants have begun transferring their ETH holdings.\n\nICO Participants Stirring After A Long Hiatus\n\nThis pattern of dormant Ethereum ICO participants springing into action isn\u2019t new. Two weeks prior to the latest transaction, a pre-mined stash of Ethereum, which had been lying dormant for nearly eight years, was abruptly moved. At current rates, this stash is estimated to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThis particular \u2018whale\u2019 move grabbed the attention of the crypto community, stirring speculation and interest in equal measure. Interestingly, the motives behind this transfer remain largely unknown, adding an element of mystery to the whale movement.\n\nRegardless of these ICO participants\u2019 movement on the blockchain, Ethereum has seen a continuous downtrend in the past few weeks.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTerm Labs today launches its fixed-rate lending protocol on Ethereum. Term Finance is a milestone towards the development of a more mature crypto market, one with rules more familiar to TradFi lenders and borrowers than current Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nVariable rates are the current rule in DeFi, making it riskier for large professional portfolios to get on board.\n\nInterest rates on protocols like Aave and Compound are calculated according to supply and demand. So, if a crypto whale deposits a boatload of funds into a lending pool, rates across the board will plummet in accordance with the abundance of supply, and vice versa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Term team channeled the U.S. Treasury for inspiration, specifically its auction calendar model, which matches borrowers and lenders who have set predetermined rates. The collateral is then locked up in a smart contract for the duration of the auction, aka the loan\u2019s term.\n\nTerm Finance promises zero slippage\u2014an occurrence where the expected price of a trade is different from the final price after the trade has been executed. It also promises no spread, which is when two listed prices (commonly buy and sell) are different.\n\nIn addition, the team hopes investors and traders will be lured by low fees and high-quality blue chip collateral like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins by Circle and Tether\n\nBack in February, Term Labs raised $2.5 million to build the lending platform. The funding round was led by Electric Capital and included contributions from Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Robot Ventures, and Mexc Ventures.\n\nTerm Labs turns to the future\n\nBilly Welch, Term Labs\u2019 co-founder confirmed with Decrypt that Term Finance will branch out into other blockchains and layer-2 solutions \u201cshortly after\u201d the first launch on Ethereum. While no dates were given, Welch said the protocol \u201cwill be multi-chain soon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cmost popular\u201d lending and borrowing activities among the 2,000 testnet users and private mainnet beta was, according to Welch, borrowing stablecoins against liquid staking tokens (LSTs), in particular Lido Finance\u2019s wrapped stETH.\n\nPeople also borrowed Tether against USDC \u201cas the borrowing rate on Tether can be very volatile\u201d and, Welch says, borrowing ETH against LSTs will be a popular transaction \u201cto enhance staking yields.\u201d\n\nThe shortest duration of loan will be four weeks, but Welch envisions the 1- and 3-month loans will be the most popular, although the protocol hopes to eventually host terms of a year or more.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on borrowing and lending in the highest quality blue chip on an overcollateralized basis or a loan-to-value ratio in line with Aave and Compound,\" Welch said. \"The rates in our Beta ranged from low-to-mid 3% for borrowing stables against high-quality crypto assets. We expect other collateral types like wBTC to be popular. Over time, the protocol may expand to other assets as collateral or to supply and borrow but for now, we\u2019re sticking to the majors.\u201d"

        "content": "According to a study conducted by Cryptobetting.com, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is more popular than Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the United States. According to the study, the popular dog-themed crypto is the second most popular project in the U.S., only behind Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe study used search volume data to compare the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap and revealed that Bitcoin had a search volume of 1,910,000, while SHIB had 484,000. Dogecoin came in at third place with 280,000, while Ethereum took fourth place with 238,000.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu or Dogecoin: Which Token Can Make You a Millionaire First?\n\nIt is not surprising to see such high search volumes for SHIB. The crypto token is not only popular in the U.S., but all around the globe. However, one should take note of the stark difference between BTC\u2019s search volume and the other projects. The numbers clearly show that the original crypto is still king. However, that does not take anything away from SHIB and DOGE, the two most popular memecoins.\n\nWill Shiba Inu\u2019s popularity drive up demand?\n\nSource: The Coin Republic\n\nSHIB has struggled to perform in 2023. Although the token is extremely popular, buying demand has been scarce. Moreover, the project\u2019s upcoming layer-2 network, Shibarium, does not have an exact launch date. The launch is one of the only things that may help drive up demand, and consequently the asset\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, the repeated delays and the lack of a launch date has hurt investor confidence. Nonetheless, users expect the network to make a debut sometime in August. According to the blockchain infrastructure provider NOWNodes, Shibarium is undergoing its final tests.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: How Much Can You Make If SHIB Deletes Two Zeroes?\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has finally crossed the $0.000008 level, which it had struggled to do for many months. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00000832, up by 6.9% over the previous week. However, its price has fallen by 3.8% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation celebrated the anniversary of the rollout of the network.\n\nPopular figures chimed in to share the network\u2019s top moments.\n\nEthereum[ETH] has been one of the most prominent networks in the crypto market and has established itself as blue-chip cryptocurrency over the last 8 years. Despite various ups and downs and differences amongst the Ethereum community, the network has made steady improvements and has continued to show growth.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\n8 trips around the sun\n\nFormer Ethereum Foundation CCO Stephan Tual announced the official network rollout in a blog post on July 30, 2015. Since then, Ethereum and its native currency ETH have become the second-largest crypto asset globally, with a market capitalization of $225 billion.\n\nIn the past 8 years, the price of ETH has experienced a remarkable journey, soaring from less than $1 to its current trading value of $1,865.82 at the time of writing.\n\nDuring its initial phase, Ethereum had around 10,000 holders, but as time progressed, the number of holders surged significantly to reach an impressive 103.96 million. This tremendous growth in both its price and holder base underscores the widespread adoption and success of the Ethereum network over the years.\n\nCrypto celebrities chime in with wishes\n\nMany prominent figures in the crypto space shared their thoughts on Ethereum\u2019s 8th birthday. Sandeep Nailwal, the founder of Polygon, shared photos of him and Vitalik Buterin in India, celebrating Ethereum\u2019s milestone.\n\nCelebrating Ethereum\u2019s eighth birthday with @VitalikButerin with Indian \u201cGhever\u201d as cake ? in Bengaluru Happy Birthday Ethereum! Also getting Vitalik do a bit of Bharat Darshanam ? pic.twitter.com/CEBtoSzQZB \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon ? (@sandeepnailwal) July 30, 2023\n\nChangpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, also penned a note for Ethereum. In his tweet, CZ shared a photo from 2015 that was taken during Vitalik Buterin\u2019s stay in Tokyo. He revealed that Vitalik was already fully immersed in working on and discussing ETH at that time.\n\nInterestingly, CZ also expressed regret for not purchasing Ethereum during that period.\n\nOn this 8th birthday of #Ethereum, a little throw back to May 2, 2015, in Tokyo??, just before #ETH was officially born. @VitalikButerin stayed in my apartment in Tokyo during this trip. He was already working on and talking about ETH non-stop. And I still missed (didn't buy)\u2026 pic.twitter.com/84B6KN73Qf \u2014 CZ ? Binance (@cz_binance) July 30, 2023\n\nMoreover, he contemplated the possibility that had he invested in Ethereum early on, he might not have been motivated or felt the need to establish Binance, given the potential gains from investing in the cryptocurrency.\n\nFounders of Avalanche and Solana, also joined in and wished the cryptocurrency network a happy birthday on Twitter.\n\nStake instead of Cake\n\nIn the past year, the Ethereum network underwent two significant updates. Among these updates, the implementation of the Merge on September 15, 2022, stands out as one of the most pivotal moments.\n\nWith the successful execution of the Merge upgrade, the network made a crucial transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in a reduction in energy consumption, addressing concerns about environmental impact, and also introduced staking incentives for validators and investors.\n\nThe other update was the Shapella upgrade which occurred on 12 April, 2023. This allowed users to unlock their staked ETH from the beacon chain. Following this upgrade, the interest in staking skyrocketed. Even though the interest in staking slowly faded after the fact, an old Ethereum holder\u2019s behavior could soon re-ignite the staking flame.\n\nDuring Ethereum\u2019s 8th Birthday celebration, an individual who participated in the Ethereum ICO reappeared after 8 years of inactivity. Astonishingly, the participant transferred 641 ETH from his dormant account and promptly engaged in staking.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt the time of the Ethereum Genesis, this participant had obtained 2,000 ETH, which now amounts to $3.7 million. It was noteworthy that the initial price of ETH during the ICO was just around $0.31.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 8 years of dormancy, transferred 641 $ETH out, and started staking. He received 2K $ETH($3.7M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hGoCb22LVr pic.twitter.com/ZO09r9uFMd \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 31, 2023\n\nThis optimism was also showcased by Ethereum validators. According to staking rewards\u2019 data, the number of validators on the network grew by 8.96% over the last month. At press time, the total number of validators on the Ethereum network was 698,924."

According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, ENS name registrations totaled 31,029 in July. This represented a 14% fall from the 35,963 recorded in .eth registrations in June.\n\nOn a year-to-date, monthly ENS name registrations have plummeted by 45%. Since its monthly all-time high of 437,365 name registrations in September 2021, this has trended downward.\n\nFurther, data from Dune Analytics showed that the count of new addresses created on the ENS network experienced a decline in July. The protocol saw a mere 25,115 new addresses created within the 31-day period. This was an 18% decrease from June\u2019s count of 30,722 addresses.\n\nAfter closing June at a high of 30,099 names, primary ENS name registrations dropped by 19% by July ending. A primary ENS name is a unique, human-readable name used to identify and locate a specific Ethereum address.\n\nRegarding monthly revenue made by the protocol from new name registrations and renewals, there has been a steady decline since January. According to Dune Analytics, monthly revenue from new registrations fell by 52% between January and July.\n\nLikewise, the monthly revenue made from name renewals plummeted by 2% within the same period.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ENS Profit Calculator\n\nLook elsewhere for gains\n\nSharing a statistically significant positive correlation with leading coin Bitcoin [BTC], ENS has also traded within a tight range in the past few weeks. At press time, the alt exchanged hands at $9.50, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith many unsure of the altcoin\u2019s next direction, an assessment of its price movements on the daily chart revealed that day traders have stayed their hands from aggressive token accumulation. At press time, key momentum indicators lay flat.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below its center line at 35.14, suggesting that selling momentum exceeded accumulation. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the center line at 51.77, it moved sideways, signaling a rather unenthusiastic trading activity."

The worst month was July. If you think about it, think about where ETH was last July. It wasn't at a very different price than what it is today, I mean you're talking pretty much the same price, maybe plus or minus a couple of hundred dollars but that's where we were last July. And you can see there's this sort of lull in even the one-year ROI buying in that April, May, June July timeframe but as you get further out into Q4, it tends to go up.\"\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Shutterstock.com\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

Optimism (OP) is currently in the spotlight as it is leading the L2 price resurgence after inking forward by 7.15% in the past 24 hours to $1.70. The current bullish momentum has helped OP extend its growth in the trailing seven-day period, with the coin up 10% in this time span.\n\nOptimism in L2 ecosystem\n\nOptimism has a number of competitors, including but not limited to, Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum and zkSync. Optimism has been doing all it can to distinguish itself as the right venue for developers looking to get into the Web3.0 ecosystem through Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data from L2Beat, Optimism notably boasts of a maximum Transaction Per Second (TPS) of 10.93, a figure that pales in relation to its peers zkSync Era at 12.85 and Arbitrum at 31.64 but higher than Polygon zkEVM at 1.04.\n\nOptimism is a popular Ethereum scaling protocol, and its popularity is even more pronounced since the introduction of Base, the scaling tool launched earlier this year by Coinbase exchange. The Base protocol was built on the OP Stack, showcasing the attractiveness of the Optimism protocol with respect to its competitors across the board.\n\nMainstream adoption\n\nBesides the growth of Web3.0 developers on the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions and their overall attractiveness in terms of transaction efficiency, the embrace by the general public points to the relevance of each L2 around today.\n\nWhile protocols like Polygon have a very robust profile with respect to its alliances with mainstream brands, Optimism is not faring badly in this regard as well. The protocol has recorded several partnerships surrounding enhancing its functionalities across the board."

        "content": "Amidst the bustling crypto world, particularly in the Ethereum ecosystem, there\u2019s growing optimism about Ethereum\u2019s price. Many wonder if it will reach $2000 in August. Should you invest in Ethereum (ETH) now, or explore other rising projects like Pikamoon (PIKA)?\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to find answers. And that\u2019s through the expert analysis in this article.\n\nLatest Ethereum News: Hike in Rate, Trading Activities, and a Bullish Momentum\n\nOn July 26, the US Fed declared a 25% rate hike. Past data indicates that Ethereum (ETH) experienced notable gains in the weeks and months after the last two rate hikes on March 22 and May 3, 2023. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s transaction volumes have been increasing in recent days.\n\nOn July 22, 1.14 million Ethereum (ETH) were transacted on the network and the daily transaction volume gradually rose to 1.88 million ETH on July 27. That is a 65% increase in only a week, confirming the positive potential the Fed rate hike could have on ETH.\n\nOverall, this rise in activity coinciding with the rate hike could push ETH to break the $2000 mark in August. This chance is certain should Ethereum (ETH) enter a 5% to 10% rise as it did during the previous rate hikes in March and May 2023. However, a dip toward $1,750 is still possible if the present support level fails to hold.\n\nExperts Recommend a More Likely Alternative in Pikamoon (PIKA)\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s growth chances might be speculative, experts have found a more promising and likely opportunity in Pikamoon (PIKA).\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) is an ambitious and disruptive GameFi project powered by a play-to-earn game called the Pikamoon Adventure set in the four worlds of the Pikaverse.\n\nHere, gamers get PIKA and NFTs as rewards for building empires, adventure contest triumphs, and treasure discovery. To better their chances, Pikamoon\u2019s marketplace allows gamers to increase their avatars\u2019 ability by buying boosts using PIKA.\n\nThe following features among others make this project\u2019s growth more likely:\n\nHigh Demand and Growth Potential\n\nNothing better affirms the potential of a project like demand and consistent growth. Pikamoon enjoys this as every feature requires $PIKA. These use cases bring ceaseless demand, propelling PIKA to fast growth. It is the reward token for gamers, the payment token on the marketplace, and more.\n\nSupported by the Best\n\nThe project\u2019s potential and the successes so far have drawn in support from users, top investors, and whales. They believe PIKA will be one of the most profitable investments in the GameFi market this year with a 10,000% ROI on the horizon this year. PIKA can be your ticket to millions in profits as a new or experienced investor.\n\nBuilt to Enjoy Two Blockchains Support\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) gets technical support from the two top NFT and Metaverse blockchains it builds on: MultiversX (Elrond) and Ethereum. With these two networks as its roots, Pikamoon and PIKA have enough to scale seamlessly, record explosive profits, and handle the massive influx that comes with this growth.\n\nPikamoon Presale is Another Sign of the Project\u2019s Convincing Potential\n\nThe ongoing Pikamoon presale again asserts the bullish sentiments of expert crypto analysts as it amasses nearly $4 million in sales in addition to delivering 300% in profits to early investors. These successes all happened while still in its third and final phase, meaning there\u2019s more to come for PIKA holders.\n\nPlus, with experts predicting a 10,000% increase before the end of the year, accumulating $PIKA is a no-brainer.\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA):\n\nBuy Now: https://pikamoon.io/buy\n\nWebsite: https://pikamoon.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pikamooncoin\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/pikamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "July has been a rollercoaster month for the crypto market with Ethereum and Bitcoin witnessing a drop in their market prices, whereas Ripple\u2019s XRP surged, following a victorious outcome in the SEC lawsuit. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s price declining by 5.5% and Ethereum\u2019s by 4.7%, Ethereum has shown resilience, gaining 4.9% against Bitcoin over the past month, according to the Santiment report.\n\nadvertisement\n\nXRP Comes Out As Winner\n\nEthereum\u2019s utility numbers by the end of July were reminiscent of those in May when its price dominance against Bitcoin was more significant. This could be an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s robust network utility playing a part in its market resilience.\n\nSantiment report also revealed that in contrast, Ripple\u2019s XRP emerged as one of the biggest winners of the month, posting a 42% return. The positive performance was largely attributed to the landmark ruling in the SEC lawsuit, which established that XRP is not a security. This unexpected verdict sparked significant buying activity, elevating XRP even as other crypto assets witnessed declining market caps. Other digital assets that saw gains in July included Stellar, Maker, and XinFin.\n\nOn the negative side, Santiment\u2019s statistics showed a worrisomely low amount of whale transactions, implying that important stakeholders are not interested in purchasing the dip. The market capitalization of Bitcoin has been steadily falling and is currently hovering around the $29k price point. Even though the price of Bitcoin has dropped below $30k, large investors have exhibited reluctance, possibly indicating doubt about the near-term prospects of the market.\n\nAlso Read: Top DeFi Tokens Crash Following Curve Event, Will the Domino Spread Further?\n\nHow Is The Market Doing?\n\nThe general mood of the cryptocurrency market has changed from \u201cgreed\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d. The most popular cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin, is currently trading at a much more constrained level of $29,500 after reaching $31,000 on July 4, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range between 5.25% and 5.50%, as the market had anticipated, which helped to support Bitcoin a little bit.\n\nAlso Read: Will XRP Price Gains Come Undone As Federal Court Rejects Ripple Ruling?"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday, with altcoin falling sharply. Chaos is looming in the market on the back of pessimistic news flow. Also, lack of macroeconomic events is unable to support the movement in the digital token market.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in the red zone on Tuesday as the largest crypto token dropped about 2 per cent and breached below 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum also posted similar declines, falling more than 2 per cent and it slipped below $1,850-levels. Altcoins were mostly bleeding.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has undergone some selling pressure in the last 24 hours. Contrastingly, the crypto fear and greed index has climbed 3 points since yesterday and continues to remain in the neutral zone with a score of 53/100, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to make new lows in the daily chart as it traded at its lowest price in 40 days in the early trading hours for the day. From a purely technical analysis lens, not a lot of downside remains in it if the bullish trend line were to be respected and we could see a reversal from the trend line support which sits at around $27,000 for the day,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. Bitcoin Cash dropped more than 5 per cent, while Solana and Polygon declined about 5 per cent each. Cardano and Litecoin tumbled 4 per cent each. Polkadot, Dogecoin, Tron and XRP shed 3 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling down to $1.16 trillion-mark as it dropped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 17 per cent to $30.15 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market is currently in a consolidation phase, with Bitcoin trading in a narrow range. This is likely due to a lack of major macroeconomic news, which has made it difficult for investors to make directional bets, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nStormX (STMX) stands out as a pioneering global cryptocurrency-based solution that has successfully expanded its reach to worldwide markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday. The digital token market moved sideways in August due to the global vacation season and lack of major key economic events. However, the phase of consolidation may trigger some gains in the token space.\n\n\n\nBitcoin moved slightly higher as the largest crypto token added about half-a-per cent but remained below 29,500-mark. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum also posted gains on the similar lines and managed to hold $1,850-levels. Price action in the altcoins was mixed.\n\n\n\nFollowing an eventful weekend, the value of Bitcoin experienced a slight increase, reaching the $29,461 mark. Bitcoin has been trading within a range of $29,000 to $29,500 for the past week. The market appears to have absorbed the news of Curve Finance falling victim to an exploit, said Edul Patel, Co-founer and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Ethereum successfully breached the $1,850 level in the last seven days and is currently being traded at approximately $1,871. Meanwhile, the banking crisis in the U.S. persists, with the FDIC closing Kansas Heartland Tri-State Bank. The failure of this bank might be attributed to the impact of rising U.S. interest rates and inadequate risk management practices,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday. On the downside, Tron and Shiba Inu shed 4 per cent each, while Dogecoin and Solana shed 2 per cent each during the day. Among the gainers, Bitcoin Cash surged about 6 per cent, while Polygon gained about 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, risiing up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it gauned less than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 45 per cent to $25.85 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nBNB is within a horizontal channel in the medium term. The price action has started registering short line candles in the daily chart, indicating that BNB is currently entering a consolidation. BNB can consolidate between the range of $236 and $244, and is facing immediate resistance at $250. If the price successfully surpasses this level, it could potentially lead to the resistance level of $265 and $280.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 200-day EMA is currently at $239 and BNB is barely above this level. Its RSI has marginally recovered from past week\u2019s decline and is currently in neutral territory.If BNB is unable to break through the $250 barrier, $235 serves as an early support level, with the $220 zone providing the next line of defence.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $235, $220\n\nResistance: $250, $265, $280\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

In 2021, he made an unprecedented donation to support India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He donated $1 billion worth of Shiba Inu cryptocurrency coins to CryptoRelief, a Covid relief fund established by Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of crypto organization Polygon.\n\nHowever, it was later reported that only 5 percent of Mr Buterin's original donation was utilized for Covid relief efforts in India. This was due to the volatile nature of the meme coins, which saw their value fluctuate dramatically following the donation. CryptoRelief, therefore, returned $100 million in cryptocurrency to Mr Buterin to avoid conflict with Indian laws and the distribution of relief funds.\n\n\"CryptoRelief sending $100m of the $SHIBA funds back to me. I plan to personally deploy these funds with the help of science advisors to complement CryptoRelief's existing excellent work with some higher-risk higher-reward COVID science and relief projects worldwide,\" Mr Buterin said in a tweet."

        "content": "The XRP20 crypto project announced the launch of its presale today, August 1st, at xrp20coin.com.\n\nBuilt as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, XRP20 aims to be a more user focused and accessible token \u2013 adding stake to earn utility, a burn mechanism making it deflationary, and a low price point even cheaper than the all-time low XRP price, currently available on presale at a single stage price of 1 XRP20 = $0.000092.\n\nXRP20 Presale Tokenomics\n\n$XRP20 has a 100 billion total supply modelled on XRP\u2019s tokenomics.\n\nOf that total supply, 40% is allocated to the presale, 40% to staking rewards, 10% to exchange liquidity and 10% to its scheduled token burn. 0.1% of every XRP20 transaction is automatically burnt.\n\nThe XRP20 presale soft cap is $1.85 million, and its hard cap $3.68 million.\n\nWhy Buy XRP20 Token?\n\nThe XRP20 website states that putting its community first, the retail investor, is the focus of the project:\n\n\u2018No retail buyer had the chance to buy XRP during any ICO back in 2012 when the company was formed. But today you can buy XRP20 in presale at an even lower price than $0.01 when the original token entered the market. The original XRP was designed for legacy financial institutions and has always lacked utility for retail investors. XRP20 changes this by introducing on-chain staking. Now anybody holding XRP20 can stake their tokens to earn passive income.\u2019\n\nThe XRP20 price is approximately 30 times cheaper than the XRP price at its all-time low of $0.0028.\n\nThe decision to launch on ETH also provides additional benefits \u2013 Ethereum is the most used and secure chain with the widest range of decentralized wallet providers, making it simple for buyers to trade, track and store XRP20.\n\nNot affiliated with Ripple, $XRP20 is also a vehicle for speculation with its low market cap, aiming to capitalize on the recent crypto trend of community-focused \u20182.0\u2019 and \u201820\u2019 themed coins that outperformed the market, such as Pepe 2.0.\n\nFollowing Pepe 2.0, a range of meme coins and \u20182.0 tokens\u2019 centred around Bitcoin, Ethereum and other big caps have launched, favored by traders for their high upside potential. XRP20 aims to combine both a high ROI potential at its IDO on Uniswap with its low market cap, and a long term roadmap \u2013 including its staking rewards and burn mechanism.\n\nXRP20 Token Trending\n\nCurrently attracting the attention of several crypto influencers, XRP20 was reviewed today by the CryptoNews YouTube channel and a range of crypto news sites, who noted its fair launch structure without incremental price rounds or team tokens.\n\nJoin the XRP20 Telegram at t.me/XRP20_coin \u2013 admins will not DM you first, beware of impersonators \u2013 and follow its official Twitter account @XRP20_coin to stay upto date on the project\u2019s progress.\n\nVisit XRP20 Presale"

These investors can also sell their CRV should the price rise to $0.80.\n\nEgorov\u2019s flurry of OTC deals is purportedly a move to cushion his $60 million on Aave collateralized by $175 million in CRV tokens. Liquidation of the founder\u2019s Aave loan could trigger a domino effect of bad debt across several DeFi lending services, potentially plunging the decentralized lending ecosystem into disarray.\n\nThis scenario only plays out should CRV\u2019s price plunge significantly below $0.3 thus liquidating Egorov\u2019s massive Aave loan. Concerns regarding the possibility were raised after factory exploits on Curve Finance liquidity pools and the ensuing CRV price decline."

Despite being a new DeFi project, Tradecurve has been able to command as much attention as it has because of its unique use case. Tradecurve is building what will become the first hybrid trading platform where users will be able to access and trade financial instruments from the global derivatives market.\n\nOn the platform, users will be able to trade stocks, options, forex, crypto, and commodities with only one account. This will actively solve the problem traders face in managing multiple accounts.\n\nIn addition, it will link Tradecurve to one of the biggest markets in the world. In June 2022, the Bank for International Settlement estimated that the global derivatives market was worth $632 trillion. This will give Tradecurve more liquidity than every other DeFi project.\n\nBy solving a major problem with DeFi, Tradecurve has earned a frontrunner seat in the next major expansion. Crypto analysts have predicted that the utility token of Tradecurve, TCRV, will also be positively impacted by its market.\n\nAt press time, TCRV trades at $0.025 per token in its fifth presale stage but is expected to hit a high of $0.029 in the coming week. Long-term predictions peg the price of TCRV at $1.5 before the end of this year, making it one of 2023\u2019s biggest gainers.\n\nVisit the links below to get more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token:\n\nClick Here For the Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram"

        "title": "EIP-6968 Set To Enable Revenue Sharing For Ethereum - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), dubbed EIP-6968, has been proposed by Ethereum developers to facilitate decentralized application (dApp) creators to earn a share of transaction fees generated on Layer 2 (L2).\n\nOn the outset, EIP-6968 aims to introduce a new type of token, the \"Contract Secured Revenue\" (CSR), which would allow developers to claim a percentage of transaction fees generated when users interact with their smart contracts.\n\nKevin Owocki, one of the co-authors of the proposal, envisages this development as an opportunity for projects to band together, form an L2 around shared ideas, and share sequencer fee revenue based on who drives the most usage.\n\nMechanism and Scaling\n\nLayer 2 solutions play a crucial role in enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum network. By conducting transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1 or L1), they mitigate network congestion and reduce transaction costs, whhich can skyrocket during peak periods. Layer 2 solutions use various methods like state channels, sidechains, and rollups, enabling faster and more efficient transaction processing. They significantly boost the tranbsaction throughput, thereby facilitating a smoother, more scalable experience for users and developers.\n\nIn terms of the relation between L2s and the EIP-6968 proposal, the former allows smart contract developers to tap into potentially lucrative revenue streams. By introducing the concept of \"Contract Secured Revenue\" (CSR), Layer 2 can incentivize developers to create and deploy their dApps on these networks, fostering innovation and community growth. It creates a positive feedback loop - the more a developer's smart contracts are used, the more transaction fees they can potentially earn. This not only motivates developers but also accelerates the overall development and scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdoption and Potential Impact\n\nThe revenue generated from CSR could be utilized for multiple purposes, such as funding dApp development, public goods, or incentivizing developers to join a network. While Owocki initially proposed EIP-6968 in May, it has garnered increased attention following his presentation at the recent EthCC conference in Paris.\n\nEIP-6968 promises to revolutionize the fiercely competitive Ethereum scaling sector by introducing a novel type of incentive for developers. The proposal posits using protocol rewards of L1 to fund smart contract development, a significant change from what is the current state of market mechanisms in place.\n\nEIP-6968, viewed as a step ahead from app-chains, is designed to enable \"ecosystem-chains\" that host multiple decentralized applications. It is essentially a modified version of EIP-1559, which implemented Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism back in August 2021.\n\nThe proposed upgrade could be adopted by any network that uses EIP-1559. Owocki expressed optimism about the potential traction within the L2 ecosystem, predicting a beneficial cycle where smart contract developers receive revenue for the value they contribute to L2s.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CZ wrote that, back then, Buterin was staying at his place during the trip to Japan and \"was already working on and talking about ETH non-stop.\"\n\nChangpeng Zhao confessed that he did not buy Ethereum when it launched and called it the \"miss of a lifetime.\" However, this presented him with a great opportunity and the motivation to create Binance, which later turned into a crypto trading platform with the largest trading volume in the world.\n\nOn this 8th birthday of #Ethereum, a little throw back to May 2, 2015, in Tokyo\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5, just before #ETH was officially born. @VitalikButerin stayed in my apartment in Tokyo during this trip.

He stressed that Ethereum made possible ICOs and, if it had not been for that, Binance would never have been born.\n\nHappy Birthday #Ethereum! @VitalikButerin\n\n\n\nAmong many things, Ethereum made ICOs possible, which in turn, made many other projects possible, including Binance. \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) July 30, 2023\n\nSHIB's birthday just one day away from Ethereum's\n\nOn July 31, another popular cryptocurrency celebrates its birthday; popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerged into the market on July 31, 2020, created by the pseudonymous Ryoshi and Shytoshi Kusama (the latter remains the project's lead developer).\n\nThe initial price of the coin was $0.000000001009, according to CoinMarketCap. Per the video shared by Lucie, the marketing specialist of SHIB, there were Shiba Inu tokens owned by the founders initially by default, and Ryoshi bought all his SHIB from the free market to stress the principle of equality on which, among others (such as decentralization), SHIB was founded. The video also claims that zero funds were spent on the creation and promotion of Shiba Inu into the crypto community by Ryoshi.\n\nHappy Birthday, $Shib! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf82\n\n\n\nWishing you a fantastic day filled with joy and wonderful memories.\n\n\n\nNow, let's watch this exciting video about the journey to decentralization! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f Enjoy!https://t.co/kBsrrPIHUL \u2014 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc04 | Summer of Shibarium (@LucieSHIB) July 31, 2023\n\nShiba Inu was also launched on the Ethereum chain. At the end of May 2022, Ryoshi deleted all of his social media accounts and went under the radar, similar to the move made by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.\n\nShytoshi Kusama now remains at the head of the SHIB team, which is about to launch the Layer 2 network Shibarium. After that, according to his recent tweets, Shytoshi will also step down from his role of the leader as SHIB will be totally run by the community."

        "content": "TAIPEI, Aug. 1, 2023 /CNW/ -- Unitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live on 31 July.\n\nUnitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live and allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT.\n\nUnitas Protocol is the first DeFi protocol offering unitized stablecoins, a new stablecoin category that functions as Units of Account for different emerging market currencies. It mitigates emerging market dollar shortages by opening access to global USD liquidity for businesses and individuals needing safe and affordable cross-border transactions.\n\nUnitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \"unitizes\" a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe first unitized stablecoins open to minting are USD91 (INR-pegged), USD971 (AED-pegged), USD84 (VND-pegged), and USD1 (USD-pegged). Unitas' naming convention prefixes its stablecoin names with the Store of Value (e.g., \"USD\") and suffixes them with country codes (e.g., \"91\" for INR) that indicate Units of Account of emerging market currencies.\n\nA unitized stablecoin reflects the value of one unit of emerging market currency (e.g., INR) denominated in some USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT).\n\nUnitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \u201cunitizes\u201d a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\n\"Today is a significant milestone for Unitas and the global financial and digital asset ecosystems,\" said Wayne Huang, co-founder and board member of Unitas Foundation. \"Unitas Protocol unlocks stablecoin real-world business and individual applications.\"\n\nAs emerging market small medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to face US Dollar liquidity shortages, stablecoins pegged to USD (especially USDT) have been widely adopted among merchants, importers and exporters in their domestic and cross-border transactions.\n\nDespite USD stablecoins' convenience, each country has its sovereign currency unit that is the primary denomination in domestic quotations, transactions, and communication. Unitized stablecoins bridge this gap by providing users with guaranteed, on-chain USD liquidity while still allowing them to quote, transact, and communicate using their respective countries' primary Units of Account.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, an Indian importer must buy USDT with INR cash via a peer-to-peer transaction and pay the USDT to its supplier. The importer then sells its received goods to local distributors and gets paid in INR cash. The exchange rate, profit, and cost calculations are always complicated.\n\nUSD91 solves this by maintaining competitive rates and guaranteeing USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) liquidity, which is over-reserved on-chain for anyone to audit. The same solution framework applies to USD stablecoin liquidity in countries such as Vietnam (via USD84) and UAE (via USD971).\n\nIn short, while holding a unitized stablecoin (e.g., USD91) is equivalent to holding a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT), unitized stablecoins enable local currency-denominated, stablecoin-based transactions that allow more straightforward quotation and communication in users' familiar Units of Account.\n\nUnitas Protocol is essentially a value translator between USD and other currencies and guarantees that its stablecoin can unconditionally convert back to a USD stablecoin. With unitized stablecoins, each country can have its own best version of USDT, acting as a common denomination for all kinds of transactions.\n\nAbout Unitas Foundation\n\nUnitas Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2022. Unitas Protocol operates exogenously over-reserved stablecoins pegged to emerging market currencies. These stablecoins unleash emerging market potentials by facilitating foreign investment, cross-border payment, global market access, DeFi participation, efficient USD liquidity, and more.\n\nTo learn more about Unitas Foundation, visit its official website ( https://unitas.foundation ), Wiki , Telegram , Twitter, blog , or email team@unitas.foundation .\n\n\u2014\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe press release is only for informative purposes.

Popular consensus algorithms used in Layer-1 blockchains include Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), among others.\n\nSecurity: Layer-1 blockchains prioritize security by utilizing cryptographic algorithms and decentralized network structures. The immutability of the blockchain, achieved through cryptographic hashing, ensures the integrity and tamper-resistance of transactions recorded on the network.\n\nScalability: Layer-1 blockchains face the challenge of scalability, as they need to accommodate a large number of transactions without compromising efficiency. Several Layer-1 protocols employ innovative techniques such as sharding, sidechains, and state channels to enhance scalability and throughput.\n\nSmart Contracts: Many Layer-1 blockchains support the execution of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. Smart contracts enable the automation of contractual agreements, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing transparency.\n\nWhat Is the Main Limitation of Layer 1?\n\nLayer 1 blockchains seek to provide the fundamental blockchain functions. Any blockchain\u2019s primary objective is to optimize decentralization, security, and scalability. The concept of accomplishing all three is referred to as the blockchain trilemma due to the difficulty of striking a balance between them.\n\nEarly L1 chains (specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum) prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of their networks\u2019 scalability. This has prompted L1 developers to modify their designs to prioritize scalability or to work on alternative solutions \u201coff-chain.\u201d There are a few ways in which L1 chains can improve scalability by modifying their native architecture. These consist of:\n\nIncreasing block size: With larger blocks, more transactions can \u201cfit\u201d into each block, thereby enhancing network speed. The disadvantage is that network-securing computers (nodes) must increase their hardware requirements, which increases the risk of centralization.\n\nChanging the consensus mechanism: Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms are typically quicker and less resource-intensive than Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms. Nonetheless, some contend that this comes at the expense of inadequate security and centralization.\n\nSharding: Sharding enables Layer 1 chains to divide their data into a predetermined number of distinct data components (called shards), thereby assisting to decongest the network and increase transaction speeds. However, communication between sharded chains can be complicated, resulting in compromised blockchain security.\n\nNotable Layer-1 Blockchain Protocols\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, operates on a Layer-1 blockchain. It utilizes the PoW consensus mechanism, allowing for secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Bitcoin\u2019s Layer-1 blockchain is primarily designed for value transfer.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum is a Layer-1 blockchain renowned for its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. It introduced the concept of programmable money, revolutionizing the blockchain landscape. Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1 blockchain employs the PoW consensus algorithm, although it is transitioning to a PoS-based mechanism with the introduction of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a Layer-1 blockchain protocol that focuses on interoperability between different blockchains. It enables the seamless transfer of assets and data across multiple chains. Polkadot utilizes a unique shared security model and the Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nSolana: Solana, a blockchain of the third generation, aims to resolve the scalability issues of L1 blockchains. Solana employs proof of History (PoH) consensus to achieve transaction speeds of up to 65,000 per second, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer-1 protocols represent the foundational layer of the blockchain revolution, providing the necessary infrastructure for secure and scalable decentralized systems. By leveraging consensus mechanisms, scalability solutions, and programmability, Layer-1 blockchains offer unparalleled opportunities for industries and individuals alike. As scalability challenges are overcome and interoperability becomes the norm, we can expect a proliferation of innovative use cases and widespread adoption. As this technology continues to evolve, there is a possibility that in the near future, Layer-1 protocols might underpin a multitude of transformative applications, reshaping the global economic and social landscape."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Gains Strength Amid Sideways Bitcoin (BTC) Chop - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is gaining strength again after a significant pullback. Despite a sideways BTC price action, the ETH/BTC pair continues to extend its gains. There are multiple fundamental and technical factors behind this strength which I will be discussing in this article.\n\nBTC price has been stuck within a very narrow range since last week. The pioneering cryptocurrency is struggling to break above the $29,500 level. This has increased the selling pressure in altcoins, as many analysts anticipate a drop after the ongoing accumulation phase. However, on Friday, ETH to USD price once again outperformed BTC. At press time, the native asset of the biggest L1 was trading at $1877 during its New York session after rising by 0.93%.\n\nETH/BTC Rebounds From Fresh 52-Week Lows\n\nMany traders prefer to trade Ethereum in ETH/BTC pair, which shows its strength against Bitcoin. The following chart reveals that ETH price plunged to its lowest level of the year against BTC on 29th June. The pair slid to $0.0608, which was last tapped in July 2022.\n\nThe lack of volatility in Bitcoin has created some buying opportunities in other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. As Bitcoin consolidates, some investors are rotating their profits into Ethereum, which is helping to drive up the ETH/BTC pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum TVL Is Down 77% From Its All-Time High\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is by far the biggest smart contract platform in terms of daily active users and the total locked value (TVL). However, there has been a massive decrease in the TVL on the top Layer 1 protocol in the past two years. According to the DeFi Llama, the network TVL has plummeted to $25.1 billion from its 2021 peak of $108 billion. This sharp decline in the locked funds can be attributed to multiple factors.\n\nEthereum TVL seems affected by the recent downtrend in crypto markets. As the Ethereum price has fallen, so has the amount of value locked in its DeFi protocols. Another reason is that the network is currently facing scaling issues, leading to higher gas fees and slower transaction speeds. This has made it less attractive for users to use Ethereum DeFi protocols, contributing to the decline in TVL.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nThe following ETH price chart is quite self-explanatory. It is evident from this chart that there is a massive resistance above the major psychological level of $2,000. In fact, there have already been two price rejections from $2017-2140 since the start of this year.\n\nA closer look at the chart also reveals that the price is also respecting an upward trendline. Currently, the digital asset is retesting this trendline. As long as the price remains above this trendline, Ethereum price prediction will remain bullish. In case of a strong bounce from this trendline, I expect the price to retest the 2,000 level again.\n\nA significant line in the sand for many traders is the 200-day moving average, which currently lies at $1768. A breakdown below this key moving average will flip my outlook on Ethereum bearish once again.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSince the arrival of CryptoKitties in 2017 and DeFi Summer in 2020, the industry is still grappling with how to make blockchains better, cheaper, and faster.\n\nAnd this is precisely where Offchain Labs\u2019 chief strategy officer A.J. Warner and his team are setting up camp: solving the famed blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma refers to the three core challenges developers face when building a blockchain: scalability, security, and decentralization. Gains made in one of these areas are concessions in another.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith so many options for trade-offs, there have been several experiments across the layer-1 space, ranging from Ethereum to Solana, Algorand, and Celestia.\n\n\u201cEthereum solves that by focusing on security, decentralization, and outsourcing throughput to rollups, that\u2019s their version,\u201d Warner told Decrypt.\n\nAs for a network like Solana, it's attempting to have \u201call of this throughput exist in a single environment, and make sure that the thing is also secure and decentralized,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure if this might defy the law of physics.\u201d\n\nAs for a solution to the trilemma, the developer team at Offchain Labs is working hard to scale Ethereum with its rollup-based network called Arbitrum.\n\nAt $5.68 billion in total value locked, a measure of how much money is sloshing around a protocol or dapp, Arbitrum is head and shoulders above the competition. In terms of speed, it\u2019s certainly an improvement, too, with a measured daily seven transactions per second over the last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompared to payment heavyweights, like Mastercard or Visa, however, it\u2019s still far from replacing the traditional competition.\n\n\u201cIf somebody solves the trilemma in a more efficient way, that would be the big breakthrough,\u201d said Warner. \u201cBut, I don't think we're so close.\u201d\n\nAlongside solving one of the industry\u2019s trickiest problems, such a solution would also have to earn the mindshare of the developer masses.\n\n\u201cYou don't have to just solve it,\u201d he told Decrypt at EthCC Paris this year. \u201cIt has to be a huge order of magnitude, an experience that will inspire confidence in both users and developers.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019\n\nWarner says that one of the areas the Arbitrum team is \u201creally excited\u201d to be working on is permissionless validation, which he describes as \u201cpretty close to the holy grail of rollup technology.\u201d\n\nRollups are a type of scaling solution that \u201crolls\u201d multiple transactions together. The final transaction is presented to the blockchain as a single transaction.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups: Optimistic and zero knowledge.\n\nOptimistic rollups assume the rolled-up data is valid, thus speeding things up. To protect against fraud and error, optimistic rollup protocols allow users to contest transactions. The flagged transaction is submitted directly to the Ethereum network to check its legitimacy and settle the dispute.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZero-knowledge rollups\u2013 zk-rollups\u2013rely on zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which allows a key detail, such as how old someone is, to be mathematically proven without disclosing additional information, like that person\u2019s nationality without disclosing their passport.\n\nOf the two rollup flavors, Arbitrum falls into the optimistic category.\n\nWarner says permissionless validation is the holy grail of rollup tech \u201cbecause the fundamental security properties of a rollup, which distinguish it from alternative L1s and Ethereum, is you only need to trust one honest validator. And if it's permissionless, that\u2019s another way of saying you only need to trust yourself.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warner, there are fifteen external validators on Arbitrum, which gives users some level of confidence.\n\nNow, if one of them submitted an invalid state transition, then in a permissionless system, users can challenge it themselves and have the confidence that they can protect their assets in real-time.\n\nContrast this with the current system where, as Warner says, \u201cyou'd have to raise a red flag and one of the 15 validators would be incentivized to challenge anyways because they would want to defend the protocol, but then you rely on them to do it.\u201d He adds: \u201cSo, this is pretty close to the Holy Grail.\u201d\n\nPermissionless validation thus enables the community to assess the quality of its validators, bringing the network one step closer to full accountability and transparency.\n\nAnd, another step closer to adequately solving the industry\u2019s trilemma.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

It is only in second position to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. On July 31, Ethereum price stands at Rs 153,578.57\n\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency but a platform that allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it. It has given birth to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, providing financial instruments that do not directly rely on intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks.\n\nButerin had earlier discussed the future of Ethereum, particularly the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrades. These upgrades promise a more scalable, secure, and sustainable Ethereum, with the Beacon Chain, one of Ethereum 2.0's distinct sections, allowing users to be Eth2 validators by staking Ethereum.\n\nRecently, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, came up with his new cryptocurrency project, Worldcoin, which aims to resolve the issues of proof of personhood by creating a system that uses biometrics to confirm identities. Buterin released a long form response about his thoughts on Worldcoin and said that as artificial intelligence increases with time, it will be really tough to distinguish between humans and machines.\n\nIn 2021, Buterin made an unprecedented donation to support India's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. He donated $1 billion worth of Shiba Inu cryptocurrency coins to CryptoRelief, a Covid relief fund established by Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of crypto organization Polygon.\n\nHowever, a report from Cryptonews indicates that only 5 percent of Buterin's original donation was utilized for Covid relief efforts in India.

Nevertheless, it is impossible to bridge it back as there are no bridges to facilitate a \u201creturn trip\u201d just yet.\n\nStill, they sent their ETH in the millions, with obvious expectations for lucrative returns cognizant of the fact that the blockchain was still nascent and yet to make an official premiere.\n\nand people legitimately ask us why we\u2019re in this space sometimes pic.twitter.com/VcbW9IP9pp \u2014 Prince of Unibot | Manifesting | Gh0Stly (@DextMoon) July 30, 2023\n\nFor the layperson, a bridge is a blockchain-based tool through that a user can transfer tokens from one network to another. Noteworthy, the bait was enticing considering the historical surge of projects in their early stages, just like PEPE did and many others like it.\n\nOverview BALD Project Timeline\n\nBALD ran on the BASE chain, which had been developed and availed to developers earlier in July, giving them an avenue to develop their own applications and blockchain-based products in readiness for a scheduled launch later in the year. The BALD developer leveraged this offering to sell his project.\n\nThe project was launched on July 29 on LeetSwap decentralized exchange (DEX), rolling out with a blast to record upwards of 4,000,000% gains as investors locked large volumes of assets in BASE, a blockchain that is yet to go live.\n\nand people legitimately ask us why we\u2019re in this space sometimes pic.twitter.com/VcbW9IP9pp \u2014 Prince of Unibot | Manifesting | Gh0Stly (@DextMoon) July 30, 2023\n\nThe project presented as one of the most lucrative, so much so that one investor made upwards of $800,000 in profits within 18 hours after investing only $9,800.\n\nIn just 18 hours, this #crypto wallet went from $9,8k to $815k \u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\nInsider\u2019s first to uncover $BALD & boosted his balance by 8173% !\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive in his trades I\u2019ll show his next x100 gem pic.twitter.com/b8IhY0vWG7 \u2014 Reflection (@0xReflection) July 30, 2023\n\nAnother trader raked in $1.4 million after seeding in only $500. These millionaire-making events came as the BALD market capitalization sprinted to $85 million within hours. With these success stories trending on crypto X, capital inflow to the program multiplied a hundredfold, catapulting the trading volume to upwards of $100 million in under 24 hours.\n\nAs unsuspecting investors bridged their funds on the Base chain, some knowing there was only a unilateral bridge; fortunes were made as traders capitalized on the hype. Overflows from BALD boded well for other tokens running on BASE blockchain, with the likes of brian (BRIAN), toshi (TOSHI), and basedbot (BOT), among others, jumping a thousand fold with early entrants multiplying their seed money in monumental proportions.\n\nThe ensuing demand pressure saw BALD record an all-time high of around $0.1000 as indicated in the chart above, giving it mainstream attraction. As of July 31, BALD market liquidity was still increasing, with the token developer progressively adding more ETH to a liquidity pool that was steadily trading BALD against Ethereum. Data shows that on at one point on July 31, the BALD/ETH trading pair held more than $32 million in liquidity with upwards of $100 million in volume.\n\nAccording to the Lookonchain blockchain aggregator, the liquidity influx came in the form of four transactions, likely by accomplices, moving a total of 0.534 ETH, or just over $1,000, to buy 50 million BALD within 4 minutes of the token\u2019s issuance. The addresses proceeded to sell 37 million BALD for 554 ETH, which translates to approximately $1.04 million.\n\nThese 4 addresses spent 0.534 $ETH($1K) to buy 50M $BALD (50% of the total supply) within 4 mins of $BALD starting trading.\n\n\n\nThen sold 37M $BALD for 554 $ETH($1.04M).\n\n\n\nEarned $1M with $1K in 1 day! pic.twitter.com/gXIDRjbhic \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 30, 2023\n\nAll these culminated to an unfortunate incident, when the developer pulled the rug from underneath the investors by removing nearly 70% of the liquidity.\n\nBALD project developer leaves goodbye message\n\nThe project developer has since left a goodbye message to their victims, explaining why he executed the rug pull. In his own words:\n\nThe developer has deleted their account.\n\nWhat investors ought to have investigated\n\nIn the heat of the surge, investors failed to cross-examine the project\u2019s fundamentals including tokenomics, roadmap, utility, and developing community. As it turned out, BALD was devoid of proper fundamentals, making it a classical pyramid scheme where only \u201cearly investors and influencers made the most gains,\u201d as Coindesk puts it. The rest suffered catastrophic losses on the back of exit liquidity.\n\nThe incident has provided a loophole for other bad actors, comprising developers who launched their own imitations that could not be sold in the open market.\n\nImitations that cannot be sold to the open market\n\nIt remains to be seen whether investors will be able to cash in their gains given the unidirectional bridge."

        "title": "Unitas Protocol Goes Live on Ethereum Mainnet: Mint Unitized Stablecoins with USDT - Canada NewsWire",
        "content": "TAIPEI, Aug. 1, 2023 /CNW/ -- Unitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live on 31 July.\n\nUnitas Protocol is the first DeFi protocol offering unitized stablecoins, a new stablecoin category that functions as Units of Account for different emerging market currencies. It mitigates emerging market dollar shortages by opening access to global USD liquidity for businesses and individuals needing safe and affordable cross-border transactions.\n\nUnitas Foundation announced that Unitas Protocol mainnet is live and allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. Unitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \u201cunitizes\u201d a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\nUnitas Protocol allows anyone to mint unitized stablecoins with USDT. It \"unitizes\" a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) into one local currency unit.\n\nThe first unitized stablecoins open to minting are USD91 (INR-pegged), USD971 (AED-pegged), USD84 (VND-pegged), and USD1 (USD-pegged). Unitas' naming convention prefixes its stablecoin names with the Store of Value (e.g., \"USD\") and suffixes them with country codes (e.g., \"91\" for INR) that indicate Units of Account of emerging market currencies.\n\nA unitized stablecoin reflects the value of one unit of emerging market currency (e.g., INR) denominated in some USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT).\n\n\"Today is a significant milestone for Unitas and the global financial and digital asset ecosystems,\" said Wayne Huang, co-founder and board member of Unitas Foundation. \"Unitas Protocol unlocks stablecoin real-world business and individual applications.\"\n\nAs emerging market small medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to face US Dollar liquidity shortages, stablecoins pegged to USD (especially USDT) have been widely adopted among merchants, importers and exporters in their domestic and cross-border transactions.\n\nDespite USD stablecoins' convenience, each country has its sovereign currency unit that is the primary denomination in domestic quotations, transactions, and communication. Unitized stablecoins bridge this gap by providing users with guaranteed, on-chain USD liquidity while still allowing them to quote, transact, and communicate using their respective countries' primary Units of Account.\n\nCurrently, an Indian importer must buy USDT with INR cash via a peer-to-peer transaction and pay the USDT to its supplier. The importer then sells its received goods to local distributors and gets paid in INR cash. The exchange rate, profit, and cost calculations are always complicated.\n\nUSD91 solves this by maintaining competitive rates and guaranteeing USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT) liquidity, which is over-reserved on-chain for anyone to audit. The same solution framework applies to USD stablecoin liquidity in countries such as Vietnam (via USD84) and UAE (via USD971).\n\nIn short, while holding a unitized stablecoin (e.g., USD91) is equivalent to holding a USD stablecoin (e.g., USDT), unitized stablecoins enable local currency-denominated, stablecoin-based transactions that allow more straightforward quotation and communication in users' familiar Units of Account.\n\nUnitas Protocol is essentially a value translator between USD and other currencies and guarantees that its stablecoin can unconditionally convert back to a USD stablecoin. With unitized stablecoins, each country can have its own best version of USDT, acting as a common denomination for all kinds of transactions.\n\nAbout Unitas Foundation\n\nUnitas Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2022. Unitas Protocol operates exogenously over-reserved stablecoins pegged to emerging market currencies. These stablecoins unleash emerging market potentials by facilitating foreign investment, cross-border payment, global market access, DeFi participation, efficient USD liquidity, and more.\n\nTo learn more about Unitas Foundation, visit its official website ( https://unitas.foundation ), Wiki , Telegram , Twitter, blog , or email [email protected] .\n\n\u2014\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe press release is only for informative purposes.

        "title": "Eight Years of Ethereum: A Walk Down Memory Chain | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In July 2015, the Ethereum blockchain was launched by Vitalik Buterin and his team of co-founders. With its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) and smart contract functionality, Ethereum aimed to become a decentralized world computer that could execute peer-to-peer agreements and applications.\n\nOver the past eight years, Ethereum has cemented itself as the leading smart contract platform, enabling a new wave of decentralized applications across finance, gaming, collectibles and more. It\u2019s also established itself as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind only Bitcoin in terms of importance.\n\nTo celebrate eight years of Ether, let\u2019s take a walk down memory chain and revisit some of king of altcoins\u2019 major milestones along the way.\n\nThe Origins of Ethereum\n\nEthereum was first proposed in late 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin, then just 19 years old. Buterin envisioned it as a blockchain-based computing platform that could execute decentralized applications and smart contracts. It was announced in January 2014 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami.\n\nIn 2014, Buterin partnered with other co-founders including Gavin Wood, Jeffrey Wilcke, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio to start developing Ethereum. The non-profit Ethereum Foundation was created in Switzerland to oversee open-source development. The Genesis block launched and went live on July 30, 2015. At launch, the initial Ether supply was 72 million coins, with an initial price around $0.311 per ETH. Since then, it has become the leading smart contract blockchain platform and the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nThe ICO Boom of 2017\n\nIn 2017, Ethereum became the platform of choice for launching initial coin offerings (ICOs) \u2013 a novel way for crypto startups to crowdfund by selling tokens. That year saw over $6 billion raised through ICOs as investors rushed to fund emerging blockchain projects.\n\nHowever, lack of regulation around ICOs led to many sham offerings, eventually leading to a partial collapse of the ICO market. Nevertheless, Ethereum provided the fundamental infrastructure that enabled the ICO mania and funded many legitimate projects in the space.\n\nThe Rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nStarting in 2018, Ethereum became the foundation for the emerging DeFi \u2013 an alternative financial system built on blockchain technology and decentralized networks rather than centralized intermediaries.\n\nDeFi protocols like MakerDAO, Aave, Compound and Uniswap utilize Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts to recreate traditional financial instruments like loans, savings accounts and exchanges in a transparent, global and permissionless way.\n\nThe growth of DeFi has been astounding, with over $20 billion worth of assets locked into Ethereum DeFi protocols today. DeFi has expanded the utility of Ethereum and showcased the potential of decentralized applications.\n\nNFTs Take Off\n\nIn 2017, the ERC-721 standard was proposed as a way to create unique, blockchain-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum. But NFTs saw mainstream breakout only in 2021, as Ethereum NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare hosted multi-million dollar sales of digital art and collectibles.\n\nNFTs represented a new application for Ethereum \u2013 helping digital creators monetize their work through scarcity and proof of ownership on the blockchain. While NFTs have received their share of criticism, they undeniably expanded the cryptocurrency\u2019s appeal to new demographics in art, gaming and pop culture.\n\nThe Merge: Transition to Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum completed its much-awaited Merge upgrade, transitioning from energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus to the greener and scalable proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThis monumental technological shift promises to make Ethereum more sustainable and ready for further upgrades like sharding. While the Merge doesn\u2019t automatically reduce gas fees, it lays the foundation for the blockchain to keep pace with its growing adoption.\n\nLooking Ahead: More Use Cases on the Horizon\n\nEthereum has come a long way from its inception as a \u201cworld computer\u201d for decentralized applications. Even as Ethereum faces stiff competition from chains like Solana, there\u2019s still tremendous potential for Ethereum to expand its capabilities.\n\nHere are some emerging use cases that could drive adoption over the next few years:\n\nDecentralized identity and reputation systems that could replace online accounts, credentials and reduce spam.\n\nDecentralized data storage networks like Filecoin and Arweave for hosting internet content in a permissionless way.\n\nDecentralized cloud computing resources that could rival centralized cloud service providers.\n\nInternet of Things integration for automation and machine-to-machine transactions using oracles.\n\nFully decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with transparent governance and operations.\n\nTokenization of assets like stocks, bonds, real estate and other contracts to enable fractional ownership and trading on blockchain.\n\nAfter eight years of growth, Ethereum is no longer an experiment \u2013 but a battle-tested smart contract platform with a vibrant ecosystem. As Ethereum continues maturing, its decentralized vision could have profound implications for finance, technology and beyond over the next decade. The true capabilities of Web3 are still just beginning to take shape."

        "content": "Ethereum is turning 8 since the Ethereum Foundation launched the network.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao has remarked on Twitter, sharing a story about his time with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe crypto community has united in celebration of the Ethereum network\u2019s 8th anniversary, commemorating eight years since the Ethereum Foundation launched the network.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, Stephan Tual, the former CCO of the Ethereum Foundation, expressed his admiration in a blog post on the milestone the network has covered and the transformation it entangled with it. In the blog post, he said:\n\nThe vision of a censorship-proof \u2018world computer\u2019 that anyone can program, paying exclusively for what they use and nothing more, is now a reality.\n\nAfter eight years, Ethereum and its native cryptocurrency Ether have experienced significant growth, becoming the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, with a market capitalization of $225 billion and an Impressive thriving community of over 1,900 developers actively contributing to the platform monthly.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 8 Years of Progress\n\nTo celebrate the event, community members shared nostalgic moments and reflected on Ethereum\u2019s journey since its inception, including its historical prices, development milestones, and overall expansion.\n\nAccording to Bankless co-host Ryan Sean Adams, Ethereum\u2019s remarkable achievements include an astounding secured value of $400 billion, resulting in annualized profits of $3.6 billion. Moreover, the Ethereum blockchain currently comprises an extensive collection of 17.8 million blocks, holding a diverse array of digital assets within its ecosystem.\n\nHappy birthday Ethereum! \ud83c\udf82 $400 billion in secured value, $3.6 billion in annualized profits, and a total of 17.8 million blocks of uncensorable digital property. Not bad for an 8 year old. \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS \u2013 rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 30, 2023\n\nSeizing the occasion of Ethereum\u2019s birthday as a chance to indulge in nostalgia, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on Twitter shared a story about his time with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. He recounted the period when Vitalik stayed in Tokyo with him months before the Ethereum launch.\n\nOn this 8th birthday of #Ethereum, a little throw back to May 2, 2015, in Tokyo\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5, just before #ETH was officially born. @VitalikButerin stayed in my apartment in Tokyo during this trip.

He playfully remarked, \u201cHad I invested in ETH back then, I might not have felt the urge or motivation to create Binance. Who knows?\u201c\n\nUdi Wertheimer, a former Bitcoin enthusiast who has reformed his views, joined the celebration with a touch of humor, playfully referring to the Ethereum network as his \u201cfavorite Bitcoin sidechain.\u201d\n\nHappy birthday Ethereum! My favorite bitcoin sidechain \ud83e\udde1 \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) July 30, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s creation was the outcome of a collaborative effort involving several notable figures, most notably Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin, and Anthony Di Iorio. By providing a platform for developers to design smart contracts and create innovative blockchain applications, Ethereum played a crucial role in fueling the initial coin offering boom during late 2017.\n\nMoreover, it played a significant part in the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and development, known as \u201cDeFi summer\u201d in 2020.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Journey: From Inception to Unstoppable Progress\n\nUpon its introduction, Ethereum entered the scene six years after the inception of Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneering blockchain in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin solely served as a payment network for simple monetary transactions which brought the need for a more diverse blockchain. The primary objective behind the launch of Ethereum was to unlock and realize the full potential of blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum revolutionized the crypto community by being the first blockchain to support smart contracts, paving the way for various use cases that are widely appreciated today. These encompass decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Web 3, and tokenization.\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has continuously surged forward. According to data from OkLink, the total number of transactions on the Ethereum network has surpassed 2.05 billion Txns. The number of currency-holding addresses has reached 66.12 million, with a total circulation of 47.22 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s foundation and innovations in the smart-contract space have inspired platforms like Solana, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Tezos, and Algorand. These projects have drawn upon Ethereum\u2019s success and advancements to build their smart-contract blockchains.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Elon Musk is set to transform Twitter into a comprehensive platform for payments and financial services.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP, and Ethereum may be integrated into this ambitious plan.\n\nSimilar to the report, Elon Musk\u2019s audacious plan to reshape Twitter into the comprehensive platform \u201cX\u201d seems set to revolutionize the world of financial services and payments. This bold vision, nurtured for over 22 years, could turn Twitter into the most valuable financial institution globally. But what piques the interest of cryptocurrency enthusiasts is the possibility of integrating digital assets like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP, and Ethereum into this transformative venture.\n\nAs tweeted by The Spectator Index, Elon Musk recently revealed his long-standing ambition to make \u201cX\u201d the leading financial institution worldwide. This announcement has captivated the attention of industry experts and crypto enthusiasts alike, who eagerly anticipate the potential integration of cryptocurrencies into the platform.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1685767284638511104?t=0dGMLrnk8RyaVBu8ROo_Qg&s=35\n\nMusk\u2019s interest in digital assets has been well-documented, with Tesla already holding a significant amount of Bitcoin. Furthermore, his playful affection for Dogecoin has been evident in various instances, suggesting that it might find a place within the integrated payment system of \u201cX.\u201d The recent surge in Dogecoin\u2019s value following Twitter\u2019s rebranding only adds fuel to the speculation surrounding its potential incorporation.\n\nThis grand vision for \u201cX\u201d traces its origins back to Musk\u2019s earlier days at PayPal when \u201cX.com\u201d was the platform\u2019s original name. The fact that Musk now owns the \u201cX.com\u201d URL, which redirects to Twitter\u2019s current domain, adds an intriguing dimension to this ambitious endeavor. Furthermore, Twitter has already taken steps to secure money transmitter licenses in certain U.S. states, indicating its commitment to building a robust payment infrastructure.\n\nWhile skeptics may question the impact of integrating cryptocurrencies into Twitter, there is no denying Musk\u2019s massive following, which could prove instrumental in driving broader crypto adoption. The integration of digital assets could open a gateway to crypto transactions not only for the active crypto community on Twitter but also for the wider public, facilitating the use of fintech applications and blockchain solutions like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nTwitter\u2019s previous partnership with payments startup Strike, which introduced a Bitcoin tipping feature, hinted at the platform\u2019s initial foray into the world of cryptocurrencies. Now, with Musk\u2019s long-term vision finally coming to fruition, Twitter\u2019s transformation into a financial powerhouse seems increasingly plausible.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s strategic vision and relentless pursuit of innovation have the potential to redefine Twitter as a financial institution with global significance. If successful, \u201cX\u201d could stand as a symbol of disruption, altering the financial landscape and ushering in a new era of digital finance.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "ERC-223 lands among the Ethereum standards - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago, the ERC-223 token standard, first proposed by well-known hacker Dexaran in 2017, was finally added to Ethereum\u2019s official standards list.\n\nERC-223 solves some security and usability issues of the classic ERC-20, simplifying the end-user-side experience.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the details together.\n\nA dive into the past: the Dexaran hacker and involvement in the Ethereum hard fork\n\nBefore delving into technical issues related to Ethereum\u2019s token standards, it is appropriate to look back at the history of Ethereum\u2019s DAO hack and the subsequent hard fork that saw Dexaran as one of the main players in the affair.\n\nBack in June 2016, an unknown hacker attacked Ethereum\u2019s DAO, known to be the world\u2019s first decentralized autonomous organization committed to supporting and funding the ecosystem of the chain.\n\n3,641,694 ETH worth about $60 million (now more than $7 billion) were stolen by exploiting a native \u201cfallback\u201d function of the Solidity programming language.\n\nThe attacker even sent an encrypted message to the Ethereum team to render the manner in which he had executed the token claim and to clarify that his attack had not violated any US federal law by acting in line with the terms of the DAO smart contract.\n\nHe added in the letter that he would defend himself legally if his stolen assets were illegally freed or blocked by Ethereum\u2019s top management.\n\nThe hack shocked the entire Ethereum community, which hung by a thread for the next two months, waiting to find out how things would unfold for the DAO and how the private investors who had funded the project would be liquidated.\n\nAfter several debates, the Cryptographic Network Foundation chose the hard fork route to \u201cgo back in time\u201d and pretend that the hack had never happened.\n\nMore precisely, a new chain ( what we know today as the real Ethereum) was created that was identical to the initial one but resumed address balances at the time before the 3.6 million ether hack.\n\nThis fork was the result of internal disagreement that emerged from the decentralized community, which was divided between those who supported the \u201ccode is law\u201d philosophy and those who took a less extreme view and believed that artificial tampering with the code was the right thing to do on such occasions.\n\nOne individual in particular, known by the nickname Dexaran, shared the idea of the immutability of transactions and that even in the face of incidents of this character, the code and history of the blockchain should be respected.\n\nDexaran occupied the faction of those who did not upgrade to the software and remained in the original chain, now known under the name Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe same individual personally committed $500,000 of his personal funds to finance some work on Callisto Network, a decentralized protocol aimed at creating experimental improvements for Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe figure of Dexaran is well known among the Ethereum community, both for his philosophical stance and for inventing the ERC-223 token standard that solves some bugs and transaction efficiency issues related to the classic ERC-20 standard.\n\nThe security and efficiency issues related to ERC-20 tokens\n\nThe token standard proposed in 2017 by the supporter of Ethereum Classic Dexaran, was not intended to solve security issues related to the Ethereum DAO hack, whose flaw in the code was fixed soon after the incident.\n\nThe ERC-223 standard was designed to put a patch over another critical problem that plagued the ERC-20 standard that caused the loss of $3 million in Ether to users in just a few years.\n\nIn detail, we are talking about the fallacy that sees as \u201clost forever\u201d all those ERC-20 tokens that are mistakenly transferred to a contract address rather than a wallet address.\n\nIn fact, if a user mistakenly sends their tokens to the address of a contract, there is no mechanism that blocks this transaction or returns the assets to the sender (this is because it is not possible to handle incoming token transactions on a contract).\n\nBecause of this programming \u201cflaw,\u201d until 31 December 2017, about $1.3 million in QTUM, $1 million in EOS, $250,000 in GNT, $217,000 in STORJ, and many other small losses have been lost.\n\nAnother problem with the ERC-20 standard relates to an issue of efficiency in ERC-20 address-contract communication: when, for example, a user intends to execute an asset deposit on a decentralized platform such as Aave, they must first approve the transaction and then execute it.\n\nThis happens because the traditional Ethereum standard sees no difference between the interaction between two addresses or between an address and a contract, invoking the \u201ctransfer\u201d function in both cases.\n\nWhen you execute the smart contract in question by making the deposit, what is actually performed is a \u201ctransferfrom\u201d callback of a previously approved amount of assets.\n\nThis, in addition to being undesirable in terms of \u201cease of use,\u201d requires the payment of gas fees on two separate occasions as well as clogging the blockchain with transactions with associated risk of \u201cbloating\u201d situations.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ERC-223 token standard\n\nThe ERC-223 standard represents a superset for ERC-20 that allows the use of tokens as first-class value transfer resources in the development of smart contracts.\n\nA few days ago, the ERC-223 was added on the official Ethereum website in the section dedicated to token standards, officially sealing the entry of this category of tokens into the family of the decentralized smart contract development network.\n\nThis was announced by Dexaran, which had already introduced this topic in EIP-223 dated 5 March 2017.\n\nAs mentioned, it serves as a more secure standard in that it does not allow token transfers to contracts that do not explicitly support receiving tokens, hence avoiding mishaps for users less navigated in the field.\n\nGoing more specifically, the benefits of ERC-223 are the following:\n\neliminates the problem of accidentally lost tokens with deposit on contract addresses;\n\nsimplifies the user experience by allowing assets to be sent via a single transfer function;\n\nallows developers to manage incoming token transactions on contracts;\n\nreduces unnecessary spending of gas fees , helping the network reduce congestion;\n\n, helping the network reduce congestion; makes transactions similar to those that occur with Ether;\n\nIt is worth noting that the ERC-223 standard is backward compatible with ERC-20 tokens, hence every feature of the primary standard is applicable to the secondary standard.\n\nAll contracts or services that work with ERC-20 hence can also be used with ERC-223.\n\nIn addition, there is a converter that allows ERC-20 tokens to be converted to ERC-223 1:1 at any time without cost or restriction. ERC-223 tokens can also be converted back to the ERC-20 origin.\n\nA series of tutorials and guidelines exploring the workflow and operation of ERC-223 tokens will be presented by Dexaran in the coming days.\n\nAll the details have been published in a post on Reddit.\n\nWe hope that Dexaran\u2019s proposed standard will play a central role in the Ethereum framework, going on to improve the user experience and eliminate unnecessary risks for users, with a push toward mass adoption of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Sam Altman's Worldcoin and Bitcoin Spark set to outpace Solana and Ethereum in 2023 | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "As 2023 unveils more surprises in the crypto world, Bitcoin Spark and Worldcoin are poised to make a significant impact. Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin and Bitcoin Spark have emerged as formidable contenders, likely to outpace well-established giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). These innovative projects shine due to their cutting-edge technologies and unique solutions to the crypto industry\u2019s challenges.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) is a new fork from the Bitcoin family, striving to address speed, scalability, and access to the mining process. Bitcoin Spark appreciates that mining Bitcoin has become a preserve of a few, contrary to Satoshi\u2019s vision. As a result, BTCS introduces radical changes to the mining process and reward distribution. Whereas Bitcoin sticks to the proof-of-work system, Bitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d (PoP). Under PoP, users needing computation power can rent and operate in a virtual environment. The project rewards miners with BTCS using an algorithmically-generated figure. The essence is to distribute rewards fairly, in a manner those with computing resources get more, but not to the extent of compromising security.\n\nMining will be available in an easy-to-use app compatible with Windows, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS. The Bitcoin Spark application operates in a virtual environment, ensuring secure transaction processing while limiting access to files and other phone capabilities to prevent interference during app usage. The software is designed to self-adjust its processing power based on user needs and battery capacity. Additionally, the app serves as a wallet, and users can create independent mining applications once launched.\n\nBTCS has its ICO commencing Aug 1 with a debut price of $1.50, and you can imagine being able to buy Bitcoin when it was only 1$. Bitcoin Spark allows for a 20 % bonus to early adopters and a chance to more than 10x gains on their investment when BTCS launches at $10.\n\nWorldcoin (WLD)\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled Worldcoin, a new cryptocurrency requiring users to scan their eyes using \u201corb\u201d to establish a unique digital identity. The project, in development, aims to create \u201ca new identity and financial network owned by everyone.\u201d Altman believes Worldcoin could offer economic opportunities and serve as a solution to distinguish humans from AI-generated content online. To register, users download the World App and visit a Worldcoin operator for iris scanning. Altman hopes people will prove their real identity while maintaining privacy. The cryptocurrency offers a free token to users upon sign-up, with its value expected to rise. However, WLD faces serious privacy probes as authorities place caution. Worldcoin also faces ethical issues, as analysts point out its lack of sustainability.\n\nWill Ethereum go up?\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest digital asset is more than just a crypto token and is famous for its powerful features and blockchain solutions. Experts believe Ethereum could recover and rise again after the 2022 slump due to its unique model, scalability solutions, and leadership in dApps. Ethereum is a darling for DeFi, smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs, and DApps. ETH\u2019s recent transition to a PoS with Ethereum 2.0 is expected to reduce energy consumption and improve scalability. As Ethereum continues to strengthen and innovate, it is likely to thrive in the long term and attract investors seeking to optimize their wealth.\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nSolana, a relatively young cryptocurrency launched in 2020, has quickly gained recognition as one of the most advanced blockchains and a potential \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d It has already achieved a spot in the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. In November 2021, Solana\u2019s token achieved a remarkable milestone, reaching an all-time high of $259.96. However, the overall market experienced a slowdown, leading to SOL price decline. Despite the short-term fluctuations, Solana\u2019s price prediction is optimistic, indicating that the value of the Solana coin is expected to appreciate over time to become a worthwhile investment in the years to come.\n\nWrap Up\n\nAs the year surges through the third quarter, all eyes are on Worldcoin and Bitcoin Spark to see how they will reshape the landscape and potentially disrupt the dominance of the current market leaders. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s radical revolutionary approach is expected to carry the day as Worldcoin face ethical and privacy breaches.\n\nLearn more on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nMore on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Home \u00bb De-Fi How To Bridge Coins Back From Base To Ethereum: A Comprehensive Guide De-FiJournal How To Bridge Coins Back From Base To Ethereum: A Comprehensive Guide Rene Peters\n\nThere\u2019s been a common misconception that bridging into the Base chain is a one-way process with no way to withdraw funds. However, this is not the case. It is indeed possible to use the native withdrawal process to get your funds back on the Ethereum mainnet, albeit with a waiting period of 7 days.\n\nTwitter user Cygaar shared a detailed guide on on how to do it. The Base chain is essentially a 1-1 fork of Optimism, which means it can leverage all the features that Optimism has. This includes a native withdrawal process that allows users to move ETH from Base back to the Ethereum mainnet. The downside is that it takes 7 days due to the challenge period.\n\nThis 7-day period is necessary because optimistic rollups need a long enough period to challenge potentially fraudulent claims. Due to this waiting period, most people opt to use third-party bridges to bridge back to the mainnet quicker. However, the native withdrawal method should always work.\n\nThe Withdrawal Process\n\nTo start the withdrawal process, users need to visit the L2StandardBridge contract on the Base chain. From there, they can choose either \u201cwithdraw\u201d or \u201cwithdrawTo\u201d, with the only difference being that the latter allows users to choose the destination address that receives the ETH on the mainnet.\n\nThe fields need to be filled out as follows:\n\nwithdraw : This is the amount of ETH you want to bridge back. _l2Token : Use the value 0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000 . This is the ETH token address on Base. _amount : This should be the same value you used for part 1, but converted to wei. _minGasLimit : Put 0 _extraData : Put 0x\n\nAfter submitting the transaction, users should save the transaction hash for later reference.\n\nThe Role of Optimism\n\nOptimism handles withdrawals by requiring users to post a proof to L1 that they did a withdrawal on the L2 (Base in this case). After this, the user must wait 7 days to pass so any external party has the opportunity to challenge the proof. If no challenge happens, the user can finalize their withdrawal on L1.\n\nFor Base, users can use a command-line tool for withdrawals written by the Base team. This tool requires the necessary inputs \u2013 transaction hash from above, RPC URL, and the private key of the account that withdrew.\n\nExplosion in Meme Coin Market; How to find potential successors to $BONK, $PEPE, and $WIF?\ud83e\udd2b The key? Getting in early, especially during the ICO phase. Check out NuggetRush today! This pioneering memecoin combines play-to-earn gaming with authentic gold mining ventures. Seize the opportunity with ongoing presale prices! Plus, prepare for $NUGX\u2019s upcoming launch on major exchanges. Show more + Show less \u2013\n\nAfter running this command, users will get a transaction hash. They can confirm that their proof went through by looking up this transaction hash on Etherscan (for mainnet). They\u2019ll then have to wait 7 days before proceeding. Once this challenge period is over, they can run the second command for finalizing the withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawing from the Base chain back to Ethereum isn\u2019t particularly hard, but it does require some technical savviness for now. This guide is meant for people that absolutely need to bridge back right now and don\u2019t want to wait for the official bridge UI to come out. The Optimism stack was always built with a way to bridge back from L2 to L1, they just happened to make a UI to make this process easier. This guide works for all Optimism-stack chains."

Layer 2 chains process transactions off-chain for higher throughput and lower costs while integrating security features like fraud proofs. This makes L2 solutions ideal for easing Ethereum\u2019s scaling pains.\n\nWhat Are Ethereum Rollups?\n\nThere are two main types of Ethereum rollups \u2013 optimistic and zero-knowledge. Optimistic rollups bundle transactions off-chain and only execute computation on-chain when disputes occur. This significantly cuts fees and boosts TPS. Zero-knowledge rollups use cryptographic proofs for off-chain validation without revealing data. Both types enhance scalability and reduce costs.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIn summary, Layer 2 solutions like rollups and sidechains overcome blockchain scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain. They reduce fees and improve speeds, enhancing overall usability and sustainability. Leading Ethereum L2 projects make transactions seamless and affordable.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Are The ETH L2 Fees\u2753 The Sharia Advisory Council branch of Malaysia\u2019s security commission has advised that trading and investing in cryptocurrencies is permissible. This means that digital currencies can also be used to make zakat payments. How do Layer 2 solutions ensure security\u2753 They incorporate validity proofs, fraud proofs, and other cryptographic mechanisms to verify transactions processed off-chain are correct before committing data to Layer 1. These proofs provide security assurances so users can trust L2 solutions. What Is The Best Ethereum L2\u2753 The best Ethereum L2 solutions connect to Ethereum while offloading transactions off-chain. Projects like Polygon, Optimistic Rollups, Arbitrum, and zkSync provide faster and cheaper transactions, enhancing scalability. What are some key benefits of Layer 2 solutions\u2753 Layer 2 solutions provide faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and the ability to scale blockchain networks to handle higher throughput. They enhance usability without sacrificing decentralization. Additionally, L2 solutions enable use cases like micropayments which are infeasible on Layer 1 chains due to congestion and costs. Can DApps operate solely on Layer 2\u2753 In most cases DApps need to utilize both Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions to optimize performance and costs. Purely operating on L2 can limit functionality in some cases. The combination of Layer 1 and 2 is optimal for DApps to balance capabilities and scalability. What rollup type is best \u2013 optimistic or ZK rollups\u2753 Both optimistic and ZK rollups have tradeoffs. Optimistic rollups have lower friction to get started but withdrawals take longer. ZK rollups offer faster finality but require more complex setup. The best solution depends on the specific use case priorities. How do users transfer assets between L1 and L2\u2753 Users can leverage bridging mechanisms to move assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains. These bridges allow users to deposit to L2 from L1, use the funds on L2, and withdraw back to the L1 chain when needed. This provides flexibility to harness Layer 2 speeds and cost savings."
