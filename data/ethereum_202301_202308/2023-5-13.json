        "title": "Ethereum's Beacon Chain updated after finality issues - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum core developers rolled out patches for Prysm Labs and Teku clients in response to two Beacon Chain finality issues in 24 hours. The Beacon Chain serves as the consensus layer for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn May 11, Ethereum developers reported that the Beacon Chain was experiencing problems confirming transactions. Although new blocks could be proposed, an unknown issue prevented their finalization. The outage lasted around 25 minutes. A similar issue occurred on May 12, preventing block finalization for over an hour.\n\nFinality was unable to be reached for three and eight epochs, said the Ethereum Foundation in a statement shared by an Ethereum consultant on Twitter. The issue \u201cappears to have been caused by high load on some of the Consensus Layers clients, which in turn was caused by an exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nThe beacon chain stopped finalizing about thirty minutes ago. I don't know why yet, but in general the chain is designed to be resilient against this, transactions will continue as usual and finalization will kick in when the problem is resolved. pic.twitter.com/utAS0uAWpG \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) May 11, 2023\n\nAlthough the network was unable to finalize, live and end users were able to transact on the network thanks to client diversity, \u201cas not all client implementations were affected by this exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nClient diversity relates to the number of software clients available to network validators. Greater diversity among clients means a more robust and secure network.\n\nTeky and Prysm have released upgrades that implement optimizations to prevent beacon nodes from consuming excessive resources.\n\nA similar issue occurred on March 15, delaying the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which was successfully deployed on April 12. Ethereum\u2019s preexisting proof-of-work chain merged with the Beacon Chain on Sept. 15, 2022, enabling the network\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is faster and less energy-intensive.\n\nRecent trading hype around memecoins has increased Ethereum\u2019s activity and staking rewards rates. According to on-chain data, validators earned $46 million in the first week of May, or 24,997 Ether (ETH), a 40% increase over the previous week\u2019s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain had a technical issue on May 12 that led to a stoppage of finalizing blocks for over an hour. The incident followed a previous technical problem on May 11, making it the second one in 24 hours.\n\nA bug could have attacked Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain failed to finalize transactions for an unclear reason, causing major security concerns for users. Steven Zheng, the Block research director, mentioned that people speculate that the reason was bugs in staking clients or MEV infrastructures.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation stated that the unfinalized blocks could lead to the re-ordering or dropping of pending transactions from the network.\n\nThe recent attack was the second one in 24 hours, with the same issue on May 11 when finality paused for about 25 minutes.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain experiences temporary halt in finalization, raising alarms\n\nAccording to an Ethereum staker, they found a production incident where all four sets of CL+EL deployed in their system were simultaneously rebooted, which is a rare phenomenon. It was then discovered that these BeaconNode Prysm suddenly doubled their memory usage, which drove the memory limit and triggered OOM.\n\nA self-proclaimed Ethereum Beacon Chain community health consultant, Superphiz.eth, clarified that transactions do not stop due to finality issues like those on Ethereum. In addition, he noted that the lack of finality had no impact on on-chain activity.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1656977820315254786?s=20\n\nAs of the time of writing, the network has fixed the issue and restored the block finalization.\n\nChanges need to be implemented on network\n\nSome services built on Ethereum may need to modify operations due to finality issues. DYdX, for example, paused deposits temporarily due to the incident and continues to investigate the matter and monitor it.\n\nSuperphiz.eth noted that he expects a third even with the second wave over. He further advised validators on the network to increase their hardware spec if they can and switch to a minority client if possible. However, he noted not to worry too much about it, even if it looks terrible. The chain keeps going and will eventually finalize.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1657106474131136512\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear that questions about Ethereum\u2019s stability remain and could stain its credibility in the builder\u2019s eyes. The reliability of a network is essential for blockchains that would like to attract capital and grow users. That is important because Ethereum is historically viewed as among the most stable networks on the market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nCrypto Twitter has been awash the past few weeks with talk of a strange new protocol called EigenLayer.\n\nSome are going as far as calling it the next Ethereum Meta, while others are already whipping up speculative airdrop guides. And at least one person is doing God\u2019s work, helping us all pronounce the project\u2019s name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what in the hell is EigenLayer? Well, think of it as being like blockchain security-as-a-service.\n\nInstead of having to gather funds, hardware, and a series of validators to keep your newly-launched crypto project from getting 51% attacked (or worse), EigenLayer wants to put staked Ethereum back to work for you.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism means that the network is secured by economic incentives and penalties rather than massive warehouses of mining machines. So-called validators in such a network can join and begin earning ETH-denominated yield once they stake 32 ETH to the network. If, however, their validators go down or they behave maliciously by validating incorrect transactions, they\u2019ll be penalized; a portion of that 32 Ethereum gets taken away.\n\nFor reference, there\u2019s currently 19.7 million Ethereum enlisted to keep Ethereum secure, or about $34 billion today\u2014that\u2019s more than 16% of all Ethereum currently in circulation. Yes, it\u2019s a lot.\n\nEigenLayer takes this a step further by rehypothecating all that staked ETH to serve the same security purposes but for other, newer projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRehypothecation is basically another term for using the same money twice. And because that money\u2019s being used twice, stakers who opt-in will also enjoy an even higher yield. And the more projects that build (and gain traction), the more yield opted-in stakers can earn.\n\nGiven that the asset being staked here is also Ethereum, these other projects would also be Ethereum-based. EigenLayer\u2019s white paper includes bridge technologies and oracle providers that could all use this double-dipped Ethereum.\n\nIn many ways, this will also make the developers\u2019 deployment experience far easier, providing confidence that their pet project will ultimately be backed by the market\u2019s second-largest crypto network.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd, very crypto-native idea, but as mentioned, it\u2019s got a lot of folks fired up. ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin said EigenLayer is \u201cat the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAnd in March, the project raised $50 million in a Series A round from a host of notable investors.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, of course. For now, though, all eyes are on Eigen.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay. Subscribers to our emails get to read the essay before it goes on the site. Subscribe here."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s gas prices declined, while interest in Ethereum NFTs waned as well.\n\nETH\u2019s price remained unaffected despite the beacon chain mishap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] high gas prices have always been a subject of discussion in the crypto sector. Over the last few days, due to the hype around memecoins, gas prices on the Ethereum network surged.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, after the memecoin hype died down, gas fees on Ethereum declined. Over the last few days, the average gas price paid by Ethereum users fell from 155.84 ETH to 77.85 ETH.\n\nHow was ETH impacted?\n\nThis decline in gas prices could attract more users to the Ethereum network. Inasmuch, an increase in activity was observed.\n\nHowever, at press time, activity on the Ethereum network declined, as indicated by the low gas usage on the network. Another indicator of low activity was the decline in NFT trades.\n\nThe decline in gas prices could thus improve the sentiment around Ethereum. Due to the beacon chain debacle, people\u2019s perception of the protocol has turned negative.\n\nSome bumps in the road\n\nDevelopers have come out and explained the reasons as to why the issues on the network occurred. According to one of the developers, Potuz, the Ethereum network experienced a 25-minute loss of finality due to several valid but untimely attestations being broadcast. This stressed consensus clients, especially those on weaker hardware, causing them to struggle while following the chain.\n\nTo address this issue, Prysm has released a fix that ignores attestations with known old targets to prevent CPU stress and memory bloat. This maintains safety, as the ignored attestations will be processed as soon as the chain is seen.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThese developments didn\u2019t have an immense impact on ETH\u2019s price. In the past few days, ETH\u2019s prices remained relatively stable. The velocity of ETH, during this period, increased, suggesting that the frequency with which ETH was being traded grew.\n\nHowever, network growth fell, indicating that interest in new addresses in ETH had fallen."

        "title": "Best Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now: Solano, Ethereum and Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Global investors continue to scour the markets and search for the fastest growing, highest yielding cryptocurrencies. 2023 has provided investors with a number of opportunities to make fast profits whilst also providing stability. The crypto market is known for its volatility, traders and enthusiasts must keep their finger on the pulse as selecting the correct investment is critical. With the cryptocurrency market maintaining a market cap above the $1 trillion mark most of the time, many investors are constantly looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now\n\nInnovative, groundbreaking technology is the key to any successful cryptocurrency. Market movers and shakers, disrupters and enhancers provide investors with the perfect opportunity to make profits. Below are some of the best cryptocurrency investments to buy right now:\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin will always be on the list of the best investments, with a market cap of over $500million the once obscure cryptocurrency has become the bedrock of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin currently has a market dominance of more than 45% with crypto experts recognising that the price of many other cryptocurrencies is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of people still unknown to date. Bitcoin was created to serve as peer-to-peer cash, a currency that would be independent of the government. The lack of governmental control has drawn many to the decentralized asset over the years. Another factor that has attracted users to the asset is its limited supply. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which means that it is a deflationary asset that is resistant to inflation. This scarcity has helped to drive up the price of Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors looking to store value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed violently. The crypto asset started the year trading around the $45,000 mark. However, Bitcoin ended the year below $20,000, falling as low as $15,000 at some point. Ironically, 2022 seemed to be the year when Bitcoin would reach the $100,000 milestone.\n\nPlan B, a renowned Bitcoin analyst, and proponent, deduced a system for predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price based on supply. This unique system coined by Plan B had been effective in the past, accurately predicting the period when Bitcoin would hit the $10,000 mark and cross the $50,000 mark. The stage seemed set for the next prediction. According to Plan B\u2019s model, BTC would reach the $100,000 mark sometime around late 2021 or early 2022. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price tumbled after a series of negative events in the crypto ecosystem, the most notable being the crash of LUNA and UST. After hitting unexpected lows in 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price is now due for some relief. Crypto investors realize that Bitcoin below $20,000 is undervalued. More so, the flagship cryptocurrency has always bounced back from black swan events and massive price crashes. In 2023, investors expect Bitcoin to bounce back from the massive fall from its peak experienced the year before.\n\nFurther, Bitcoin\u2019s halving is expected to take place in 2024. The halving of Bitcoin would reduce block rewards to miners. This would make the crypto asset scarcer than it was. Historical price action reveals that Bitcoin always appreciates massively months after the halving. Prudent long-term investors will use the dollar-cost averaging method to invest in the asset before the next halving in 2024.\n\n2. Tradecurve \u2013 A Presale to Purchase\n\nTradecurve.io\u2019s presale is making waves within the cryptocurrency currency market, with phase one of it\u2019s presale rapidly selling out TCRV is showing all the signs of a profitable opportunity for investors. Designed to become the worlds first hybrid trading exchange, Tradecurve will serve as a bridge between the financial and cryptocurrency markets. Tradecurve\u2019s unique privacy policy and disposal of KYC checks allows users of the platform to trade the financial markets in complete anonymity.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native utility token $TCRV powers the entire Tradecurve ecosystem and is currently priced at $0.01. Tradecurve is as an excellent opportunity for investors who are able to take advantage of its current price, a total of 40% of $TCRV will be sold during the presale.\n\nHolders of the Tradecurve token will also benefit from a number of offerings such as; access to trading academies via the metaverse, automated trading, copy trading, passive income through staking, high-leverage options, lowered subscription and trading fees. Tradecurve will also incorporate algorithmic trading, allowing users to utilize advanced algorithms and AI to execute trades with speed and precision.\n\nProviding access for investors to trade; stocks, shares, currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities and indices all from one account, Tradecurve has set the precedent for never-seen-before privacy when trading the financial markets. With an experienced team behind the project, multiple use cases and features of the Tradecurve platform, investors are expecting the $TCRV presale to continue gaining rapid momentum.\n\n3. Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s native token is Ether. Ether is used to pay for transactions and services on the platform. This has created an economic system within the platform that has helped to drive its adoption and use.\n\nThe protocol is widely utilized in the NFT and DeFi space. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and the project was founded by Vitalik Buterin and co. Notably, Charles Hoskinson, the current founder of the Cardano network, also played an integral role in the development of Ethereum. Ethereum was created to facilitate the development of immutable smart contracts and programs. Today, the blockchain protocol has lived up to expectations, enabling developers to build decentralized applications.\n\nOne of the main advantages of Ethereum is its flexibility. Developers can use the platform to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Notably, the blockchain protocol\u2019s native token (ETH) has made early investors a lot of money. Ether was less than a dollar for most of 2015. Today, however, Ether is valued at around $1800.\n\nInterestingly, despite the massive growth Ethereum has experienced over the years, the protocol still has a long way to go in development. The constant innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem has led the project to continue to see tremendous success. The Ethereum Foundation implemented a means of receiving improvement proposals, that is EIPs. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, and it gives room for innovation in the ecosystem.\n\nOn the 12th of April, Ethereum successfully completed an EIP that has long been pending. The EIP enabled the release of staked tokens to users who had locked their ETH to enable its consensus mechanism transmission. Ethereum previously utilized the proof of work consensus mechanism but has now switched to the proof of stake consensus mechanism. This switch will enable scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nVitalik Buterin noted that the successful transition of the Ethereum network from proof of work to proof of stake was not the end of Ethereum\u2019s development trajectory. The protocol still has significant upgrades in its roadmap for 2023 and 2024.\n\nWhen investors factor in the upcoming developments waiting on the Ethereum network, the project becomes more appealing. Ethereum currently has very strong fundamentals, and a more scalable Ethereum would attract more investors. This makes Ether a good crypto asset to invest in for long-term gains.\n\n4. Solana\n\nSolana is one of the well-known \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in the crypto ecosystem. The cryptocurrency made a name as an ETH-killer because of the fascinating features of its blockchain. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that was created to solve the scalability and performance issues faced by the Ethereum network. It was launched in 2020 by a team of developers led by Anatoly Yakovenko and has quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors.\n\nSolana has magnificent transaction speed. The platform boasts a transaction speed of 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in existence. This has made it an attractive option for developers looking to build decentralized applications that require high-speed transaction processing.\n\nSolana has some disadvantages, though. While Solana stands tall in its speed, the blockchain protocol seems to be slightly deficient in centralization. This relative deficiency is understandable due to the fact that the protocol is relatively new. Newer blockchain networks tend to be less decentralized than long-standing protocols. Further, the Solana network has also been criticized for its security in the past. The blockchain network has been stopped on two occasions due to upgrades.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Solana ecosystem still has a strong developer community. Its strong community has helped the ecosystem and the native token to survive catastrophic seasons. Last year, during the crypto market meltdown, the SOL token was severely affected.\n\nIts price fell from a high of $250 to as low as $50. While this price crash was massive, the worst was still yet to come. In November, when the FTX exchange was found guilty of mismanaging traders\u2019 funds, the SOL token paid a part of the price. The FTX exchange held most of its assets and collateral in SOL. As the heat intensified, the exchange had to liquidate most of its collateral in FTT and SOL. That month, SOL tumbled from around the $30 mark to as low as $8.\n\nInterestingly though, while it seemed to be the end of the road for the Ethereum killer, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. A team of developers launched BONK, the first memecoin of the Solana ecosystem. The developers emphasized that their goal was to attract liquidity to the Solana ecosystem and rescue the dying token. Thankfully, their plans were met with success.\n\nLate in December and early in January, memecoin fans joined the Bonk ecosystem, and the Bonk airdrop further contributed in boosting liquidity in the Solana ecosystem. At the moment, Solana still seems miles away from its all-time high. However, the token has continued to survive the crypto market storms and would be set to bounce back when a significant bull run occurs. Solana offers a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the cryptocurrency market. Its speed, low fees, and strong community support make it an attractive option for developers and investors.\n\n5. Pancakeswap\n\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange running on the Binance Smart Chain network. It was launched in September 2020 and has quickly become one of the largest DEXs. Compared to DEXs built on the Ethereum network, Pancakeswap has low transaction fees. This has attracted many retail traders to the exchange.\n\nAnother advantage of PancakeSwap is its yield farming feature, which allows users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to the platform. Liquidity providers make a share of the fees generated by the exchange, and they can also earn CAKE tokens, the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, as a reward for their participation.\n\nNotably, CAKE, the native token of the Pancakeswap ecosystem, was once in the top 20 ranks of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, the price of the CAKE token has fallen drastically recently, and so has its market capitalization. CAKE is now ranked as the 85th largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile its current price and decline in the past two years are discouraging, it is worth noting that the exchange has no competition on the BSC network. Cake currently has the largest liquidity for BSC projects and will continue to be widely utilized.\n\nAdditionally, the price decline presents a massive investment opportunity for investors. If the CAKE token is to reclaim its all-time high, that would be a 20X move from its current price. Factoring the project\u2019s fundamentals and its role in the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, CAKE will have the potential to profit investors in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, Tradecurve, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and PancakeSwap tokens have solid fundamentals making them great coins to invest in this year. The crypto market is full of opportunities and now is the time to invest. Notably, optimum profits are not made from well established cryptos but young, innovative tokens with real world usage. Tradecurve has all of these credentials and an exciting future ahead, now is an excellent time to get involved in the presale.\n\nFor more information about Tradecurve (TCRV), visit the links below:\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Poised To Hit 35% Surge In Staking Demand \u2013 What It Means For Investors - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In 2022, Ethereum formally adopted Proof of Stake (PoS) as a more secure and energy-efficient method to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nPoS and other consensus mechanisms are integral to the security of a network. This shift has significant implications for the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of staking \u2013 the process of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network.\n\nRelated Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil\u2019s Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin\u2019s Price?\n\nWhile staking has been around for some time, several factors are now converging to potentially drive a significant increase in ETH staking. In fact, a leading staking service provider has predicted a surge in staking activity and has backed it up with compelling reasons.\n\nSo, what does this mean for Ethereum, and why is staking becoming such a critical part of its blockchain infrastructure?\n\nStaked Q2 Report Predicts Significant ETH Staking Rate Increase\n\nStaked, a research subsidiary of the Kraken exchange, has released its Q2 report, projecting that the ETH staking rate could see a significant increase of 20% to 35% over the next 12 to 18 months. This forecast was based on several factors, including the recent increase in average Ethereum staking yield from 5.2% to 5.8% on a year on year basis.\n\nMoreover, the Staked Q2 report\u2019s prediction of a significant increase in the ETH staking rate could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. If more users begin staking their ETH, the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency will decrease, potentially leading to an increase in its price.\n\nThis, in turn, could have a ripple effect on the entire cryptocurrency market, making it a crucial trend to watch in the coming months.\n\nETH total market cap currently at $218 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nWhat Increased ETH Staking Means For Investors\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits is that a higher staking yield means investors can earn more rewards for their staked ETH. This could be especially appealing to long-term investors who are looking to maximize their returns.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in staking could potentially lead to a decrease in the circulating supply of ETH, which could drive up its price. This means that investors who are holding ETH could see their holdings increase in value.\n\nBut the impact of increased ETH staking goes beyond just earning rewards and potential price increases. It also has a positive effect on the overall health and stability of the Ethereum network.\n\nBy staking their ETH, investors are essentially locking it up, making it more difficult for bad actors to attack the network. This makes the network more secure and trustworthy, which could attract more users and investors to the platform.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $1,798 according to CoinGecko, with a 2.4% rally in the past 24 hours. However, it\u2019s worth noting that ETH has experienced a seven-day slump of 8.5%, highlighting the volatility that is characteristic of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n-Featured image from Siam Blockchain\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Crypto to buy now: Top investor shares the 3 to choose in May - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Dominic Basulto\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the domestic banking crisis and the potential for a U.S. debt default, some investors are now exploring crypto as a potential safe haven asset to weather the economic storm. Such thinking would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when the common consensus was that \"crypto winter\" would extend into much of 2023.\n\nBut are any cryptos really safe to buy right now? And, if so, which ones should investors be thinking about adding to their portfolios this month?\n\nBitcoin\n\nFirst up is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is regaining its status as \"digital gold\" in the minds of many investors due to all the uncertainty in the market today. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold has been surging in recent months, and the growing consensus is that Bitcoin is probably the safest crypto to invest in right now. Of course, \"safest\" is a relative term, because we all know how risky and volatile Bitcoin can be. Last year, for example, the value of Bitcoin plummeted by nearly 65%.\n\nDollar dollar bill, y'all:Gen Z is using cash more than ever in the face of inflation\n\nBut one factor in Bitcoin's favor is its long track record, which has made it a favorite of both retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin, which was created back in 2013, has survived several different market crashes over the past decade, and has emerged stronger each time. Bitcoin continues to offer tremendous upside potential, based on the pace of its international adoption as both a form of payment and a store of value.\n\nIn fact, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has modeled the long-term growth potential of this crypto and concluded that Bitcoin could soar past the $1.48 million price mark by 2030. Less aggressive estimates have Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. Thus, from my perspective, Bitcoin offers the optimal blend of risk and reward of any top cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\n\nNext up is Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing only Bitcoin. Ethereum offers investors a well-diversified ecosystem, with exposure to every key segment of the blockchain and crypto world. This includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming. Thus, by holding Ethereum, you are diversifying away some of the risk of holding crypto in your portfolio.\n\nMost impressively, Ethereum continues to upgrade its blockchain, ensuring that it remains the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. Last year, for example, Ethereum completed The Merge. This technological upgrade helped to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more scalable. And it prepared Ethereum for the next wave of growth in the blockchain world. And then, in March of this year, Ethereum came through again with Shapella (also known as \"Shanghai\"), another major upgrade to secure its status as a premier blockchain.\n\nAnd Ethereum shows no signs of stopping with future updates. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, has already given investors a detailed roadmap for what's coming next in 2023 and 2024. The goal is to make Ethereum the highest-throughput, fastest, and most scalable blockchain in the world.\n\nSolana\n\nFor the third pick, I would have to go with Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), an Ethereum competitor with an $8.15 billion market cap. This is one of the few blockchain projects with the potential to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum this year. Year to date, Solana is already up 107%, which is more than Bitcoin (65%) and Ethereum (53%).\n\nWhile some might argue that this remarkable rebound in Solana is nothing more than a dead cat bounce after the FTX (CRYPTO: FTT) meltdown last year, there are several key steps that Solana has taken in 2023 that have me very optimistic about its future. One of these is the recent launch of Saga, the first-ever mobile phone by a major blockchain network. The Android-powered Saga has been described as a \"crypto phone\" due to its integration of crypto-friendly features. This mobile phone could be the key to Solana gaining a key foothold in the Web3 market, where Solana is preparing other initiatives.\n\nWhich crypto to buy first?\n\nIf there's one cryptocurrency to buy first this month, it's Bitcoin. As noted above, this is the one crypto that offers the optimal blend of risk and reward. This is an especially important consideration, given the economic headwinds swirling around the market right now. Thus far, at least, Bitcoin has proven to be a safe haven asset worth holding at a time when America's regional banks seem to be failing on a frequent basis.\n\nBut if you're really looking to outperform the market, that's when it's time to explore the altcoins that are much smaller (and hence, much riskier) than either Bitcoin or Ethereum. My personal pick is Solana, which has already skyrocketed to triple-digit gains in 2023. Solana comes with its share of drawbacks -- such as continued concerns about network stability -- but is a blockchain that I think is building a long-term future in the crypto world.\n\nDominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nDespite a small midweek growth spurt on news that the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s inflation readings were lower than expected, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered the weekend with moderate losses over the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin is down 7.9% and trades for $26,817. Even the news that the Principality of Liechtenstein will soon accept it as payment for state services could not stop the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization from posting a larger loss than Ethereum this week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has had to compete with a rising dollar this week. The cryptocurrency typically has an inverse relationship with the dollar so the latter\u2019s rise over the last two days has manifested in a pullback in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nThe use of Bitcoin for Ordinals NFTs also appears to be slowing down, with trading volume dropping by 50% on May 11 and remaining far short of its range throughout most of May, according to the Dune dashboard of blockchain analyst Domo.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees also hit a brief two-year high on Tuesday when the average price hit $31.14, according to data by BitInfoCharts. That figure is now back under $10.\n\nEthereum dipped 5.8% over the seven days and currently changes hands at $1,800. It\u2019s one of lighter dips in a week where, broadly speaking, the damage was light across the market.\n\nCryptocurrencies that dipped more than 8% this week include Polygon (MATIC), which fell 11.5% to $0.856058, Avalanche (AVAX) dropped 11% to $15.01, Toncoin (TON) sank 11.8% to $1.85, and Internet Computer (ICP) dropped 9.2% to trade at $5.16.\n\nIn the news...\n\nOn Monday, American crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The news comes weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the company with failing to register as a broker-dealer, exchange, and clearing agency and said the agency netted at least $1.3 billion in illicit revenue between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in March, Bittrex said it was winding down U.S. operations, with CEO Richie Lai citing the \"current U.S. regulatory and economic environment\" as reasons for the decision.\n\nAt a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, Republican and Democrat lawmakers failed to find common ground over the extent to which new regulation is needed for digital assets. Their main difficulty is deciding whether a token should be considered a security or commodity, if the former, then regulatory jurisdiction would be given to the SEC, if the latter, it would go to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThat same day, Texas lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of an update to the state\u2019s Bill of Rights to include the right of the people to own, hold, and use digital currencies. It\u2019s still a long way from being passed though, and still has to pass one more vote in the House, one in the Senate and a people\u2019s vote.\n\nFinally on Thursday The U.S. Chamber of Commerce slammed the SEC for its regulation-by-enforcement approach toward the digital asset industry. It filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase in the exchange\u2019s ongoing court petition to get the securities regulator to clarify its rules.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has deliberately muddied the waters by claiming sweeping authority over digital assets while deploying a haphazard, enforcement-based approach,\u201d the Chamber wrote. \u201cThis regulatory chaos is by design, not happenstance.\u201d"

However, the rift widened after the much-awaited Shapella Upgrade went live in April, bringing some improvements unique to Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, a similar event in September 2022, known as the Merge, which kickstarted Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, failed to bring about a considerable decoupling between the two assets.\n\nBut the recent Shapella Upgrade closed the loop on some of the key aspects of the transition that couldn\u2019t make it to the Merge last year, thus positioning Ethereum as a full-fledged PoS network.\n\nIt is important to understand that both the assets function very differently from each other.\n\nWhile Ethereum is often used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nInfact, by virtue of being a chain which hosts numerous applications, the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum was a whopping $27 billion at the time of writing. In contrast, Bitcoin held assets worth only $183 million.\n\nWhat can be the implications?\n\nAs per a 21 April report by Coinbase, lower BTC-ETH correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification as holding both the assets can result in higher returns. As for institutional investors, the trend could impact their trading strategies like cross-hedging.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHaving said that, recent price action of the two coins showed that both have moved on a near identical wavelength. Earlier this week, BTC\u2019s crash fueled by a false rumor created ripples in the broader crypto market and ETH didn\u2019t go unscathed.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC was down 8.48% over the last week while Ethereum\u2019s weekly losses were 6.44%."

        "title": "Ethereum Developers Resolve Beacon Chain Finality Issues - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum developers have taken measures to address the finality issues that occurred on the Beacon chain in the past week. On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed.\n\nEthereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge\n\nIn response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum\u2019s constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain.\n\nWe can start putting this loss of finality issue behind us, @Teku_ConsenSys and @prylabs have deployed fixes that will prevent the attestation flooding. This is one step on our diversity & decentralization journey, let's learn from it and move forward with greater purpose. pic.twitter.com/cSRgPTWeuy \u2014 superphiz.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@superphiz) May 13, 2023\n\nSuperphiz also shared a statement from the Ethereum Foundation in which they are speculating the cause of these \u201cexceptional scenarios\u201d to be the \u201chigh load of some Consensus Layer clients\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation applauded client diversity which made it feasible for transactions to occur on the network, as not all client implementations were affected by the finality challenges.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation also confirmed that the exact cause of the Beacon chain glitch is still unknown. However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations.\n\nETH Total Supply Declines Following The Merge\n\nIn other news, Ethereum\u2019s total supply decreased in the months after The Merge.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, The Merge occurred in which the Ethereum network fully transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), leading to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIn the 241 days after this historical event, data from the Ethereum supply analytics platform, ultrasound.money shows that ETH\u2019s total supply has declined by 0.29%.\n\nSince The Merge, over 653,000 ETH has been burned compared to the 425,000 ETH that has been minted in the last eight months resulting in a net negative change of about -227,000 ETH.\n\nInterestingly, ultrasound.money predicts the total ETH supply to have increased at a rate of 3.244% per year had The Merge not occurred.\n\nThat said, if this deflationary trend continues, it would mean good news for long-term ETH investors. This is because a decrease in supply usually results in a rise in value.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,805.77 with a total supply of 122.89 million. Along with most of the market, ETH showed a negative price movement in the last week, losing 5.36% of its value.\n\nETH Trading At $1804.73 | Source: ETHUSD Chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured Image: Forbes, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee is on the High End - Tekedia",
        "content": "If you have ever used Ethereum to process transactions on the Blockchain, you might have noticed that the gas fee is not cheap. Gas fee is the amount of Ether that you pay to the network for processing your transaction. The gas fee depends on two factors: the gas price and the gas limit.\n\nThe gas price is the amount of ether that you are willing to pay for each unit of gas, and the gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction can consume. The higher the gas price and the gas limit, the higher the gas fee.\n\nWhy is the Gas Fee so high on Ethereum Network?\n\nThe main reason is that Ethereum is a popular platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that run on smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that execute automatically on the blockchain according to predefined rules.\n\nHowever, smart contracts also consume gas when they are executed, and some of them can be very complex and require a lot of computation. Therefore, when there is a high demand for dApps and smart contracts on Ethereum, the network becomes congested and the gas fee increases.\n\nHow To reduce Gas Fee on Ethereum Network\n\nThere are a few ways to save on gas fees when using Ethereum. One way is to adjust your gas price and gas limit according to the network conditions. You can use tools like Etherscan or EthGasStation to check the current average gas price and the recommended gas price for fast or slow transactions.\n\nYou can also use MetaMask or other wallets that allow you to customize your gas price and gas limit before sending a transaction. However, you should be careful not to set your gas price too low or your gas limit too high, as this might result in your transaction being rejected or stuck in the network.\n\nAnother way to reduce the gas fee on Ethereum is to use layer 2 solutions or sidechains. Layer 2 solutions are protocols that run on top of Ethereum and provide faster and cheaper transactions by using different consensus mechanisms or off-chain computation.\n\nSome examples of layer 2 solutions are Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, zkSync, Loopring, and StarkWare. Sidechains are independent blockchains that are compatible with Ethereum and allow users to transfer assets between them.\n\nSome examples of side chains are xDai, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. By using layer 2 solutions or sidechains, you can avoid paying high gas fees on the main Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum gas fee is not cheap because of the high demand for dApps and smart contracts on the platform. However, you can reduce the gas fee by adjusting your gas price and gas limit or by using layer 2 solutions or sidechains. These DApps and smart contracts require a lot of computation and storage, which consume a lot of gas.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum has transitioned to a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which requires a lot of energy and resources to secure the network. PoW also limits the scalability of Ethereum, as it can only process around 15 transactions per second.\n\nPoS has helped stimulate lower gas fees significantly on the Ethereum network, as it will reduce the need for intensive computation and competition among miners. Ethereum is not cheap, but it is valuable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "You\u2019ve found the perfect spot if you\u2019re a meme or altcoin fan looking for the next big thing. This article will evaluate Big Eyes Coin (BIG), NEAR, and Ethereum (ETH). Which will be the ultimate meme coin?\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 The FOMO Cure\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a cryptocurrency that functions similarly to other meme coins, with its value determined by community enthusiasm and FOMO. But what distinguishes it from the competition? Although Big Eyes Coin has a purrfect cat crew, it takes pleasure in being the \u201cunderdog\u201d of the meme coin space, promoting itself as a genuinely community-driven enterprise.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, with a devoted staff and an engaged community, has the potential to become the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu killer. Will it, however, live up to the hype?\n\nAt this point, the answer is simply YES; it definitely can, but in a crypto world, you need facts, and we can\u2019t be dull, so here are the facts.\n\nThe presale has so far raised $35.4 million. Big Eyes Coin is designed to help the community, which has been demonstrated through donating $15,926 to charity organisations.\n\nAnd if you think this is great, there is still more. As the presale is still taking place and will end on the 3rd of June, everyone can enter the promo code END300 at checkout for a 300% bonus.\n\nThe Big Eyes team is going BIG once again. The BIG Casino is about to be launched on August 29th, 2023; a gaming and betting website where you may play and earn BIG. Anyone can participate in the games by converting their crypto holdings into BIG tokens. This will increase the daily trade volume, the number of legitimate BIG holders, and the market capitalisation as the casino and P2E activities expand.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR): The Altcoin for Scalable and Interoperable Decentralised Apps\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) is another fascinating altcoin gaining traction in cryptocurrency. NEAR is also compatible with Ethereum.\n\nNEAR was created to make it simple for developers to construct blockchain-based decentralised apps (dApps). Because the platform is designed for scalability and interoperability, it is a popular choice among investors and developers.\n\nNEAR allows you to be a part of the future of fintech while supporting a thriving and innovative community. Near Protocol (NEAR) has had a significant price gain in recent months, with its native token presently trading at $1.93, up from $1.25 in early January 2023. But are they near to exploding the altcoin season? Time will tell.\n\nWhat a Terrific Time to be Optimistic About Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. ETH is a decentralised platform that allows smart contracts and dApps to be developed and run without interruption or influence from a third party.\n\nETH is intended to be used as digital money, but it also has many other applications. It is quick, safe, and has various features, making it a popular choice among investors and developers. While not a meme coin, ETH is a significant participant in banking and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe most crucial aspect of meme coins is the project\u2019s community. Big Eyes Coin is a blossoming community of meme currency enthusiasts and investors thrilled about the project\u2019s potential. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a more established community but is not expressly designed for meme currencies.\n\nAnother critical aspect to consider is transaction speed and costs. NEAR is intended to be scalable, and its transaction costs are far lower than Ethereum. This makes it a more appealing platform for meme currencies that demand quick and inexpensive transfers.\n\nIt is difficult to precisely anticipate the price of any cryptocurrency or meme coin. However, Big Eyes Coin has the potential to be a top 10 meme coin based on current market trends and the excitement surrounding it.\n\nClick to know more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale:https://buy1.bigeyes.space/?source=RWfuttKewL\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Following the news that Arbitrum has already airdropped tokens worth $ 120 million to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in its ecosystem, interest has surged in other ERC20 tokens that put the financial well-being of their community first. The most notable of these is DigiToads, built from the ground up with its community at the absolute heart of everything it does. TOADS has recently welcomed new investments across the board, especially from Ethereum whales, who see more upside and a better return over the coming months with DigiToads compared to even Ethereum itself. And when whales make moves in the crypto ocean, waves are felt across the industry. TOADS is making waves\u2014here\u2019s why:\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nThe TOADS community is already being heavily rewarded thanks to the ecosystem\u2019s incredibly compelling new ico presale. The journey is only just starting for TOADS, and it will continue gaining in price throughout its presale adventure. Early adopters have already seen their holdings grow and there\u2019s still time to join them.\n\nAs part of a compelling model for P2E gaming and meme coin potential, the TOADS community is at the core of the whole ecosystem. It\u2019s been built to help benefit all its holders, especially early investors, with an experience that\u2019s fun, rewarding, and sustainable. That\u2019s why TOADS has already made over $3 million in sales in just a couple of months. This growth looks set to continue.\n\nThe DigiToads community is continuously rewarded with a fun experience and more TOADS tokens, depending on how well your companions compete. You can also enjoy top NFT staking mechanics to earn residual income along the way. 2.5% of profits are also donated to charitable causes, especially those that aim to protect the planet, setting it apart from other resource-heavy crypto projects and making the TOADS ecosystem a community-first project.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nARB\u2019s airdrop of $ 120 million tokens to 125 DAOs has shown how much a community-first project can do in the crypto world. The airdrop is an important part of the ARB roadmap, which aims to pay out 1.13% of its total 10 billion tokens to qualifying DAO projects. ARB still leads the way as one of the best community-minded cryptos around and is, therefore, a strong pick for your portfolio. But some investors prefer projects like TOADS, which they believe has more room to grow over the next few months and beyond.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is still the cornerstone of the altcoin world as the go-to development platform for ERC20 projects. But prices in ETH itself remain stagnant, causing whales to look elsewhere. And they don\u2019t have to look far, as there are plenty of strong options already on the Ethereum blockchain, like TOADS and ARB. With ETH whales starting to move into TOADS investments, others are looking to follow for the hottest new property in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion\n\nARB has shown how well a crypto community can be rewarded, but TOADS takes this community-first approach even further. Throughout the TOADS journey, its community of avid investors will be rewarded more than almost any other crypto project. That\u2019s one of the reasons why ETH whales are moving into TOADS and you should strongly consider joining them to diversify your portfolio and potentially accumulate long-term gains.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
