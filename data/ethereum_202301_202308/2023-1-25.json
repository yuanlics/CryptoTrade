        "title": "How Long Will the Ethereum LSD Narrative Last? Talking 2023 Trends with Nansen\u2019s Martin Lee - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum Liquid Staking tokens are going through the roof. Lido is up 150% in a month, similarly Frax Shares, while other protocols, such as Rocket Pool, are also catching up.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. NFTs are also seeing massive volumes for multiple consecutive weeks, showing little signs of slowing down.\n\nThe question now is for how long this positive trend will sustain \u2013 is it a dead cat bounce or the beginning of a much-awaited recovery?\n\nTo help us crunch the numbers and interpret some of the on-chain data is Martin Lee \u2013 a Data Journalist from the popular cryptocurrency analytics firm Nansen.\n\nLiquid Staking Coins Trend Upwards, but for How Long?\n\nEthereum LSD, or liquid staking derivative coins, have been the hottest story of 2023 so far, with many of the protocols seeing tremendous growth in the value locked and, by extension \u2013 popularity.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with the concept, we have a comprehensive guide on Ethereum liquid staking.\n\nAs opposed to staking directly into the Beacon depositor contract, LSD protocols allow users to stake their ETH and receive a synthetic version of it \u2013 a new token, per se \u2013 that can then be used across various DeFi applications to trade, farm, provide liquidity, and so forth.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Lee outlined two major advantages that, according to him, are part of the reasons why the narrative has grown so strong. For instance, h outlined that staking ETH directly into the smart contract is \u201creally capital inefficient\u201d because of a few things. First, the capital requirement is quite considerable (32 ETH), and the lockup period used to be unknown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe natural solution to this would be liquid staking. You get a liquid token in exchange for whatever you\u2019ve staked (in this case ETH). For example, if you stake ETH with Lido, you get stETH, which is fully liquid and you can interact with various DeFi protocols.\n\nLiquid staking solves both the problems of the staked ETH being illiquid and the high capital requirement to participate in ETH staking.\n\nNative tokens of LSD protocols, such as Lido\u2019s LDO, for instance, have been on the run lately. LDO itself is up close to 150% in the past month, similar to other protocols of the kind like Rocket Pool and others.\n\nThe catalyst for this seems to have been the recent announcement that Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will hit the public testnet in February and the mainnet in 2023. This is a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community because it will allow validators to unlock the 32 ETH they\u2019ve staked in the Beacon contract for the first time. The consensus seems to be that this would increase the demand for liquid staking alternatives, which is the predominant reason for the current popularity and increase in their valuations.\n\nOn when the narrative will inevitably die out, Lee says that most trends like this typically slow down on the date of the event that prompted their emergence in the first place \u2013 in this case, the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nTypically, the trend dies out on the date of the event itself. For example, the ETH Merge was such a huge topic, but on the Merge date itself, people completely stopped talking about it.\n\nNFT Volumes Also Pop\n\nAt the time of our recording, NFT trading volume was going through the roof, and even though there was a certain decline in the past couple of days, the market saw a considerable rebound.\n\nIn fact, by January 17th, ETH NFTs saw five consecutive weeks of up-only volumes.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Lee said that it\u2019s more or less this is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in past cycles.\n\nWhenever we have long periods of very boring action, where there\u2019s basically no movements, prices are extremely stable, NFTs tend to go on their own mini-run whenever that happens. In the past 2-3 months, the price action across the board was extremely stagnant. Then, NFTs kind of went on their own mini-run, with some projects doing better than others.\n\nTo find out what Lee thinks the trends of this year will look like, as well as whether or not the Shanghai upgrade will cause a lot of selling pressure on ETH\u2019s price, don\u2019t hesitate to watch the full video above."

        "title": "Polygon a BETTER Crypto Investment Than Ethereum in 2023? - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "This article answers the most important question for the next bull rally. Which is a better investment for the next bullrun ETH or MATIC. Take a look at this: ETH\u2019s ICO Price\u2014$0.31 and its ROI in 10 years was 5,277x. On the other hand, MATIC\u2019s ICO Price\u2014$0.00263 and its ROI in 4 years was 376X.\n\nDoes this big ROI number for ETH mean that the token has had its run? And for those 10X 50X returns in 2023 we should hold MATIC rather than ETH? To get the right answer, I had to do a lot of ground work. But to make it simple for you, I have compared the 2 most important parameters for ETH and MATIC, as these helped me conclude which one I should finally hold for the next bullrun and why? Before I come to the 2 parameters, let me first update you on what is happening with both these projects in 2023.\n\nWhat is Happening with Ethereum in 2023?\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum has its next big upgrade coming in the Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. This will enable withdrawal of staked ETH to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, over 13.49% of total ETH supply is staked and from March 2023, a part of it will unlock for withdrawals. This enabling of withdrawal is also likely to have some ramifications on market demand for ETH, and that could have an effect on the price of ETH.\n\nSo, I plan to keep a close eye on ETH staking withdrawal schedule to understand its impact on ETH price. Now here is something interesting. Shanghai upgrade will also have effect on Polygon. How and why I will explain in the next section that talks about what is Polygon up to in 2023?\n\nWhat is Happening with Polygon in 2023?\n\nPolygon killed 2022 with its mainstream partnerships with some of the biggest of the biggest brands: Adobe, Disney, Meta, NFL, NuBank, Reddit, Robinhood, and Starbucks. And in 2023 Polygon is bound to make it big because of these 4 factors:\n\n#2022 wrap-up #onPolygon by Polygon Analytics\ud83d\udc47 Active wallets hit a new ATH: 11 mm+ \ud83d\ude80\n\nTotal active wallets: 206 mm (+58% from \u201821) \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRange of monthly transactions: 80 mm+ \ud83e\udd1d@LensProtocol & @unstoppableweb saw explosive growth after launch #onPolygon \ud83d\udca5 pic.twitter.com/c1OXO7ymKr \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) January 24, 2023\n\nProjects Migrating to Polygon\n\nThe end of December 2022 saw 3 popular protocols migrate to the Polygon network. For instance, two major Solana NFT platforms, DeGods and y00ts, announced their move to Polygon. More projects mean more users and more token usage.\n\n2. Mastercard Incubator Project\n\nOn January 7th, traditional finance giant, Mastercard, announced an incubator program that will teach emerging artists how to use web3 technology. The program is called the Artist Accelerator program, and it is being developed in collaboration with Polygon.\n\n3. NFT Sale Volume Spike\n\nPolygon defied crypto winter with a spike in NFT sales volume\n\n4. Uptick in Users\n\nPolygon also recorded more NFT users than most other networks. All this will undoubtedly translate into price action for Matic.\n\nNow, here is something that most of us don\u2019t know. Shanghai was originally expected to include additional much-anticipated enhancements, including proto-danksharding\u2014a streamlined data sampling process that would make layer-2 transactions like Polygon transaction on Ethereum significantly cheaper and faster. But both updates were postponed to make sure ETH withdrawals could debut by March.\n\nWhile the world is going nuts about ChatGPT, #GenerativeAI is taking a new leap #onPolygon \ud83e\udd2f@real_alethea and Polygon have launched the world's 1\ufe0f\u20e3st AI Collectibles campaign \ud83e\udd16#AI launching on #Web3?\n\nWhaaaaa?! \ud83e\udd29https://t.co/VXjtO467j2 \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) January 19, 2023\n\nHowever, cheaper and faster transactions on Polygon will attract more users to Polygon and translate into price action. But Ethereum developers have not announced any date about this upgrade yet. Except that it should take place in March.\n\nPros Ethereum VS Polygon\n\nIf we look at the pros of each chain, we see an interesting development. On one side, Ethereum has the most devs and highest TVL of all chains. 60% of all chains, compared to 2.59% on Polygon. That\u2019s $26.7 billion compared to $1.15 billion.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, we see Polygon with fast and cheap transactions. The other day I wanted to buy a $15 NFT on OpenSea on Ethereum, with $11 gas fees. I\u2019m like, \u2018really\u2019? So, it\u2019s no surprise that Polygon has the full support of the Ethereum community. Ethereum has a lot of institutional demand. That\u2019s not bad at all, since that\u2019s where a lot of money is at. As a result, this has a positive effect on the price of ETH. For example:\n\nZK solutions\n\nOptimism\n\nLayer 2 and Layer 3 solutions building on Ethereum. Layer 2 deals with scalability and cheap & fast transactions. The layer 3 chains deal with interoperability. The IBC on Cosmos or Quant are samples of layer 3.\n\nPolygon vs. Ethereum, which is better for NFTs? \ud83e\udd4a Here's a side-by-side comparison of their TVL, consensus mechanism, transaction per second, gas fees and tokenomics! \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/QcMR6ls4bR \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 21, 2023\n\nOn Polygon, we see mostly retail demand. However, their list of Web2 partnerships is impressive. They partnered recently with seemingly every big name in the Web2 world. They all want an entrance into Web3, and choose Polygon for this. For example:\n\nDisney\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe NFL\n\nAdidas\n\nStripe\n\nOr Meta\n\nIf you are keen to know more about Polygon in detail, I recently did a deep dive video. It tells you all about the ZKs and rollups and about their partnerships. Coming back to the point and comparing the upcoming narrative.\n\nComparing the Upcoming Narratives\n\nOn the narratives, we see that Ethereum\u2019s staking is very successful. Although you need to invest 32 ETH to become a validator, many people simply delegate their ETH. In other words, they hand over their ETH to a validator. Yield is around 4% in average.\n\nSoon, you will be able to unlock your staked ETH, with the Shanghai update. This is due in March 2023. Currently, holders stake over 16 million ETH. The withdrawal option for ETH is the main narrative for the Shanghai update.\n\nEthereum also turned deflationary after the Merge. Shortly after the Merge, the circulating supply of ETH is declining. This is due to a new burning mechanism of fees. Now let\u2019s have a look at Polygon. 5 They just completed a hard fork on 17th January. This took care of gas fee spikes. It also reduced the time for making a new block. In other words, transaction finality improves.\n\nFurthermore, Polygon is a prime mover with ZK solutions. This is a technology that improves scalability. Ethereum has a TPS (transactions per second) of 11-15. ZK rollups can change that to up to 5000 TPS or more. Polygon also has the zkEVM Rollups coming. This is the first ZK technology that is completely compatible with Ethereum. It will reduce transaction costs even more and allow for higher throughput. Being Layer 2, it\u2019s built on top of Ethereum. As a result, it benefits from Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nPolygon zkEVM: Now with more throughput and less latency. But how? Recursion makes proofs smaller. Aggregation makes them correct. Batches of proofs are also 150% larger. pic.twitter.com/3Hi9H2uasT \u2014 Polygon ZK (@0xPolygonZK) January 13, 2023\n\nDemand Drivers and Buy Walls\n\nEthereum attracts mostly institutional demand. Both from Web2 and Web3. On the other hand, Polygon is more for retailers. They attract some Web2 institutions, however, not as constant investments.\n\nWe also see a strong ETF demand for ETH. That\u2019s an exchange-traded funds. In other words, you can trade in BTC or ETH on a traditional exchange. So, you don\u2019t have to go through a crypto exchange. Ethereum also offers a multitude of Layer 2 and ZK solutions. Companies and firms will also put Ethereum in their balance sheets.\n\nThe number of dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem is great, with around, 3750 dApps. However, Polygon hosts no less than 53,000 dApps. The ETH gas fee will remain high, and people will see Polygon\u2019s gas as a perfect alternative.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nSo, with all the information at hand, many expect that Polygon might take this one. However, I\u2019m going to give you a potentially less popular opinion. I think that Ethereum will outperform Polygon. And here\u2019s why, for example:\n\nThe deflationary dynamics and buy walls ensure ETH dominance over Polygon. Buy walls are when a large group of traders, sometimes whales, try to control an asset\u2019s price. This will, of course, suit their best interest.\n\nWe also see rising competition in L1 space, which is not benefiting Polygon in the long run:\n\nETH and 3 BTC are down 69%.\n\nMATIC is down 67.5% from its ATH.\n\nIt is a clear sign that Polygon is overvalued at this price for a bear market entry. It\u2019s best to accumulate Polygon in the range of $0.5-0.7 and ETH in the $900-1k range.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "content": "Ethereum price has finally recorded some pullback after a 40% rally in January, giving investors an opportunity to buy ETH at lower levels. The ETH price hit a high of $1,674 last Saturday and fell under $1,550 today due to profit-taking by traders as the rally had no significant pullback.\n\nWhile investors speculate whether this is the best level to buy Ethereum, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes there\u2019s more to it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Can Fall To $1,450\n\nPopular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe in a tweet on January 25 predicts a further fall in the Ethereum price to near $1,450. He believes Ethereum price may witness some rebound from the crucial support level of $1,550, but the actual bounce for another rally will come only from below the crucial support level.\n\n\u201cSome slow grind upwards and then one more sweep in the coming days and the correction should be over and we\u2019ll continue the party.\u201d\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell nearly 5% in the last 24 hours to hit a low of $1,530. Profit booking by traders and selloff by whales were the primary reasons behind the recent fall in ETH prices.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert data, a whale dumped 24,768 ETH worth $38 million to crypto exchange Coinbase today. Whales had transferred ETH worth almost $200 million to crypto exchanges and liquidity pools in the last few days.\n\nOn-chain data by Santiment confirms profit-taking transactions since Ethereum hit a high of $1,674. The Ethereum Ratio of Daily On-Chain Transaction Volume in Profit to Loss jumps higher on January 20 indicating a rise in profit-taking transactions.\n\nMoreover, the social dominance of Ethereum has hit its highest value since July last year after the price drop, indicating traders looking for a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nEthereum Price Shows Slight Recovery\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell over 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,553. The 24-hour low and high are $1,530 and $1,637, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume increased by 14% after the fall, indicating a slight increase in interest among traders.\n\nHowever, ETH price will remain under pressure until the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2018s rate hike decision on February 1 and the fourth-quarter GDP data due on Thursday.\n\nAlso Read: Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally Is Likely Over"

        "content": "Top NFT Collections Fear Return of High Gas Fees and Look to Layer 1s\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nNFT News\n\nDespite Ethereum being the birth-place of NFTs, some of the network\u2019s most popular NFT communities are expanding onto alternative Layer 1 blockchains. The reason? The threat Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees may return.\n\nOn Thursday, Pudgy Penguins and Doodles both announced they will expand beyond Ethereum. Pudgy Penguins launched cross-chain bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain, while Doodles announced its new Doodles 2 project will live on the Flow blockchain.\n\nCore Motivation\n\nBoth teams said securing low gas fees for their users was a core motivation behind exploring other alternative smart contract chains. Pudgy Penguins warned that with less than 2M transactions currently processed by Ethereum daily, a surge in on-chain activity could drive gas fees up by \u201c1,000% or more\n\nThe 2021 NFT boom was a major source of congestion for the Ethereum network, with average transaction fees for simple transactions spiking above $50 while complex smart contract interactions cost hundreds of dollars in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, average Ethereum transaction fees fell 93.5% from $63 in November 2021 to just $4 today.\n\nDespite leading players in the NFT sector making significant gas fee optimizations in 2022 and on-chain activity remaining low during recent months, the moves from Pudgy Penguins and Doodles to explore alternative chains suggests many developers are bracing for the possibility that Ethereum fees could soon spike again.\n\nNFT Provenance\n\n\u201cEthereum is an ideal base chain for preserving your NFT\u2019s provenance over time,\u201d Pudgy Penguins said in a blog post. \u201cHowever, Ethereum mainnet\u2019s user experience is not as friendly as it could be for people new to the technology.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins teamed up with Layer Zero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, to launch its bridge.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The team said it chose Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain for its first multi-chain foray due to their \u201crapidly growing usage and exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be easy for the next wave of users, that are in the hundreds of millions, to interact and become a part of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem,\u201d the team said. \u201cBy enabling the Lil Pudgys to go cross-chain, we\u2019re setting up the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem to reach millions of people.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins has a market cap of $77.2M, according to NFT Floor Price. Its floor price is $8,710, a 246% gain in two months.\n\nAlso on Jan. 25, Doodles, a popular PFP avatar collection limited to 10,000 NFTs, announced it will launch Doodles 2 on Flow.\n\nDoodles 2 will allow users to customize their NFT. After minting a base-level doodle and selecting traits such as skin tone and hair color, holders can then customize their NFT with digital wearables such as clothing, accessories, and gadgets of \u201cvarying tiers and rarity.\u201d\n\nSpace Doodle\n\n\u201cIn 2023, we\u2019re opening the gates so Doodles can live everywhere,\u201d Doodles tweeted. \u201cThanks to Flow\u2019s nonexistent gas fees, Doodles holders can enjoy endless customization to create their own uniquely personalized characters.\u201d\n\nDoodles said it will mint the first digital wearables for the new project on Jan. 31. The team hinted that a second set of wearables will be launched roughly one month later.\n\nUnannounced Experiences\n\nDoodles 2 wearables buyers will also receive \u201cDoodles 2 Beta Passes\u201d granting access to the project\u2019s private beta launch.\n\nThe team said it will continue to invest in its Ethereum-based ecosystem, including upcoming \u201cunannounced experiences\u201d it plans to launch on the chain.\n\nDoodles is the 14th largest NFT collection by market cap with $114.7M, according to NFT Price Floor.

What effects could these developments have on the network and ETH?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA Fork before the Fork\n\nAn Ethereum engineer named Marius Van Der Wijden announced the Mainnet Shadow Fork on 23 January. Wijden planned to introduce rogue nodes into the testnet that would send out faulty blocks and messages to trick other nodes into joining a phony fork of the network.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing ???

Ethereum employed multiple shadow forks for testing.\n\nVitalik going stealth\n\nEthereum\u2019s founder and current CEO, Vitalik Buterin, also proposed the implementation of a feature he named \u201cStealth Addresses.\u201d In an article, while highlighting the difficulty of ensuring privacy in the ecosystem, Buterin stated:\n\n\u201cFixing this state of affairs is a serious topic.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Stealth Addresses would be a way to conceal the true ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and domain names registered using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Stealth addresses are created by wallets, which scramble public key addresses for anonymous transactions. A unique \u201cspending key\u201d key is required to access these incognito exchanges.\n\nIf the Dev team\u2019s shadow fork turned out to be successful, users could withdraw their staked ETH without fear of the network being compromised. The lack of privacy concerns on the Ethereum network might also be solved if Vitalik\u2019s suggested stealth address could be deployed. If these updates increase the network\u2019s popularity, ETH\u2019s value may rise.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nDevelopment activity decent, but price drops\n\nThe Development Activity indicator on Santiment could be used to get an idea of how busy the developers are. As of this writing, the Metric indicated that developer input had nearly reached 50. As the Shanghai update approaches, this may very well climb further.\n\nOn the daily timescale chart, Ethereum traded at about $1,618. In addition, the price continued, the little decline it had been experiencing over the previous 48 hours -until press time \u2013 by dropping by almost.50%.\n\nHowever, it was apparent that the price action was higher than the long and short Moving Averages (blue and yellow lines). The support level was also shown by the yellow and blue lines."

        "title": "Ethereum NFT Hit Doodles Will Launch Doodles 2 on Flow Blockchain - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDoodles is one of the most prominent Ethereum NFT projects around, with colorful profile pictures (PFPs) that stand out on social media, more than $550 million in trading volume to date, and musician Pharrell Williams as its chief brand officer.\n\nBut for its next big drop, Doodles is heading to the Flow blockchain.\n\nToday, Doodles announced that its upcoming larger-scale Doodles 2 project will launch on Flow, the Web3 platform best known for sports NFT projects like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDoodles 2 was first announced last June at an NFT NYC event. It retains the pastel, cartoonish style of the original series and artist Scott \u201cBurnt Toast\u201d Martin, but is said to span millions of NFTs instead of the 10,000 avatars in the first Doodles series.\n\nIt will also let NFT holders endlessly customize their characters for use in games, on social media, and elsewhere. Owners of Doodles 2 NFTs will be able to personalize the look of their avatars, including the body, apparel, expression, and accessories.\n\nDoodles will release digital wearable items for the NFT avatars \u201cvia limited-edition IRL drops tied to specific events and brand collaborations,\u201d it said in a press release, with the items then tradeable on the Gaia marketplace on Flow.\n\nAt NFT NYC, the team said that Doodles 2 would launch on a different blockchain platform than Ethereum due to the customization element, as Ethereum mainnet transactions can carry expensive network gas fees. Some in the NFT space had speculated it would be Solana, or perhaps Polygon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlow is an unexpected pick, and a coup for Flow creator Dapper Labs. Doodles will be the first high-profile NFT project to start on Ethereum and shift over to Flow, which has seen dwindling NFT activity in recent months as its token price has fallen sharply. Dapper Labs laid off 22% of its team in November amid broader NFT market slowdown.\n\nIn its announcement today, Doodles said that the Flow launch will \u201cmark the start of a future of strong cross-interoperability with Ethereum.\" The launch of Doodles 2 NFTs will be tied to the existing Dooplicator NFTs on Ethereum that were offered free to existing Doodles NFT holders last June.\n\nA Doodles representative told Decrypt that Flow blockchain developers helped create an app-specific bridge for the project that lets NFT holders use their Doodles characters across the chains. If a collector connects an Ethereum wallet that holds both a Doodles NFT and Dooplicator NFT, then they can use the Dooplicator to create wearable customizations on Flow.\n\nThe bridge app will then prompt the user to connect a Dapper wallet on Flow to receive the wearables. The Doodles 2 rollout will begin on January 31 for existing Doodles NFT holders, the team said, with additional details to follow before then.\n\nInterestingly, Dapper Labs helped create Ethereum\u2019s NFT standard back in 2017, and its project CryptoKitties nearly took down the network as users flocked to collect and trade digital cats. Dapper decided to create its own blockchain platform as a result, and said in 2020 that it would also bridge CryptoKitties from Ethereum to Flow\u2014but that still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nDoodles was valued at $704 million in September when it announced a $54 million fundraise led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six firm, with participation from 10T Holdings, Acrew Capital, and the now-shuttered FTX Ventures.\n\nOn Monday, Doodles announced the acquisition of animation studio Golden Wolf, which has worked on projects for Disney, Adidas, Adult Swim, Nike, and PlayStation, among other brands. Golden Wolf previously produced the Doodles 2 animated teaser seen above.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has proposed a potential solution to the issue of privacy on Ethereum, which he considers to be the most significant remaining challenge for the platform.\n\n\n\nIn a blog post, Buterin acknowledged the need to develop a privacy solution because, by default, all information recorded on a public blockchain is publicly accessible.\n\nButerin suggested the idea of \"stealth addresses\" as a way to potentially anonymize various types of transactions on Ethereum, such as peer-to-peer transactions, non-fungible token transfers and Ethereum Name Service registrations, thus providing privacy to the users.\n\n\n\n\n\nButerin, in the blog post, explained how transactions on Ethereum can be made anonymously between two parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process starts with the recipient generating and keeping a \"spending key\", which is then used to create a \"stealth meta-address.\" This meta-address is then given to the sender, who uses it to perform a computation and generate a \"stealth address\" that is of the receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sender then transfers assets to the receiver's stealth address and publishes a temporary key to make sure that the stealth address belongs to the receiver. This results in a new stealth address being generated for each new transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nButerin noted that to ensure the link between the stealth address and the user's meta-address is not publicly visible, a \"Diffie-Hellman key exchange\" and a \"key blinding mechanism\" must be implemented. He also added that a technology called ZK-SNARKs, which is a cryptographic-proof technology with built-in privacy features, could be used to transfer funds to pay for transaction fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Buterin pointed out that this solution may have its own drawbacks in the short term, as it would cost a lot of gas, potentially adding hundreds of thousands of gas to the cost of a single transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of stealth addresses has been proposed as a solution for on-chain privacy issues on Ethereum for several years, but few solutions have been implemented so far. This is not the first time that Buterin has discussed the use of stealth addresses in Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, he described stealth addresses as a low-tech solution for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is a brokerage organization whose objective is to keep an eye on the cheap cost, brilliant transactions, and the maker\u2019s access. The users can trade bitcoins through the platform website . Along with other options like stock, bonds, FX, and funds on more than 135 marketplaces. Moreover, this firm allows users to analyze the lines with the help of socially responsible investment (SRI). Recently, these brokers added some new features, making crypto funds part of their trading platform, which is an excellent thing in the world of crypto exchange.\n\nIn this blog, we are going to discuss the interactive broker from its functionality to accessibility, so don\u2019t leave it in the midst; read the blog thoroughly.

        "content": "The broader crypto market is off to a good start in 2023, and Ethereum has been enjoying a smooth uptrend with the rest of the community. There are multiple factors behind Ethereum\u2019s growth at the moment, including ETH\u2019s increased burn rate and a clear growth of ETH address balances.\n\nHowever, one of the main driving forces behind ETH\u2019s momentum over the last few weeks is the blockchain\u2019s upcoming Shanghai Upgrade. This update will allow users to withdraw their staked ETH and their respective staking rewards, which have been locked on the protocol since 2020.\n\nTo reach this goal without any hiccups, Ethereum recently implemented the \u2018Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u2019 In this article, we will discuss what this shadow fork is and how it will help Ethereum realise one of its biggest updates since the Merge in 2022.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s mainnet shadow fork?\n\nOn January 23, Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden announced the successful launch of the \u2018Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u2019 The shadow fork will allow developers to test the waters before the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. The trial environment is a fork of the mainnet and is only used for testing the network; it is not a parallel or a separate blockchain.\n\nMainnet shadow forks are conducted as previews or rehearsals of upcoming upgrades. They allow the developers to identify any flaws or glitches and resolve them before the upgrade is implemented. As such, Ethereum\u2019s shadow fork will help developers determine the preparedness of the ETH staking withdrawal feature.\n\nAccording to Wijden\u2019s tweet, the shadow fork was taken live successfully after ironing out a couple of glitches. \u201cWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalising. It started with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly, and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,\u201d wrote Wijden.\n\nAmong many things other things, Ethereum core developers Van Der Wijden and Potuz will be creating malicious nodes that will try to convince other nodes on the network to follow a false iteration of the blockchain. The purpose or objective is to see if malicious entities can threaten or harm the network during the upgrade or after it.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is the first major upgrade to be implemented on the blockchain since the iconic Ethereum Merge which took place in September 2022. The Merge saw Ethereum transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The transition enabled users to stake their ETH and earn the rights of validating transactions on the blockchain. In exchange for that, the users will be rewarded with freshly minted ETH.\n\nHowever, users can only withdraw their staked and rewarded ETH once the Shanghai upgrade is completed. Therefore, testing the upgrade is incredibly essential, especially with more than $26 billion worth of tokens currently staked on Ethereum.\n\nConclusion"

        "title": "How to Use the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "How to Use the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum?\n\nAs we move further towards a multi-chain ecosystem, bridging tokens between different blockchain platforms is becoming an increasingly common task. One of the platforms you\u2019re most likely going to be bridging to is Arbitrum, a layer 2 that functions on top of Ethereum. The reason why you\u2019ll likely want to bridge your crypto to Arbitrum is because the platform offers much lower fees and faster transactions.\n\nBridging tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum is a simple process, although there are some details you have to look out for. In this article, we\u2019ll be demonstrating how to add Arbitrum to your MetaMask wallet and showing you how to use the Arbitrum bridge to transfer your ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\nBefore we get started with bridging ETH to Arbitrum, let\u2019s do a quick refresher on what Arbitrum actually is.\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a layer 2 platform providing a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum. Transactions made on Arbitrum are executed off-chain for better performance, but get posted on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of rollups. More specifically, the scaling technique underpinning Arbitrum is called optimistic rollups.\n\nThe Arbitrum mainnet was launched in September 2021, and is currently going through a gradual launch. The Arbitrum platform is not yet fully decentralized, as it relies on a permissioned set of validators at the moment. The plan is to gradually decentralize Arbitrum over time if the platform proves itself to be reliable and working as expected.\n\nHowever, developers are already able to deploy fully-fledged decentralized applications on Arbitrum with the same smart contract functionality that\u2019s available on the Ethereum mainnet. In fact, you can use decentralized applications on Arbitrum right now to save on transaction fees.\n\nThe Arbitrum project is being developed by a company called Offchain Labs. The two main products they are working on are Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. To avoid any confusion, we should note that the layer 2 platform that we are referring to throughout this article is technically called Arbitrum One. However, we\u2019ll just be calling it \u201cArbitrum\u201d, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s broadly referred to in the crypto community.\n\nWhy would you want to bridge to Arbitrum?\n\nLow fees and fast transactions\n\nThe main reason to use Arbitrum is to benefit from faster transactions and lower fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Arbitrum is fully compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which means that any smart contract that can be deployed on Ethereum can also be deployed on Arbitrum.\n\nThe number of unique addresses on Arbitrum has been growing rapidly. Image source: Arbiscan\n\nAt the time of writing, sending ETH on Arbitrum will cost you about $0.05 per transaction, compared to $0.75 on Ethereum. The savings are even more impressive when it comes to swapping tokens. A token swap on Arbitrum currently costs about $0.13 in fees, compared to $3.74 on Ethereum.\n\nSo, if you plan to do a lot of ETH transactions or make multiple token swaps, Arbitrum is definitely worth considering. The decentralized application ecosystem on Arbitrum is quite impressive as well, as you can find popular protocols such as Uniswap, Aave, 1inch, Curve and many others on Arbitrum.\n\nThere\u2019s also some decentralized applications that are available on Arbitrum, but not the Ethereum mainnet. One such example is GMX, a popular decentralized derivatives exchange.\n\nYou might get an airdrop in the future\n\nA less obvious reason why you would want to use Arbitrum is the possibility of a future Arbitrum airdrop. The Arbitrum platform doesn\u2019t have its own token, which is why many members of the crypto community are speculating that an Arbitrum token might be launched in the future.\n\nIf an Arbitrum token launch does happen in the future, there\u2019s a decent chance that it would be distributed through a \u201cretroactive airdrop\u201d, where a snapshot of past transactions on Arbitrum would be used to distribute tokens to users.\n\nSo, if you use the Arbitrum platform today, there\u2019s a chance that you could get free tokens in the future if there is an Arbitrum airdrop. Please keep in mind that this scenario is purely speculative, as the Arbitrum project hasn\u2019t actually announced any plans to launch an Arbitrum token.\n\nHow to move ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum\n\nNow, we\u2019ll show you how to move ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum using the Arbitrum bridge.\n\nStep 1: Add Arbitrum to MetaMask\n\nBefore you can get started with using Arbitrum, you should set up your cryptocurrency wallet to support the Arbitrum network. We recommend using MetaMask, as it provides a convenient way to store your crypto in a non-custodial manner. Adding Arbitrum to MetaMask is easy, and we\u2019ll show you exactly how to do it.\n\nThe easiest way to connect your MetaMask wallet to Arbitrum is to simply go to the Arbitrum Bridge website at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ and select \u201cArbitrum One\u201d in the dropdown menu. This will automatically prompt your MetaMask wallet to ask you if you wish to connect to Arbitrum.\n\nAs you can see, all the necessary information is already filled in. After clicking \u201cApprove\u201d, you will be prompted to switch the current network your MetaMask is connected to from Ethereum to Arbitrum. You can of course switch your MetaMask back to Ethereum any time you like.\n\nYou can also connect MetaMask to Arbitrum manually\n\nYou can also connect your MetaMask wallet to Arbitrum manually, if you wish. Click on your profile picture in your MetaMask wallet, and select \u201cSettings\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201cSettings\u201d menu, choose \u201cNetworks\u201d and then click \u201cAdd Network\u201d. Choose \u201cAdd network manually\u201d.\n\nHere are the details you need to connect your MetaMask to Arbitrum:\n\nNetwork Name: Arbitrum One\n\nNew RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc\n\nChain ID: 42161\n\nCurrency symbol: ETH\n\nBlock explorer URL: https://arbiscan.io\n\nStep 2: Bridge tokens\n\nOnce your MetaMask is set up to use the Arbitrum network, you\u2019re ready to bridge ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\nNote: Moving ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum is fast. However, ETH withdrawals from Arbitrum back to the Ethereum network take approximately 7 days to finalize. Please keep this in mind any time you\u2019re bridging funds.\n\nHead over to the Arbitrum bridge at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/.\n\nMake sure that the \u201cFrom\u201d network is \u201cMainnet\u201d and the \u201cTo\u201d network is \u201cArbitrum One\u201d. Input the amount of ETH that you want to bridge over to Arbitrum. Make sure to consider the gas fee ($2.13 in our example) before approving the transaction.\n\nIf everything looks good to go, click \u201cMove funds to Arbitrum One\u201d.\n\nYour MetaMask wallet will pop up with the details of the transaction. If everything checks out, press \u201cConfirm\u201d to continue.\n\nAfter clicking \u201cConfirm\u201d, the Arbitrum bridge website will notify you that the bridging transaction is currently taking place, and will provide you with an estimate of how long it will take.\n\nOnce the bridging is complete, you\u2019ll be able to use Arbitrum-based decentralized applications with the ETH that you just transferred over. You can use the Arbiscan block explorer to view transactions on the Arbitrum network.\n\nYou can also get ETH to Arbitrum through centralized crypto exchanges\n\nAbove, we showed you how to get funds to Arbitrum using your own wallet. However, there\u2019s also an alternative method available. Some centralized exchanges have added support for the Arbitrum network, allowing users to withdraw funds from the exchange directly to Arbitrum.\n\nSome examples of exchanges that support withdrawals to Arbitrum include:\n\nIf you have ETH on any of these exchanges, you can withdraw it directly to Arbitrum if you wish to do so. Of course, you will also need to set up a wallet for the Arbitrum network beforehand in order to receive the funds and actually use Arbitrum.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014Moving ETH to Arbitrum will allow you to enjoy fast and cheap transactions\n\nBy using the Arbitrum bridge, you can easily move ETH from the Ethereum mainnet over to the Arbitrum layer 2. This will enable you to utilize decentralized applications on the Arbitrum network with much lower transaction costs than what you would have been paying on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nYou can bridge your ETH over to Arbitrum directly with your wallet, or use a centralized exchange that allows you to withdraw ETH to Arbitrum directly. Many leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, now support this feature.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Arbitrum and the chances of an Arbitrum token being released in the future, check out our article that will tell you everything you need to know about the potential Arbitrum airdrop."

        "content": "2022 was a year of bloodied crypto markets that had exchanges and investors alike mopping up investment losses. Many large crypto-currencies lost their fair share in value. The global crypto-industry had to contend with tighter wallets from investors on account of inflation and federal rate hikes.\n\nApart from macro trends, a singular event but just as bad for crypto-markets was the downfall of the second largest crypto-exchange, FTX. While this caught the attention of news portals and social media, this was not the first crypto firm to go in 2022.\n\nBefore FTX, many others called it quits due to poor collateral value or questionable investment practices. Some of these firms were Voyager Capital, Celsius, 3AC etc. Their losses were in the hundreds of millions.\n\nAccording to CNBC sources, these coins fell hard in their value:\n\nTerra: -100%\n\nSolana: -93%\n\nAMP: -93%\n\nCardano: -80%\n\nEther: -67%\n\nBitcoin: -63%\n\nDogecoin: -55%\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost. 2023 holds promise with coins like Bitcoin and Ethererum showing an upward tick in their prices.\n\nThe current price of Ethererum is $1636, an increase of 37% from $1195 at the start of the year (Jan 1st, 2023). Bitcoin is up 39% and fixed at a current price of $23,059.62. Both cryptos were tied through correlation in 2022 and seem to be now as well, which means if Bitcoin goes up, Ethereum goes up as well.\n\nThis positive trend may have extended to other cryptocurrencies as well. Solana has increased in price but most of the established coins in the market remain well below their previous peaks.\n\nNew meme coin offers a potential investment to crypto-enthusiasts\n\nShiba Inu was recently delisted in trading pairs from Binance. Perhaps Big Eyes Coin, a new and popular meme coin, can interest old and new crypto-investors alike.\n\nBig Eyes is a new community meme coin that is devoted to increasing the wealth of its members. It is not entirely profit based. Big Eyes has a humanitarian mission as well: saving the oceans and all its swimming inhabitants. According to its whitepaper, a charity wallet holding 5% of tokens will be held in place for donations to humanitarian organizations. Another 5% will be kept aside for marketing, an overhead expense necessary to keep Big Eyes company operations running.\n\nNFTs will be a huge part of this coin\u2019s offerings and gifted to anyone who joins as a community member. The cat friendly coin will have a supply of 200 billion tokens and 80% of the total supply will be available at launch.\n\nThe presale of the token has raised $17.44 million so far from investors, large enough to hint at possible upside to anyone who buys the token.\n\nFor All Things Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: This article is not investment advice.

        "content": "Aave Stablecoin Expected to Boost Revenue\n\nBy: Aleksandar Gilbert \u2022 Loading...\n\nThe Defiant Interview\n\nAave, the largest decentralized lending protocol, is expected to launch on Friday the latest version of its software on Ethereum, a move that will pave the way for its stablecoin, GHO.\n\nAAVE token holders must approve the move in a vote that ends Wednesday at 5 p.m. New York time, though the measure is expected to pass. Fewer than a tenth of one percent of votes cast were in opposition on Tuesday evening.\n\nKuchelov Interview\n\nIn an interview with The Defiant, Aave founder Stani Kuchelov said GHO would be released \u201cin weeks,\u201d but declined to get more specific. While GHO is widely anticipated and expected to provide a substantial boost to Aave revenue in the coming years, it\u2019s just one of several benefits promised in the protocol\u2019s latest software release.\n\nThe software, dubbed V3, has existed on other blockchains for almost a year. With more than $5.5B in total value locked, Aave\u2019s lending pool on Ethereum is by far its largest. Kuchelov expects all of the liquidity on Aave\u2019s existing Ethereum lending pools to move to V3 over time, as users take advantage of its improvements in capital efficiency and risk mitigation.\n\nWhat Is Aave? A Step-by-Step Guide to the DeFi Lender\n\nIn the world of decentralized lending, most loans are over-collateralized \u2014 the value of the collateral used to take out a crypto loan is greater than the value of the borrowed crypto. This protects the borrower from going into the red should their collateral drop in value, a real possibility in the volatile world of digital assets.\n\nAn \u201cefficiency mode\u201d in V3 will offer a better loan-to-value ratio when borrowing assets correlated with their collateral, such as pairs of stablecoins, or Ether and its liquid staking derivatives.\n\nVolume\n\n\u201cIt actually enables a very efficient way to do [foreign exchange] trading,\u201d Kuchelov said, such as borrowing Euro-pegged stablecoins against dollar-pegged stablecoins to take long or short positions on the market. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of volume of FX trading, and obviously that volume could actually be on-chain. \u2026 That\u2019s something that we\u2019re betting on quite a lot.\u201d\n\nAnother feature, \u201cportal,\u201d will allow users to move liquidity across Aave\u2019s several blockchains, by allowing them to mint unbacked assets in a \u201cdestination chain,\u201d and then back them later through the liquidity that you have on your source network, according to Kuchelov.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

There\u2019s a lot of volume of FX trading, and obviously that volume could actually be on-chain. \u2026 That\u2019s something that we\u2019re betting on quite a lot.\n\n\n\nStani Kuchelov\n\n\u201cMost of the value is stored, more or less, in lending protocols,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best place to transfer value between networks.\u201d\n\nRegarding safety, V3 will allow users to lend and borrow a wider range of tokens, with risk mitigation features meant to protect the wider protocol from the volatility of less liquid assets.\n\nBattle-Tested\n\nThose and other safety features will allow GHO to better hold its peg than it could on V2, Kuchelov said.\n\nThe founder expects token holders to approve V3 deployment, given its history on other blockchains, such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s battle-tested,\u201d he said. \u201cV3 is pretty much[an evolution of the previous version \u2026 [a] state of the art liquidity protocol.\u201d\n\nAave was down 8% in the preceding 24 hours early Wednesday morning, according to data from The Defiant Terminal."

        "content": "The count of validators running the PoS network has exceeded 500,000.\n\nAs the market corrects, ETH\u2019s price has fallen by 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe number of validators on the Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake network surpassed 500,000, according to data from Glassnode. This milestone comes ahead of the scheduled upgrade for the Shanghai network, set to take place at the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThere are now over 503k active Proof-of-Stake Validators on the #Ethereum beacon chain. The total number of new, or exiting validators is capped each day, depending on the validator pool size. The current limit is 1575 validators/day. ? Live Dashboard: https://t.co/bsdjS0vv0Q pic.twitter.com/lijbqXNMXM \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain data provider, the number of validators on the PoS chain grew by 76% on a year-over-year basis. Since the Merge on 15 September 2022, this has increased by about 20%.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nThose looking tp become a validator on the Ethereum PoS network need to deposit 32 ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 contract. As of this writing, the total number of ETH deposited into this contract by validators running the network was 16.23 million ETH, per data from Glassnode.\n\nThis represented 13% of the altcoin\u2019s current circulating supply of 120.53 million ETH. With more validators joining the network, the total value of ETH deposited into the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract grew by 78% in the last year.\n\nValidators on the Ethereum PoS network are grouped into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator on the committee is responsible for producing blocks for each 12-second slot.\n\nThese validators are automatically organized into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator in a committee is charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot. However, if the assigned validator is unavailable, it results in a missed block.\n\nFUD overruns the market\n\nData from Glassnode revealed that the number of missed blocks on the PoS network has decreased by 90% since its daily peak of 259 missed blocks on 6 September, 2022. In the last year, this fell by 54%.\n\nFurther, to ensure that the PoS network runs optimally, there has to be a high degree of participation by validators on the network. According to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates a reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior block space efficiency.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nSince the temporary slip of participation rate on the network to 97% on 7 December 2022, it regained its spot at 99%, where it sat at the time of writing. This meant that almost all the network validators were actively participating in the block production process.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, a significant surge in the alt\u2019s social dominance was spotted on-chain. A sudden spike in this metric typically suggests widespread euphoria in the market. This is followed by a decline in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nAmid a market-wide dip, ETH\u2019s price declined by 5% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "How the Porsche NFT Drop Crashed and Burned - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA major player like auto brand Porsche entering the Web3 space is typically a cause for celebration among NFT collectors. However, pre-launch concern quickly evolved into a 1,800-NFT pileup this week when Porsche\u2019s pricey NFT drop fell well short of selling out, forcing the brand to announce plans to shift gears and cut the supply.\n\nPorsche\u2019s project focused on the German automaker\u2019s iconic 911 sports car, with a planned drop of 7,500 Ethereum NFTs that would celebrate the vehicle and allow holders access to events and exclusive merchandise. It would also let crypto-savvy car junkies vaguely \u201chelp design Porsche's future in the virtual world.\u201d\n\nBut buzz around the project took a hard negative turn last Friday when Porsche announced that it would sell the NFTs for 0.911 ETH apiece, or about $1,475 as of this writing. That\u2019s a steep asking price in an NFT market that has lost considerable steam from the heights of early last year, particularly for a project with several thousand such NFTs on offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe backlash from Crypto Twitter was swift and severe. Notable builders and collectors in the space responded calling the move \u201ctone deaf,\u201d \u201cclueless,\u201d and a \u201ccash grab,\u201d as the tweet racked up more than one million impressions primarily through mocking shares.\n\nSome suggested that 0.0911 ETH (about $145) would have made a lot more sense. But Porsche didn\u2019t directly acknowledge the backlash in public, and its plans didn\u2019t change.\n\nSoon after the public mint started on Monday, primary sales slowed to a crawl\u2014and in what\u2019s seen as a death knell for any newly launched project, the NFTs were quickly being resold below the mint price on secondary marketplaces as owners fled the scene. By this morning, only about 1,500 of the NFTs had been minted. Porsche then made its move.\n\n\u201cOur holders have spoken,\u201d the official project account tweeted today. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut our supply and stop the mint to move forward with creating the best experience for an exclusive community. More info in the next hours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is a pristine example of a large brand trying to extract liquidity from the community without onboarding itself into Web3. Porsche had a .911 mint, in a bearmarket, for 7500 pieces. Of course it failed. Next to no marketing, trying to raise on prestige alone. https://t.co/0HFbpxgRDP \u2014 camol (@camolNFT) January 24, 2023\n\nJust over 1,850 NFTs have been minted as of this writing, with the sale now set to end at 6 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The floor price\u2014that is, the cost of the cheapest-listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014has fluctuated, briefly climbing above the 0.911 ETH mark on top marketplace OpenSea but again dropping below. Currently, it sits at 0.905 ETH (about $1,465).\n\nEven the decision to announce plans to kill the mint but not immediately do it was slammed by some. Rug Radio co-CEO Farokh Sarmad called out the project\u2019s Twitter messaging, writing, \u201cWhoever is running @eth_porsche, you're not helping the @Porsche brand and you suck.\u201d\n\nThis mint didn't close and the tweet made people FOMO into minting more NFTs at 0.911 ETH. You can check the chain, but the amount sold is pretty big in the last 2 hours since the tweet. Whoever is running @eth_porsche, you're not helping the @Porsche brand and you suck. https://t.co/RRn4YO8B7e \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) January 24, 2023\n\nPorsche replied to Decrypt's earlier requests for comment on Wednesday, following the end of the public mint and the original publication of this article.\n\n\"The NFT is meant to be a long-term investment. We see a lot of interest in the mint from art lovers and Porsche enthusiasts. Many customers from the Web3 community have obviously held back because direct resale seemed unprofitable due to the customization of the NFT,\" the Porsche representative wrote. \"The size of the community is not decisive for us. What is crucial is that we can offer the community the most exclusive and individual events and utilities possible.\u201d\n\nPorsche is the latest example of a brand endeavor in the Web3 world gone wrong. While some traditional companies have been praised for partnering with existing NFT projects\u2014as Budweiser and Adidas did\u2014or using the tech in ways that aren\u2019t revenue drivers themselves (like Starbucks and Reddit), others have faced considerable criticism\n\nPepsi\u2019s Mic Drop is a notable example\u2014even as a free mint, it was criticized for clunky messaging and strange artwork. A recent Game of Thrones NFT launch was widely mocked for generic, glitchy artwork. And while it ultimately sold out, a Tiffany & Co. NFT drop last year tied to CryptoPunks-themed pendants was criticized for its costly mint price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCelebrity-linked NFT projects have faced similar criticism in the past, whether or not they\u2019ve sold well. Donald Trump\u2019s recent collection, for example, was widely mocked\u2014even by Trump supporters\u2014but ultimately sold out and rose in value. A Michael Jordan-inspired project launched by his son last year on Solana cut its own supply after a slower-than-expected mint.\n\nBroadly, Web3 advocates appear increasingly keen on brands attempting to build in the space by giving away NFTs or making them affordable and accessible. Attempts by established firms and celebrities to simply extract value via high prices and minimal value don\u2019t tend to land well.\n\nPorsche\u2019s drop, to many observers, is yet another example of the latter\u2014and the brand may have learned a tough first lesson in Web3 as it considers a modified path ahead.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to add the comment from Porsche."

        "title": "Top 10 Bitcoin Alternatives One Must Consider in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are 10 bitcoin alternatives that have held on throughout steep price climbs and plunges\n\nBitcoin is a synonym for cryptocurrency. It is single-handedly leading the pack of cryptocurrencies in terms of popularity and market capitalization. But there are many Bitcoin alternatives like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, Binance Coin, and more that can be strong options for diversifying your crypto portfolio. In the ocean of 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s check out the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives you must consider before your next investment:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is Bitcoin\u2019s largest competitor. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it\u2019s also the biggest platform for decentralized applications. The applications on Ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and medium of exchange; Ethereum is seen as a general-purpose blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has marked a milestone as one of the first altcoins that emerged and successfully traded off from bitcoin. The cryptocurrency emerged as a solution to the unsettling issues between bitcoin developers and miners. Bitcoin Cash got split from bitcoin\u2019s chain and created its own path towards adoption and growing market capitalization.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins with a large and active community. Being a deflationary cryptocurrency, it can be good for long-term value growth. At present, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001212, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389,319,671.\n\nDogecoin\n\nOften called a \u2018meme coin,\u2019 dogecoin is the first cryptocurrency that came out from the Shiba Inu joke that trended on the internet years back. After maintaining a low profile for many since its inception in 2013, dogecoin showed its potential in 2020 when it was accepted as a payment model among sports teams and entered the AMC theaters.\n\nSolana\n\nSoaring by more than 11,000% throughout 2021, Solana created history. Although it is trading below its all-time high of $260 in 2022, Solana has outperformed the majority of other cryptocurrencies, which makes it one of the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nTether\n\nTehter is born out as the brainchild of people who thought that the cryptocurrency market was very volatile and unsettling. As the foremost stable coin, the tether is pegged to the US dollar and experiences fewer fluctuations compared to bitcoin. This alone makes the cryptocurrency the best alternative for bitcoin.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple Network is a network that has been developed to provide quick and secure transactions to banks, especially by using blockchain technology. The Ripple system scores better than the bitcoin network for its lower processing times and lower transaction charges.\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBNB is the cryptocurrency promoted by Binance Coin exchange. Unlike bitcoin that just acts as a cryptocurrency, Binance Coin is both a virtual token and a crypto exchange platform that could pump up value based on its market performance. Besides, the platform also incentivizes users with BNB coins over transactions, enhancing the circulation of the token as much as possible.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is one of the most fundamentally strong and best Bitcoin alternatives in the market today. With low transaction fees and continued developments in Cardano\u2019s ecosystem, the coin does have an advantage over both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLitecoin\n\nReferred as the \u2018silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u2019 Litecoin was launched in 2011 with much of its functionalities similar to bitcoin. Litecoin was created by an MIT graduate and former Google engineer, Charlie Lee. With an open-source global payment network, Litecoin can add faster blocks compared to bitcoin, which contributes to its faster transaction time.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "What do a dead racoon, a red fire hydrant and Kate Winslet have in common? The answer isn\u2019t obvious to us either. But now we have your attention it\u2019s time to discuss the large heaving mud sodden elephant in the room \u2013 the current state of crypto. The last 12 months have been tough, they\u2019ve given even the most adept and well researched crypto whale pause for thought.\n\nIn the late 1800\u2019s families travelled across the broad stretch of coarse, unrelenting American dustbowl in search of that rare commodity \u2013 gold. Back breaking work was carried out in order to sift what might only be a few tiny nuggets no bigger than that of a finger nail. Today, mining of crypto exists on a digital plane, the geography and metrics have changed but the ethos and sense that \u2013 for a select and determined few gargantuan gains can be made \u2013 remains the same.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) has so far teased 9 presale stages with growing anticipation and interest. This tiny anime kitten has many in the inner crypto sanctum salivating for its impending arrival. The token boasts strong utility coupled with a bold faced tongue out meme aesthetic and approach. Millennials and Gen Z alike have demonstrated they intend to change the (un)natural order of things\u2026posting a letter? Nope \u2013 social media direct messaging, heavy cumbersome cameras to take pictures \u2013 nah, a smart phone with a megabillion pixel camera will do the job nicely. The point is \u2013 change is upon us. It happens sometimes slowly and incrementally, sometimes with the full force of a wrecking ball rolling through the interior of a museum of historical artefacts..sometimes slow and then very..very.. fast.\n\nBig Eyes is building a loyal community who appreciate its charitable pivot offering 5% of its wallet to causes relating to environmental collapse and marine preservation. This mischievous kitten enjoys her fish, and as such wants to ensure that there is a plentitude of healthy fish in this world.\n\nUnlike Big Eyes two bigger brothers Doge and Shiba Inu, this token is yet to launch meaning its current token price is devastatingly and disgustingly low. This, however won\u2019t be the case for very much longer as the team have announced they\u2019ll be releasing Big Eyes into the world imminently, given they have repeatedly surpassed presale stage targets \u2013 $17.5million so far raised. You\u2019d be foolish to hedge your beds and place some of your capital into what crypto clerks are calling \u2013 \u201cthe 2nd generation of decentralised meme coin with utility\u201d.\n\nThere Is A Light That Never Goes Out \u2013 Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralised blockchain being utilised to both store your money but also in the creation of interesting apps. The crypto currently has a market cap of $154billion. So despite the dip it has been experiencing, its financial stability is of no serious concern. Ethereum has no cap on the number of tokens it can supply hitting 122 million currently, despite this its price is inestimably high.\n\nIf what youre looking for is a little less sweat on the back of your neck and hands that dont feel quite so clammy as the latest market news lands on your phone \u2013 then Ethereum makes total sense. A stable coin, its price isn\u2019t subject to the same bipolar jittery fluctuations that you see with other disposable coins that enter the market hourly.\n\nCommunity built, this team have harnessed the power of decentralisation in the truest sense. From each of the furthest and most far flung corners of the internet enabled world \u2013 kindred souls have been adding to and improving its infrastructure.\n\nEthereums move to a proof of stake merger is now beginning to bear fruit as it launches a tasty and it must be said secretive upgrade to its network known exotically as Shanghai. In the pithiest and simplest sense this upgrade will allow stakers to withdraw their holdings from the network. A big, bold and beautiful move forward.\n\nBit By Bit With Bitcoin\n\nThe macdaddy, the Godfather, the Czar. Bitcoin (BTC) has held the top spot in crypto since records began. Unlikely to be budged, nudged, tripped or surpassed any time soon this decentralised currency offers more than just a glimpse into the future of the financial sector.\n\nA consolidation seems to be underway and all signs and smoke signals suggest if Bitcoin can hold to $23,000 the market will respond generously and we could see its slow and steady escalation back towards its euphoric heights of November 2021 when it hit above $65,000. If however, it dips below $23,000 the market confidence could trigger a domino effect and immediate sell off that could see its value dwindle paving the way for Ethereum to exercise more bolshy market dominance having been seen as the little tike to Bitcoins (BTC) big bully brother for so long.\n\nThe token to keep your eyes on and your wallets aligned with is Big Eyes.
