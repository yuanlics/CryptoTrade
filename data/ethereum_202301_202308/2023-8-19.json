        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the year, Ethereum (ETH 0.59%) is up 45%. While that recent performance is impressive, there are still plenty of skeptics out there. After all, a a recent price of about $1,730, Ethereum is 64% below its all-time high of $4,892 from two years ago, and hasn't had the type of monster rally many investors were expecting when it completed The Merge, a system upgrade, last September.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum is trading at almost exactly the same price it was one year ago. And it has had unexpected difficulty breaking through the $2,000 price level. So is Ethereum undervalued or not? To answer that question, there are three important factors to consider.\n\nInnovation leader\n\nEthereum recently celebrated its eighth birthday, and it's fascinating to look back and see how far Ethereum has come in such a relatively short time. Ethereum has become the de facto benchmark standard that all other Layer-1 blockchains measure themselves against. There have been a large number of blockchains that have attempted to become \"the next Ethereum\" and failed -- and that list includes Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nBy investing in Ethereum, you are investing in the innovation leader with a clear competitive advantage. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts for the blockchain and has consistently been first to market with new innovations. That includes the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), new decentralized finance exchanges, and new gaming and metaverse experiences. Given Ethereum's track record of innovation, I'm confident that there's plenty of upside potential ahead.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nAll of that innovation happening on the Ethereum blockchain means that the size and scope of the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow. Ethereum still has the largest community of blockchain developers in the world, and the number of use cases for Ethereum continues to grow. For example, Wall Street firms are experimenting with Ethereum as a new form of payment network, while manufacturing companies are experimenting with Ethereum's blockchain technology to improve their supply chains.\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum is simply the most diversified crypto that you can own in your portfolio. You're not investing in a one-trick pony, and that is really the key to Ethereum's allure for both retail and institutional investors. That's an important consideration during volatile and uncertain market conditions, when diversification is the key to riding out the tough times.\n\nRoadmap for success\n\nOne other key consideration is that Ethereum has a roadmap for success, so you can see exactly where Ethereum has been, and where it's headed. After The Merge, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled an updated roadmap that includes five new distinct stages, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Even if each of those stages only lasts six months, that's still a three-year strategic vision. If you're a buy-and-hold investor, that's exactly what you want to see: a long-term plan for success.\n\nWhen you dig into the specific milestones on Ethereum's roadmap, that's when things get really interesting. For example, the current phase of development (\"The Surge\") has a goal of boosting Ethereum's transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second. That's blazingly fast speed, even faster than the theoretical maximum speed of the Visa card payment network (65,000 transactions per second). Eventually, says Buterin, the goal is to hit 1 million transactions per second.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nInvesting in crypto can be risky and speculative, and it's no different with Ethereum. So, yes, there's actually quite a bit that could go wrong for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, might decide that Ethereum is actually a security, thereby sending it to crypto purgatory and upending future plans for development. There's also a risk that an upstart \"Ethereum killer\" might truly emerge, dooming Ethereum to the dustbin of history.\n\nBut, as noted above, Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation, growth, and diversification. At recent prices it seems remarkably undervalued. Just two years ago, Ethereum was trading for nearly $5,000. So I'm very confident buying Ethereum now, while it still seems to be trading at a discount. Over the long haul, Ethereum's upside potential is just too high to ignore."

This interoperability expands the potential for collaboration and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Ether\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform, Ether serves as the fuel that powers transactions and operations within the network.\n\nEther stands as a digital asset that is purchasable, tradable, and usable for investment, payments, and exchange trading.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Donald Trump Holds Up To $500k ETH\n\nFunctions and Uses of Ether\n\nPayment Method: Ether is used as a means of payment for on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nWhen users initiate transactions or execute smart contracts on Ethereum, they need to pay gas fees, which are calculated in Ether. These gas fees compensate the network participants, including miners, for their computational resources and effort in securing the blockchain. Investment: Ether can be seen as a digital asset that individuals can invest in for potential capital appreciation. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ether is subject to market fluctuations and can provide opportunities for investors to generate profits.\n\n\n\nYet, remember that engaging in cryptocurrency investments involves risks and requires prudent consideration. Trading: Ether is listed and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade the digital asset. Traders can take advantage of price movements and volatility in the cryptocurrency market to potentially profit from their trading activities. Medium of Exchange: Some merchants and online retailers accept Ether as a form of payment for goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of Ether as a medium of exchange provides an alternative to traditional fiat currency transactions, offering faster and more secure transactions, especially for cross-border payments.\n\nEther vs. Ethereum: The Differences\n\nIt is crucial to understand the distinction between Ethereum and Ether to avoid confusion. Ethereum refers to the blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is the specific cryptocurrency that operates within the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the infrastructure, it also serves as the digital asset and means of value exchange within that infrastructure.\n\nConclusion: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nIn summary, Ethereum and Ether are integral components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but they are not interchangeable terms.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development and deployment of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ether, on the other hand, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as a digital asset and payment method within the ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between Ethereum and Ether is essential for anyone navigating the world of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and participation in this evolving digital landscape."

        "title": "EVM Chains: What Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "EVM Chains are the bread and butter of the crypto space. In select cryptocurrency camps, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is considered a non-negotiable feature that emerging blockchains need to support to stay relevant and attract users.\n\nIf you sort the industry\u2019s blockchains by TVL (Total Value Locked), 9 of the top 10 networks are EVM-compatible, with Solana (SOL) being the only exception to the rule.\n\nWhat exactly is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and why is it so important?\n\nWhat Is the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine is a software environment that executes code and contracts on EVM networks. An easier way to think of it is to imagine a computer\u2019s operating system. Regardless of whether you use an HP or Lenovo laptop, it\u2019s easy to jump between the two because you\u2019re ultimately communicating with the device through a Windows operating system.\n\nLet\u2019s apply this concept to the world of blockchain technology. The Ethereum Virtual Machine means that whether you\u2019re using Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC), things look and feel more or less the same. For example, you don\u2019t need to memorize the Arbitrum (ARB) whitepaper to use crypto wallets like MetaMask or a dex like Uniswap on the Arbitrum network.\n\nIf you\u2019re confident using one EVM Chain, you\u2019re confident using all of them.\n\nHow Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Work?\n\nWhen you look closely at the EVM, you\u2019ll find a complex system that runs tasks consistently. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is deterministic, meaning if you give it a specific task, it will always give the same result, no matter where it\u2019s done or who does it.\n\nThis deterministic nature is crucial for the consensus mechanism of the EVM-based networks, ensuring all nodes harmoniously agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe EVM operates on a unique set of instructions, allowing for the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts. These contracts, written primarily in a programming language called Solidity, are then compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is what the EVM reads, interprets, and executes.\n\nWhen you initiate a smart contract transaction, the EVM springs into action. It processes the transaction, calculates the necessary gas fees, and updates the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nAnother intriguing facet of the EVM is its Turing completeness, meaning it can perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can, provided it\u2019s given enough time and memory.\n\nHow does this benefit the Ethereum blockchain? Well, it means that the EVM can execute any algorithm or program, granting Ethereum its iconic flexibility. This versatility helps developers create innovative smart contracts and Web 3 dApps (decentralized applications) on the Ethereum mainnet and other EVM chains.\n\nWhy Is EVM Compatibility so Important?\n\nIn an industry fraught with interoperability issues and complex bridging processes, EVM chains help to smooth the onboarding process and give users a sense of trust and familiarity with new networks.\n\nEVM compatibility means that a blockchain can run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easy for blockchain developers to port over existing contracts and ERC-20 tokens to a cross-chain environment and deploy crucial dApps, like decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces.\n\nWith the rise of multiple blockchains, each with its unique strengths like faster transactions and lower transaction fees, the ability to communicate and interact between them is of paramount importance. EVM-compatible blockchains integrate more easily than non-EVM chains, enabling assets and data to flow between different chains.\n\nOn top of that, operating an EVM helps emerging chains leverage Ethereum\u2019s existing tools and infrastructure. Being a pioneer in the smart contract space, Ethereum has a rich ecosystem of DApps. EVM compatibility allows other blockchains to tap into this established ecosystem, benefiting from tried-and-tested tools and services without reinventing the wheel.\n\nLooking at competing Layer-1 blockchains that don\u2019t naturally support EVM compatibility, like Cardano (ADA), we see first-hand how difficult it is to onboard new users, especially in DeFi.\n\nDespite Cardano having powerful tech in its own right, the network struggles to attract a user base as large as EVM chains like the BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Cardano developers need to be proficient in the network\u2019s dedicated programming language, Haskell, while all EVM chains use the same languages, like Solidity and Vyper.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between EVM-Equivalence and EVM-Compatibility?\n\nJust when you thought you\u2019d understood everything, there\u2019s another layer of definitions. In today\u2019s rapidly evolving industry, some blockchain ecosystems insist that simply being EVM-compatible is no longer enough. Teams like Polygon aim for EVM equivalence within the Polygon Proof-of-Stake sidechain and zkEVM.\n\nIs there any difference between compatibility and equivalence?\n\nEVM-Compatibility\n\nEVM-Compatibility represents a blockchain\u2019s ability to run the EVM and execute Ethereum-based smart contracts. An EVM-compatible blockchain can seamlessly integrate with Ethereum\u2019s tools, protocols, and standards.\n\nDevelopers can deploy the same smart contracts across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains without major code modifications.\n\nEVM-Equivalence\n\nOn the other hand, EVM-Equivalence is a more profound alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. An EVM-equivalent blockchain not only supports Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts but also mirrors Ethereum\u2019s state, account structures, and consensus mechanisms.\n\nIt\u2019s like a twin of the Ethereum network, sharing its DNA but existing as a separate entity. EVM-equivalent blockchains can synchronize with Ethereum\u2019s state and offer a near-identical environment for dApps and contracts.\n\nWhile EVM-Compatibility offers a bridge to the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for smooth functionality and integration, EVM-Equivalence is like walking in Ethereum\u2019s shoes, mirroring its every step.\n\nExamples Of EVM-Compatible Blockchains\n\nNow that we better understand what EVM Chains are let\u2019s dive into a quick list of the top EVM-compatible blockchains in the crypto industry.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) \u2013 With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain. It introduced thousands of people to DeFi for the first time and was the first major low-cost alternative to Ethereum.\n\n\u2013 With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain.

Celo (CELO) \u2013 Originally designed as a simple payment network, Celo has blossomed into a fully-fledged and functional EVM chain with plenty of dApps and tools for the budding DeFi enthusiast.\n\nEVM Chain Pros and Cons\n\nAfter the invention of Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is arguably the biggest revolution in the blockchain landscape, serving as the backbone for a myriad of decentralized applications and platforms. Of course, it\u2019s not without its faults.\n\nPros\n\nInteroperability \u2013 EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.\n\n\u2013 EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.

Learning Curve \u2013 For newcomers, the Ethereum Virtual Machine can present a steep learning curve, marking it difficult to come to terms with.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile networks like Solana and Cardano don\u2019t natively support EVM-based programs, independent teams have created EVM networks like NEON and Milkomeda that settle transactions on their respective Layer-1.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nIn the current climate of the crypto industry, running an Ethereum Virtual Machine is essential if teams want to bring users to their blockchain. Without being EVM-compatible, the barriers to entry are too inconvenient.\n\nAs we can see, Cardano is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap, but it has far fewer DeFi applications and TVL statistics than relatively unknown EVM-chains like Kava and Pulsechain.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and a co-founder of Ethereum, has a history of teasing Ethereum and its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but now he has stepped things up a notch, it seems. A discussion broke out about which ecosystem is better after a question was posted on \u2018X\u2019 if Cardano would ever be an Ethereum competitor.\n\nOne user said that it was telling that Ethereum had to transition to a 2.0 version of what Cardano already is today. Another argued that Cardano followed Ethereum\u2019s roadmap but was behind by years.\n\nAnd then came along an \u2018X\u2019 user who said he predicted Hoskinson would stop talking about Hydra and look towards things that Ethereum developers are doing, essentially copying from them. He added that Hoskinson would soon say that \u201cOur plan was always that if it works on Ethereum, we can just copy it, and actually, rollups and data availability have always been the future of Cardano too\u201d.\n\nHoskinson on Fire\n\nCharles Hoskinson swallowed the bait and said he felt sorry for people obsessed with their blockchain, saying, \u201cWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them\u201d.\n\nHe reminded the original poster that Hydra, one of the recent improvements to the popular blockchain, is live and evolving rapidly. Additionally, Hoskinson stated that Mithril is now operational, marking the initial move toward an enhanced ADA and light client approach. He explained that innovative transaction methods have been developed, including tiered pricing and Babel fees. Adding that, the concept of a roll-up strategy has been in place since the inception of Midnight four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not only defend Cardano but started to throw punches at Ethereum too, saying: \u201cMeanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNo matter whose side you take, it is clear that Cardano is unfinished, and there is no dispute about that. Cardano\u2019s development runs in stages and is now in the second last stage. While the current stage focuses on scaling and resource use, the final stage will see a fully decentralized community-governed ecosystem. Hoskinson thinks by then, Cardano will serve as a blueprint for other blockchains and be \u201csubstantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on the market\u201d."

News that Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in a Manhattan court prompted institutional investors and big holders to dump riskier assets, like stocks and Bitcoin, causing the sudden drop.\n\nAll told, Bitcoin ends the week at $25,935, posting a seven-day drop of 11.9%.\n\nClosest contender Ethereum (ETH) fared similarly, with an intraweek drop of 10.2% to $1,662.\n\nBroadly speaking, these were some of the lightest price movements. Altcoins generally tumbled harder, with most other leading cryptocurrencies posting losses of between 10% and 20%, including BNB, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLosses of over 20% were felt by holders of Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LTC), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which dropped over 23%.\n\nThe most resilient cryptocurrency in the top twenty by market cap was TRON (TRX), which only fell 4.8% and currently sells for $0.073810.\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nThe regulatory uncertainty around crypto continued apace as the news cycle in the U.S. and beyond gave crypto hopefuls very little to chew on.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2013a leading U.S. bank regulator\u2013dedicated two out of ninety pages to crypto in its annual report. Insignificant as it may seem, this was a first for the FDIC, which used the slim space to point out that crypto may pose \u201cnovel and complex\u201d risks to the financial system.\n\nArgentinian Bitcoin fans enjoyed a different week than the rest of us. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency reached its Argentine all-time-high of 10.2 million Argentine Peso (ARS) on Wednesday, piggybacked by a surprise victory in the country's presidential primaries by hopeful Javier Milei, a professed libertarian known for his pro-Bitcoin stance."

        "content": "An Optimism-based (OP) decentralized credit market protocol has been hacked to the tune of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to the security department of web3 protocol De.Fi, bad actors have stolen about $7.2 million worth of the leading smart contract platform by exploiting Exactly (EXA), an open-source credit market project.\n\n\u201cAfter a thorough review of the Exactly protocol hack, we have concluded that the total of stolen amount up to date is ~$7.2 million (4,323.6 ETH) Eventually, they bridged ~1,490 ETH, using Across Protocol, and 2,832.92 ETH to Ethereum via Optimism Bridge.\u201d\n\nAccording to Exactly, the protocol has been temporarily paused as the issue is investigated, though investors will still be able to withdraw funds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively investigating a security issue within our protocol. To ensure user safety, the protocol is temporarily paused (you can still withdraw assets). Our team is on top of this and will share more details as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBlockchain security firm Beosin explains how the hacker found a way to bypass the protocol\u2019s security measures.\n\n\u201cRoot cause of the Exactly Protocol exploit: the market address in DebtManager contract could be manipulated. The attacker passed in a malicious market contract address, bypassing the permit check, and executed a malicious deposit function to steal the USDC deposited by users. Finally liquidated users\u2019 assets to make a profit.\u201d\n\nNews of the hack had an impact on EXA\u2019s price as the altcoin fell sharply during the last 24 hours.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn an unexpected development, Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking platform, has unveiled that a long-dormant pre-mine Ethereum address, which lay asleep for a staggering 8.1 years, has been reactivated. The address, previously containing 191 Ethereum tokens with a valuation of approximately $317,724, has sprung to life, sending ripples of intrigue across the crypto space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 191 #ETH (317,724 USD) has just been activated after 8.1 years!https://t.co/VJ7RgTzxz3 \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 19, 2023\n\nPre-mining is the practice of mining and distributing cryptocurrencies prior to their official launch. The resurgence of this sleeping whale address marks a rare event, one that last occurred nearly three weeks ago at the close of July. A case in point, an Ethereum ICO participant, who had maintained silence for eight years, orchestrated a substantial transfer of 641 ETH, currently valued at around $1.07 million.\n\nMajor bear alert\n\nThe crypto community remains divided over the significance of these reawakenings. The prevailing sentiment suggests that the resurgence may portend bearish market trends. This belief has garnered support from recent historical trends. For instance, following the previous instance of a similar whale reactivation in July, the ETH price plummeted by a staggering 20.42%.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThe skeptics' position finds further validation in the months spanning from May to mid-July, during which weekly awakenings of such dormant wallets precipitated a 17.3% decline in the ETH price.\n\nAs the awakened whale navigates the current market landscape, the community should brace for potential fluctuations. All eyes are now fixated on the awakening whale and the cryptic tides it might usher in.\n\nIn this ever-evolving narrative of crypto trends, the reanimation of a pre-mine Ethereum whale after nearly a decade serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate interplay between early investors, market sentiment and the pulse of digital assets."

        "content": "The SEC may approve the several Ethereum ETF applications it has received.\n\nETH\u2019s price jumped as the news broke.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Ethereum [ETH] futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) may be approved by the U.S. SEC sooner than expected. The report, which came out on 17 August, noted that the regulatory is unlikely to block the product that has seen a lot of applications by numerous firms.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nRecall that BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin [BTC] futures ETF has already paved. So, the Ethereum community has also been eagerly awaiting a similar development. At the time of writing, firms including BitWise, Volatility Shares, Roundhill, and Grayscale had already filed applications for the ETF.\n\nInterestingly, the development broke when the entire crypto market was undergoing a massive correction. During that time, ETH\u2019s price had fallen to $1,600. But as soon as the public got wind of the report, a renewed sense of optimism entered the market. This, in turn, acted as a catalyst for the cryptocurrency\u2019s recovery.\n\nThis propelled ETH to gain as much as 10% within a short period. Although the report has not been confirmed by the SEC, many believe that if approved, it could bring some stability to the crypto market.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum community may need to be careful about being overly excited about the development. This is because the SEC has been slow to authorize derivative products, as the regulator continues to express skepticism over the potential manipulation of cryptocurrencies like ETH.\n\nBut what else is happening with Ethereum?\n\nAccording to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s network growth had decreased to 26,600. Network growth measures the number of new addresses joining a network. When the metric increases, it means that there is a good level of traction on the network.\n\nBut a decrease in the network growth suggests that new addresses joining the network have refrained from making transactions.\n\nIf approved, there could be a positive change in network growth. This is because more investors might trust ETH, and institutional liquidity would come into the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that ETH could be undervalued at its current price. The MVRV ratio represents the ratio between the current price of an asset and the realized prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen it rises into the positive region, it means that market participants have made a lot of unrealized gains. But when the metric falls into the red area, it suggests that the average holder is coping with losses.\n\nAt press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was -8.01%. This indicates losses for ETH holders. At the same time, it offers a buying opportunity for those looking to hold for a long period."

        "content": "BabyShiba\n\nBabyShiba Coin Rockets in Tribute to Shiba Inu: Outperforms Competitors Post Launch.\n\nSAITAMA, JAPAN, Aug. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Babyshiba, an ERC-20 memecoin, was launched on the 16th of August, seeing an incredible price growth of 13,000% in just 24 hours as a tribute to the well-known Shiba Inu coin. Its goal is to outdo the famous Babydoge, and it gained immediate traction.\n\nA little bit of background for context: The Shiba Inu coin was released two years ago as a memecoin centered around decentralization, by an anonymous founder called Ryoshi. Recently, it evolved beyond a simple meme and launched its own Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. Interestingly, the Shibarium blockchain went live the same day as the Babyshiba launch, sparking speculation about the individuals behind this new project. Additionally, BabyShiba was also launched in August, coinciding with the same month as the Shiba Inu launch.\n\nWith the crypto world's attention on Shiba Inu due to the Shibarium blockchain, Babyshiba emerged at the perfect time. This impeccable timing suggests the launch was a well-calculated plan by its creators. Babyshiba not only pays tribute to Ryoshi's vision embodied in Shiba Inu but also aims to surpass Babydoge, a derivative of the renowned Doge Coin.\n\nThe project quickly gained substantial momentum and attracted a community aptly named the BabyShibArmy. Some are suggesting a repeat of the Babydoge magic, as the project's Telegram group experiences ongoing growth and the community remains highly active on Twitter (X). As the community plays a vital role in any memecoin and was initially the driving force behind Shiba Inu, BabyShiba likely has a promising future.\n\nOn the technical side, BabyShiba is tradable on Uniswap, an Ethereum DEX, and imposes a 1% tax allocated for marketing. Daily updates on marketing initiatives are visible in their Telegram group, with full transparency maintained on expenditure. Already, over 20 significant crypto influencers have talked about their project, and this figure is steadily rising. The project's website is meticulously designed, and they have published a whitepaper elaborating on their vision.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven its potential to become the top memecoin of summer 2023 and perhaps one of the most successful ever (alongside its rival Babydoge), the BabyShiba project deserves close attention. We encourage you to monitor its progress over the coming weeks and judge its potential for yourself.\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite: https://babyshib.vip\n\n\n\nTelegram: t.me/babyshiberc\n\n\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/babyshiberc\n\n\n\nWhitepaper: https://babyshiba-1.gitbook.io/babyshiba-shibpaper/\n\n\n\nEmail: contact@babyshib.vip\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT: Adams joshua Babyshiba contact@babyshib.vip\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "While the broader cryptocurrency market recently took a nosedive, some mysterious Ethereum whale successfully escaped with $41 million worth of ETH. Days later, the price of ETH went down, along with BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Did this whale know something the rest of the market didn\u2019t?\n\nEthereum Whale Sells $41 Million Before Market Crash\n\nIn the early hours of August 18, the crypto market saw investors reacting to SpaceX selling its $373 million Bitcoin holdings, pushing down Bitcoin by more than 8% in a matter of minutes. During this period, the crypto market cap dropped to $1.1 trillion, and Ethereum also saw its value plummet by almost 6%.\n\nOn-chain data provided by Lookonchain reveals that a smart Ethereum whale dumped 22,341 ETH worth $41 million just prior on August 14. On-chain investigation shows that the whale moved their ETH holdings to the Binance exchange and then withdrew $41 million worth of Tether USDT.\n\nWhile this whale still made a loss of $1.7 million in the sale, if they hadn\u2019t moved their funds, they would have lost at least $5 million in the crash.\n\nThe whale was very smart and dumped 22,341 $ETH ($41M) before the market crashed. Even though he lost ~$1.7M this time, he successfully avoided the market crash. Perhaps he will buy $ETH back at a cheaper price in the future. Follow this smart whale.\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/S4Wv8XRlhW pic.twitter.com/BcdzdpmbIA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 18, 2023\n\nCoincidentally, this isn\u2019t the first time this trader has made headline trades. This savvy Ethereum whale has shown signs of being able to predict market movements before and has had a 100% winning rate in recent months.\n\nThe whale profited from the SEC and Spot Bitcoin ETFs saga. When ETH plummeted in reaction to news of the SEC rejecting spot Bitcoin applications from BlackRock and other investment companies, this whale saw this as an opportunity to buy the dip on June 30.\n\nThey bought 8,188 ETH worth $15.23 million at $1,860 per ETH, and ETH would later rise to $1948.60 in the hours after.\n\nA smart whale deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance and withdrew 15.9M $USDT 12 hrs ago. The whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling at high prices to make a profit. He has a 100% win rate of trading $ETH in the past 2 months.https://t.co/dT9p6jeCtr pic.twitter.com/pTuJAwL81O \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 28, 2023\n\nDo Whales Sometimes Have Insider Knowledge?\n\nWhile we can\u2019t know for sure if whales have access to insider information, their actions are worth paying attention to. It could be that this whale knew something was going to trigger a price crash or was just making the right trading decision at the right time.\n\nNevertheless, whale moves could signal future price action due to the sheer size of their holdings. So by closely following the on-chain activity of major holders, investors might gain useful insights.\n\nThe market is still yet to bounce back from the recent dip. At the time of writing, ETH is down by 1.80% in the past 24 hours and down by 10.19% in a 7-day timeframe. Bitcoin and XRP are also down by 11.87% and 19.87%, respectively in a 7-day timeframe.\n\nETH price jumps to $1,681 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to approve multiple applications for Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the same time, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nSince July, the regulator has been flooded with applications from several investment firms, including requests combining futures Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) strategies. So far, the SEC has not instructed the firms to withdraw their applications, unlike in 2021, when firms were instructed to withdraw similar applications. This suggests that the regulator won\u2019t block the fund\u2019s launch within a few weeks, according to WSJ sources.\n\nAt least 16 applications for Ether or Bitcoin-Ether futures ETFs are awaiting regulatory approval. Ether is the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, used for peer-to-peer transactions within the decentralized network. A crypto futures ETF tracks the performance of crypto futures contracts. For example, instead of investing directly in Bitcoin or Ethereum, a crypto futures ETF invests in futures contracts that are tied to the price of these digital assets.\n\nUPDATE: Here's what the #Ethereum futures ETF filings race looks like. This is a list of all filings including withdrawn AND the 16 active filings. Notice @ValkyrieFunds' date on $BTF currently looks to be the leader absent some action from SEC -- 10/3/23 https://t.co/DgZpDVbEqO pic.twitter.com/CYEcTJnkx8 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 16, 2023\n\nWith the prospect of crypto futures approval looming, the SEC keeps receiving requests. Earlier this week, asset management firm Valkyrie filed for an Ether futures ETF and a previous application combining a Bitcoin-Ether futures strategy. Valkyrie is the first in line in this race and could see its BTC-ETH ETF debuting in early October.\n\nIn the ETF industry, first-mover advantage is important. According to the WSJ, citing data from Morningstar, the first futures Bitcoin ETF approved from ProShares has gathered $1 billion in assets under management since its inception in October 2021, while Valkyrie\u2019s similar product, launched a few days later, amassed nearly $28 million in assets under management.\n\nIn another major decision affecting the crypto industry, the SEC has yet to decide whether to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Players waiting for approval include Wall Street giants Fidelity and BlackRock. According to the application\u2019s timeline, the SEC has until January to deliver a final verdict.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

This would be a huge moment for companies looking to offer such investment products.\n\nThis month, seven different funds were proposed to the SEC, including Valkyrie, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, Roundhill, and Volatility Shares.

If they don't, BTC could step into the next week within the current low range.

However, considering the commission has delayed for the second time, the weekend may not record any significant action unless whales step in to take advantage of the weekend tranquility.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors and investors come in, Bitcoin price could find a footing to push north. While flipping the $$26,300 and $27,300 levels from resistance back to support would be a good sign, only a decisive candlestick close above the ascending trendline at $28,738 would invalidate the current gloom, with a possible foray to the $30,400 presenting next.\n\nAlso Read Bitcoin price dips to the $25,100 range with $820 million long positions liquidated across the market.\n\nEthereum price follows BTC on the heels\n\nEthereum (ETH) price reflects an almost similar outlook as BTC, indicating a long candlestick for the August 17 trading session and a short one for August 18 as the largest altcoin continues pulling north. This points to a tight correlation between BTC and ETH, with capital overflows from Bitcoin likely to drive Ethereum if the capital does come.\n\nAs in the case of BTC, the RSI is at 19, pointing to a weak price strength. The AO histogram bars do not inspire optimism either, pointing to the bears' position in the front row seats. Without a significant catalyst to drive Bitcoin price, ETH holders may remain within the $1,714 to $1,627 range for a while, possibly across the weekend.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, should Bitcoin price start moving, ETH would easily follow suit, drawing north to breach the $1,813 resistance level. Higher, it could traverse the $1,891 and $1,941 resistance levels, respectively, before an attempt to reclaim the May 6 and mid-July highs above the $2,000 psychological level. A decisive daily candlestick close above this level invalidates the current bearish outlook. It would constitute a 20% flight from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Forecast: Indication of a 45% crash of bear trap?\n\nRipple price mark times around $0.5010\n\nRipple price has been stuck around the $0.5010 level for the better part of the day after pulling back 20% from the August 17 low of $0.4226. While the token also looks to Bitcoin for influence, a lot depends on the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC after the court approved the regulators' request for an interlocutory appeal.\n\nAs reported, the SEC wants the Howey Test revisited, with a potential overturning of the Ripple victory on July 13. Just as the partial victory sent XRP north by unprecedented margins, the possibility of an overturn inspires fears. With this, Ripple price could hover around the current level for a while or draw toward the $0.4191 support floor.\n\nThe RSI at 23, coupled with the bars of the AO histograms in the negative zone, bolsters the bears' case, indicating a possible slump.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by XRP bulls could send Ripple price north, possibly foraying above the $0.5752 resistance level or higher past the $0.6840 level. In a highly bullish case, XRP could reclaim the $0.8193 resistance level, levels last seen around July.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs Ripple, the legal battle intensifies as XRP holders expect new changes from SEC appeal"

        "content": "XRP, the digital asset affiliated with Ripple, witnessed a significant uptick, surging nearly 10% earlier today. As of recent metrics, XRP has settled at a 4.5% gain, still significantly outshining its rivals, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, for instance, barely moved with a 0.2% increase, while Ethereum slightly ascended by 0.4%. In contrast, Cardano, a notable contender in the crypto market, saw its price dip by 0.4%.\n\nHowever, when we zoom out to look at the seven-day performance, the narrative changes a bit. Over a week, XRP suffered a notable decline, shedding 14% of its value. In comparison, Ethereum's value decreased by 9.3% and BNB's by 9.9% over the week. Cardano's seven-day performance also indicated a drop but at a lesser rate of 7.5%.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, XRP recently lost roughly 40% in a single month, underperforming other top cryptocurrencies and erasing its gains that were added because of the favorable Ripple ruling.\n\nThe SEC is fighting back\n\nDespite its impressive short-term performance, XRP remains clouded by uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeal against Ripple.\n\nThe appeal, recently submitted by the SEC, challenges a July court order. This order had decided that Ripple's sales and offers of XRP on cryptocurrency trading platforms didn't lead investors to anticipate profits dependent on others' efforts. Furthermore, it had ruled that XRP distributions as payment for services don't constitute an \"investment of money.\"\n\nThis appeal's central issues revolve around the classification of XRP's offers and sales. One court has already indicated a disagreement with the initial Ripple decision, but some prominent voices within the XRP community have downplayed the significance of such a move.\n\nThe court previously recognized that institutional sales fit the Howey criteria. However, distinctions have been drawn regarding the categorization of coins sold directly to institutional investors compared to retail investors in secondary markets."

        "title": "SEC\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF Approval: A Resounding Victory For ETH\u2019s Security Status? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "According to Bloomberg, in a key development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly set to allow the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum (ETH) futures.\n\nThis move marks a significant win for numerous firms that have long sought to introduce such products. While the SEC has previously hesitated to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies, the decision to greenlight an Ethereum futures ETF could have profound implications for Ethereum\u2019s classification as a non-security.\n\nThis development also holds potential ramifications for other cryptocurrencies, as the SEC\u2019s stance on where the line between security and non-security lies becomes a subject of litigation.\n\nEthereum Paradigm Shift\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s report, sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is unlikely to block the ETFs based on futures contracts for Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nNearly a dozen companies, including prominent names like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares, have filed applications to launch these ETFs. While it remains unclear which funds will receive approval, insiders suggest that several may be granted the green light as early as October.\n\nThis anticipated approval of an Ethereum futures ETF by the SEC could have far-reaching implications for the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reluctance to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies has spurred speculation that derivative-based products would offer a potential pathway to market access.\n\nOn this matter, crypto analyst Adam Cochran has highlighted that the SEC potentially approving an ETF based on Ethereum futures contracts implicitly acknowledges that Ethereum itself is not considered a security.\n\nThis decision challenges the notion that Ethereum should be regulated as a traditional financial security, considering its proof-of-stake mechanism, purpose, and usage.\n\nCochran further believes that the SEC\u2019s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF bolsters Ethereum\u2019s non-security status and sets a precedent that could impact other cryptocurrencies facing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Grayscale Investments over rejecting their Bitcoin trust\u2019s conversion into an ETF highlights the agency\u2019s concerns regarding investor protection, manipulation risks, and price volatility.\n\nHowever, this approval could provide a compelling argument in favor of distinguishing between the underlying asset and how it is sold, bolstering the Torres Doctrine and potentially influencing the outcome of similar cases, such as the XRP appeal.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF holds tremendous significance for the cryptocurrency industry. If confirmed, it would mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum\u2019s classification as a non-security, further solidifying its position as a commodity or currency.\n\nThe decision also highlights the regulatory challenge of defining clear boundaries between securities and non-securities in crypto.\n\nAs the industry evolves, approving an Ethereum futures ETF could shape the regulatory landscape, paving the way for increased adoption and investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, the news is not entirely favorable for ETH as it trades at $1,660, following a downward trend similar to Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. The market has experienced a substantial outflow of liquidity, leading to a significant decline in most digital currencies.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, ETH has declined more than 4% after breaking its previously established range between $1,895 and $1,830. Additionally, it has suffered a notable loss of 10% within the seven-day timeframe.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum Sustains Growth and User Influx Following ARB Airdrop, Total Assets Reach $5.77 Billion: Report\n\nSource: Arbitrum\n\nPer Nansen\u2019s Arbitrum Quarterly Report for Q2 2023, the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 23, 2023, led to a peak in users and transactions. Following the ARB airdrop, daily transactions and user numbers have consistently exceeded the chain\u2019s past averages.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum rollup hosting asset valued at $5.77 billion, sustained robust growth in the previous quarter. Throughout Q2, Arbitrum maintained its momentum by enhancing its infrastructure and advancing its ecosystem.\n\nAfter the ARB airdrop incentives concluded and the airdrop resulted in a \u201csell-the-news\u201d reaction for the native token and its associated ecosystem projects, noteworthy activity levels persisted, evident in transaction and user counts surpassing pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe influx of new users underscores Arbitrum\u2019s enduring strength and flourishing ecosystem.\n\nA group of \u201csuper airdrop hunters\u201d who amassed ARB tokens using multiple Ethereum addresses contributed significantly to the selling pressure.\n\nThe ARB token experienced significant selling during the airdrop, causing its price to plummet from $10.29 to $1 in just a few hours.\n\nNansen\u2019s report stated that the stability of Arbitrum after its Airdrop \u201cpoints towards more organic activity\u201d as new users have been increasing, even \u201csurpassing Ethereum on certain days in Q2.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, daily transactions and gas prices on Arbitrum One, one of the critical components of Arbitrum utilizing Arbitrum Rollup technology to enhance transaction throughput while maintaining security, remained steady, averaging 800k transactions.\n\nSource: Nansen\n\nThe quarter saw a consistent rise in transaction count compared to the previous quarter, indicating heightened activity since the airdrop. Daily active addresses on Arbitrum remained stable at approximately 200k throughout the quarter.\n\nConversely, there has been a gradual increase in the number of new wallets initiating transactions on Arbitrum since the beginning of the year. On specific days in Q2, this count surpassed Ethereum\u2019s new wallet activity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Airdrop Spurs Price Surge and Ecosystem Growth Since March\n\nThe announcement of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 16 led to a significant price increase in native tokens of projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including GMX (GMX), Magic (MAGIC), Gains Network (GNS), and Radiant Network (RDNT).\n\nThis surge was directly tied to the ARB airdrop, fueling growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe price surge occurred mainly between the airdrop announcement and its execution on March 23.\n\nAs noted in a report, \u201cOnce the airdrop launched alongside the $ARB token introduction, ecosystem token prices began to decrease, following a typical \u2018sell the news\u2019 pattern.\u201d\n\nThe Arbitrum airdrop allocated 1.1% of the total 12.75 billion ARB supply to the ecosystem\u2019s DAOs. This allocation was crucial for a positive outlook on the Arbitrum ecosystem, as DAOs could leverage ARB incentives to encourage usage.\n\nHowever, the airdrop amounts for individual projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem were relatively smaller. Only GMX and MAGIC received allocations exceeding $10 million.\n\nMost projects received less than $500,000 worth of ARB tokens, which needed to be improved to incentivize liquidity across a large user base.\n\nWith the speculation surrounding the ARB airdrop subsiding, the growing number of new wallets implies increased organic engagement.\n\nDaily active users, transaction count, and on-chain value have all settled at levels higher than pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe upward trends in gas fee expenditure and the establishment of new wallets further signify the growing utilization of the network."

        "content": "On August 17, Ethereum Foundation held a pivotal meeting to discuss developments around a new testnet, Holesky, that is launching on 15th September. The launch of the new testnet offers to initiate a new stage of experimentation and progress within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe testnet has a unique name, not \u201cHole-sky,\u201d but it comes from a train station in Prague, Czech Republic. People casually call this station \u201cHole\u0161ky.\u201d Ackee Blockchain Security found something interesting in the testnet\u2019s code: the code number, 17000, is the same as the area\u2019s postal code.\n\nParithosh Jayanthi, the DevOps expert at the Ethereum Foundation, said that the development team had conducted all tests involving an astounding 1.4 million validators on the Holesky testnet.\n\nThis hard work helped make the network stable and reliable. Jayanthi said that this big achievement would be the starting point for the Holesky testnet\u2019s size. This shows that Ethereum is serious about making its technology handle lots of things and work better.\n\nAt the center of the discussions was the task of determining how many testnet tokens should be integrated into the Holesky testnet. Ultimately they decided against introducing a 1.6 billion Holesky into circulation. Developers opted not to decrease the supply of 120 million ETH on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe testnet is scheduled to remain operational for an extended duration, offering Long-Term Service (LTS) support until 2027, followed by an End-of-Life (EOL) phase that stretches until 2028.\n\nThe Holseky would probably replace Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, introduced in 2019, transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Both Goerli and Holesky, in addition to the established Ethereum mainnet, operate as proof-of-stake networks. However, it\u2019s crucial to understand that, unlike the Ethereum mainnet, these two testnets don\u2019t use ETH tokens that hold real-world market value."

        "content": "With the \u2018Summer of Shibarium\u2019 coming up soon, there has been noticeable whale activity on Shiba Inu\u2019s network and within the meme coin market. The SHIB price has been bullish for some weeks, and even experts believe its recent price pullback means a bigger rally is coming.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has also re-entered the news scene, with the Bitcoin (BTC) price having a hard time breaking through its $30,000 resistance. But never mind all that, as Anarchy\u2019s ROI potential could answer every crypto trader\u2019s prayers. But only if you act fast.\n\nEarly investors in the Anarchy (ANA) world can gain 100x profits from their presale investments, and there\u2019s no telling what potential the ANA token price will have after it launches. We could be in for another Pepe coin (PEPE)!\n\nHere\u2019s what we have on the budding meme project.\n\n>>> BUY $ANA NOW <<<\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Shows Promise For the Summer, While Ethereum (ETH) Remains Undecided\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network is about to get a lot busier, as meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Anarchy (ANA) are looking to deliver shockers this summer. Shiba Inu is finally looking to make a big break since its launch in 2021, and the community is delighted to launch its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, in August.\n\nThe SHIB price has enjoyed some price rallying lately, as the whales have moved trillions worth of tokens in the past month. However, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price dipped by about 11% in the past two days, according to Coin Gape, although analysts have stated that it could be a pullback indicating a bullish run.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum (ETH) price is dipping following Bitcoin\u2019s decline. The decline has affected most altcoins, and Ethereum (ETH) may not be crossing the $2,000 mark very soon. The ETH price could be headed for as low as $1,600, as it has been testing new supports lately, according to FXStreet reports.\n\nEven PayPal\u2019s announcement to host their stablecoin, PYUSD, on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain is not rescuing the ETH price from its drop. With Ethereum (ETH) out of the competition, Anarchy (ANA) has only Shiba Inu (SHIB) to compete with for profits in the cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu\u2019s price rally can\u2019t be estimated yet, but experts are convinced Anarchy (ANA) can deliver 100x gains for its investors this year.\n\nThe race is on, but Anarchy (ANA) seems to be some steps ahead. Let\u2019s have more from the budding meme coin.\n\nSomething huge is coming.\n\nIf you see this \ud83d\udc40\n\nThen your early! pic.twitter.com/HssZ4ywwrJ \u2014 ANARCHY (@anarchycoineth) June 10, 2023\n\nAnarchy\u2019s ROI Showdown Has Begun, But The Token Has More To Offer\n\nAnarchy (ANA) has been the most exciting thing in the cryptocurrency market since the Pepe coin (PEPE) launch in April. The meme coin is not making PEPE\u2019s mistakes, though. The developers have created a protocol that will serve as the standard for incoming meme coins, and this is only the start.\n\nAnarchy (ANA) seeks to dominate the meme coin sector by offering utility for its users while it encourages them to fight the oppressive system around them using memes. The meme coin is fed up with the rich and powerful ones leaving the majority at the bottom of the pyramid, and it is out to do something about that. With its DAO and memes, Anarchy (ANA) will empower its users with the capital and confidence to leave the corrupt system and pursue their dreams and passions.\n\nAnarchy\u2019s memes will come with a lot of creativity, sarcasm, and fun. The memes will call out the government and criticise its corrupt policies and officials while offering the rest of the crypto-verse the best of entertainment.

        "title": "Ethereum would trade at this price if it hits its all-time high market cap - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) reached an all-time high price of $4,878 on November 10, 2021, as well as an all-time high market cap of $548.4 billion on the same date. Two years ago, the Ethereum Network implemented a few updates that drastically changed the supply dynamics for Ether, the native token.\n\nHowever, even with all the changes, ETH is still affected by its token\u2019s inflation. Considering data retrieved by Finbold on August 18, with a circulating supply of around 120.21 million ETH, one Ether would be worth close to $4,570 \u2014 $308 (6.3%) less than its price all-time high in US dollars.\n\nETH supply stats. Source: ultrasound.money (registered on August 18, at 12pm UTC)\n\nThe first change to Ethereum\u2019s code to impact the token\u2019s supply was called the London Upgrade, made on August 5, 2021, which introduced the burning mechanism as described by the Ethereum Foundation:\n\n\u201cThe London upgrade introduced EIP-1559, which reformed the transaction fee market, along with changes to how gas refunds are handled and the Ice Age schedule.\u201d\n\nWhile the second relevant change was called The Merge (or Paris), which took place on September 15, 2022 \u2014 one year after the \u2018burn.\u2019 Paris merged Ethereum\u2019s blockchain with the Beacon Chain, switching the old Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS), reducing ETH\u2019s emission through block subsidy, as entities\u2019 costs to maintain the network were drastically reduced.\n\nEthereum supply inflation and gas fees\n\nSince then, a little over 3 million ETH have been added to Ether\u2019s circulating supply. As a result of 6.56 million ETH issued through the payment of the block subsidy to Ethereum\u2019s validators, less an amount of 3.55 million burned ETH from the share of the gas fees paid by Ethereum users.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Ether has a yearly inflation rate of 1.26%, as opposed to an expected yearly inflation rate of 3.16%, in case \u2018The Merge\u2019 did not take place.\n\nAt current rates, it\u2019s also expected that the network burns an average of 1.75 million ETH per year, but these numbers are directly correlated to the network usage. The more people use the Ethereum Network, paying more gas fees to transact or deploy smart contracts, the more ETH will be burned \u2014 and the opposite is equally true.\n\nRecently, Visa (NYSE: V) introduced the possibility for users to pay their gas fees on Ethereum with a Visa Credit Card, thanks to another change in the protocol called Address Abstraction (ERC-4337). This could also impact fee expenditures, impacting the burn amount, and the projected price for 1 ETH in the future, according to its all-time high market cap.\n\nETH analysis\n\nETH was changing hands as low as $1,680 on August 18, after massive losses that affected the whole crypto market, registering over 11% in losses in the last 30 days.\n\nThere are no guarantees that ETH will ever reach its all-time high market cap of $548.4 billion, depending entirely on further development, news, sentiment, and demand for the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, it\u2019s also possible that the second-largest cryptocurrency could overcome this historic mark.\n\nAll in all, a few experts were foreseeing a price drop (as happened), in anticipation of a further price appreciation. Moreover, two positive signs were spotted on Ethereum.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "content": "A large cryptocurrency whale has liquidated over $41 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH) shortly before the cryptocurrency market crashed and lost over 6% of its value in just 24 hours.\n\nAccording to on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the whale dumped 22,341 ETH then valued at $41 million in a move that realized a loss of $1.7 million for the whale, but successfully avoided a market crash.\n\nThe whale was very smart and dumped 22,341 $ETH ($41M) before the market crashed.\n\n\n\nEven though he lost ~$1.7M this time, he successfully avoided the market crash.\n\n\n\nPerhaps he will buy $ETH back at a cheaper price in the future.\n\n\n\nFollow this smart whale.\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/S4Wv8XRlhW pic.twitter.com/BcdzdpmbIA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 18, 2023\n\nThe whale realized its loss by moving the ETH tokens to leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, where it sold the funds and then withdraw them in the form of leading stablecoin USDT.\n\nThe move came ahead of a cryptocurrency market crash that saw the total capitalization of the space drop by over 6% to $1.1 trillion, the lowest level in at least two months, that came amid reports SpaceX sold all of its Bitcoin \u2013 even though these remain unconfirmed \u2013 and as China\u2019s struggling property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is down by around 7.3% in the last 24-hour period and over 10% in the last seven days, Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by 9.5% in the past week and 6% over the last 24-hour period as it outperformed the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance is tied to reports that suggest the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to approve the listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indirectly offering exposure to the cryptocurrency through ETH futures contracts.\n\nNotably earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase gained regulatory approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether futures trading to customers in the United States. Coinbase\u2019s foray into the derivatives sector isn\u2019t a recent endeavor. In September 2021, the company submitted an application to the National Futures Association (NFA) seeking FCM registration.\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."

        "title": "Simultaneous approval of all Ethereum ETFs on the horizon | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The Ethereum ETF scene is on the brink of a revolution. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), historically cautious and skeptical about the crypto world, seems to be shifting its stance.\n\nThe wave of change hints that the agency might give the green light to a barrage of Ether futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\nThe Flood of Applications: What Changed?\n\nOver the past several months, a barrage of applications related to the Ethereum ETF has crashed upon the SEC\u2019s doorstep. Among these, a slew encompasses combined strategies of both Bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nIf we took a time machine back to 2021, the atmosphere was entirely different; the SEC consistently nudged companies to pull back their similar applications.\n\nHowever, whispers from those with their ear to the ground suggest that this past reticence might have transformed into a more accommodating approach. This evolution in attitude signals that the SEC could potentially let these Ethereum ETFs out of the gate in the coming weeks.\n\nAnd the sheer number? We\u2019re talking about 16 applications revolving around either Ether or a combination of Bitcoin-Ether futures ETFs. Now, for the uninitiated, these aren\u2019t just standard ETFs but represent a nuanced segment of the market.\n\nInstead of thrusting money directly into the crypto giants like Bitcoin or Ethereum, these crypto futures ETFs leverage futures contracts linked to the crypto prices.\n\nValkyrie: Leading the Ethereum ETF Charge?\n\nOne notable player in this Ethereum ETF frenzy is Valkyrie. They aren\u2019t newcomers; the asset management giant recently put forward an application for an Ether futures ETF.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t their first foray either; a prior bid for a combined Bitcoin-Ether futures strategy ETF was already in the mix. If rumors are to be believed, Valkyrie might be inching ahead, potentially launching its BTC-ETH ETF by October.\n\nBut why the mad dash? The ETF domain operates on a simple mantra: the early bird catches the worm. A case in point is ProShares. Being the premier futures Bitcoin ETF to get the SEC\u2019s nod, it raked in a staggering $1 billion in assets within its inaugural year.\n\nContrast that with Valkyrie\u2019s similar offering, which entered the market slightly later and managed nearly $28 million. The difference is glaring. This dance with the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t the SEC\u2019s only t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the crypto domain.\n\nAnother mammoth decision dangles in the balance: will the SEC bestow its blessings on a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.? It\u2019s not just fledgling entities hanging in the balance, but Wall Street behemoths like Fidelity and BlackRock too. The anticipation is palpable, and the SEC\u2019s final word on this is expected by January.\n\nBottomline is the Ethereum ETF landscape in the U.S. teeters on the brink of a seismic shift. With the SEC\u2019s potential mass approval of a multitude of applications, a new era for crypto-based ETFs might dawn. The financial world waits with bated breath, eyes trained on the SEC\u2019s next move."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation Announces Q2 Funding for Projects and Conferences\n\nTomiwabold Olajide By August 19, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation released details of its funding in Q2, revealing an allocation of $9.2 million to support various projects, conferences and industry research. Among the recipients, community and education projects took precedence, encompassing over ten summits and conferences.\n\n\n\nThe scope of funded activities extended globally, with conferences and hackathons like ETH Barcelona, ETH Belgrade, ETH Prague, Ethereum Singapore and ETH Rome benefiting from the Foundation\u2019s financial backing. The allocation of grants extended to Consensus Layer research focused on data availability sampling, distributed systems and staking infrastructure tools. Key Ethereum clients, Nimbus and Lighthouse, saw ongoing development efforts.\n\n\n\nSignificant funding was channeled into cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, aiding the development of tools like Chiquito and Hypernova for streamlined zk circuit construction. Additionally, privacy-centric protocols such as Lambdadelta, Isokratia, and zkEmail were supported. Foundational protocols like Halo2 and Semaphore continued to receive backing.\n\n\n\nDeveloper experience and tooling improvements remained priorities, as evidenced by the funding of Recovery Pulse for smart contract recovery.\n\n\n\nExecution Layer projects, including the Fluffy Light client, and Nethermind internships, were also recipients of financial support. Developing the Nimbus execution layer and the layer-2 Beacon Chain blockchain explorer also secured funding.\n\n\n\nDespite the ongoing bear market, the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s ecosystem support program (ESP) remains committed to fostering growth within the expansive ecosystem of the largest smart contract network in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\n\n\nIn related news, reports surfaced indicating that former U.S. President Donald Trump possesses Ethereum holdings ranging from $250,000 to $500,000. These holdings are likely linked to the sale of his self-themed NFT collection.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock"
