        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Might Finally Surpass Bitcoin (BTC) by Market Cap, Analyst Displays Four Scenarios - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIndependent cryptocurrency analyst shared the charts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \"domination,\" i.e., the percentage of net crypto segment market cap. He indicated two trend lines that may display the timeline of \"flippening\" much-anticipated by the Ethereum (ETH) community.\n\nEthereum (ETH) might flip Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025-2026, here's how\n\nMorgan Bennett tracked the dynamics of the share of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) market capitalization compared to the entire cryptocurrencies segment. Although he cannot call himself a \"fan\" of technical analysis, he is sure that two trends are obvious: Bitcoin's (BTC) domination shrinks while the Ethereum (ETH) one grows.\n\nNot a fan of technical analysis but it's hard to argue against long-term trends.\n\n\n\nIf the trend continues, $ETH will flip $BTC within the next 2-3 years. pic.twitter.com/CSFtnjwgnF \u2014 Mo (@MorganTBennett) June 2, 2023\n\nShould both trend lines be valid, the \"flippening\" might happen in the next two or three years. On the chart by Bennett, it takes place in Q4, 2026. Thanks to the growing size of the altcoin market, both cryptocurrencies will be responsible for 23-24% by the moment of \"flippening.\"\n\nEthereum (ETH) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) \"gently,\" \"gradually,\" \"suddenly\" or both cryptocurrencies can fall victim to the \"Digital Gold\" narrative disappearing.\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is in charge of over 46.2% of cryptocurrency market capitalization, while Ethereum's (ETH) share exceeds 19.5%. The third largest cryptocurrency, the U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) stablecoin, totals 7.36% of net crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two largest cryptocurrencies, were at the closest point to \"flippening\" six years ago, in mid-June 2017. Bitcoin (BTC) was in charge of 37% of the market, and Ethereum's (ETH) capitalization comprised 32%.\n\nBy contrast, in September 2019, Bitcoin's (BTC) market cap was 10x larger than that of Ethereum (ETH) since the latter was much more affected by the Crypto Winter of 2018-2020.\n\n\"Flippening could happen, but line is ridiculous,\" crypto veteran Chris Blec says\n\nThe followers of Bennett agreed with his calculations. However, some of them stressed that they are tired of \"flippening\" narratives that have been discussed here and there since the launch of Ethereum (ETH) in June 2015.\n\nProminent DeFi analyst and influencer Chris Blec, author of the Blec Report project, says that in general, Bitcoin (BTC) has all chances of being surpassed by Ethereum (ETH), but the accuracy of the aforementioned model should not be overestimated:\n\nI don't disagree that the flippening could happen but that line is really ridiculous.. you just completely ignored all of the data points between 2016 and today\n\nBennett agreed with this point of view, but added that it is impossible to find a function that does not predict the flippening even if Ethereum's (ETH) dominance at the start was considered 0."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) decentralized finance (DeFi) activity has declined in the bear market, and the sector faces further competition from Ethereum\u2019s annual staking reward of 4%, according to Glassnode analysts. However, a DeFi narrative is building around liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens, which could revive Ethereum\u2019s network activity.\n\nThe percentage of gas consumed by DeFi protocols has dropped from 34% in 2020 to between 8% and 16% presently, with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) commanding the maximum share of 25\u201330%, according to a recent report from Glassnode.\n\nEthereum gas usage by transaction type. Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode\u2019s supply-weighted price index for DeFi, priced in United States dollars and ETH, recorded a 90% loss since early 2021.\n\nThe so-called DeFi \u201cblue chips,\u201d which represent a basket of governance tokens from well-known DeFi protocols like Uniswap (UNI), MakerDAO (MKR), Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Balancer (BAL) and SushiSwap (SUSHI), have lost 88% of their market capitalization from all-time highs of $45 billion in May 2021.\n\nETH vs. DeFi tokens price performance. Source: Glassnode\n\nDeFi blue chip tokens have underperformed against ETH during bullish market rallies and experienced a more severe drop than ETH \u201con the downside during the bear.\u201d The analysts predict that since the staking of ETH now yields 4%, it will act as a \u201cnew hurdle rate over which token returns must jump.\u201d This yield represents the benchmark rate for Ether investors.\n\nLeading lending protocols like Aave and Compound offer between 2\u20133% yields on lending stablecoins and Ether. Moreover, DeFi protocols also come with smart contract risk, which is eliminated with proof-of-stake validators.\n\nStaking has become popular among Ethereum investors, especially after the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which enabled redemptions from the staking contract.\n\nBy the end of May, Ethereum users staked 21.63 million ETH worth $40.021 billion, representing 18% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply.\n\nLSD platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool account for one-third of this massive market. These applications offer a tokenized representation of staked ETH, allowing investors access to the staking yields without compromising liquidity.\n\nA growing trend among Ethereum investors is interacting with LSD financialization (LSDfi), which aims to put the liquidity offered by the LSD tokens to use in DeFi applications.\n\nRelated: LSD for DeFi: Tenet, LayerZero partner to drive cross-chain liquid staking adoption\n\nIs LSDfi the solution?\n\nLSDfi leverages the liquidity of LSD tokens into DeFi-like lending protocols and liquidity on exchanges for higher yields. Given that a considerable amount of ETH is staked with the LSD platforms, LSDfi has the potential to revive DeFi activity.\n\nA Dune analytics dashboard by data analyst Defimochi shows the total value locked (TVL) in LSDfi protocols has touched $411 million, rising exponentially since mid-May. Some of the popular names in the sector are Pendle Finance, Lybra Finance, Curve Finance and Alchemix Protocol.\n\nLSDfi total value locked. Source: Dune\n\nThe liquidity of LSD tokens on Curve Finance \u2014 the largest stablecoin exchange in the market \u2014 has surpassed $1.5 billion. Curve also enabled the minting of its overcollateralized stablecoin crvUSD (CRVUSD) using Frax Protocol\u2019s staked Frax Ether (SFRXETH) as collateral.\n\nNew protocols like Lybra Finance and Pendle Finance, which are looking to leverage the liquidity provided by LSD tokens, have also become popular.\n\nAs has happened before with DeFi, newer applications will likely tap the liquidity of LSD tokens by facilitating liquidity mining of their governance tokens for early depositors.\n\nWhile these can bring decent gains for some users, these protocols could carry smart contract risks and the chance of getting rug pulled, introducing the risks that come with the higher gains that LSDfi provides.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The daily chart shows the buyers facing a minor hurdle at the local top $1922 formed during the breakout of the wedge pattern. If the coin price successfully flips this barrier into suitable support, the buyers will obtain excellent follow-up for the bullish breakout and will pave the way for further recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Advocate Predicts \u201cLayer-2 Summer\u201d Next Year; Which Tokens To Rally?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe recent correction in Ethereum price rebounded below the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level projecting the overall market trend remains bullish.\n\nA potential breakout above $1922 will trigger a quick 5.5% rise in ETH\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $3.3 Billion, indicating a 28% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe June 2nd daily green candle is crucial for the Ethereum price signifying several traits for the upcoming rally. The long bullish candle formed at the recently breached angular trendline and horizontal resistance of $1850 indicates that buyers are sustaining prices at high levels and should maintain further growth.\n\nIn addition, the green candle also engulfed the last three days\u2019 price action with sufficient volume indicating the high momentum of buying. Therefore, a breakout above the overhead barrier of $1922 indicates the next significant resistance is directly at $2000 followed by $2138.\n\nIn addition, the low of the June 2nd candle stands as a important support, and therefore breakdown below it will offset the bullish thesis.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Ready to Hit $2000?\n\nThe wedge pattern breakout was a sign of a trend reversal which set the ETH price on a recovery path. In technical analysis, the swing highs formed during the development of the chart pattern are the significant target. Therefore, if the buyer breach $1922 in the coming week, the price will witness a sharp rally to $2000.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the higher band of BB indicator projects the buying is still aggressive.\n\nStochastic: The indicator slopes K%(blue) and D%(orange) have spent most time above the 80% mark in the past few months, indicating the Ethereum coin is an outperformer."

Recent data revealed that the number of certain ETH cohorts has reached an all-time low.\n\nAs holders appear to be diminishing, examining the state of ETH staking and its price dynamics becomes intriguing.\n\nEthereum holders decline\n\nRecent data from Glassnode Alert revealed a concerning trend in Ethereum cohorts holding over 10,000 ETH. The chart on Glassnode showed a gradual decline since April, with a steeper drop observed in May.\n\nAs of this writing, there were only 1,139 holders with more than 10,000 coins, marking a two-year low for this metric. To provide context, back in February, the number stood at approximately 1,213.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges also experienced a decline in recent months, adding to the enigma surrounding ETH holdings. This decline is noteworthy, particularly considering the Shappella upgrade and ETH staking activation.\n\nMassive outflow dominates Ethereum flow\n\nThe Netflow metric on Glassnode provided insight into Ethereum\u2019s recent activity, revealing a significant level of movement. However, a predominant pattern observed on the chart was negative flow, indicating more outflow than inflow.\n\nAs of this writing, the Netflow showed a negative value surpassing 70,000 ETH. Notably, on March 26, there was a substantial outflow of over 451,000 ETH, marking the highest negative flow since February.\n\nThis observation suggested that the holdings released by various cohorts, particularly the 10,000 ETH holders, might not be immediately entering the market for sale on exchanges. Instead, it was plausible that these holdings were being directed toward ETH staking activities.\n\nETH staking landscape\n\nThe Ethereum total value staked demonstrated a clear and consistent upward trajectory, evident from observing the chart. It revealed a daily increase in the value of staked ETH, with new all-time highs achieved almost daily.\n\nAs of this writing, the total value staked surpassed 24 million ETH. To put this into perspective, just a day prior, it was slightly above 23 million ETH, signifying an impressive addition of nearly a million ETH in 24 hours.\n\nFurthermore, the total number of deposits also exhibited an upward trend, closely reflecting the uptrend in the total value staked. There were over 778,000 deposits at press time, further emphasizing the continuous growth in this metric.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum price trend\n\nExamining the Ethereum price trend on a daily timeframe chart revealed a recent breakthrough above its short Moving Average (MA), represented by the yellow line. This breakout coincided with a 2.4% price increase observed on June 2. ,\n\nEthereum was trading at around $1,900 at press time, experiencing a slight loss. The current price level brought it closer to the $2,000 region, which was a psychological barrier for Ethereum\u2019s price."

        "content": "As the world moves to decentralized finance (DeFi), more people are utilizing the Ethereum network, making Ethereum's gas fees a topic of discussion in the WEB 3 space. The utility of Ethereum's ecosystem has resulted in higher gas fees and increased congestion on the network.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum gas fees\n\nGas is the measuring unit for the computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. In the Ethereum ecosystem, stakers are incentivized to maintain the network with tasks such as validating transactions.\n\nThe rewards for participating and contributing to the Ethereum network are paid in gas fees. To avoid accidental loops or other computational waste, the Ethereum network has set a limit of steps of code execution. This fundamental unit of computation is referred to as \u00a8gas\u00a8.\n\nSince cryptocurrency transactions require computational resources, every transaction requires a fee. Since there are only a limited number of participants, the network can approve a limited amount of transactions. Transactors bid with higher gas limits to prioritize their transactions.\n\nAs a result, it provides a higher incentive to validators. Gas fees also act as a security mechanism for the network. It prevents congestion caused by malicious actors or spam network transactions. They're required to maintain the quality of transactions on the network.\n\nThe importance of gas limits\n\nGas limits are hard caps on user fees applied to approve Ethereum based functions like sending Ether from one wallet to another or executing smart contracts. It refers to the maximum capacity a wallet allows to charge for fees on the network. As a security layer, it prevents transactions from overcharging due to congestion or anomalies.\n\nImportant terms to understand before setting gas limits\n\nBase fees\n\nEthereum transactions are applied to blocks to verify them. Every block has a base fee, which is the minimum cost of submitting transactions. The gas fees added to a transaction must at least equal the base fee for it to get included in the block.\n\nTip/Priority fees\n\nIn addition to base fees, a tip or a priority fee for validators can be added to the gas fees. These fees are non-mandatory extra costs added by users to fasten the verification process. Tips encourage miners to prioritize transactions on the block faster.\n\nMax fees\n\nMax fees refer to Max-Fee-Per-Gas, which are optional perimeters for gas limits. Max fees are the maximum limit users are willing to spend on gas fees. The max fee should exceed the total base fee and priority fee. The difference between the both gets refunded to the user.\n\nCalculating fees\n\nApplications running Ethereum transactions can upgrade to automate transaction fees. The suggested fees include the base fee and tips predicted by the system. This makes it easier for users to execute transactions without the complexity of calculating the required fees.\n\nGas Prices\n\nEthereum gas prices have fluctuated with its utility and the innovation of dApps (decentralized applications) building on top of the network. There are multiple factors thyat affect gas fees:\n\nFunction complexity:\n\nThe complexity of the function submitted on the Ethereum network affects the validation time. The amount of effort contributed by validators to execute the task on the network determines the initial fee charge. Multiple functionalities increase complication, requiring more computational power and higher gas fees.\n\nTransaction Urgency:\n\nThe increased utility of Ethereum-based dApps has created an urgency for validation. Layer - 2 solutions on the network help to resolve this. Nevertheless, the Ethereum blockchain still settles the transaction.\n\nNetwork status:\n\nThe Ethereum network has limited validators, and low TPS (transactions-per-second) makes it prone to congestion during busy periods. The system is maintained by gas fees, which settle urgent transactions with higher priority fees first. The network status determines gas prices, as a congested network repeatedly settles bids with higher tips before picking up transactions with base fees or no tips.\n\nHow is Ethereum gas fees calculated?\n\nGas fees are made up of two components: the gas price and the gas limit. When a user initiates a transaction on the Ethereum network, they specify the amount of gas they are willing to pay for its execution. The maximum amount the user is willing to spend is the gas limit, and the base fee rate is how much it'll cost per unit of gas.\n\nThe total gas fees can be calculated using the below formula.\n\nGas fees = Gas limit x (Base fee + Tip).\n\nThe total gas fee for a transaction can be calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the sum of the base fee and tip fee (if applied). It considers the minimum fee cost, i.e., the base fee and the priority fee or tips added to the transaction to make it faster.\n\ne.g., if a transaction has a gas limit of 100,000 and a gas price of 50 Gwei (0.000000050 ETH), the total gas fee would be 0.005 ETH (100,000 * 0.000000050).\n\nEven with correct calculations, the final gas fee can vary. The base fee fluctuates, and the price can change depending on the demand of the network. If the network is congested, transactions with higher gas fees will be prioritized. To execute urgent transactions, users increase the gas price to prioritize their transaction.\n\nWays to reduce Ethereum gas fees\n\nEthereum's current limitations on speed have been the core reason for network congestion. The upcoming scalability upgrades will eventually address the high gas fee issues; meanwhile, there are a few ways to reduce it.\n\nMonitoring demand and network congestions\n\nUsers can monitor the Ethereum network to understand its status. When demand is high, the network gets congested. One can check pending confirmed transactions on Etherscan or mempools before carrying out transactions.\n\nSync timings\n\nEthereum gas prices fluctuate aligned with the volatility of its underlying asset Ethereum. One can study Ethereum's price action and events to estimate when gas fees will be their lowest.\n\nExplore dApps\n\nUtilize the benefits of dApps built on Ethereum that provide offers on transacting and participating in their ecosystem. These decentralized applications offer lower entry barriers for newer traders by eliminating high gas fees and providing rebate offers.\n\nGas tokens\n\nUsers can earn ETH and create gas tokens by removing storage variables on the blockchain. When gas fees are low, one can mine gas tokens and utilize them later to pay gas fees or exchange them for Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2 solutions\n\nLayer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network are alternate solutions to deal with high gas fees. These complementary platforms enable users to scale up their transactions, zk-roll ups, and side chains, which results in lower gas fees and faster transaction settlement times.\n\nFuture of ETH gas fees\n\nHigh gas fees occur during high levels of congestion on the Ethereum blockchain. Executing functions on Ethereum's network consumes computational power and requires gas fees to incentive validators to carry out the task.\n\nThe fees are used to pay for calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens; each consumes different amounts of \"gas\" units. With the growing complexity of dApp functionalities, a smart contract's operations also increase as each transaction consumes more space in a limited-sized block.\n\nUpgrades to introduce improvements and advancement in Ethereum's infrastructure may address rising ETH gas prices and congestion on the network.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I choose my ETH gas limit?\n\nUsers can calculate the appropriate required gas limit by monitoring the base fee on Etherscan's gas tracker.\n\nWhy is the ETH gas limit so high?\n\nDue to increased network activity, ETH gas limits are set high. Users can set gas limits as per requirements. Non-utilized gas fees are refunded via EVM.\n\nHow much is one gwei?\n\n1 Gwei equals 0.000000001 ETH, which is one-billionth of an Ethereum.\n\nHow can I avoid high ETH gas fees?\n\nUsers can monitor network congestion and transaction timings before placing execution orders. Exploring offers on dApps, and using Layer-2 solutions can also help avoid high ETH gas fees.\n\nHow is the gas fee calculated?\n\nThe total gas fee for a transaction can be calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the sum of the base fee and tip fee (if applied). The total gas fees can be calculated using the formula: Gas fees = Gas limit x (Base fee + tip)."

        "content": "The Ethereum price could see a stronger increase again in the coming months. With the coming year 2024, the next bull market is very likely to be around the corner. The $10,000 mark, which some analysts saw as early as 2021, should be just around the corner. But how high could the Ethereum price rise at the top of the bear market? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article!\n\nHow did Ethereum Perform in the last few weeks?\n\nThe Ethereum price has seen more of a sideways movement in the last few weeks. The year 2023 started with a strong increase. At the turn of the year, the ETH rate was still below $1,200. After the rise of the first weeks of the new year, the ETH price rose by almost 50% to $1,700.\n\nAfter a brief crash at the beginning of March, the Ethereum price rose sharply again and saw the breakthrough above the $2,000 mark in April. After peaking at $2,100, the price has fallen back below $2,000 in recent weeks. The ETH price recently moved between 1,800 and 1,900 dollars.\n\nHow much can the ETH price rise in the bull market?\n\nThe Ethereum price was able to see a significant increase again in 2023. However, the price is still well below the all-time high of $4,800 from 2021. But after the Bitcoin Halving in April next year, the new bull market should start, in which the Ethereum price could also rise massively again.\n\nIn the last bull market, the ETH price was also able to rise extremely sharply. At the lowest point of the previous bear market, the Ethereum price was still 80 dollars. From there, the price was able to rally to $4,800, a 60-fold increase.\n\nIn bull markets, altcoins such as Ethereum usually see larger percentage increases than the Bitcoin price. However, the price increases of Bitcoin and Ethereum have also converged in recent years.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can Ethereum reach $20,000?\n\nBased on this experience, the Ethereum price can still rise very sharply in the coming months until the bull market. The low of the last few months was slightly below the $1,000 mark. Therefore, a rise by a factor of 10 to $10,000 in the coming bull market should be feasible.\n\nAn increase by a factor of 60 will very likely not happen again. But a 20x rally from the bear market lows to the next all-time bull market high definitely seems possible. An Ethereum price of $20,000 in the next bull market therefore seems quite likely.\n\nDo you want to trade Ethereum?

        "content": "Starknet is an open-source framework designed to enhance scalability and privacy for decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nStarknet has experienced significant growth in usage by various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the network in recent months leading to a notable increase in its total value locked (TVL), which represents the amount of cryptocurrency assets secured within the protocol.\n\nAt the time of writing, Starknet\u2019s TVL is reported to be about $12 million. This represents a significant ten-fold increase compared to the TVL just 3 months ago.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is a widely used metric in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It represents the total value of assets, typically in the form of cryptocurrencies, that are locked or deposited within a specific DeFi protocol, platform, or smart contract.\n\nTVL is used as an indicator of the level of activity and liquidity within the protocol, providing insights into its popularity and the extent to which users trust it with their assets.\n\nHow Starknet Scales Ethereum\n\nStarknet, developed by Israeli-based company, StarkWare, enhances the Ethereum network\u2019s performance by enabling off-chain computations and data storage while maintaining the security guarantees provided by the underlying blockchain.\n\nBy moving computations off-chain and storing only the necessary data on-chain, Starknet aims to improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction fees. This is achieved through a technology called ZK-rollups, which allows for the aggregation of multiple off-chain transactions into a single on-chain proof. This approach enhances scalability while preserving the decentralized and trustless nature of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI certainly cannot give any investment advice, but there are many many developers that understand that in order to unleash Ethereum\u2019s scale reaching a global demand, you need new, safe, and battle-tested technologies,\u201d StarkWare President and Co-Founder, Eli Ben-Sasson, said in a recent interview, adding that Starknet is already recognized as a \u2018hell of a technology stack.\u2019\n\nStarknet utilizes a layer-2 scaling technique called zero-knowledge rollups to achieve scalability and cost-efficiency. Zero-knowledge rollups bundle numerous transactions together off-chain, known as the data availability layer, and generate a succinct proof that attests to the validity of these transactions. This proof is then submitted and verified on the Ethereum blockchain, known as the execution layer.\n\nJediSwap, a permissionless automated market maker (AMM) is currently the major player in the Starknet ecosystem, commanding over 57% of the TVL, which amounts to more than $6 million.\n\nStarknet is however under stiff competition in the Ethereum layer two market with the likes of Arbitrum and Optimism, for example, commanding TVLs of $2.4 billion and $884 million, respectively. The growth of these two, some of the earliest scaling technologies, comes following swift adoption among DeFi heavyweights on each network, including Uniswap, Aave, and Curve.\n\nStarknet, on its part, points to Cairo, a programming language inspired by Rust, as the key behind its growth. According to Ben Sasson, Cairo is \u2018the most modern and best smart contract language out there that developers are flocking to.\u2019\n\nSasson adds that Starknet is scheduled to upgrade to version 0.12 in June 2023 and is anticipated to bring notable improvements, particularly in terms of increased throughput.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\n____________________________________\n\n____________________________________"

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has made an $800 million ether (ETH) staking move that has caused significant delays in the Ethereum validator queue. The company deposited $745 million of ETH into staking contracts in just two days, adding to the already long waiting time to deploy new validators on the Ethereum network.\n\nCelsius Ethereum Staking\n\nCelsius is reshuffling its staked ETH holdings after Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade allowed withdrawals from staking contracts. This strategic shake-up has caused the queue to stretch to 44 days, with Celsius potentially adding nearly a week of delay, according to Tom Wan of 21Shares.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPreviously, Celsius held 460,000 ETH ($870 million) staked with Lido Finance and deployed 160,000 tokens ($300 million) in their own staking pool.\n\nCoinGape reported that it has reportedly withdrawn 428,000 staked Ethereum (stETH) valued at $780 million.\n\nBankrupt Crypto Lender Case\n\nThe reshuffling of staked assets coincides with Celsius\u2019 ongoing efforts to restructure following a bankruptcy protection filing in July. The company faced liquidity issues due to plummeting cryptocurrency prices and a surge in user withdrawals.\n\nRecently, the U.S. bankruptcy court auctioned off Celsius to Fahrenheit, an investment group backed by Arrington Capital, which will take over the lender\u2019s assets, including institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, and crypto mining units.\n\nRead Former Celsius CEO\u2019s 1B Plan\u2026\n\nCelsius Network on May 25 announced the completion of the auction process to transfer the assets to crypto consortium Fahrenheit LLC.\n\nEven after these transfers, Celsius\u2019 wallets still hold around $109 million worth of ETH, according to data from Arkham. However, this influx of staking activity has further strained the Ethereum validator queue, which was already burdened with increased demand since the activation of the Shanghai upgrade on April 12.\n\nDeposits have exceeded withdrawals by nearly $5.5 billion, leaving new participants with a month-long wait to set up validators, according to blockchain intelligence firm Nansen."

        "content": "The crypto space has witnessed a remarkable variety of new token standards and exciting innovations. For example, the emergence of BRC-20 brought new possibilities to the Bitcoin network.\n\nNow, Ethereum has ERC-4337, which promises exciting new possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem and wider Web3 adoption. Read on to find out more.\n\nTL;DR\n\nEnhances Ethereum wallets: ERC-4337's smart wallet agreements offer adaptable protection and features, allowing for versatile management of wallets through account abstraction.\n\nSubsidizes transaction fees: Enables subsidies for transactions, ultimately cutting expenses and increasing accessibility to Ethereum.\n\nSupports ERC-20 for fees : Provides the option to pay transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens, expanding the range of choices beyond solely relying on Ether (ETH).\n\nPrioritizes privacy: Combining signatures improves privacy and security, safeguarding personal information while conducting transactions.\n\nUser-friendly innovations: Using elements such as biometric identification and time-based social recovery enhances convenience and protection. This streamlines the process of accessing and retrieving wallets without requiring intricate protocol modifications.\n\nWhat are ERC-4337 and account abstraction?\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that gives you access to smart wallet contracts. Smart wallet contracts allow you to program your wallet for greater security and usability through what's called account abstraction. Account abstraction upgrades the Externally Owned Account (EOA) \u2014 an Ethereum account required to interact with the Ethereum network \u2014 so it can be controlled by smart contracts. The result? Greater flexibility to program your own security rules, simpler account recovery should you lose your keys, and the option for social recovery.\n\nERC-4337 also allows for subsidized transaction fees, which means that you may have your transaction costs partially or fully covered by external sources. This opens up possibilities for more affordable and accessible transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nAnother significant feature of ERC-4337 is the ability to pay transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens. This means that instead of paying fees exclusively in Ether (ETH), you can use other tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain to cover transaction costs. This introduces a new level of flexibility and convenience should you hold various ERC-20 tokens in your wallets.\n\nPreserving privacy\n\nAlongside usability, one of the most significant aspects of ERC-4337 is its privacy features, which address concerns about data confidentiality. These features enable you to engage in transactions while safeguarding your privacy and sensitive information. To achieve this, the token standard incorporates aggregated signatures, which enhance security and reduce transaction costs by combining multiple signatures into a single, more efficient signature.\n\nERC-4337 goes beyond technical advancements by introducing user-friendly wallet features. These features include biometric authentication, allowing you to access your wallet using fingerprint or facial recognition to simplify the login process and enhance security.\n\nMeanwhile, time-locked social recovery provides a safety net for wallet access, allowing you to recover your account with the assistance of trusted friends or family members if you lose access to your wallet. What makes ERC-4337 even more remarkable is its implementation as an ERC standard, rather than requiring a complex protocol update.\n\nThis streamlines the adoption process, saving time and effort while providing compatibility with existing Ethereum infrastructure. As a result, the features of ERC-4337 are more readily available to all users, fostering Ethereum's growth and attracting newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe origins of account abstraction\n\nAccount abstraction, an intriguing concept in the Ethereum ecosystem, has been the subject of deliberation and exploration for several years. In 2016, Vitalik Buterin presented EIP-86, a proposal to enable smart contracts to initiate and authorize transactions. However, EIP-86 was never rolled out because it would have required changes to the Ethereum consensus layer.\n\nIn 2020, EIP-2938 and EIP-3074 were introduced, allowing smart contracts to be used as accounts. But similar to EIP-86, these two proposals would also require changes to the Ethereum consensus layer.\n\nIn response, ERC-4337 was proposed in 2021, presenting a solution that enabled account abstraction using a separate mempool. As a result, this approach required no consensus layer modifications.\n\nThe Ethereum community welcomed the introduction of ERC-4337, appreciating its ability to support account abstraction while maintaining the stability and integrity of the network.\n\nPotential drawbacks of ERC-4337\n\nERC-4337 does have some limitations when observing its impact on the Ethereum network.\n\nHigher gas fees\n\nGas fees are a primary drawback. Transactions using the ERC-4337 standard may incur higher gas costs than regular transactions, potentially making them less affordable for certain users. Gas fees are a fundamental part of Ethereum's blockchain, serving as the mechanism for allocating resources and preventing spam and abuse. However, the increased gas costs associated with ERC-4337 could create barriers to adoption and usage, limiting accessibility and hindering widespread acceptance of the standard.\n\nIt's crucial to balance the cost of transactions and the benefits offered by ERC-4337 to guarantee its viability and inclusivity within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCentralization concerns\n\nAnother challenge for ERC-4337 is the potential for increased centralization. The standard relies heavily on smart contracts to manage accounts, which raises the possibility of a few developers and organizations gaining control over the underlying infrastructure.\n\nThis concentration of power contradicts the decentralized principles that Ethereum aims to uphold. Centralization can introduce risks such as limited transparency, biased decision making, and reduced user trust. Therefore, it's essential to make sure the development and governance of ERC-4337 remains inclusive, transparent, and open to community participation.\n\nAdded complexity\n\nThe arrival of ERC-4337 may bring increased complexity to the Ethereum ecosystem. The standard introduces new concepts and features that may be more challenging for developers to understand and apply effectively. This complexity could lead to errors and security vulnerabilities, potentially compromising the overall stability and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nMitigating the drawbacks\n\nMany believe it's possible to address the drawbacks of ERC-4337 by providing comprehensive documentation, educational resources, and developer support. These actions can help developers to effectively navigate the complexities of ERC-4337 and create secure and robust applications.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs Ethereum continues to push boundaries, other blockchains may need to incorporate similar features to remain competitive. This competition could drive innovation, benefiting users by creating a more dynamic and diverse ecosystem of blockchain platforms.\n\nWe're proud to be a part of a collaborative effort in building ERC-7579, along with Rhinestone, Biconomy, and ZeroDev. ERC-7579 tackles a common problem \u2014 the complexity and rigidity of existing standards, notably ERC-6900.\n\nWhile ERC-6900 advanced the development of modular smart accounts, ERC-7579 sought to simplify the approach further. It focused on standardizing essential interfaces for smart accounts and modules, offering developers greater flexibility and creativity without the burden of heavy restrictions.\n\nThe buzz surrounding ERC-7579 is due to the urgent demand in the blockchain arena for a consistent standard that can reduce division and enhance the compatibility of smart accounts.\n\nThe success of ERC-7579 hinges on its compatibility with ERC-4337 for account abstraction. This harmonization of standards allows smart accounts to seamlessly communicate with different decentralized applications (DApps), providing users with a uniform and user-friendly experience, irrespective of the technology used.\n\nBefore ERC-7579, smart accounts functioned independently, posing difficulties for developers to create modules that could work on different platforms.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe blockchain space continues to evolve with notable innovations such as ERC-4337 on Ethereum, which promises enhanced usability and wider Web3 adoption.\n\nThis standard introduces smart contract wallets with customizable security and simplified account recovery. It also uses ERC-20 tokens for transaction fees, making it more accessible and user-friendly without complicated protocol changes.\n\nThe development of ERC-7579 seeks to simplify blockchain standards by focusing on essential smart account interfaces. By improving compatibility and effectiveness between various platforms, ERC-7579 can effectively work alongside ERC-4337.\n\nThese developments mark a significant stride towards creating a more cohesive and accessible blockchain network, and could significantly strengthen Ethereum's position in the blockchain space."

        "content": "The U.S. debt ceiling decision propelled S&P 500 and gold prices, surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were trading at a profit on a daily timeframe at press time.\n\nIn a fascinating turn of events, the prices of the S&P 500 and gold have taken a leap, outshining Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. This remarkable shift can be attributed to the U.S. Congress\u2019s decision on 1 June, wherein they opted to suspend the country\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum below traditional stocks\n\nThe United States Congress has successfully endorsed an agreement that increases the government\u2019s borrowing limit to avert the potential calamity of defaulting on debt repayments. The Senate passed the deal on 1 June, and the House of Representatives approved it the day before.\n\nOnce signed into law by President Joe Biden, this agreement will enable the federal government to borrow funds until after the next presidential election in November 2024.\n\nThe trend of cryptos and equities\n\nFascinating insights from Santiment revealed that the decision to raise the debt ceiling profoundly impacted the price movements of various assets.\n\nTraditional stocks, as exemplified by the S&P 500, witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching their highest level since August. Moreover, the price of gold also experienced an upward lift, as indicated by the chart.\n\nAs of this writing, the S&P 500 price had surpassed the $4000 mark, while gold exceeded $1,900.\n\nOn the other hand, the chart demonstrated that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, were trailing behind equities. They were experiencing a comparatively lower performance than traditional stocks, showing a weak correlation.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price trend\n\nBitcoin has recently witnessed a series of fluctuations, oscillating between highs and lows but consistently remaining below the $30,000 price threshold. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $27,160, showcasing a modest gain of over 1%.\n\nIt was exhibiting a bearish trend at press time, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a daily timeframe. Nevertheless, there was a noticeable uptrend in its RSI line, thanks to a price increase.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nIn a similar vein, Ethereum has also been trading with a profit. Its value at the time of writing stood around $1,890, reflecting a gain of over 1.5%. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was experiencing a bullish trend, according to its RSI line.\n\nAs for the future, it remains uncertain whether there will be a stronger correlation between the price movements of Bitcoin, Ethereum, the S&P 500, and gold in the coming days."

        "title": "MetaMask Wallet Review: Is MetaMask A Good Wallet? - Milk Road",
        "content": "Expert Review: MetaMask Wallet In Transactions\n\nCrypto wallets are serious business, but MetaMask makes it fun. When you first install the extension, the fox icon follows your cursor movements. The well-known fox icon represents an anonymous identity. Your wallet becomes your sign-in for web3 apps rather than a username and password.\n\nI tested the MetaMask extension as well as the mobile app, looking for undiscovered features and evaluating everyday usability.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Chrome Extension Review\n\nWallet\n\nSending crypto on MetaMask is intuitive. To receive crypto, you\u2019ll need to copy the wallet address to the clipboard or click on the three-dot menu to get a scannable QR code from the account details screen.\n\nWhen sending crypto using the extension, I was offered the option to change the gas fee. Higher fees typically provide faster transfers. Lower-fee transactions can get stuck for a while if the network is busy.\n\nI did encounter one problem with the wallet: A token I sent to the wallet wasn\u2019t detected. I had to add the token manually, which can be done from the home screen (import tokens).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask lets you buy crypto through several providers:\n\nCoinbase Pay (not available on Polygon)\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\nCoinbase Pay connects your Coinbase account and some (but not all) payment methods you have saved in Coinbase. You can send ETH from your Coinbase exchange wallet or buy ETH with your bank account or cash you have on the exchange. I didn\u2019t find an option to send other tokens, just ETH.\n\nMoonPay, another crypto provider, offers six tokens, including ETH and three stablecoins. The minimum purchase is $30 with a $3.99 minimum fee.\n\nSwaps\n\nMetaMask provides a swap feature, which works like an aggregator and compares exchange rates from liquidity pools, including:\n\nUniswap\n\n1inch\n\nParaSwap\n\nand others\n\nSwap fees are 0.875% and help fund MetaMask\u2019s development.\n\ndApp Connections\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension doesn\u2019t include an app browser, but it runs in a browser \u2013 so everything is just a new tab away.\n\nSupport\n\nMetaMask offers support through two channels: a chatbot and a community support forum.\n\nThe chatbot was able to point me in the right direction but didn\u2019t answer the question directly. The linked article I selected from the suggested list didn\u2019t answer the question directly either but was helpful in that it discussed using trusted bridges.\n\nIf the chatbot can\u2019t help, you\u2019ll be able to speak with an agent. In my case, I spoke with Danny, who was very helpful and did answer my question: To bridge tokens from one block to another, you can connect your MetaMask wallet to the portfolio site dApp linked on the main page of the extension.\n\nPortfolio Site\n\nAn easily overlooked link on the main page of MetaMask\u2019s extension points to the portfolio site dApp, from which you can see an overview of your assets on all blockchains you added to MetaMask. (Assets locked in smart contracts won\u2019t show, however.)\n\nFrom the dApp, you can also make swaps or use a bridge to move assets from one blockchain to another. A watchlist lets you track token prices.\n\nI used the bridge, still marked as Beta, to move MATIC from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon.\n\nThe actual cost of the transaction was $1.33 compared to the quoted fee of $8.53. Thanks, MetaMask!\n\nMetaMask Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nMetaMask ran poorly at startup on my octa-core Android phone. Once up and running, the app worked smoothly.\n\nThe mobile app supports fingerprint authentication or password authentication for login, protecting your crypto from phone thieves and snooping phone fiddlers.\n\nI synced the mobile wallet with the Chrome extension using the 12-word recovery phrase to explore its features.\n\nWallet\n\nSending and receiving worked as expected on mobile. However, I didn\u2019t find a setting to enable adjustable gas fees like on the extension.\n\nSwitching networks just takes a click but can only be done from the network listing on the wallet home screen. This is something to keep in mind if you wander off to explore dApps on a network not supported by the dApp (like I did).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask mobile offered fewer options for buying compared to the extension. Notably, Coinbase Pay was missing in my region.\n\nOther options include:\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\ndApp Browser\n\nConnecting blockchain apps with crypto wallets can be a challenge on mobile devices, so MetaMask includes a dApp browser. Coinbase wallet offers a similar feature.\n\nApps are sorted by category, including decentralized finance, decentralized exchanges, collectibles, etc.\n\nPopular dApp Browser Apps:\n\nUsing the MetaMask app browser, I stopped by Uniswap to check on my liquidity pool. Uniswap didn\u2019t see my MetaMask Polygon wallet, instead suggesting I connect with my Coinbase wallet.\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the MetaMask browser extension for dApps, but the mobile app is great for sending and receiving on the go.\n\nWhat Is MetaMask Wallet?\n\nMetaMask is a DeFi cryptocurrency wallet initially built by ConsenSys for the Ethereum network. Since its inception in 2016, support for additional networks has been added, including Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and many others \u2013 all just a click away.\n\nThe growth of decentralized applications (dApps) helps fuel MetaMask\u2019s popularity; ETH-compatible dApps commonly offer MetaMask as the top option to connect a wallet.\n\nWith decentralized apps, MetaMask acts as both a wallet and a signing key to approve smart contracts. When an app needs permission to perform actions, the app passes a request over to your wallet. MetaMask then shows you the details, prompting you to accept or reject the request.\n\nAbove, the decentralized exchange Uniswap is asking MetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension to sign a smart contract I initiated. MetaMask also provides a mobile app for Android and iOS.\n\nHow Does MetaMask Wallet Work?\n\nMetaMask is a hot wallet, meaning it\u2019s connected to the internet, and the private keys are generated on an online device. Most wallets use two keys: a public key and a private key. The latter is what lets you spend or transfer crypto and approve transactions.\n\nNothing leaves your MetaMask wallet unless the transaction is signed with the private key generated when you set up your wallet for the first time.\n\nThe private key is a long string of numbers and letters that\u2019s nearly impossible to memorize, so most wallets use a recovery phrase of 12 to 24 words that lets your wallet re-generate the private key if needed. MetaMask uses 12 words. You\u2019ll also secure your wallet with a (required) password.\n\nMetaMask uses Ethereum as the default network, but the wallet supports multiple Ethereum-compatible networks, such as Polygon and Optimism. While visible in the same wallet app, assets on each blockchain remain separate. You\u2019ll have to switch networks to access the assets on each chain.\n\nMetaMask lets you connect to popular dApps like Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or games and metaverse projects like Axie Infinity or Decentraland.\n\nThe alternative to hot wallets like MetaMask is cold wallets, typically hardware wallets \u2013 devices that store your private keys offline and can connect to a computer or phone when needed. MetaMask can pair with hardware wallets like Ledger, adding an extra permission layer if an app wants to access your wallet. This step can help protect against scams and allows you to confirm each transaction on your hardware device.\n\nMetaMask provides a near-perfect solution if you\u2019re exploring the ETH-based world of crypto. But if you need to store Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Cardano, you\u2019ll need a separate wallet.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Notable Features\n\nFeature Explanation Enhanced token detection MetaMask can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually. Support for hardware wallets Pair MetaMask with Ledger or Trezor devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions. Multiple blockchain support Easily add support for Polygon or other lower-cost ETH-compatible networks. Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with a slider to match the transaction\u2019s priority. Swaps Use MetaMask\u2019s smart transactions to reduce costs when swapping tokens within the wallet app.\n\nMetaMask starts out with a simple feature set, but you can add more functionality in the settings. Enhanced token detection, additional blockchains, and a gas fee UI based on EIP-1559 are just a few clicks away.\n\nMulti-Asset Support\n\nMetaMask supports ERC-20 tokens, including the tokens listed below, as well as ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nAave (AAVE)\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nMatic (MATIC)\n\nAnd many more.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s token detection attempts to identify new tokens you add to your wallet. Most of the time, it works. You can add the token manually in the rare case where MetaMask misses one.\n\nSecurity\n\nMetaMask asks you to set up a password as a first step. After that, the wallet generates a private key and provides you with a 12-word recovery phrase so you can restore your wallet if needed. This is standard fare for hot wallets. The 12-word passphrase can also be used with other wallets, such as Coinbase wallet or Brave wallet, so guard it carefully. Anyone who finds your recovery phrase won\u2019t need MetaMask to access your wallet.\n\nI connected my MetaMask wallet to my Ledger hardware wallet, a simple process that creates up to five new accounts in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nFunds in these new accounts can only be accessed with the hardware wallet but other accounts in MetaMask won\u2019t require your hardware device.\n\nHow To Set Up Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nMetaMask offers a Chrome extension and mobile app. Here\u2019s how to set up the Chrome extension.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install MetaMask.\n\nGo to MetaMask to get the official download link for the extension. MetaMask is open-source software, so it\u2019s easy to make a copy of the app modified for nefarious purposes. Get the real thing.\n\nStep 2: Open MetaMask And Agree To The Terms.\n\nThe Chrome extension should open automatically after it\u2019s installed. You can also find the extension in the extension manager at the top right of Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.\n\nAgree to the terms to get started\n\nStep 3: Create A New Wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to MetaMask, choose the option on the right to create a new wallet. You can use the (recovery phrase) option on the left to add your wallet to additional devices later.\n\nAs a first step, MetaMask will ask you to create a password (write it down). The next screen provides a helpful video explaining how MetaMask works and the role of your secret (recovery) phrase.\n\nStep 4: Write Down Your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\nMetaMask automatically generates a 12-word recovery phrase. You\u2019ll need this phrase to use your wallet on another device or if you need to restore your wallet. Keep your recovery phrase somewhere safe. If someone finds it, they can access the funds in your wallet.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to verify the 12-word phrase in the extension.\n\nStep 5: Add Networks (If Needed) And Add Funds.\n\nMetaMask defaults to the Ethereum network. You can add networks by clicking on the Ethereum Mainnet dropdown menu.\n\nAfter adding the networks you want, you can transfer ETH-compatible tokens from another wallet or from an exchange like Coinbase. Be sure to use the correct network when making transfers and only transfer compatible tokens.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nMetaMask offers powerful functionality in a fun-to-use browser extension with plenty of customization options available in settings. The mobile app may be better suited to simple transactions, like sending some crypto to a friend when you\u2019re splitting the cost of a pizza.\n\nHot wallets bring risks, such as bugs or hacks, that can expose your private key. But Ledger integration can make MetaMask a safer choice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs MetaMask Wallet Safe? MetaMask is a hot wallet, which can expose your private key due to exploits or coding bugs. However, you can pair MetaMask with a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to add another layer of security. Is MetaMask Better Than Coinbase Wallet? Each wallet has its advantages and disadvantages. Coinbase\u2019s mobile wallet can hold Bitcoin as well as ETH tokens, whereas MetaMask is easier to use. Many people use both wallets. Does MetaMask Charge Monthly Fees? MetaMask is free to use, but some activities within the wallet come at a cost. Sending crypto or signing smart contracts both cost fees. Additionally, buying or swapping crypto in the wallet comes with fees. Why Is MetaMask So Popular? MetaMask was started in 2016, so the wallet has had a lot of time to gain acceptance and refine features. It\u2019s also easy to use, supports several ETH-compatible networks, and automatically detects new tokens in your wallet. Can I Link My Bank Account To MetaMask? When buying crypto through MetaMask, you can use your bank account in some cases. But there is no way to withdraw crypto or USD from MetaMask to your bank account.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "content": "Jun 03, 2023 at 13:10 // Price\n\nCoin Idol Author\n\nEthereum price (ETH) is in the bullish trend zone as it moves three times closer to the resistance level of $1,920.\n\nLong-term analysis of the Ethereum price: bullish\n\nSince the price cut on May 11, the Ether price has only fluctuated between $1,750 and $1,920. The rising movement was stopped by the moving average lines. On May 28, the price of Ether rose above the moving average lines again. Before it was rejected, Ether reached a high of $1,925. After the price collapse on May 11, this was the first time the uptrend was restricted. The coin has already been rejected two other times. The largest altcoin is now sold at $1,902. If the bears fall below the moving average lines, the selling pressure on Ether will increase again. The price of Ether will fall to the lower range if it rises above the support level of $1,750. Currently, Ether is trading above the moving average lines but below the resistance level.\n\nEthereum indicator analysis\n\nEther will start to rise again when the Relative Strength Index for period 14 reaches 56. It is unlikely that Ether will climb upwards as the market is overbought. If the bears break below the moving average lines, the selling pressure on Ether will increase again. The risk associated with Ether has decreased as the stochastic on the daily chart is currently above the 80 level. Sellers are expected to emerge in the overbought zone and lower prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Indicators:\n\nKey resistance levels - $2,000 and $2,500\n\nKey support levels - $1,800 and $1,300\n\nWhat is the next direction for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is expected to continue its movement between $1,750 and $1,920 as it faces rejection from the recent high. The largest altcoin would have continued its uptrend if it had broken the resistance level. Ether would have fallen back to the psychological ceiling of $2,000. For the time being, the largest altcoin will maintain its trend within the range.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer. This analysis and forecast are the personal opinions of the author and are not a recommendation to buy or sell cryptocurrency and should not be viewed as an endorsement by CoinIdol.

        "content": "Ethereum is the largest network for DeFi and dApps, with a TVL of $27.04 billion.\n\nThe news of the bridging pumped TRX to its highest value since May 2022.\n\nJustin Sun, founder of the TRON [TRX] blockchain, announced that the network\u2019s native token, TRX, will be fully accessible on the largest altcoin network, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nAccording to Sun, this was made possible by using the BitTorrent Bridge, a cross-chain transfer solution which facilitates movement of assets and data between blockchains.\n\nThe news of the bridging pumped TRX to its highest value since May 2022. At the time of writing, it had surged by 9.59% in the 24-hour period to be valued at $0.08356, data from CoinMarketCap revealed.\n\n#TRON (#TRX) has now expanded its reach by going live on the #Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the #BitTorrent bridge . With the contract address 0x50327c6c5a14dcade707abad2e27eb517df87ab5, #TRX is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem. \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) June 2, 2023\n\nTRX enters a new universe\n\nThe move has the potential to boost TRX\u2019s liquidity like never before. It can help TRX holders to access the wide array of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols functioning on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum users will be able to utilize the bridged TRX token to access applications on the Tron network. This addresses one of the major issues with blockchains \u2013 lack of interoperability.\n\nRecall that, Ethereum is the largest network for DeFi and dApps, with a total value locked (TVL) of a staggering $27.04 billion at press time, according to data from Artemis. On the other hand, Tron, which comes second-best in the list, held assets worth $5.55 billion.\n\nTron gets busier\n\nThe Tron network has been on a tear lately, witnessing a massive spike in network traffic. The chain hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing 11.47 million transactions on 2 June, as per Tronscan.\n\nIn the last 30 days, the average daily transaction on TRON was 8.78 million.\n\nOverall, the total number of transactions increased by 1.6% in the last month, reflecting growing demand for the proof-of-stake network.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 TRXs worth today?\n\nDeflationary trend continues\n\nWith the intention of long-term market value growth, TRON continued to apply deflationary pressure on TRX. The network removed about 17.21 million tokens out of circulation on 2 June.\n\nAs the number of new tokens produced on the network stayed mostly unchanged, the net issuance rate, or inflation rate, decreased further to -15.43 million, extending TRX\u2019s deflationary streak.\n\nWith the spike in burn activity, TRX\u2019s circulating supply contracted considerably in 2023. At the time of writing, about 90.2 billion tokens were in public hands, having shrunk nearly 2% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis."

        "title": "Ethereum holding price better than Bitcoin, can Avorak Trade explain why? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Avorak Trade has been making waves in the crypto market while still in development. With the Ethereum (ETH) holding price better than Bitcoin (BTC), investors wonder whether Avorak Trade can help.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) price\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. The correlation between the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) prices was close to 1.0, which made it less crucial to track. However, recent reports indicate a decline in the correlation, dropping from 0.95 in mid-March to 0.82 in mid-April. ETH is gaining more value in relation to BTC as time progresses. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including Ethereum\u2019s recent technical upgrades. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s diversified ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more, sets it apart from Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a payment method. Investors increasingly recognize Ethereum\u2019s potential, and some speculate that with a stronger and more diversified ecosystem, Ethereum could eventually flip Bitcoin. However, the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and it remains to be seen whether Ethereum (ETH) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) and become the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nWhat is Avorak Trade? Can it help?\n\nAvorak Trade is a powerful trading tool developed by Avorak AI. It can offer valuable insights and assistance in understanding the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets, including the contrasting price movements of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).

        "content": "While the Bitcoin price prediction by Google Bard brings exciting insights for investors and market participants, the Collateral Network (COLT) token emerges as a groundbreaking innovation. COLT has already showcased remarkable growth during its presale, surpassing Ethereum (ETH) and attracting a major investor base.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBard\u2019s Crystal Ball Illuminates the Price Path of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nWhen asked about the Bitcoin possible price at the end of 2023, Bard AI responded with a range of possibilities. According to its research, Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $40,000, offering a bullish outlook for investors.\n\nHowever, Bard AI cautioned that there is also a possibility of the Bitcoin (BTC) price falling below $30,000, acknowledging the inherent volatility in the crypto market. The famous AI tool stressed the importance of considering various factors that may impact the Bitcoin price trajectory, including the state of the global economy.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nA flourishing global economy tends to boost investor confidence, making them more inclined to invest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, if the global economy thrives in 2023, it could positively impact the Bitcoin price. But, unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s our reality following the COVID crisis.\n\nAs of now, BTC is trading at $27,785. After a sustained period of unusually low volatility, BTC is poised for a significant price jump, possibly reaching $32,000. This estimate is based on its calculated \u2018true cost basis,\u2019 which is determined by excluding permanently lost coins and focusing on the activity of active investors.\n\nHowever, despite this optimistic prediction, many investors, weary from the bear Bitcoin market, might sell off their holdings once BTC hits this price, potentially dampening the expected surge.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Action and Whale Activity Signal Market Dynamics\n\nEthereum recently experienced a period of stability, hovering around the 100-day moving average of $1,790 before finding support and moving higher. However, during the consolidation correction phase since mid-April, the Ethereum price formed a descending wedge pattern.\n\nDuring the day, the Ethereum (ETH) price reached the upper boundary of the wedge at $1.900, propelled by its recent surge, but it dropped immediately to the current price of $1,880.\n\nIn parallel, an Ethereum whale deposited 23,080 ETH, valued at approximately $44 million, just 20 minutes after the cryptocurrency\u2019s price surpassed $1,904. This suggests that major holders are starting to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s recent upward movement.\n\nDespite the sizable withdrawal, the Ethereum market performance started declining, suggesting that the broader market sentiment may turn bearish and push the price below the support line of $1,820.\n\nIf the Ethereum price breaches this support level, investors should pay attention to $1,817. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum will invalidate the bullish thesis and could trigger a correction to $1,703.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Is Transforming Web3 Peer-To-Peer Lending\n\nCollateral Network is revolutionizing Web3 peer-to-peer lending by integrating cutting-edge blockchain technology that enhances efficiency and security. Its unique approach enables users to unlock the value of physical assets through asset monetization, offering a range of benefits to investors and borrowers.\n\nImagine you own a valuable vintage car worth $400,000 and need liquidity.\n\nFirst, you send your car to Collateral Network as loan collateral. Collateral Network will authenticate its value and safeguard the asset. Then, Collateral Network utilizes innovative technology to mint an NFT, serving as a digital representation of your physical asset. This way, the NFT becomes a 100% asset-backed investment opportunity. The NFT is fractionalized, allowing multiple investors to provide liquidity to the loan and receive passive income in return.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nUpon repayment of the principal loan and the agreed-upon interest, Collateral Network burns the NFTs. Your vehicle is redeemed from Collateral Network\u2019s vault, ensuring a seamless and efficient process.\n\nCollateral Network provides a competitive edge to investors by offering increased liquidity and voting rights on upcoming listings to token holders. Currently trading at $0.014, analysts predict a significant surge in the Collateral Network (COLT) market value to $0.35 (a remarkable 3500% increase) in the coming months!\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In a significant development for the crypto community, Etherescan has unveiled a groundbreaking feature that promises to revolutionize the way users access and interpret on-chain data. With its advanced filter, Etherescan has taken a giant leap forward in making blockchain analytics more accessible and user-friendly, catering to the growing demand for transparency and information in the world of crypto.\n\nEtherscan\u2019s Advance Filter \u2013 What is it?\n\nWhat exactly is the purpose of this new feature? The Advanced Filter is an extremely useful feature that allows users to filter and personalize their search results based on specified criteria. Users can use Etherscan\u2019s Advanced Filter to gain important insights and do customized analyses on the enormous Ethereum blockchain data.\n\nUsers can focus on transactions, addresses, and activities that are most relevant to their research, monitoring, or investigative needs by narrowing search results based on particular criteria.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nHow to use the Advance Filter\n\nNote that Advance Filter can be accessed through Etherscan\u2019s address page. The Advance Filter can be used in the following segments:\n\n1. To filter the transaction type\n\nUse this filter to narrow down your analysis to specific transaction categories of interest. How do you go about it?\n\n1. First, select All- and this Includes all the transaction types.\n\n2. Secondly, focus on transactions involving an EOA (Externally Owned Address, or what is referred to as a wallet address) sending ETH directly to other addresses.\n\n3. Then Internal Txs: Transactions that are consequences of smart contract logic triggered by regular transactions.\n\n4. Focus on ERC-20: These are transactions involving ERC-20 tokens.\n\n5. Then, the ERC-721 involves transactions involving non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n6. ERC-1155 for the transactions involving semi-fungible ERC-1155 tokens (SFTs).\n\n7. Deposit: Focuses on transactions involving the deposit of ETH into the Beacon Chain Contract in order to validate Ethereum.\n\n8. Withdrawal: This involves transactions involving the withdrawal of ETH from the Beacon Chain as a result of automatic reward withdrawal or exiting as a validator.\n\n2. Method\n\nThis refers to the function being carried out in a transaction based on the decoded input data. It is part of the transaction\u2019s input data and specifies the name of the function as well as any required parameters. In addition, you can filter by any known function name and method ID. Typical operations include Transfer, Mint, and Swap.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n3. Etherscan Advance Filter on Age\n\nThis filter can be used to analyze transactions and activity over different time frames, providing insights into recent or historical events. The \u201cAge\u201d box allows you to choose between predefined time ranges (e.g., last 1h, last 24h, last 7d, last 30d, last 90d) and a custom length.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n4. Filter transaction from the said address to the receiver\n\nYou have the option of including or excluding transactions involving certain addresses. This filter also allows for the addition of multiple addresses, allowing for more intricate and precise filtering. You can enter up to 5 Ethereum addresses and choose whether to \u201cInclude\u201d or \u201cExclude\u201d them.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if you enter (many) addresses in either the \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cto\u201d column, the Etherscan Advance filter will display transactions involving any of these addresses. If you use the \u201cExclude\u201d option, the filter will specifically exclude transactions containing the provided address.\n\n5. Etherscan Advance Filter\n\nAccording to the design, transactions can be filtered based on the amount transferred. It can be used to track transactions with predefined value thresholds or to analyze high-value transfers. You can select from predefined amount ranges (for example, 1-10, 1-100, 1-1K, 1-10K, 1-100K, 1-1M) or enter your own.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n6. Filter by assets\n\nThis filter allows you to look for transactions involving certain tokens by entering the token\u2019s name, symbol, or contract address. Users can include or exclude transactions relating to the chosen token by selecting the \u201cIs\u201d or \u201cIs Not\u201d options. Popular assets like WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, and WETH are also readily available for choosing.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nAdditionally, you can save the filter for future use. Here you can view your stored filters. To access this feature, you must sign in to your Etherscan account. The data displayed in the filter corresponds to the available information up to the specified block.\n\nThis is a Beta release, some limitations include:\n\n\u2013 Poor reputation tokens, ignore list tokens, and failed transactions displayed with no option to hide them\n\n\u2013 From and To addresses are only joined by OR operator\n\n\n\nLet us know what you'd like us to add or improve! \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) June 2, 2023\n\nUsing Etherscan\u2019s Advance Filter to analyze DeFi exploits\n\nDeFi exploits can be intricate and involve multiple addresses, necessitating in-depth analysis to obtain a thorough understanding of the incident. In the past, this required launching multiple Etherscan tabs to assemble the puzzle.\n\nFortunately, with Etherscan\u2019s Advanced Filter tool, community members can expedite their analysis by consolidating our findings across multiple filter fields and gaining a clearer view of the exploit.\n\nConsider the case of the Euler exploit, which occurred in March 2023. Because this hack involves a flash loan and numerous tokens, it was critical to concentrate on key transactions. You can accomplish this by filtering the transaction types to include ordinary transactions (txs), ERC-20 token transactions, and internal transactions.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nUsing the \u2018IS NOT\u2019 option, you can further focus your research by excluding spammy and irrelevant addresses. You can also specify an amount range to focus on key transactions and exclude irrelevant assets from your research."
