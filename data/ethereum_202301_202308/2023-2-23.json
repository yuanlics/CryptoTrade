        "title": "The Rise of DeFi: How Ethereum Is Leading the Way - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a rapidly expanding sector of the blockchain industry with the potential to transform traditional financial systems. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is leading this charge. In this article, we'll look at what DeFi is, why it matters, and how Ethereum is leading the charge.\n\nWhat Is DeFi?\n\nDeFi refers to a set of financial applications built on blockchain technology that are decentralized, open, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nThese applications seek to provide financial services and products without the involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as banks or other financial institutions.\n\nDeFi protocols are built on blockchain networks like Ethereum and employ smart contracts to execute transactions and automate financial processes.\n\nKeep Reading Social Media Reward Coins: A Catalyst for Widespread Crypto Adoption\n\nThese protocols offer a variety of financial services, such as lending and borrowing, trading, asset management, and insurance.\n\nWhat Is the Significance of DeFi?\n\nDeFi has the potential to transform traditional financial systems by making financial services more accessible, efficient, and transparent. DeFi can reduce transaction fees, increase speed and security, and provide greater access to financial services for underserved populations by eliminating intermediaries and utilizing blockchain technology.\n\nBecause anyone can create and launch a new DeFi protocol, DeFi has the potential to enable new forms of financial innovation and experimentation. This has resulted in a proliferation of DeFi projects, with new protocols and applications being released on a nearly daily basis.\n\nHow Is Ethereum Setting the Standard?\n\nThe majority of DeFi protocols and applications are built on Ethereum, the leading blockchain network for DeFi. Developers can use Ethereum's smart contract functionality to create complex financial protocols that can be executed automatically and without the use of intermediaries.\n\nThe use of decentralized exchanges is a key feature of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem (DEXs). DEXs enable users to trade cryptocurrencies without requiring a centralized exchange or intermediary. This reduces fees while giving users more control and transparency.\n\nUniswap is a popular Ethereum DEX that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for an order book or centralized exchange.\n\nTo determine prices, Uniswap employs an automated market maker (AMM) system, which is based on a mathematical formula rather than supply and demand.\n\nCompound is another popular DeFi protocol on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without the use of intermediaries.\n\nTo provide users with the best possible returns, Compound employs an algorithmic interest rate system that adjusts based on supply and demand.\n\nStablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of a fiat currency such as the US dollar, are also part of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoins allow users to protect themselves against cryptocurrency volatility and provide a more stable medium of exchange. Tether (USDT), the most popular stablecoin on Ethereum, has a market capitalization of more than $60 billion.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of the Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem?\n\nUsers benefit from Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem in a variety of ways, including:\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum DeFi protocols are decentralized, which means they are not controlled by a central authority. This increases transparency and reduces the possibility of fraud or manipulation.\n\nAccessibility: Anyone with an internet connection, regardless of location or financial status, can use Ethereum's DeFi protocols. This increases the financial inclusion of underserved populations.\n\nEfficiency: On Ethereum, DeFi protocols are automated and executed via smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency.\n\nBecause anyone can create and launch a new DeFi protocol, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem enables new forms of financial innovation and experimentation.\n\nWhat Are the Challenges That Ethereum\u2019s DeFi Ecosystem Is Facing?\n\nWhile Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem has many advantages, it also has some drawbacks. Scalability is one of the most difficult challenges, as Ethereum's current infrastructure can only handle a limited number of transactions per second.\n\nThis has resulted in network congestion and high transaction fees during periods of high demand.\n\nSecurity is another issue confronting Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, as smart contracts can be vulnerable to hacks and exploits.\n\nThis has resulted in a number of high-profile incidents, including the 2016 hack of the DAO, which resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.\n\nFinally, because DeFi protocols and applications are largely unregulated, the regulatory environment surrounding DeFi remains unclear. This has raised concerns about investor protection and future regulatory crackdowns.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi Ecosystem?\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is growing and evolving. The launch of Ethereum 2.0, which will introduce several upgrades to the Ethereum network, including a shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus and increased scalability, is one of the key developments on the horizon.\n\nOther upcoming developments include the release of layer 2 scaling solutions, which will allow for more transactions to be processed on the Ethereum network, as well as the continued growth and evolution of DeFi protocols and applications.\n\nCan Ethereum 2.0 Topple Bitcoin?\n\nThere is a lot of hype around ETH 2.0, but can it topple BTC and become the number 1 cryptocurrency?\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of its features and find out.\n\nThe Beacon Chain\n\nThe beacon chain is a proof of stake mega blockchain which while not being able to handle transactions or smart contracts will be the heart of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIt runs side by side with the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that it exists separately until the change is made to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe beacon chain takes responsibility for coordinating the entire Ethereum network.\n\nSharding\n\nThe main idea behind sharding is to create more ways (64) in which information can travel within the blockchain.\n\nBy creating shards, the infrastructure of the blockchain can effectively be split into smaller pieces and, in the process, the shares will allow an easier way of storing and accessing data, meaning that each one of them will be able to operate independently of one another and, consequently, achieve the underlying goal of network scalability.\n\nThinking long term, what will eventually happen is something called docking, a process in which the current Ethereum blockchain will simply become one of the 64 shards, meaning that we will have 63 other blockchains to use.\n\nScalability\n\nEthereum can only handle around 15 transactions a second and, whenever the network gets very busy, that means that the cost of each transaction is bound to get higher and higher as they are all competing against one another.\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0, capabilities for achieving at least 100.000 transactions per second are to be expected, and, in turn, making them cheaper.\n\nAdded Security\n\nWith added security, it will be much harder to attack the network or attempt to harm it in any way.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is at the forefront of a rapidly growing sector of the blockchain industry: decentralized finance. Users benefit from Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem in a variety of ways, including decentralization, accessibility, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nHowever, it does face a number of challenges, including scalability, security, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite these obstacles, Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years."

        "content": "While many investors appreciated these services, the SEC did not. Its public complaint states, \u201cKraken has offered and sold its crypto asset \u2018staking services\u2019 to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up \u2013 or \u2018stake\u2019 \u2013 their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.\u201d"

        "title": "Only 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed since 2020, says core dev - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem has seen only 226 validators slashed since the launch of the Beacon Chain on Dec. 1, 2020 \u2014 amounting to just 0.04% of 524,060 validators, according to an Ethereum core developer.\n\nSlashing is a process where a validator breaches the proof-of-stake consensus rules, which often results in the removal of that validator from the network and slashing a portion of the staked Ether (ETH) that the validator provided as collateral.\n\nSuch slim odds of being slashed were highlighted by Ethereum core developer \u201cSuperphiz\u201d in a Feb. 23 Twitter post, which suggests that people shouldn\u2019t be concerned about staking ETH for that particular reason.\n\n226 out of 523,000 validators on the beacon chain have been slashed. This is nothing to lose sleep over. Many slashings have occurred during failed system migration. Here are four emerging best practice tips to avoid this:https://t.co/wleR4YQmDD \u2014 superphiz.eth (@superphiz) February 22, 2023\n\nThe developer also explained \u201cfour emerging best practices\u201d to reduce those odds even further.\n\nOne of these practices was to wipe any existing chain data on old staking machines and to reinstall and reformat the validator where necessary, said Superphiz, noting that many slashings occur due to \u201cfailed systems migrations.\u201d\n\nSuperphiz then suggested using \u201cdoppelganger detection,\u201d which checks whether the validator\u2019s keys are active before starting the validation process.\n\nWhile this can impact validator uptime, he explained that \u201cperfect uptime\u201d isn\u2019t worth getting slashed in the grand scheme of things:\n\n\u201cIt's wise to throw away $0.06 to save $1700. (A slashing costs about 1 Ether).\u201d\n\nThe developer said it is also worth watching buffers and logs on the Beacon Chain to become aware of any potential problems that may arise.\n\nLog of the slashed validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nIf something feels wrong, Superphiz suggested \u201cunplugging everything\u201d and to \u201ccome back\u201d when the problem has been identified and a proposed solution is set in place.\n\nThe developer also noted that over 150 of the 226 slashings have been caused by services rather than \u201chome stakers.\u201d\n\nStaked ETH and number of active validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nSlashing can occur due to an \u201cattestation\u201d or a \u201cproposal\u201d violation, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAn attestation violation is one where a malicious validator attempts to change the history of a block or \u201cdouble votes\u201d by attesting two candidates for the same block.\n\nA proposal violation occurs when a validator proposes and signs two different blocks for the same slot.\n\nThe majority of slashing events have come from attestation violations, according to data from beaconcha.in.\n\nOne of the largest slashing events occurred on Feb. 4, 2021, when staking infrastructure provider \u201cStaked\u201d had 75 of its validators slashed for producing competing blocks. Staked said the attestation violation came about due to a \u201ctechnical issue.\u201d\n\nRelated: What are the risks of the Ethereum Merge?\n\nSince the Beacon Chain merged with the Ethereum proof-of-work chain on Sept. 15, only 35 of the total 226 slashings have taken place, according to beaconcha.in, which suggests that the Merge has not had a profound impact on slashing rates.\n\nWith about 16.7 million ETH staked (according to beaconcha.in) out of 120.4 million ETH currently in circulation (according to CoinGecko), the percentage of ETH staked is about 13.9%.\n\nETH can be staked via a centralized exchange, by delegation to a third-party validator network, or by running on an independent node, which requires 32 ETH."

        "title": "Coinbase Is Building Its Own Ethereum Layer-2 Network Called 'Base' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase has today unveiled Base, its own Ethereum layer-2 network. The company says Base will be the new home for the Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products and\u2014it hopes\u2014an open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nThough only publicly announced today, a testnet for Base has actually been live since the start of the month, Coinbase Senior Director of Engineering Jesse Pollak told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThis is a bet that we can help enable the next million dapps, which are going to bring in the next billion users. We think that's going to happen on a five- to 10-year horizon and this is our contribution to making that happen sooner rather than later,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat makes Coinbase, which has traded on Nasdaq under the COIN ticker since April 2021, the first publicly traded company to launch a layer-2 blockchain network on top of Ethereum. On Wednesday, COIN ended the day trading at $61.18 per share, down 1% for the day, after trading as high as $67.17 in the wake of beating analyst predictions on its Q4 earnings.\n\nLayer-2 networks help make transactions faster and cheaper than an underlying blockchain, in this case Ethereum, by processing batches of transactions on a separate chain and then sending receipts back to the mainnet. Base will be \u201ca rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism,\u201d according to a blog post that Coinbase shared with Decrypt ahead of its Thursday announcement.\n\nBase is entering a crowded and rapidly growing cohort. As of Wednesday evening, there was more than $6 billion worth of ETH on layer 2s, a 17% increase from a month ago, according to L2Beat.\n\nThe website tracks 26 different Ethereum scaling networks, including Arbitrum One and Optimism. Those two networks alone account for 53% and 31% of L2 market share, respectively. But unlike those L2s, Base will not be launching a network token. On other networks, tokens help pay for gas fees and are used to incentivize development.\n\n\u201cWe've seen a lot of people kind of use tokens to drive activity. But our thesis is that tokens are not the only way to drive activity,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cBuilding great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that both Optimism and Arbitrum initially launched their networks without a token either. Optimism has since airdropped its OP governance token to early adopters of its network and Arbitrum has long been rumored to be planning the same.\n\nBase is launching with dozens of partners who\u2019ve committed to building in and supporting the ecosystem, including oracle network Chainlink, Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, and DeFi protocol Aave.\n\nCoinbase said it intends for the governance of Base to be fully decentralized, although it won\u2019t be that way at the start.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is going to gradually transition into a role where we\u2019re a contributor to Base, we provide services and products that are built on top of Base, and we are not the decision maker for everything in the Base network\u2014that\u2019s being done through more decentralized governance,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nTo that end, Coinbase will be joining Optimism as a core developer on the open-source OP Stack. Pollak heads up the small Coinbase team dedicated to working on Base.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to keep the core team really lean and lean into this reality that we can have an outsized impact if we\u2019re building onchain,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 blockchain may help expand scaling on Ethereum - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is diving into the blockchain world in a move that some market players are excited about.\n\nOn Thursday, the exchange launched Base, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 (L2) blockchain, in an effort to enter the decentralized ecosystem through its own chain and expand further into the developer space, Jesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, previously told TechCrunch.\n\nBase\u2019s L2 is a \u201csecure, low-cost, developer-friendly\u201d chain that aims to help builders create dApps on-chain, the company stated. A number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have committed to building on Base, a Coinbase spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nThose that plan to be involved include Blockdaemon, Chainlink, Etherscan, QuickNode, Aave, Animoca Brands, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden, Pyth, Rainbow Wallet, Ribbon Finance, The Graph, Wormhole and Gelato, to name a handful.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Base reinforces the importance of L2s in growing the blockchain ecosystem,\u201d said Dmitry Shklovsky, co-founder of QuickNode, which is a partner and node provider for Base. \u201cMore onramps and more equitable, developer-friendly L2s are key health indicators that we are moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nL2 blockchains build on top of layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche in an effort to reduce bottlenecks, constraints and other network-clogging effects. Instead of putting every transaction on an L1 chain, L2s bundle transactions so tasks can be delivered in a more efficient manner.\n\nL1s like Ethereum are secure but impractical for high-throughput volumes due to prohibitively expensive gas, or transaction, fees, spokespeople from The Graph Foundation and Edge & Node said in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cL2s make the blockchain space more accessible by a broader range of both devs and users, allowing cheaper, faster transactions that still take advantage of the security of L1s like Ethereum.\u201d\n\nL2s are essential for accessibility and scalability in the space, Shklovsky said. \u201cL1s typically prioritize security and decentralization over scalability. L2s reduce the workload on the main chain, making the network faster and more user-friendly, allowing chains to scale quickly without compromising decentralization or security.\u201d\n\nGrowing the L2 space\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack in collaboration with the layer-2 blockchain Optimism, which is also focused on the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cOptimism is not a competitor [to Base], but rather a collaborator,\u201d Shklovsky said.\n\nThe Optimism stack is open source and relied upon by many in the web3 space, The Graph and Edge & Node spokespeople said. \u201cThis demonstrates the positive-sum and collaborative spirit of web3, in contrast to the competitive landscape that has become the norm in web2. When developers build in the open, everyone benefits without having to reinvent the wheel from scratch every time a new technology is created.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s new chain will not impact the crypto ecosystem more or less than any other L2, Shklovsky thinks. \u201cSince there is no plan to issue a network token, Base\u2019s only impact on the broader crypto ecosystem is creating another onramp for new users \u2014 which is good for everyone.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is home to over 110 million verified users and is a well-known entry point for new people looking to enter the web3 space. So, this launch could be a connecting point to the Wild West of crypto.\n\nThe new chain will help \u201conboard new users into the crypto ecosystem that will engage in decentralized applications \u2014 at a deeper level than surface-level engagement on exchanges,\u201d The Graph and Edge & Node spokespeople said.\n\n\u201cBy launching an L2, Coinbase creates a bridge between exchange users and the decentralized web,\u201d the spokespeople said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see centralized organizations building on top of decentralized infrastructure, introducing their users to more web3-native experiences.\u201d\n\nReinforcing beliefs\n\nIn general, Offchain Labs (the team behind L2 scaling solution Arbitrum) and QuickNode also see Coinbase\u2019s involvement as exciting. \u201cIt reinforces what we\u2019ve always believed \u2014 blockchain is about so much more than just cryptocurrency,\u201d Shklovsky said, referring to the tokens often associated with particular chains.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s involvement also validates the vision for L2s, Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, said. \u201cScaling Ethereum is a team sport and we welcome them to this important space.\u201d\n\nThere are dozens of L2 blockchains that exist today, with over $6.34 billion in total value locked (TVL) across the networks, up about 3% in the past seven days, according to L2BEAT data.\n\nArbitrum, which is the biggest L2 scaling system, has over $3.35 billion in TVL and surpassed Ethereum in daily transactions on Tuesday with over 1.1 million transactions, according to block explorer Arbiscan. This growth points to the demand for scaling solutions as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been long-time believers in the importance of L2 technologies as the future of our Ethereum, and indeed we\u2019ve been seeing this vision play out with Arbitrum seeing explosive organic growth, outpacing the number of transactions on Ethereum for the first time this week,\u201d Goldfeder said.\n\nWhile Base is incubated inside of Coinbase, its plan is to decentralize it \u201cin the years ahead,\u201d Pollak said. The team has done \u201ca lot of work over the last six months\u201d to address some of the biggest concerns from others, including how a big centralized company can engage in a decentralized way.\n\nThis effort to become fully decentralized \u201cshows their commitment to the ethos of the blockchain space,\u201d Shklovsky said.\n\nMarket players have to look at the L1 and L2 spaces with an abundance mindset, Shklovsky said. \u201cWith billions of potential users worldwide, there is a place and use case for every L2 as long as they are secure, user-friendly and scalable.\u201d\n\nRegulation sitting on the sidelines\n\nAs all this plays out, regulation looms in the background for the whole industry.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been circulating around the crypto space as it homes in on staking businesses like Kraken\u2019s \u2014 which got hit with a $30 million charge from the agency earlier this month.\n\nIn separate news, at the beginning of 2023, New York financial regulators found that Coinbase violated anti-money laundering laws by failing to conduct adequate background checks. Coinbase agreed to pay a $50 million fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services and is also required to spend $50 million on improving its compliance program.\n\nA number of U.S.-based crackdowns are transpiring across the crypto space, and the question of how major crypto firms and exchanges like Coinbase will navigate these new waters is unclear. Adding a new decentralized blockchain to a centralized entity could cause some headaches for the exchange if they go off-course in the eyes of regulators.\n\nBut whether regulation will carry a deeper weight on the space is yet to be determined."

        "content": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian was tipped off to the impending launch of Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether, in a meeting with crypto exchange Coinbase back in 2014.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ohanian said he spent $15,000 to buy 50,000 ETH (average price: $3.33) in 2014, which is now worth $82.4 million.\n\nEther was purchasable for bitcoin in 2014 during the project\u2019s presale, but the Ethereum blockchain only went live on July 30, 2015. This meant the first ether holders had to wait until the blockchain\u2019s launch to move or utilize their tokens.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have,\u201d Ohanian told Forbes. Ether was last trading around $1,650, and is up 38% in the year-to-date period, according to Blockworks Research, and 49,500% above Ohanian\u2019s initial purchase price.\n\nOhanian\u2019s openness to decentralized and uncensorable currency comes from knowledge about his family\u2019s traumatic history, where some of his relatives were killed during the Armenian genocide of 1915. Their inherited heirloom rugs were seized by Turkish soldiers.\n\nThe idea of persecution, especially by a state, \u201cmakes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive,\u201d he said.\n\nThat observation makes up one of Ohanian\u2019s core investment strategies. The tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist has made a total of 164 investments, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nAmong those, 29 are blockchain-related.

        "title": "Plan to Boost ETH Staking Rewards May Grow $152B Sector - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "EigenLayer Releases Details of Staking Changes in Growing PoS Space\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDive\n\nIn recent years, staking has quietly emerged as a wellspring of profit for the DeFi community. With more than $152B worth of crypto assets locked up to secure Proof of Stake networks, it\u2019s attracting institutional and retail investors alike by offering new ways to earn returns from digital assets.\n\nNow the Proof of Stake movement may kick into another gear. On Tuesday, EigenLayer, a \u201crestaking\u201d protocol, released a plan that would let holders of ETH stake and earn higher returns by performing more tasks than simply tending the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGame Changer\n\nIn its whitepaper, EigenLayer said it was developing a way to enable stakers to add new applications and offerings to Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus process. Ethereum, which switched to PoS last September in The Merge, dominates the staking sector with almost $30B in staked capitalization.\n\nProviding or staking tokens to manage blockchains has rapidly become a game-changing new business in crypto. Ethereum stakers lock up ETH in order to run a node and earn fees for validating Ethereum transactions. If a validator submits fraudulent transactions, the network will slash the staker\u2019s ETH both as punishment and to disincentivize others from engaging in malicious conduct.\n\nAs a restaking protocol, EigenLayer sets up a springboard for users to perform other services, or \u201cmodules,\u201d besides staking in exchange for fees.\n\nThis lets stakers earn extra rewards by using their nodes to validate computation for protocols deployed on EigenLayer.\n\nThe document offers many examples of modules suited to using EigenLayer, including cross-chain bridges, oracle networks, data availability layers, new virtual machines, and trusted execution environments.\n\nEigenLayer praised Ethereum for allowing dApps compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 its core smart contract engine \u2014 to enjoy the security guarantees of the network\u2019s stakers when deploying code.\n\n\u201cBy being fully programmable on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum pioneered the concept of modular blockchains, where distributed applications became modules that could be built permissionlessly on top of the Ethereum trust network,\u201d EigenLayer said. \u201cInnovation can come from any DApp developer, but the developer need not be trusted for the safety and liveness of execution of the DApp, since trust is underwritten by the blockchain.\u201d\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nEVM\n\nHowever, EigenLayer said that any code module that cannot be deployed on top of the EVM \u201ccannot absorb the pooled trust of Ethereum,\u201d limiting the scope of applications able to benefit from Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer. Many modules aren\u2019t compatible with the EVM because they process inputs from outside Ethereum and cannot be validated by the network.\n\nThe document offers many examples of modules suited to using EigenLayer, including cross-chain bridges, oracle networks, data availability layers, new virtual machines, and trusted execution environments.\n\n\u201cTypically, such modules require actively validated services that have their own distributed validation semantics to do verification,\u201d EigenLayer said. \u201cUsually, these actively validated services (AVSs) are either secured by their own native token, or are permissioned in nature\u2026 Restaking vastly expands the space of blockchain applications over which security can be pooled.\u201d\n\nUsers can opt-in to restake using EigenLayer by accepting additional slashing conditions on their Ether stake. While restaking allows stakers to earn additional yields on top of their usual rewards by securing AVSs, the profits come with increased slashing risks.\n\nCryptoeconomic Security\n\n\u201cA core idea of EigenLayer is to provision cryptoeconomic security through various slashing mechanisms which levy a high cost of corruption,\u201d EigenLayer said. \u201cIf a staker who is restaked on EigenLayer is proven to have behaved adversarially while participating in an AVS, then that staker\u2019s ETH will be subject to slashing.\u201d\n\nEigenLayer also supports staking through delegation, where users delegate their coins to entities operating EigenLayer operator nodes. This means Ethereum stakers who do not operate nodes can participate in staking in exchange for a small fee.\n\nHowever, users\u2019 assets are slashed if their delegated operator fails to meet their obligations. \u201cBefore delegating to any operator, EigenLayer restakers must do extensive due diligence on the operator to whom they are delegating,\u201d the whitepaper said.\n\nEigenLayer will also retain the right to veto any slashing event as a defensive measure protecting against module code bugs that could slash honest validators. EigenLayer will exercise the veto through multisig governance.\n\nThe multisig committee will comprise \u201creputed individuals in the Ethereum and EigenLayer community.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the AVS and its related infrastructure and contracts are battle-tested, there are various slashing risks that need to be mitigated in EigenLayer in order to avoid risk cascades,\u201d the whitepaper said. \u201cWe think of the slashing veto process as similar to training wheels that will be eventually removed.\u201d\n\nAVS operators can apply to use the veto committee as a way to assure restakers they will not be vulnerable to unfair slashing, pending approval from the committee. EigenLayer also urged AVS developers to seek security audits to demonstrate that their code is trustworthy to potential restakers.\n\nAVS operators can support a variety of assets for restaking, including liquid staking derivatives, native tokens issued by the AVS operator, and staked ETH.They can also specify conditions for the restakers that secure their module, including requiring that they stake as a solo node to promote decentralization.\n\nEigenLayer compared the role that validators play in its ecosystem to venture capital firms backing early-stage startups.\n\nMerge\n\n\u201cJust as venture capital investments are both essential to innovation and profitable for venture capitalists, the restaking ecosystem of EigenLayer can accelerate open innovation of blockchain applications while increasing profit from contributing to the growth of pooled security,\u201d\n\nEthereum transitioned to Proof of Stake consensus last September when its PoS consensus layer, the Beacon Chain, merged with its mainnet execution layer. The move booted Proof of Work miners for the network, driving a 90% reduction in ETH issuance and a more than 99.9% drop in the network\u2019s environmental footprint."

        "content": "Coinbase announced a major new project today in the form of Base, a layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum built in collaboration with Optimism. To mark the news, the crypto exchange dropped a free open edition Ethereum NFT for anyone to mint\u2014but it's not through Coinbase\u2019s own struggling NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBase, Introduced\u201d is a free NFT that Coinbase made available through Zora, an NFT minting platform and startup focused on Web3 creator tools. It\u2019s an open edition NFT, which means that anyone can claim one of the identical collectibles until the minting window ends on Sunday, with a limit of one NFT per wallet.\n\nAlready, more than 24,000 of the Ethereum NFTs have been minted since this morning\u2019s announcement of Base. As a result, the NFT\u2019s smart contract\u2014which contains the code that powers the project\u2014has become the largest \u201cgas guzzler\u201d on the Ethereum network, with over $271,000 worth of gas (or network transaction fees) used over the past three hours.\n\nCoinbase Is Building Its Own Ethereum Layer-2 Network Called 'Base'\n\nZora is a well-known NFT minting platform for Web3 creators, but Coinbase already has its own NFT marketplace. However, Coinbase NFT has gained very little traction since launching last spring, with public blockchain data showing less than $8,000 worth of total NFT trading volume over the past week.\n\nCompare that to some $596 million worth of trading volume over the last week at Blur, the top NFT marketplace that recently surpassed longtime leader OpenSea on the back of whale traders flipping assets at a rapid race to maximize BLUR token trading rewards.\n\nCoinbase NFT shows the Base, Introduced NFTs on its marketplace, but they\u2019re secondary listings posted by users who minted through Zora. Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi said on an earnings call this week that the exchange is \u201cnot throwing in the towel\u201d on its NFT ambitions, despite having \u201ca very lean team on it now.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe exchange's NFT marketplace has supported NFT mints in the past, including significant drops like The Bill Murray 1,000. However, the company confirmed earlier this month that it \"paused\" creator drops on Coinbase NFT to push resources towards other features on the marketplace.\n\nThe free Base NFT nods towards the recent \u201copen edition meta\u201d in the NFT world, in which creators launch low-priced NFT mints that then layer in gamification elements, in some cases providing incentives to holders to \u201cburn\u201d (or permanently destroy) a number of them in exchange for a unique, rarer version that isn\u2019t identical to the others.\n\nFrom $8 Mint to $4K Flip: Open Edition NFTs Are Reenergizing the Market\n\nCoinbase hasn\u2019t promised any future utility or benefits for the Base NFT. However, the NFTs are finding some traction on secondary markets. Most of them are selling for a relatively low price right now, about 0.01 ETH ($16) apiece, but some of the early-numbered editions or those with so-called \u201cvanity numbers\u201d are commanding higher prices.\n\nFor example, NFT #888 sold for 0.888 ETH (about $1,455) this morning, and the buyer has listed it for 8.888 ETH ($14,700) in the hopes of securing a sizable flip. Other three-digit NFT editions have sold for hundreds of dollars since the free mint launched this morning."

        "content": "Circle rolls out new Euro-based stablecoin as an ERC20 token on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain metrics rose as a result of the announcement.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network just added support for another stablecoin. The network has so far supported multiple stablecoins, but most are pegged on the U.S. dollar. This time the latest addition is Euro Coin [EUROC], which will be pegged on the Euro.\n\nRead about Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe new Euro-backed stablecoin issued by Circle might be the first major attempt at properly tapping into the European market. The Coinbase exchange is already making efforts to make EUROC available. It noted recently that the new stablecoin is an ERC20 token and that it will be available in regions where Coinbase is supported.\n\nCoinbase will add support for Euro Coin (EUROC) on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Inbound transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. \u2014 Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) February 21, 2023\n\nCoinbase also noted that the support may be restricted. In addition, the exchange noted that it will initially be available as EUROC-EUR and EUROC-USD pairs. While this new stablecoin might be a game changer for European crypto traders, Ethereum will be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nAssessing the on-chain impact\n\nEurope is one of the biggest economic regions in the world. As such, it can control a substantial amount of trading volumes in the crypto market. A direct link to the market through a Euro-backed stablecoin may thus prove quite useful. Ethereum is banking on this development to tap into more trading volume and network growth.\n\nSuch a major development is bound to have an impact in both the short and long term. Ethereum\u2019s development activity metric registered a sharp rally in the last 24 hours ahead of the EUROC launch. In addition, its on-chain volume grew by over $2 billion within the same 24-hour period.\n\nOn the network activity side of things, there was a noteworthy surge in 24-hour active addresses in the last 24 hours. Ethereum\u2019s network growth tanked to a new weekly low. This is contrary to expectations that a major stablecoin launch would likely trigger renewed interest.\n\nA potential reason for the relatively low change in activity is that ETH is currently slowing down after facing resistance above $1,700. It experienced a return of sell pressure so far this week, but it remains to be seen whether the new development will breathe life to the bulls.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nETH traded at $1,623 at press time.\n\nAs far as metrics are concerned, there is room for more downside before it interacts with the 50% RSI level. There is a sizable probability that demand may resume at the RSI midpoint, especially since the current bearish momentum is not so strong."

        "content": "Exchange Giant Challenges Arbitrum and Other Layer 2s With Own Blockchain\n\nBy: Aleksandar Gilbert \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nCoinbase, the No. 1 crypto exchange in the U.S., is building a new Layer 2 blockchain to give its users easy access to faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum, the company said Thursday.\n\nThe move puts it in direct competition with heavyweight Arbitrum and a slew of competitors that plan to introduce similar products ater this year.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains, also known as rollups, batch and compress user transactions before appending them to the Ethereum blockchain. This makes it possible to use Ethereum while avoiding its notoriously high transaction fees and sluggish execution.\n\nCrucial Role\n\nRollups are expected to play a crucial role in scaling Ethereum, and proponents say the technology will make it fast enough and cheap enough to accommodate billions of users and replace legacy institutions such as banks.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s rollup, Base, is available for application developers to test, the company said. A mainnet launch will likely happen before the end of the third quarter, according to Jesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase isn\u2019t the first crypto exchange to build its own blockchain \u2014 Binance launched its BNB Smart Chain in September 2020. But it is the first to build a rollup.\n\nIt joins a competitive field.\n\nAccording to L2BEAT, leading Layer 2 Arbitrum on Tuesday processed more transactions than Ethereum, a first for a rollup. Its parent company Offchain Labs was valued at $1.2B during a Series B in August 2021. Optimism, the second-largest rollup and Arbitrum\u2019s primary competitor, was valued at more than $1.6B during its Series B last March.\n\nLater this year, several rollups using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology are expected to debut. Some experts believe that rollups powered by ZK cryptography are the most promising method of scaling Ethereum due to their potential to improve on existing Later 2 blockchains in terms of speed and security.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nValidity Proof\n\n\u201cOptimistic\u201d rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism assume transactions are valid and provide a seven-day dispute window. ZK rollups create a \u201cvalidity proof,\u201d a receipt that the rolled up transactions are indeed authentic. As such, there is no delay in confirming transactions.\n\nScroll, Polygon, Matter Labs and ConsenSys are all working on Ethereum-compatible zero-knowledge rollups, or zkEVMs, that will allow developers to easily deploy their existing applications. Polygon has said it will release its zkEVM on March 27. Last week, Matter Labs invited developers to register to deploy their applications on its zkEVM, zkSync.\n\nPolygon to Deliver Zero-Knowledge Powered Rollup Layer 2 Sets March 27 Launch Date for Ethereum Scaling Offering\n\nBut Base will follow a tried-and-true method in its attempt to offer Ethereum users faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nBase is an optimistic rollup built using Optimism\u2019s code, the \u201cOP Stack.\u201d The Optimism Foundation has made the codebase public, hoping that other developers copy and improve on it.\n\nPollock, who led the development of Base, said the modularity of the OP Stack appealed to the company.\n\nCopy-and-Paste Job\n\n\u201cAs there\u2019s more technology improvements in how to build chains \u2014 for instance, ZK technologies \u2014 we can actually integrate those technologies into the OP Stack. That modularity [paves the way for] upgradeability.\u201d\n\nBase isn\u2019t a simple copy-and-paste job, however. It\u2019s the beginning of a collaboration.\n\nCoinbase will become a contributor to the OP Stack. It will donate a percentage of Base transaction fees to an Optimism-run grant program that funds developers working on public goods, such as upgrades to Ethereum. Eventually, Base and the Optimism blockchain will be hard to tell apart.\n\n\u201cBy building on the same technology stack, by working with the same values around decentralization, and by prioritizing the work to make these pieces of software interoperable, what we\u2019re going to be able to build to over the next few years is a world where Optimism and Base increasingly feel like one chain, the super-chain, and there\u2019s actually a bunch of other chains that are interconnected with them,\u201d Pollock said.\n\nIn the meantime, Base will attempt to differentiate itself as a rollup that caters to developers.\n\nGrants Program\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we\u2019ve established crypto as something that can be useful for trading and speculation, but [actual] utility is not there,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cAnd so our goal with Base is to make it really easy for developers to build useful [applications], and then to make it really easy for users, through the Coinbase interfaces, to use those [applications].\u201d\n\nIn order to spur development, Coinbase and its venture arm, Coinbase Ventures, will fund a grants program for software engineers who build on Base. Pollock declined to disclose the size of the grants program.\n\nMajor DeFi projects already building on Base include Aave, Ribbon and Balancer, according to Coinbase.\n\nCorrects the spelling of Jesse Pollak\u2019s surname."

Thus, going extremely bullish on Ether based on one strong fundamental was a poor decision.\n\nMoreover, going all in while relying on one indicator, particularly a widely-anticipated news event, is often a losing strategy, which is why traders should consider multiple factors before making a decision.\n\nEthereum fund outflows picked momentum ahead of the Merge. Source: CoinShares\n\nFor instance, one such metric was institutional flows. Ether investment funds suffered outflows worth $61.6 million a week before the Merge, according to CoinShares' weekly report, suggesting that \"smart money\" was leaning bearish.\n\nHedge with put options\n\nHedging with options in Ether trading enables investors to purchase options contracts opposite their current open positions. Therefore, investors could mitigate risk by opening a put option contract against their bullish spot.\n\nA put option gives a holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell ETH at a predetermined price on or before a particular date. So, if the spot Ether price drops, the investor could sell the asset at a pre-agreed price, thus protecting themself from losses in ETH's value.\n\nDon't go all in; check momentum\n\nDo not put all your eggs in one basket regardless of how much capital you can throw around.\n\nInstead, entering a position in increments could be a safer strategy while keeping some funds on the sidelines. Thus, traders can buy ETH during a short- or long-term bull run but can spare some capital to buy during potential dips, while relying on multiple technical indicators for cues.\n\nFor instance, momentum oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) reveal whether Ether is oversold or overbought on specific timeframes. So a strategy of going long when the RSI reading is close to or above the 70 and forming a lower high has a high chance of failure.\n\nRelated: A beginner\u2019s guide to cryptocurrency trading strategies\n\nThe Ethereum daily chart below shows the two instances when the above-mentioned investor bought ETH alongside the RSI forming a lower high.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUltimately, traders' mistakes can serve as opportunities to learn what works for an investor and what doesn't. The main takeaway is that investors should enter a market with a definite plan based on their own analysis and risk appetite.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 Staking on Exchange vs. Creating Your Node: What You Need to Know - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The Ethereum Network recently saw the official launch of the Beacon Chain, which is a stepping stone to the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, aiming to improve network speed, efficiency, and scalability. It\u2019s a move by the Ethereum foundation to abandon the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm for the energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. On top of that, we have to change terminology from having miners to having validators.\n\nEthereum 2.0 hopes to improve transaction processing speed to new heights, satisfying the demand of DeFi users.\n\nThe most significant change to facilitate improved transaction handling is the use of sharding technology. The term sharding comes from database terminology where we break up a single database into smaller parts that can be processed more quickly. In other words, not every node has to be a supercomputer capable of storing and searching terabytes of data. Even a small node can participate in the network and store a particular shard.\n\nOf course, every shard is stored on multiple nodes to guarantee redundancy in case many nodes crash. We don\u2019t want to lose a valuable piece of blockchain data because it happens that all nodes containing a particular piece of data fail.\n\nNow, enough about ETH2.0 improvements. This upgrade gives crypto enthusiasts and investors a new opportunity to become part of the Ethereum Network through staking while earning ETH passively.\n\nBut what are your options? First of all, how does Ethereum 2.0 staking work?\n\nEthereum 2.0 Staking: Do You Have 32 ETH?\n\nStaking is mandatory to secure a PoS-based blockchain. Ethereum requires every validator to stake a minimum of 32 ETH or more to run a validator node.\n\nValidators who have staked 32 ETH or more with the Ethereum Network can validate transactions. For doing so, they will receive rewards that come from gas fees. At this point, it\u2019s not clear yet what the expected APR will be for Ethereum staking. They added a rough estimate for the first year of Ethereum staking.\n\nAt this time, the exact size of an annual reward for Ethereum stakers is still unknown. However, according to the project roadmap, this value will vary between 1.56% and 18.1% and will be inversely proportional to the total number of validators: When the network increases, the rewards will contract.\n\nEven though Ethereum promises an attractive reward ratio, there are obvious risks attached. The Ethereum 2.0 staking page puts an important disclaimer.\n\nAlthough you can earn rewards for doing work that benefits the network, you can lose ETH for malicious actions, going offline, and failing to validate.\n\nHowever, you can pool your resources by joining a staking pool. In this case, there\u2019s no need to own the full amount of 32 Ether. If you only have one or two Ether, you can still join a staking pool.\n\nThe following section will give you a detailed breakdown of the pros and cons of using an exchange-based staking pool over running your validator node, staking 32 Ether.\n\nExchange-Based Staking: The Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nHands-Off Approach\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take care of the commitment of running and maintaining an Ethereum 2.0 node for years. Many things can happen in three years.\n\nSome exchanges might allow you to withdraw your stake after a fixed period or even allow flexible staking. This functionality depends on the popularity of the feature.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Need 32 ETH\n\nAn obvious benefit is that you can participate in the process without committing the entire 32 ETH required to become a validator. This allows users with smaller investments to earn passively on their ETH without any further commitments.\n\nYou\u2019re also not going to be concerned with any technicalities because everything you would need to do on most exchanges is stake your ETH without any further actions.\n\nCons\n\nLimited Control\n\nYou don\u2019t have any control over how the exchange maintains the validator node(s). Anyone can make mistakes, even an exchange. It\u2019s impossible to revert a slashing event. So, when an exchange-based node gets slashed, all exchange-based stakers are hurt.\n\nHowever, the slashing event will likely be less harsh as the exchange can spread the slash over all of its pooled stakers. Perhaps, they can tap into a reserve pool to cover the loss.\n\nThe Risk of a Halt\n\nAdditionally, an inherent risk of keeping your funds locked in an exchange is that of a potential hack or an attack by regulators, for example. If something happens to that exchange, your funds are also at risk.\n\nPotential Fees\n\nSome exchanges charge fees to maintain a validator node. You may wonder why? Exchanges charge fees to cover their costs to maintain nodes. This added cost can remove some of your earnings from staking. Always check the details when picking an exchange.\n\nYet, most exchanges choose to distribute the full earnings to their users. Binance distributes 100% of on-chain staking income among its users. Kraken Eth2.0 staking, however, doesn\u2019t mention any costs.\n\nYou can take a look at some of the most popular exchanges that support Ethereum 2.0 in our list here. Now, let\u2019s have a look at the pros and cons of running a validator node on your own.\n\nRunning a Validator Node: Pros and Cons\n\nWhile it might be more interesting to run your validator node to collect passive income from validating transactions, the risks are measurably higher.\n\nPros\n\nLet\u2019s also take a look at the pros.\n\nMore control over your funds\n\nYou use your Ethereum wallet to stake the 32 ETH. In other words, the common phrase \u201cYour wallet, your keys\u201d applies here. When using an exchange-based staking pool, the exchange will still send your ETH to the Depositor contract that handles staking. It means that the exchange doesn\u2019t hold the ETH in their wallets, as explained above.\n\nEarning full rewards\n\nYou earn the full rewards for your stake while running a validator node. Remember that you\u2019ll have to spend some of your funds on maintenance, such as covering cloud costs when running a node with a cloud provider.\n\nCons\n\nHere are the disadvantages of running your validator node.\n\nNot everyone has the required capital of 32 ETH.\n\nTechnical Understanding is Necessary\n\nSome technical know-how is required to run but also maintain a validator node. If done incorrectly, such as failing to validate transactions or going offline, you can lose part of your stake. This event is called slashing, a well-known concept among the Cosmos and Polkadot community. This mechanism incentivizes validators to act honestly and maintain their nodes correctly.\n\nIndefinite Lockup Period\n\nYour staked Ether will be locked up for an indefinite period. It\u2019s not possible to use this locked ETH in any of the existing DeFi protocols. The sole purpose of your stake is to secure the Ethereum Network.\n\nHere, it\u2019s important to note that your ETH will also be locked indefinitely if you choose to use an exchange to stake. However, most exchanges mint a synthetic token in a 1:1 peg with the ETH you stake. This token is then listed for trading. You will be receiving your rewards based on the number of synthetic tokens you own, but if you decide that you don\u2019t want to go on with staking, you can sell it and use the capital for something else.\n\nConclusion: Which Option is Best?\n\nAs with many areas of cryptocurrency, a core decision is whether to give up your control over assets. In the end, exchange-based staking still sends your funds to the Depositor contract. However, you put your trust with an exchange to maintain a validator node correctly.\n\nRemember that both staking options are subject to Ethereum\u2019s volatility. It\u2019s impossible to withdraw funds if Ethereum\u2019s price experiences extreme volatility. Therefore, it\u2019s a big commitment to stake with the Ethereum Network.\n\nHowever, the underlying goal is fascinating. With the right amount of stakers, Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to reach 100,000 transactions per second. And you can become part of the network to realize this ambitious goal of becoming a \u201cworld computer.\u201d\n\nYet, Ethereum 2.0 staking offers better rates than centralized finance. On top of that, if you choose the exchange-based staking option, you will also get a synthetic asset. This opens up new ways to experiment with DeFi.\n\nIn short, if you don\u2019t have the technical know-how or don\u2019t have 32 ETH to commit long-term, it\u2019s probably better to opt for an exchange-based staking option."

        "title": "Coinbase Drops Free Ethereum NFT via Zora to Mark Base Network Launch - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase announced a major new project today in the form of Base, a layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum built in collaboration with Optimism. To mark the news, the crypto exchange dropped a free open edition Ethereum NFT for anyone to mint\u2014but it's not through Coinbase\u2019s own struggling NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBase, Introduced\u201d is a free NFT that Coinbase made available through Zora, an NFT minting platform and startup focused on Web3 creator tools. It\u2019s an open edition NFT, which means that anyone can claim one of the identical collectibles until the minting window ends on Sunday, with a limit of one NFT per wallet.\n\nAlready, more than 24,000 of the Ethereum NFTs have been minted since this morning\u2019s announcement of Base. As a result, the NFT\u2019s smart contract\u2014which contains the code that powers the project\u2014has become the largest \u201cgas guzzler\u201d on the Ethereum network, with over $271,000 worth of gas (or network transaction fees) used over the past three hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZora is a well-known NFT minting platform for Web3 creators, but Coinbase already has its own NFT marketplace. However, Coinbase NFT has gained very little traction since launching last spring, with public blockchain data showing less than $8,000 worth of total NFT trading volume over the past week.\n\nCompare that to some $596 million worth of trading volume over the last week at Blur, the top NFT marketplace that recently surpassed longtime leader OpenSea on the back of whale traders flipping assets at a rapid race to maximize BLUR token trading rewards.\n\nCoinbase NFT shows the Base, Introduced NFTs on its marketplace, but they\u2019re secondary listings posted by users who minted through Zora. Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi said on an earnings call this week that the exchange is \u201cnot throwing in the towel\u201d on its NFT ambitions, despite having \u201ca very lean team on it now.\u201d\n\nThe exchange's NFT marketplace has supported NFT mints in the past, including significant drops like The Bill Murray 1,000. However, the company confirmed earlier this month that it \"paused\" creator drops on Coinbase NFT to push resources towards other features on the marketplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe free Base NFT nods towards the recent \u201copen edition meta\u201d in the NFT world, in which creators launch low-priced NFT mints that then layer in gamification elements, in some cases providing incentives to holders to \u201cburn\u201d (or permanently destroy) a number of them in exchange for a unique, rarer version that isn\u2019t identical to the others.\n\nCoinbase hasn\u2019t promised any future utility or benefits for the Base NFT. However, the NFTs are finding some traction on secondary markets. Most of them are selling for a relatively low price right now, about 0.01 ETH ($16) apiece, but some of the early-numbered editions or those with so-called \u201cvanity numbers\u201d are commanding higher prices.\n\nFor example, NFT #888 sold for 0.888 ETH (about $1,455) this morning, and the buyer has listed it for 8.888 ETH ($14,700) in the hopes of securing a sizable flip. Other three-digit NFT editions have sold for hundreds of dollars since the free mint launched this morning."

The company said it has no plans to issue a new network token.\n\n1/ We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nBase will be built on the \u201cOP Stack\u201d used by Optimism. It will start off highly centralized, though Coinbase has released a detailed plan regarding how the network will decentralize over time.\n\nIn its announcement, Coinbase said that Base will be \u201cfully open source and freely available.\u201d The company said it is joining the OP Stack core dev team to \u201censure it\u2019s a public good available to everyone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, Coinbase will continue to integrate as an exchange with other networks, and Base itself will be \u201ca bridge, not an island.\u201d Coinbase intends Base to be an easy-to-use network for its customers to get familiar with using crypto, but it will encourage users to \u201cstart on Base, but go everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn its decentralization plan, Coinbase said that it is working with Op Labs and the Optimism Collective to decentralize the Optimism ecosystem by creating a \u201cSuperchain\u201d of connecting networks built on the OP Stack. The company judges that the current version of Optimism is a \u201cStage 0 rollup,\u201d citing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s post on the decentralization of rollups.

        "content": "Flare Network, a mainnet seeking to connect Offchain sources and other layer-1s, recently demonstrated that its users can trustlessly purchase Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using coins from other networks.\n\nTesting Flare Network\u2019s interoperability function\n\nIn a press release, Flare Network showed that one could buy ERC-721 NFTs on its network using Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger. These coins are not inherently compatible with Ethereum and are yet to be integrated with the Flare Network.\n\nThis demonstration was done on Flare Network\u2019s Songbird. In this testnet environment, developers can deploy dApps before launching them on the interoperable, scalable mainnet. This purchase was executed through Flare Network\u2019s State Connector and Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO). The State Connector links the Flare Network with smart contracts and Offchain sources. At the same time, the FTSO is a decentralized oracle that verifiably delivers on-chain smart contracts with reliably proven price and data feeds, including those of NFTs, from external sources.\n\nCommenting, Hugo Philion, the Flare CEO and co-founder, said:\n\n\u201cThis demo highlights Flare\u2019s ability to provide more secure, decentralized data on-chain to power new functionality and potential use cases for the industry. The NFT demo is one example of the web3 utility Flare can unlock for legacy tokens, enabling them to be used trustlessly in DApps on the network. We are excited to see what other applications engineers can develop, harnessing the capabilities of Flare\u2019s native interoperability protocols.\u201d\n\nBy illustrating this interoperability functionality currently in beta, Flare Network assured the broader community that it is possible to acquire NFTs launched on its rails using diverse tokens and coins, including DOGE and XRP. These coins are some of the world\u2019s most liquid and are currently perched in the top 10 by market capitalization.\n\nExpanding non-EVM coins\u2019 use cases\n\nBecause of interoperability, the Flare Network opens up new use cases for supported tokens. DOGE, for example, can now be used to acquire valuable NFTs, not just for trading purposes or speculation.\n\nOver the years, DOGE has been rising to new valuations with backing from Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and one of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP, for example, has retained its value despite the ongoing court case versus the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The XRPL also supports smart contracting, a net positive for XRP and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn January, the Flare Network partnered with FYEO, a blockchain security specialist. The firm will audit the platform\u2019s code bases and support safer smart contract development.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "DeGods and y00ts Are Leaving Solana\u2014Here\u2019s How It\u2019s Going to Work - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDeGods, the most valuable NFT project on Solana, has a history of announcing unexpected twists\u2014from upgrading its artwork to buying majority control of a BIG3 basketball team, and even recently putting some of its previously-burned NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nBut the project\u2019s creators delivered one hell of a Christmas surprise: DeGods will leave Solana.\n\nOn December 25, DeLabs founder Rohun \u201cFrank\u201d Vora revealed his latest \u201csocial experiment,\u201d announcing that DeGods NFTs would be \u201cbridged\u201d over to Ethereum\u2014the largest and most valuable NFT market, with projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, y00ts will be moved over to Polygon, an Ethereum scaling network that\u2019s recently gained traction with brands like Starbucks, Meta, and Nike. The DUST ecosystem token tied to both projects will also be bridged to both Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nFew concrete details about the migration have been announced since then, but for the first time, Frank and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson exclusively discussed the motivations behind the move with Decrypt and explained the upcoming process.\n\nNot \u2018if,\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019\n\nWhen DeGods launched in late 2021, Solana was near its all-time high price and its NFT scene was rapidly expanding. By the time it became Solana\u2019s most valuable large-scale NFT project last summer, SOL had lost considerable value and the wider NFT market was in freefall.\n\nIn late December, soon after the move was announced, SOL had fallen about 97% from its peak price. Frank had previously tweeted about a potential migration amid Solana\u2019s late-year struggles and faced considerable backlash from the community. Even so, rumors persisted as DeLabs continued fleshing out its actual plans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHenrikson told Decrypt that Solana was \u201ca great place\u201d to begin life, given the tooling on the network and the fact that its NFT community wasn\u2019t as established as Ethereum\u2019s. But he said that DeLabs had larger-scale ambitions that the team knew would likely someday lead the 10,000 NFT profile picture (PFP) project to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't about \u2018if,\u2019 it was just a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u2014and that was even in the earliest days of DeGods,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're gonna be the biggest, most popular NFT collection in the world, you're gonna have to be on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDeGods, which has generated nearly $150 million worth of trading volume on Solana, will soon enter the largest market for high-value NFT collections. Frank reaffirmed his goal of making DeGods the \u201cnumber-one luxury NFT in the world.\u201d\n\nCurrently, a DeGods NFT on Solana starts at about $11,500 worth of SOL on the Magic Eden marketplace, but Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club PFPs on Ethereum start at 10 times that amount. It\u2019ll be a new challenge to try and outshine ETH\u2019s heavyweights, but that\u2019s a big part of the appeal for DeLabs.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nAs follow-up project y00ts started making waves last summer, DeLabs received outreach from various blockchain networks about launching the NFT collection elsewhere.\n\nIt ultimately rolled out on Solana, but DeLabs sought an eventual destination that could help that collection reach a broader audience and collaborate with sizable brands. Henrikson cited last year\u2019s litany of brand announcements around Polygon, including NFT initiatives from Reddit, Meta, Starbucks, DraftKings, Disney, and beyond, and described it as an opportunity.\n\nHe told Decrypt that moving to Polygon is \u201cthe fastest way to get connected to these companies because they'll be on the same chain.\u201d Frank added that in addition to consumer brand deals, Polygon offers access to a growing slate of metaverse game platforms. Many y00ts visual traits were even left blank \u201cso brands can imprint their logos on there,\u201d Frank said.\n\nThe project\u2019s artwork was also designed to be broadly appealing\u2014or \u201cclean enough that I can sell pacifiers and diapers,\u201d Henrikson explained of potential partnerships or licensing deals, but also \u201cmen's cologne and things that are more degen-centric.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, DeLabs accepted a $3 million non-equity grant from Polygon Labs as part of the agreement to move y00ts to the network. Frank said that Polygon was \u201cnowhere near the largest bidder in that regard\u201d and that DeLabs chose the network for other reasons, but admitted that \u201cit felt dumb to not take\u201d the grant when so many networks were offering funds.\n\nDeLabs will use the funds to help grow its team and take some of the public-facing emphasis off of Frank, he said. Furthermore, DeLabs and Dust Labs will develop a Polygon NFT launchpad and help incubate new projects, as Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast. It\u2019s a move to grow the network\u2019s NFT scene beyond brand apps.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful thing in crypto is aligned incentives,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI personally want to see y00ts succeed, but part of seeing y00ts succeed is seeing the rest of the ecosystem succeed.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nDeLabs has set a March 15 launch target for both the DeGods and y00ts bridges, but Henrikson told Decrypt that late March is more realistic. Up until now, it wasn\u2019t exactly clear how the team planned to have users move NFTs between chains\u2014particularly on the point of whether the NFTs could be moved back and forth between the supported chains.\n\nThe bridging process via Wormhole will be an optional \u201cone-way migration\u201d from Solana to the new chain in both cases, Henrikson said, through a \u201cburn and mint\u201d process. Essentially, the Solana version of the PFP will be destroyed, and an identical version will be minted on the new chain and sent to the holder\u2019s designated wallet. There\u2019s no option to undo the migration.\n\nHolders can choose to keep their existing Solana NFT from either collection, but they will lose access to ongoing incentives and future benefits around the projects. For example, the staking rewards offered to both\u2014the DUST token for DeGods and points for y00ts holders\u2014will only continue to accrue for NFTs that have been bridged to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n\u201cYou want to do the burn-and-mint,\u201d Frank said, \u201cand you want to have some type of incentive for people to get over there in the first week\u2014so that it's like a proper party.\u201d\n\nHenrikson said that Phantom wallet, which supports Solana and has added Ethereum and Polygon in beta, is ideal for this kind of transition as it can all happen in one interface. But the Wormhole process can work with other wallets, starting with any other Solana wallet and ending with the new NFT in the popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask, for example.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFrank said that DeLabs has purposefully been quiet about future plans ahead of the shift, but that the migration will herald the start of its next phase for both projects. \u201cDeGods Season starts when we get to ETH, and y00ts Season starts when we get to Polygon,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nMoving the projects from Solana to its new respective networks will also serve as a showcase for Dust Labs\u2019 software and technology, Henrikson said, adding that the firm was founded with the ambition of being \u201call-chain or multi-chain.\u201d\n\nDust Labs, which raised $7 million last year, will offer up its software across multiple chains for other brands and companies to use. He said that doors to potential new opportunities are opening up at a \u201cmuch faster\u201d rate than ever before, thanks in part to support from Polygon Labs and interest from brands that want to help grow the NFT space on that network.\n\nWhile the announcement agitated many Solana die-hards, Frank emphasized that the migration isn\u2019t meant to be a firm goodbye to the original home of DeGods and y00ts. Any unredeemed y00t t00bs NFTs\u2014which holders burn to spawn a y00ts PFP\u2014will continue to live only on Solana, and Frank said that DeLabs would consider building future projects on the chain.\n\n\u201cWe have so much love for Solana,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAt times, it can feel very charged on the internet, but for us, it has nothing to do with that. We are honestly excited to see the mantle quote-unquote \u2018passed off\u2019 from us to another set of builders on Solana.\u201d\n\nBut DeLabs and Dust Labs see their future spanning multiple chains, and believe that the best place for DeGods and y00ts to grow is elsewhere. Frank said he\u2019s never bought into the \u201cYuga [Labs] playbook\u201d that many other NFT projects have tried to copy, and that his plan is to branch out in search of new conquests and potentially broader audiences.\n\n\u201cLet's not get complacent here. Let's keep pushing the boundaries and trying things out that are new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to take big swings, and we are trying to do it in a way that is going to make it exciting on the upside for people to participate.\u201d"

        "content": "Coinbase is launching the testnet of its Ethereum layer-2 network, Base.\n\nBase will be incubated inside Coinbase but has plans to later be completely decentralized. It will be powered through Optimism\u2019s OP stack, joining as the stack\u2019s second core contributor.\n\nIts code will be completely open-source, enabling it to preserve the critical, global, permissionless nature of cryptocurrencies, Jesse Pollak, protocol lead at Coinbase, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with Optimism because we believe this must be decentralized and open to everyone,\u201d Pollak said in an interview. \u201cDoing that in collaboration with others is going to be the path to making that actually happen.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are no plans to issue a token, Base will use ether as its native asset, meaning users will be paying for gas fees in ETH. There are plans, though, to eventually bring USDC onto the network, according to Pollak.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re excited about as well is what\u2019s called account abstraction \u2014 which is the ongoing effort to make it easier for users to have more powerful wallets,\u201d Pollak said. \u201c[This] will allow users to pay for gas in any currency they want, even if the underlying cost is in Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction, according to Pollak, is \u201csomething really powerful that will start to emerge in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nVision to build next super-chain\n\nCoinbase plans to run its own sequencer for Base in its initial launch, with plans to later decentralize the sequencer and make it possible to sequence multiple chains at the same time.\n\nA sequencer is similar to a validator. They are responsible for ordering and executing transactions and submitting them to the layer-1 chain, which in this case will be Ethereum.\n\nThe long-term vision though, Pollak said, is to have powerful interoperability between chains.\n\n\u201cRather than having one chain that\u2019s monolithic and requires everyone to be in the same place, we can actually have many chains that work together to scale Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Base\u2019s initial launch, Coinbase will partner with a handful of multichain bridge providers to allow interoperability with Ethereum layer-1 and other layer-2s \u2014 as well as layer-1 ecosystems including Solana.\n\nBen Jones, the co-founder of Optimism, told Blockworks that as technology continues to evolve, capital efficiency will improve alongside it.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the internet right now, you\u2019re not thinking about what tier two ISP you\u2019re connected to at worst you\u2019re yelling at Spectrum, but once you\u2019re on [the internet] you\u2019re not worried about what grade your packets are being routed and all of that\u2026and so we can get to a future like that as well,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAdded Jones: \u201cThat\u2019s why we have this word super chain, which is a little cheeky, but it\u2019s trying to say that it\u2019s not about having a multi-chain, but rather building one cohesive, unified network.\u201d\n\nThe modular solution\n\nOne key goal of the initiative is to create technology that can be easily upgraded.\n\nThat goal is one of the main reasons why Coinbase chose Optimism as a partner for its latest release of Base, Pollak said, attributing it to the fact that the OP stack is built to be modular.\n\nAlthough zero-knowledge (zk) technology has been gaining momentum, Pollak said the difference in technology doesn\u2019t define the product. He described it as more of an implementation detail.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in the future, we will likely have roll-ups that have both zk components and optimistic components,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important today is building the technology stack in a way that allows it to be easily upgraded.\u201d\n\nJones said that the \u201creality is you need to build infrastructure that makes it good to run chains, period.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you architect that the right way, you open up the door for things like the proof to be modules that we can slot in and upgrade over time,\u201d Jones said.\n\nModularity is not a limitation of the software, according to Jones \u2014 but rather a particular derivation pipeline that enables data layers to be swapped.\n\n\u201cIt will eventually allow us to do that with the right proof systems in a way that makes fewer sacrifices,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilar to other layer-2s, data availability on Base \u2014 the guarantee that all transaction data for a block is available to different network participants \u2014 will be on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with Optimism for the last year on something called EIP 4844 \u2014 or proto danksharding \u2014 which is creating a new form of data availability on Ethereum,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cThat is going to make it 10 to 100 times cheaper for rollups like Optimism and Base to be running, which will make it cheaper for users.\u201d\n\nThe shipping of EIP 4844 is targeted for this summer, Pollak said.\n\nEntering phase 3.5 of Coinbase\u2019s \u201cSecret Master Plan\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s end goal is to make it easier for developers to build useful decentralized applications (dapps) and distribute them broadly.\n\nCEO Brian Armstrong has said as much.\n\nIn 2016, Armstrong in \u201cThe Coinbase Secret Master Plan\u201d said that effort would be divided into four different phases: Develop the protocol; build a digital currency exchange; build a mass market interface for digital currency apps; then finally build the apps that power an open financial system.\n\n\u201cFor the last while, we\u2019ve been stuck between [phases] three and four, we\u2019ve had consumer interfaces, but we haven\u2019t had the useful dApps. Base is our bet that we can build a better platform that makes it easier for developers to build applications that are actually useful, and can bring a billion users into the crypto economy,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nPollak deems Coinbase as well-positioned to do so. It currently serves over 108 million verified users \u2014 and has access to over $100 billion worth of assets in its ecosystem, he said.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to build what we consider phase 3.5 of the secret master plan,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Uniswap Allows NFT Trading in \u2018Any Ethereum-Based Token\u2019\n\nUsers of the Uniswap NFT platform will be able to buy non-fungible tokens using any Ethereum-based token. The move is part of Uniswap\u2019s efforts to gain a share of the NFT market, which has been dominated by OpenSea and, more recently, Blur.\n\nNFT traders will find this a welcome move since there are many restrictions involved in buying non-fungible tokens on various marketplaces. For instance, some are quite specific about the kind of token required before user can complete a transaction.\n\nUniswap\u2019s new feature allows NFT traders to use any token supported by the Ethereum blockchain to make a purchase using its simplified interface. This goes for stablecoins such as USDC and USDT and even meme coins like Shiba Inu.\n\n1/ Have you purchased an NFT with any ERC20 token yet? On the surface, your transaction will display like you are buying an NFT with any token in your wallet. But dig into the code, and things get a little more interesting: pic.twitter.com/CQuaCTeSfY \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) February 23, 2023\n\nAccording to Uniswap, the new Universal Router contract will find \u201cthe most cost-efficient route\u201d to swap any Ethereum-based token into the required token for the NFT sale to happen. Then it will push that crypto to OpenSea\u2019s Seaport protocol, where the transaction will be finalized.\n\nThe new integration is a godsend for NFT buyers, who at times need to swap one crypto for another before completing a purchase. Moving forward, there are also plans to support the purchase of a single NFT using multiple cryptocurrencies. For example, if the NFT costs 2 ETH, buyers could pay with a mix of tokens as long as the full value is met.\n\nUniswap Hopes To Spark Trading On Its NFT Marketplace\n\nNow, Uniswap hopes this new feature will spark some life into its NFT marketplace. Since adding NFT trading capabilities to its platform last November, the protocol has seen fewer than 10,000 transactions in total. This roughly translates to about $7.6 million in total volume traded.\n\nData from Dune Analytics shows that the platform has about 16,600 total sellers and 5,400 total buyers. These numbers don\u2019t reflect very well on a protocol that boasts over 4.8 million users. It\u2019s clear Uniswap hasn\u2019t been able to transfer the popularity of its core offering to its NFT marketplace. However, with the new integration, things might change soon.\n\nWant more?

The layer-2 network, powered by Optimism and secured on Ethereum, aims to become a platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain.\n\nWhile still in its testnet phase, the move has been described by members of the crypto community as a \u201cmassive confidence vote\u201d and a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Base?\n\nThe base is a new Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution created by Coinbase that offers a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). It aims to make on-chain technology accessible to more than 1 billion users and does not require a new network token since it uses ETH as its native gas token.\n\nThe base is an open-source platform that leverages the expertise of Coinbase and the Optimism team to create an interoperable super chain, providing an open ecosystem for anyone to build dApps.\n\nThe project was incubated inside Coinbase and leverages its decade of experience in the crypto industry. To celebrate its launch, Base has also released a commemorative NFT called \u201cBase, Introduced,\u201d which can be freely minted on OurZora until Sunday at midnight EST.

With Coinbase boasting 110 million verified users and partnerships with over 245,000 companies in more than 100 countries since its establishment in 2012, the potential for onboarding new users to Ethereum is significant.\n\nA Watershed Moment in the Ethereum Rollup Ecosystem\n\nRyan Watkins, the co-founder of crypto-focused hedge fund Syncracy Capital, describes the news as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the Ethereum rollup ecosystem. Watkins believes that Coinbase is \u201clikely no one better\u201d positioned than to onboard the next 10 million users and institutions to Ethereum.\n\nCentralized Layer-2 Network Concerns\n\nNot everyone is bullish, however. Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel of investment firm Delphi Labs, expressed concern that launching a centralized layer-2 network \u201copens the door\u201d to unwanted SEC scrutiny. Shapiro believes that this move could accelerate the SEC\u2019s \u201csecondary market\u201d agenda with blockchain securities issues.\n\noverall, if indeed Coinbase's motives are regulatory in nature, it's not only a bad step for them, but could threaten dangerous collateral damage to the rest of the ecosystem\n\n\n\nif their motives are regulatory, they should've waited till all the infra can be really decentralized \u2014 _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) February 23, 2023\n\nDespite concerns from some members of the crypto community, the launch of Base has received a positive response overall.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin: Co-founder of Ethereum | #2 | The Cointelegraph Top 100 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\u201cTen, five, or even two years ago, my opinions on what Ethereum and blockchains can do for the world were very abstract. [...] Today\u2019s world is no longer that world.\u201d\n\nBiography:\n\nVitalik Buterin is a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain and Bitcoin Magazine. Born in Kolomna, Russia in 1994, Buterin emigrated to Canada at 6 years old with his parents. At school, Buterin quickly developed a knack for mathematics, programming and economics and was reportedly able to add three-digit numbers in his head 10x faster than anyone else. At 17, Buterin learned about Bitcoin from his father, Dmitry Buterin. In 2011, Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine and became its leading content writer. Using his industry exposure, he went on to craft the concept for Ethereum and published its namesake white paper in 2014, citing the need for a blockchain with more programmability than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain launched in 2015, and its native coin, Ether, has since become the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. The Ethereum blockchain features a vibrant system of ERC-20 tokens, decentralized finance protocols, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins and GameFi projects. Although Buterin brought Ethereum\u2019s white paper to life, other notable co-founders for the project include Polkadot\u2019s Gavin Wood, Cardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson and ConsenSys\u2019 Joseph Lubin. Buterin is actively involved in the crypto community and Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nButerin\u2019s 2022:\n\nButerin started off the year by giving the thumbs down to cross-chain bridge applications in DeFi, citing their critical vulnerability to hackers. His predictions would ultimately become true, with 2022 seeing DeFi security losses increase 47.2% to $3.64 billion, with roughly half of the incidents cross-chain bridge exploits. The Ethereum co-founder also suggested that NFTs should be made \u201csoulbound,\u201d like certain items in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, for the purpose of demonstrating achievement \u2014 such as winning GameFi tournaments or attending an invitation-only crypto conference. Amid the onset of the crypto bear market, Buterin became a citizen of Montenegro and donated $5 million to Ukraine to help with its humanitarian and war efforts.\n\nIn September, Buterin and his team of developers completed the long-awaited Ethereum Merge upgrade, which transformed the blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The upgrade made Ethereum mining largely obsolete (save for Ethereum Classic operators) and is estimated to save over 99% in energy costs. The upgrade had been in the making since 2014.\n\nButerin\u2019s 2023:\n\nFor the new year, Buterin expressed that he looks most forward to the scaling of zero-knowledge rollups with the introduction of EIP-4884. Zk-Rollups allow the validation of Ethereum transactions on a layer-2 blockchain with lower gas fees and faster processing times. After finalization, the zero-knowledge computation proof is then sent back to the Ethereum mainnet, which allows transactions to largely bypass the mainnet\u2019s limit of 10 transactions per second.\n\nSimultaneously, Buterin and Ethereum\u2019s developers plan to introduce \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d in the upcoming EIP-4884, which would allow the bundling of rollup data to increase network scalability by upward of 100x. In addition, core developers have set a tentative deadline of March 2023 for the Shanghai hard fork, which will allow users to withdraw their staked ETH. Going forward, Buterin also expressed his thoughts on the state of the ecosystem, saying that key issues to be fixed include user experience, privacy and scaling. The Ethereum co-founder also said he would like to see \u201ccrypto social take off.\u201d"

        "title": "FOMO in 4D, The Legendary Ethereum Game Gets a New Life on Arbitrum - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "BOSTON MA, Feb. 23, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over 18 months since it\u2019s release, Arbitrum is getting the attention many of its supporters have been looking for: the high-speed, low-fee, Layer-2 Ethereum rollup network has overtaken Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in terms of daily volume. After performing neck-and-neck for much of 2023, it would appear that Arbitrum has peeled off a decent percentage of the popular centralized-decentralized network\u2019s userbase. In other words, BSC users are feeling the fear of missing out (FOMO) on Arbitrum, which couldn\u2019t come at a better time for the developers of the token PoSH4D (P4D) and its game component, FOMO3D: Arbitrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite quietly launching PoSH4D (P4D) on February 21st, word of the token\u2019s release\u2014and anticipation of the upcoming game\u2014spread like a virus among the Arbitrum community, driving the marketcap of P4D to $350k within the first 24 hours. Why such a demand for a token with so little fanfare? Well, the project is a direct homage to the original Ethereum game FOMO3D, and if trends continue and the team can continue to deliver on their promises (so far they've touted their staking platform for token-holders), FOMO3D Arbitrum could become the biggest Web3 game of 2023.\n\n\"Time is a Flat Circle\"\n\nThe original FOMO3D was released in mid-2018, during a downturn in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin\u2019s price had plunged by a third from the beginning of the year, selloffs worsened in the face of massive exchange hacks, rampant initial coin offering (ICO) scams, and rumors of incoming government regulations. However, while many in the community were overcome with doom and gloom, developers of Team JUST couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the absurdity. FOMO3D was created as a satirical game based on the cutthroat environment that marked the 2018 \u201ccrypto winter:\u201d the game billed itself as an \u201cexit scam\u201d\u2013much like the aforementioned ICO schemes\u2013where players purchased \u201cprivate keys\u201d\u2013a reference to the hacked wallets that ruined several crypto exchanges that year. The game was a massive success, and the winner of the first round walked away with 10k ETH, (now valued at $17 million dollars). Given the tumultuous last year for the crypto market, it should come as no surprise that, half a decade later, in another uncertain market, the game\u2019s themes still resonate with developers and investors alike.\n\n\"DeFi, DeFi Never Changes\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many examples: Do Kwon and Terra Luna, bridge hacks like Ronin and Wormhole, and of course SBF [Sam Bankman-Fried] and FTX,\u201d said a spokesman for FOMO3D Arbitrum, rattling off the names of some the worst offenders in crypto of 2022 like a list of MVP athletes. \u201cHopefully the crypto winter put a freeze on newcomers trying to fleece the space, but in the meantime, we just want to get people\u2019s blood pumping again, and we think Arbitrum is the perfect place for a project like this.\u201d The spokesman opined, referring to the rollup\u2019s adjacency to the gargantuan amounts of liquidity held on Ethereum, as well as the low cost and high speed of transactions.\n\n\u201cDoing a revival of FOMO3D on Ethereum is impossible nowadays: even with the Merge upgrade, gas costs still regularly hit $80 per transaction and transactions can take minutes to go through, you can\u2019t run a blockchain game like that.\u201d Though the game is no longer on Ethereum, the developers did include a nod to the upgrades to the network, \u201cthe original was called \u2018proof of weak hands,\u2019 a play off the acronym for proof-of-work; as a nod to Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake, our revival is \u2018proof of strong hands.\u2019 Besides, if you\u2019re still holding crypto after last year, you\u2019ve gotta have strong hands, just how strong our community\u2019s hands are will have to wait until the game comes out this weekend.\u201d\n\nP4D CA: 0xEFc43Cf79f406D62960e34d3a62c729a0EEbEC4b\n\nP4D Chart: https://dexscreener.com/arbitrum/0xf4037ae51505d3c1f8f03f2916cd52136f0968b3\n\nP4D Staking/FOMO3D dApp preview: https://dapp.fomo3darb.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fomo3darbitrum\n\nDocs: https://docs.fomo3darb.com/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@arbitrum3d/fomo3d-arbitrum-has-arrived-86d4011142fd\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/fomo3darbitrum\n\n"

        "title": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler Indirectly Declares Ether Is A Security - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler has seemingly given an answer on whether or not Ethereum (ETH) is a security. Although he did not mention ether directly, he hinted that all other cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin have all the hallmarks of a security and should therefore be under the SEC\u2019s purview.\n\nGary Gensler Somehow Addresses Ethereum\u2019s Security Status\n\nSEC boss Gary Gensler has recently addressed one of crypto\u2019s most hotly contested issues. Almost eight years after Ethereum started producing blocks, the debate over whether ETH, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, should be labelled a security rages on.\n\nSpeaking during a recent interview with New York Magazine, Gensler noted that all cryptocurrencies in circulation except bitcoin are normally created by a group of entrepreneurs who mostly set up their headquarters in tax haven offshored, and they might also have a foundation. According to the SEC boss, the teams behind these cryptos use various intricate and opaque techniques to promote their tokens and lure investors.\n\n\u201cThey might drop their tokens overseas at first and contend or pretend that it\u2019s going to take six months before they come back to the U.S.,\u201d Gary posited. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d he continued, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d\n\nGensler insisted that, as a legal matter, such cryptocurrencies fall within the jurisdiction of his commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEther Wasn\u2019t A Security Before, But It Could Be Now\n\nPrior to Ethereum\u2019s launch back in July 2015, the network sold its native ether token via an initial coin offering (ICO) in exchange for Bitcoin. Over 49 million ETH were sold during the public ICO sale, earning the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit created to steward the blockchain\u2019s growth, more than $17 million.\n\nIn ETH\u2019s infancy, most crypto market participants argued that the token met the SEC\u2019s so-called Howey Test as it entailed an investment of money in a common enterprise from which there was an expectation of profit based on that enterprise\u2019s efforts.\n\nDespite ambiguity over Ethereum\u2019s status as a security plaguing its early years, the SEC previously weighed in on the network\u2019s status. William Hinman, the former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, said in June 2018 he believed Ethereum had become sufficiently decentralized like bitcoin and was then therefore, not a security.\n\nBut the SEC of today, under Gensler, might take a harsh stance. The former investment banker suggested that Ethereum, following the historic Merge upgrade, could be considered a security in the regulator\u2019s eyes.\n\nNotably, the SEC has already targeted Ripple in a suit that accuses the blockchain payments company of selling the XRP token as an unregistered security. That case remains in court, and the eventual ruling is bound to send shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, whichever way it goes."

        "content": "Crypto watchers cheered Coinbase\u2019s latest venture called Base \u2013 a new blockchain designed to help scale crypto\u2019s top DeFi hub, Ethereum.\n\nThe project helps bridge the gap between centralised corporate exchanges like Coinbase and decentralised protocols, which tend to attract those who prefer the permissionless and inclusive nature of blockchains including Ethereum.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has millions of users who\u2019ve maybe bought a little crypto in the past, but who\u2019ve never actually taken the leap and used their crypto in non-custodial DeFi protocols before,\u201d Michael Bentley, CEO of DeFi protocol builder Euler Labs and Coinbase\u2019s launch partner, told DL News. \u201cBase is significant for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nBase will provide vast increases in transaction speed while slashing fees to cents on the dollar compared to the main Ethereum chain. It will join several other so-called \u201clayer 2s\u201d \u2013 separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum that rely on it for security \u2013 in making Ethereum cheaper to use and more accessible for regular users.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase told DL News that the crypto community is \u201caligned with our vision and believe that Base will be a huge step forward for the entire industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be a huge distribution funnel for users into DeFi.\u201d\n\nAs a blockchain, Base will be non-custodial, meaning users must hold crypto in their own wallets rather than on the Coinbase exchange to interact with it. Crypto enthusiasts view non-custodial wallets as the gold standard in the space as they remove third-party custodians like centralised exchanges and give users complete control over their crypto.\n\n\u201cIt will be a huge distribution funnel for users into DeFi,\u201d Bentley said, because users will be able to \u201cswap, lend, and borrow their crypto assets on protocols like Uniswap and Euler at low cost without the need to trust a third-party custodian.\u201d\n\nNick Almond, founder of DAO infrastructure platform FactoryDAO, also said Base will help bring more users on-chain and using DeFi protocols. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast user base on Coinbase and the majority of those people will have never done anything on-chain. So the Base launch should tempt users over to DeFi, dApps and DAOs,\u201d he said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBase is not the first time a centralised exchange has launched its own blockchain. In September 2020, exchange giant Binance made inroads on-chain with its Ethereum-compatible Binance Smart Chain. Then in November 2021, the Crypto.com exchange launched its own chain called Cronos. However, Coinbase\u2019s Base is the first time an exchange has built a new chain directly on top of Ethereum.\n\nNOW READ: How Coinbase used Slack to sniff out its insider trader\n\nAccording to Almond, Coinbase won\u2019t be the last crypto company to create its own blockchain either. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that most major entities in the space will have their own blockchains sooner or later,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be layer 2s, using Ethereum as a base layer for security and borrowing from existing architectures like Coinbase have done with Optimism.\u201d\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed \u201cOP Stack,\u201d a shared, open-source development stack that powers fellow Ethereum layer 2 chain Optimism. Blockchains built using the OP Stack will form what Optimism calls \u201cThe Superchain\u201d \u2013 a mesh of interoperable blockchains that share Ethereum\u2019s security and can communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cBase, if anything, is a validation of Optimism\u2019s \u2018Superchain\u2019 thesis,\u201d Sebastien Guillemot, CTO and co-founder of Ethereum layer 2 Milkomeda, told DL News. \u201cThe fact that Coinbase not only is willing to sign up to Optimism\u2019s superchain vision but also pay for it shows their vision may be viable beyond small OP Stack-based app-chains.\u201d\n\nOptimism\u2019s native OP token rose 16% on the Base announcement. It has since cooled off but is still trading close to all-time highs at the time of writing."

Our goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Coinbase does not plan to issue a new network token for Base and will use Ethereum (ETH) as the native gas token.\n\nPollak noted \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people kind of use tokens to drive activity. But our thesis is that tokens are not the only way to drive activity. Building great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it is steadfastly committed to Base\u2019s decentralization in the years to come. The exchange is certain that Base will advance from a Stage 0 rollup to a Stage 1 rollup in 2023 and a Stage 2 rollup in 2024."

Discover SCENE\n\nMost metaverse games opt for 3D environments, with varying degrees of success, but Worldwide Webb has charted a different path: this massively multiplayer online (MMO) world opts for a retro, Super Nintendo-esque style, yet it supports more than a million Ethereum NFT avatars.\n\nAnd it\u2019s expanding, thanks in part to a new funding round.\n\nWorldwide Webb, founded by artist and game designer Thomas Webb, today revealed a $10 million Series A round funded entirely by VC firm Pantera Capital. It\u2019s the game\u2019s first external funding round since its initial debut in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite looking like an early 1990s throwback, Worldwide Webb is a fully online, browser-based experience that lets players plug in an Ethereum wallet and use their NFT avatars from hundreds of popular collections, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Doodles, Cool Cats, Deadfellaz, and plenty more.\n\nPopped onto @Worldwide_WEB3 to claim my valentines items, getting web3 @RuneScape vibes, with a lot more style.@WebbEmotional and co. have done an amazing job continuing to build in the bear! pic.twitter.com/pQoolM59yT \u2014 Pranksy \ud83d\udce6 (@pranksy) February 16, 2023\n\nEach supported avatar is converted into a 2D pixel character that players can then guide through the world, interacting with other players, exploring the environments, and even soaking in the story.\n\nWorldwide Webb also has its own NFT land plots in the form of digital apartments that users can customize, and those NFTs have yielded more than $80 million to date worth of trading volume.\n\nWebb, the founder and CEO, told Decrypt that the funding will help expand his development team, with ambitions to double headcount from its current tally of 30 people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe've been moving fast and we've been shipping product,\u201d Webb said. \u201cBut for us, it's a case of wanting to move faster. We want to build faster, and we want to innovate faster.\u201d\n\nWhat's next for World Wide Webb?\n\nThe next big step forward is Blockbusterz, a player-vs.-player (PvP) competitive mode that lets teams of five battle it out.\n\nThanks to NFT interoperability, players will be able to bring their Apes, Cats, Punks, and plenty more into the mode, which Webb demoed for Decrypt.\n\nIt looks like a streamlined multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, akin to mobile hit Brawl Stars, as players attack each other and attempt to control the battlefield.\n\nThe cinematic 3D trailer embedded above gives a sense of the vibe of the cross-project experience, with a brief taste of the actual 2D gameplay shown at the end.\n\n\u201cBecause we have over 200 collections integrated, I wanted to see the Deadfellaz versus the Doodles,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI wanted to see CryptoPunks versus the Bored Ape Yacht Club in competitive battles\u2014and then for us to be able to issue rewards.\u201d\n\nThe PvP mode will introduce a \u201ccompete-to-mint\u201d mechanic that lets players earn NFTs simply by playing and excelling in the competitive mode. Webb said that the game mechanics are purposefully designed to be difficult to cheat via an automated bot or script\u2014a hurdle that Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs faced with its recent Dookey Dash game competition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLonger-term, Webb aims to take even more inspiration from time-absorbing gaming classics like RuneScape and Ultima Online, keeping players hooked with richer gameplay and narrative. He said the funding will help attract more veteran talent so that they can grow Worldwide Webb into a \u201cmassive, sprawling universe.\u201d\n\nEventually, Webb said he\u2019s keen on creating native iOS and Android apps should Apple and Google grow friendlier to Web3 business models, and similarly aims to bring the game to console platforms if giants like Nintendo and PlayStation eventually play nice with NFTs.\n\nAnd while eye-catching 3D trailers are purely cinematic teasers\u2014not indicative of a visual transformation for the game\u2014his team is exploring potential ways to bring 3D elements into the experience without shedding the retro allure.\n\nHe pointed to Square Enix\u2019s role-playing game Octopath Traveler as an example of an effective hybrid aesthetic.\n\nThe 2D look is a differentiator, and even with one less dimension on-screen, Webb doesn\u2019t see it as a limitation. He still wants to deliver a large-scale, cross-project metaverse mash-up like \u201cReady Player One,\u201d albeit with pixel graphics. Fortnite currently serves up that kind of cross-IP affair, but within a limiting, closed-garden ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWhat I was really hoping to do was to see a metaverse game that people can go into, but they can bring these things in,\u201d he said, \u201cin a permissionless manner.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum News: Ethereum plans to launch a new testnet named \u201cHolli\u201d (or Holesovice) later this year. Ethereum core developers plan to transition from old testnets to new testnet and solve the ETH supply issues. The testnet will be the first long-standing, merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet.\n\nEthereum core developer Tim Beiko in a tweet on February 24 announced that the team plans to launch the Holli testnet near September 15, 2023. The plan to launch a new testnet has been in process since the Merge upgrade last September.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new testnet, Holli, is planned to launch later this year, and hopefully we can figure out these things before then! I've made two suggestions on the repo, and would love to hear from application layer devs about how we could better approach this! \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) February 23, 2023\n\nHe said old testnets end up being a problem for clients and node operators because it takes more time and space to sync. The Sepolia testnet addressed the supply issue by using a mintable ERC20 token for its beacon chain, instead of sepETH. This allowed validators to effectively mint SepETH, post-Shapella, and solve the supply issue.\n\nUnfortunately, Sepolia isn\u2019t open to permisionless validators, but Goerli is. The Goerli uses the Ethereum client GoETH for its beacon chain. So, over the past few months, an effort has started to create recurring ephemeral testnets for stakers and shadow forks to quickly test upgrades without running a testnet.\n\nTherefore, before Holli testnet launch, Ethereum developers plan to get application developers easy access to testnet ETH tokens. Testnets help three distinct groups of users: client developers, application developers, and node operators/stakers/miners. However, the needs of each group are quite diverse.\n\nEthereum Developer\u2019s Plan To Solve Problems With Testnet\n\nTim Beiko gave two suggestions to solve the problems. First, add each ETH address where the contract is deployed on the mainnet, Goerli, or Sepolia to the genesis file. Second, coordinate with major contract and infrastructure developers to launch on the network shortly after genesis.\n\nTim Beiko is currently seeking input from application layer developers on how to resolve this issue. Moreover, the name \u201cHolli\u201d is not final, it could be changed to Holesky or Holesovice.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum prepares to enable the withdrawal of Ethereum staked on the Beacon chain with the Shanghai upgrade in March. Ethereum price currently trades at $1,653.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price To Suffer? IMF Issues Crypto Action Plan"

        "content": "Customizable rollup provider Eclipse is launching a Solana-focused scaling solution, which allows applications to be compatible with Polygon, the companies exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\nRollups, a part of the layer-2 blockchain ecosystem, are a scaling solution to help make blockchains faster and cheaper. Rollups work by compiling a number of transactions into one bundle to go onto a layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum or Solana. So basically, instead of sending thousands of individual transactions, it\u2019s one larger one that costs less.\n\nThe Polygon Solana \u2014 or Sealevel \u2014 Virtual Machine (SVM) will be powered by Eclipse and will be able to run smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana, which will ultimately increase throughput speed and interoperability for crypto subsectors like gaming, DeFi and more, Neel Somani, founder of Eclipse, said to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cEthereum was obviously still really slow and still very expensive, so it was very obvious rollups were the path to scaling Ethereum,\u201d Somani said. \u201cSo we were thinking, what if we made a highly parallelized rollup, but the difference is that we stick to a standard set of tooling that already exists like the Solana Virtual Machine or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\u201d\n\nThat was the initial motivation behind Eclipse, but it\u2019s evolved into a customizable rollup provider: People can pick their base level (like Polygon or Solana), choose a virtual machine like EVM or SVM, and make customizations in the application that might include different elements at the core level, Somani said.\n\nApplications, games, projects, protocols and more are still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in the crypto ecosystem, but rollups can help support different use cases without constraining the blockchain, Somani said.\n\nThrough the launch, decentralized applications (dApps) built for the Solana blockchain can migrate or become multichain through the Polygon SVM, which can open up the doors for both communities using and building on different blockchains.\n\nBetween the two communities, there\u2019s been high demand for a collaborative solution in mainly the gaming and physical infrastructure application spaces, Somani said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big areas we\u2019ve been seeing demand for and it\u2019s the areas where Polygon and Solana have been going after lately.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, Eclipse sees this launch as just the beginning for scaling.\n\n\u201cI think this hinges toward a future proliferation of all kinds of virtual machines across all these different base layers,\u201d Somani said. \u201cThis might be one example of an SVM rollup, but we are likely to see SVM on Ethereum mainnet or SVM on other base layers.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The headline on this story was updated to properly reflect the launch of the scaling solution."

        "content": "On Wednesday, Coinbase\u2019s main Twitter account posted a six-second video of a blue dot fading into a black background. Thursday\u2019s date\u2014Feb. 23, 2023\u2014was all that was revealed. Speculation on Crypto Twitter ran rampant.\n\nThe publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange later on Thursday announced it was releasing Base, an ecosystem built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized applications, or dapps.\n\n\u201cTo bring in billions of users to the cryptoeconomy, dapps need to be easier, cheaper, and safer to interact with,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cFor this to happen, we need to make it even easier for developers to build these dapps.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s latest offering continues a push toward a long-stated goal to make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which can appear impenetrable to lay consumers and some developers, accessible to a wider audience. And for a cryptocurrency exchange heavily dependent on trading fees, the launch of the new developer ecosystem is yet another attempt to diversify the company\u2019s products amid the extended chill of Crypto Winter.\n\n1/ \ud83d\udd35 We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nBase, which Coinbase describes as \u201csecure, low-cost, [and] developer-friendly,\u201d is built on top of Ethereum, one of the largest and most heavily used blockchains. This makes it a layer-2 network, or a system built on top of another blockchain. Fees paid to operate on Base will be paid with Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, not with a new token, the company said.\n\nTo launch Base, the cryptocurrency exchange is partnering with Optimism, another layer-2 network that makes using Ethereum less expensive for users and developers. (Every time Ethereum users post a transaction on the blockchain, they must pay \u201cgas,\u201d or a fee, with Ether. Optimism lets developers process these transactions in bundles, which reduces the gas.)\n\nTo commemorate the announcement, Coinbase released a new non-fungible token collection of, unsurprisingly, blue dots. The NFTs are free to mint, or download into a crypto wallet, and will be available through Sunday.\n\nDespite the blue dot fervor, Coinbase\u2019s business took a heavy hit in 2022, as several prominent crypto companies declared bankruptcy, including rival exchange FTX.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase released fourth-quarter earnings that, while beating analysts\u2019 expectations, were markedly lower than a year earlier. The company\u2019s full-year 2022 revenue was down 57%, and it lost $557 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $840 million in the same quarter in 2021."

        "title": "What is Algorand? Is it Halal? - Islamic Finance Guru",
        "content": "Algorand (ticker: ALGO) is a relatively new cryptocurrency and open-source blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and speed. Officially launched in 2019, the Algorand platform and the accompanying ALGO cryptocurrency rank 35th in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nAlgorand seeks to compete directly with Ethereum, the juggernaut in the crypto world, offering a similar use case with smart contracts and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nJust like Ethereum, most scholars hold Algorand to be halal. We also share this view.\n\nRead on for a deep dive into what Algorand is and how the ALGO cryptocurrency works.\n\nWhat is Algorand?\n\nAlgorand is both a cryptocurrency (ALGO) and an open-source blockchain platform that offers fast transaction speeds and a smart contract ecosystem in much the same way Ethereum does. In fact, Algorand is a direct competitor to Ethereum and aims to become the mainstream smart contract and payment currency in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSilvio Micali, renown cryptographer and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), founded Algorand in 2017. The platform was officially launched to the public in June 2019.\n\nIt is easy to understand Algorand by comparing it to Ethereum. It has a similar consensus mechanism, has smart contract capability, and is directly competing with Ethereum.\n\nAlgorand is open-source just like Ethereum, meaning anyone can see the code behind the platform. This allows it to garner a level of trust and foster a developer community that is harder to come by in closed source projects.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s unique selling point is that it boasts fast transaction speeds, and can scale these fast transactions allowing it to position itself as a crypto version of Mastercard or Visa. Meaning that Algorand aims to be the payment and currency network that handles global transactions at near instantaneous speeds.\n\nAnother way in which Algorand competes directly with Ethereum is that it can host other cryptocurrencies in its ecosystem and blockchain platform. This would allow people to start their own cryptocurrency whilst using the underlying technical prowess and open-source platform of Algorand.\n\nThe number of ALGO coins is capped to a total of 10 billion, with about 7 billion in circulation right now. This creates some level of scarcity which provides ALGO coins with value.\n\nHow does Algorand work technically?\n\nThe Algorand network is a decentralised, open-source blockchain platform that was designed to be fast, secure, and scalable to handle massive volumes of transactions at near instantaneous speeds.\n\nEthereum validates a new block of transactions within 12-14 seconds, whereas Algorand validates a new block of transactions within 5-12 seconds.\n\nBitcoin (and previously Ethereum) uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to validate these transactions. PoW is essentially using very powerful computers to solve increasingly complex mathematical puzzles to add a block to the blockchain. The one who solves the puzzle in a PoW is rewarded. This person is called the \u2018block proposer\u2019.\n\nThe problem with PoW is how energy-intensive it is. Due to the computing power required it simply costs too much for most people to participate.\n\nEthereum moved onto the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in 2022, where users can \u2018stake\u2019 their coins to validate new blocks and earn rewards. Staking is basically locking up coins as collateral to earn coins. You can read more about staking here and whether it is halal.\n\nAlgorand has evolved the basic PoS mechanism and uses a unique consensus algorithm called \u2018Pure Proof-of-Stake\u2019 (PPoS), which allows it to achieve high transaction speeds and low fees without sacrificing security or decentralisation.\n\nOne of the key features of the Algorand network is its use of \u2018verifiable random functions\u2019 (VRFs) to select the \u2018block proposer\u2019 for each new block.\n\nIn a traditional PoW blockchain like Bitcoin, the block proposer is selected based on their ability to solve a complex mathematical puzzle as outlined. In contrast, the Algorand network uses VRFs to randomly select the block proposer from among a pool of validators (called \u2018committee members\u2019), who are chosen based on the amount of ALGO they have staked (i.e., locked up as collateral).\n\nThis means that in order to participate in the Algorand network as a validator, you must first purchase and hold a certain amount of ALGO. The more ALGO you hold, the higher your chances of being selected as a committee member and earning rewards for proposing and validating blocks.\n\nIn addition to its PPoS consensus algorithm, the Algorand network also uses a novel \u2018atomic transaction\u2019 mechanism to ensure the integrity and consistency of its blockchain ledger.\n\nAtomic transactions allow multiple transactions to be bundled together and either all committed to the ledger or all discarded, depending on whether they are valid. This helps to prevent the \u2018double spend\u2019 problem that can occur in other blockchain platforms, where a single unit of cryptocurrency can be spent multiple times before the transactions are fully processed.\n\nThe Algorand network and ALGO cryptocurrency aim to provide a fast, secure, and scalable platform and alternative to Ethereum for building decentralised applications (dApps) and quickly processing transactions to compete with not only other cryptocurrencies but with the likes of Mastercard and Visa.\n\nIt offers a smart contract capable ecosystem to foster a developer-consumer community and become the de facto open-source cryptocurrency platform of choice.\n\nWhat are the use cases of Algorand?\n\nPayments and DeFi\n\nThe ALGO cryptocurrency presents itself as a leaner, faster version of Ethereum.\n\nALGO can be used to make payments to merchants and people around the globe in a matter of seconds and with minimal fees, making it the ideal payment network.\n\nDevelopers can also use the Algorand network to build decentralised financial applications, such as peer-to-peer trading markets or platforms for stablecoins.\n\nAlgorand presents itself as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency as an actual currency space because of speed, scalability, and cost.\n\nNon-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs)\n\nNFTs are tokens that can be attached to unique items, such as art and media. These unique tokens are not interchangeable like a standard ALGO token. An NFT is secured on the Algorand network and can only have one owner at a time. NFTs can be sold on global markets powered by the Algorand network.\n\nAre people using Algorand right now?\n\nAlgorand is a small player in the cryptocurrency space when compared to the larger cryptocurrencies, but a big player in absolute terms.\n\nIt ranks 35th out of all cryptocurrencies and has a market dominance of 0.17% and a market cap of under $2 billion.\n\nALGO currently has a daily transaction volume of under $20 million and a daily transaction count of under 5 million. This is especially the case after the market downturn in 2022 where before it used to see higher numbers and more activity.\n\nIts direct competitor Ethereum, which is more established and trusted, ranks 2nd after only Bitcoin. ETH has a market cap of $201 billion and a daily transaction volume of under $3 billion.\n\nWhile in absolute terms Algorand is being used, it is miniscule when comparing it to some of the bigger players which compete against it directly.\n\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of Algorand?\n\nStrengths\n\nAlgorand\u2019s \u2018Pure Proof-of-Stake\u2019 (PPoS) mechanism allows it to speed past competitors in verifying transactions without sacrificing security and stability. This gives it an advantage when scaling up because on the level of millions of transactions, that is an immense amount of time and money saved.\n\nAlgorand is an open-source, smart contract capable blockchain platform which means it allows developers to build decentralised applications and even other cryptocurrencies on the Algorand network. This makes it attractive to a developer community which is essential to the longevity of any crypto network.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlgorand currently has a very small market cap and market dominance. The smaller this is, the less trust and momentum it can gain overall which affects its future prospects. People, developers, and companies will be more likely to go with bigger, more established competitors.\n\nAlgorand does not offer anything radically different from its more established and trusted competitors. This calls into question whether Algorand can truly take off and gain a respectable market dominance as opposed to remaining a niche, hobbyist blockchain network.\n\nIs Algorand a good investment?\n\nCrypto has now become a staple of many investment portfolios. Even major institutional investors now hold a small percentage of crypto in their portfolios.\n\nPutting a small percentage of your portfolio means that you can benefit from some of the potentially dazzling increases in crypto whilst also not going bankrupt if crypto were to take a really deep nosedive.\n\nThe price of ALGO currently sits at $0.2 and has decreased from high points of $3 in 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlgorand is currently quite a niche and small player in the space with multiple, better alternatives. If investors believe, after due diligence, that it has some advantage in a specific industry or market, then it may be worth dedicating small portions of your crypto portfolio to ALGO.\n\nHowever, Algorand does not actually bring enough radical innovations to supplant the larger, more established players.\n\nAlternatives to Algorand\n\nAlgorand is one of many smart contract blockchains. While it has the advantage of speed over other networks, it is not the only network with unique technical innovations.\n\nIf Algorand is to truly rise and become part of the core DeFi infrastructure, it will have to maintain and innovate in its competitive advantages over the networks below.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the name in cryptocurrency when it comes to DeFi and smart contract capable networks. Given how synonymous it is with the DeFi space and its 19.31% market dominance, Ethereum is the giant that Algorand needs to wrestle with.\n\nWhile Algorand has higher transaction speeds than Ethereum, there are two reasons why this may not be enough to contend with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum has a level of trust in the community that Algorand is a long way from achieving.\n\nNow that Ethereum has moved to the Proof-of-Stake in late 2022, some of the advantages Algorand had over Ethereum have now disappeared. Mining ETH is not as expensive and energy intensive as it used to be.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano (ADA) has a market capitalisation of almost $13 billion and hence the number 8 spot in the crypto space. Cardano was founded based on peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods, lending it technical credibility.\n\nCardano claims to be the most environmentally friendly blockchain network, using only the power of 600 homes annually, which is comparatively less compared to the colossal energy usage of other major cryptocurrencies. This makes it more sustainable in the long-term.\n\nCardano offers a similar feature set to Algorand whilst being more sustainable over the long-term.\n\nPolkadot\n\nComing in the 12th spot with a market capitalisation of $7 billion, Polkadot (DOT) is well-known in the crypto space for its \u2018interoperability\u2019 feature.\n\nThis allows several blockchains together to form one larger network, allowing data to be shared securely and efficiently. This cross-chain collaboration is so important for the future of Web 3.0 and the internet at large, that Polkadot can seriously be considered one of the core digital infrastructures of the future and slowly gain market dominance.\n\nPolkadot is a network that can co-exist with Algorand as it aims to tackle different problems. Algorand is focussed on high transaction speeds and low fees, whilst Polkadot is focussed on interoperability.\n\nIs Algorand (ALGO) halal?\n\nMost scholars hold ALGO and Algorand to be halal. We also share this view.\n\nThe essence of the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are halal comes down to whether they are \u2018M\u0101l\u2019 as we have explained previously. M\u0101l is something that can be acquired, whether it be an item or a service.\n\nThere are three stances on cryptocurrencies today:\n\nCryptocurrency is not M\u0101l, rather it is a speculative, non-Sharia-compliant investment. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset but not a currency. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency.\n\nProponents of view (1) argue that cryptocurrencies are not Sharia-compliant since they have no intrinsic value and are merely entries on a digital ledger.\n\nOur view has always been that (1) does not seem right since cryptocurrencies have value as millions of people are willing to buy, hold, and trade them. They are just as real as fiat currency today which mostly exists in the spreadsheets of banks. Our monetary system became predominantly digital a while ago.\n\nView (2) seems to be the most realistic view, as cryptocurrencies are a new and emerging technology that are yet to mature into fully fledged currencies used by economies at large. However, in practice, there is no real difference for casual users between (2) and (3) since they both consider trading cryptocurrencies to be permissible.\n\nZakat is due on ALGO like any other currency. Zakat will be relatively simple to calculate since it is simply like holding US dollars or Pound Sterling. Read our Zakat on crypto guide for a good explanation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Pure Proof-of-Stake mechanism is a good innovation which results in higher transaction speeds, lower costs, and better scalability. The question is though, is this enough to foster a developer and consumer community that will be loyal to Algorand to the exclusion of all other, larger blockchain networks that offer similar feature sets?\n\nIf Algorand can\u2019t clearly demonstrate a unique selling point to truly distinguish itself from its bigger competitors, then it\u2019s not clear how much longevity it has in the coming years."

        "title": "What is 'BASE'? Here is What We Know So Far About the L2 Project Being Built by Coinbase - Securities.io",
        "content": "This week, the publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase unveiled its own Ethereum layer-2 network called Base and advised the crypto community to stay tuned for the upcoming mainnet launch.\n\nThe Base chain will be home to Coinbase's on-chain products as well as an open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps (dApps), said the leading cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps. Our goal with Base is to make on-chain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the crypto economy,\u201d Coinbase said on Twitter.\n\nCoinbase Senior Director of Engineering Jesse Pollak shared that while the platform was only announced on Thursday, a testnet for Base has actually been live since the start of the month.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bet that we can help enable the next million dapps, which are going to bring in the next billion users. We think that will happen on a five- to 10-year horizon, and this is our contribution to making that happen sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nThe goal of Base is to bring about phase 4 of Coinbase's \u2018secret master plan,' which is to create an open financial system and onboard the next wave of users to the crypto economy. With this move, Coinbase has become the first publicly traded company to launch an Ethereum Layer 2.\n\nLayer 2 networks help make transactions faster and cheaper than the underlying blockchain, such as Ethereum, by processing batches of transactions on a separate chain and then sending receipts back to the mainnet.\n\nClick here to know all about investing in crypto.\n\nEntering a Crowded Sector\n\nCoinbase's Base is just one of many Ethereum Layer 2s; others in the space include Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, and Starknet, to name a few.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, there is currently more than $6 billion worth of ETH on these layer 2s, which is a 17% growth from a month ago. This website tracks 26 different Ethereum scaling networks and notes that Arbitrum One accounts for the majority (53%) of the L2 market share, while Optimism has captured 31% of this segment.\n\nHowever, unlike these L2s, Base will not be launching a network token, which is used on other networks to pay gas fees and incentivize development.\n\nAccording to Coinbase, \u201ctokens are not the only way to drive activity,\u201d instead, it believes \u201cbuilding great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nIt's interesting to note that both Arbitrum and Optimism launched their networks without tokens initially. However, Optimism has since airdropped its governance token to early adopters of its network. This was done in order to distribute governance power to the community and fund development proposals through its DAO. There have been rumors that Arbitrum has been planning something similar for a long time, but no token has yet been released.\n\nHowever, Base's entry into the market may not be as competitive for Optimism. According to Coinbase's announcement, Base will be \u201ca rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism.\u201d\n\nThe base will also return a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective. \u201cThis move furthers the Collective's vision for a sustainable future where Impact = Profit,\u201d tweeted Optimism on Thursday.\n\nFollowing the Coinbase announcement, Optimism's native token, OP, recorded a jump in price. The $668 million market cap coin is up 11% in the past 24 hours and nearly 240% YTD, as per CoinGecko. Launched in May 2022, just earlier this month, OP hit an ATH of $3.19.\n\nEarlier this month, Optimism revealed its plans to upgrade its network next month, which is a \u201cstep towards a multi-chain future.\u201d Dubbed \u201cBedrock,\u201d the upgrade aims to lower fees, increase transfer speed, and enhance compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nTo address the issues of speed and cost associated with layer-1 blockchains, Optimism uses \u201crollups,\u201d which involve processing transactions on a separate chain and then settling them on the mainnet in batches.\n\nDecentralized Over Time\n\nThe Base chain is launched with dozens of partners who have committed to building in and supporting the ecosystem. Some of these include Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, oracle network Chainlink, DeFi protocol Aave, Animoca Bands, and SushiSwap.\n\nCoinbase said it intends for Base governance to be fully decentralized, but it won't be that way initially. Instead, it would happen rather progressively in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is going to gradually transition into a role where we're a contributor to Base, we provide services and products that are built on top of Base, and we are not the decision maker for everything in the Base network \u2014 that's being done through more decentralized governance,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nAnd to best achieve its goals, Coinbase has decided to join Optimism as a core developer on the open-source OP Stack. They have also decided to keep the core team really lean so that \u201cwe can have an outsized impact if we're building on-chain,\u201d said Pollak.\n\nThe exchange explained in the official blog post that by leveraging Optimism's OP Stack and collaborating with Optimism, Base will act as \u201can open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the crypto economy scale.\u201d\n\nSo, Coinbase will have more control over Base at first with the vision to make Base fully permissionless eventually. And according to the announcement, Base will progress from its current Stage 0 to the next stage rollup this year alone, with the Stage 2 rollup to be achieved in 2024.\n\nWhile Base will be a separate network, it will still be powered by the underlying blockchain, that is, Ethereum. It will use Ethereum's security infrastructure, but it won't be limited to Ethereum; rather will also provide easy and secure access to other layer 2 networks, such as Optimism, as well as other blockchains ecosystems, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\n\u201cBase offers full EVM equivalence at a fraction of the cost and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform,\u201d explains Coinbase's blog post on the L2 Base.\n\nCoinbase further plans to integrate the Base chain across its exchange, wallet, NFT marketplace, and developer products.\n\nAlong with the new chain, Coinbase also announced the launch of a Base Ecosystem Fund to support early-stage projects working with Base as long as they meet the company's investment criteria.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Optimism.\n\nCOIN Gaining Strength\n\nWhile in its announcement, Coinbase made it clear that it has \u201cno plans to issue a new network token,\u201d degen traders were quick to find an alternative.\n\nSome degen crypto traders piled into an unrelated token called BASE following Coinbase's layer-2 announcement. The native token of Base Protocol, BASE saw its price soar about 350% in a few hours to almost its ATH before falling down hard to its previous levels.\n\nSome have suggested that insider trading may have occurred, as the BASE token began to move long before the Coinbase announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase (COIN) prices are up 16% since early last week but down 29% since early February highs. COIN is a $14.43 billion market cap stock trading at $62.36 at the time of writing.\n\nIn 2023, along with the broad crypto market green, COIN prices also recovered, having started the year under $32. Still, the stock is nowhere near its all-time high (ATH) of $430 hit when it first started trading on Nasdaq under the COIN ticker in April 2021. The COIN stock prices have only been down since currently 85.5% off their peak.\n\nAmidst the positive price movement, Cathie Wood's investment management firm ARK added around $13.2 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) shares, per an investor email on Thursday.\n\nARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) added 181,972 shares ($11.4 million) of Coinbase. This was the fund's biggest COIN order of the year, surpassing the $9.2 million order earlier this month. Meanwhile, 31,547 COIN shares ($1.93 million) were added to Ark's Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nThese purchases came after Coinbase reported its Q4 2022 earnings this Tuesday, which beat analyst expectations.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $605 million, up 5% from $590 million in the third quarter. Subscription and service revenues grew 34% to $283 million in Q4, accounting for almost 50% of Coinbase's overall revenue in the quarter, which was primarily due to interest income that came in at $162.2 million. Transaction volume, however, fell 12% quarter over quarter to $322 million on lower overall trading volume.\n\nIn its shareholder letter, Coinbase said crypto markets have improved in Q1 2023 compared to Q4 2022, helping it generate $120 million in transaction revenue in January 2023.\n\nHowever, during the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong cautioned retail investors \u201cnot to extrapolate those results forward,\u201d pointing out that last year revealed just how volatile the crypto market can be.\n\nCoinbase expects increased crypto regulation globally in the coming years and anticipates benefiting from it. The company also criticized the fragmented approach of the United States to regulating crypto but continues to work towards more consistent policies.\n\n\u201cPolicy is my top priority this year,\u201d said Armstrong, adding that he's been spending a lot of time in Washington, D.C. \u201cThere is a lot of excitement about the potential of this technology, and there is a lot of desire for people to have this built here in America.\u201d"

        "content": "BIG Donates $1.5M to the Ocean\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably heard of the top crypto presale coin Big Eyes Coin (BIG). If you\u2019ve been living under a rock, or you\u2019re new to crypto, BIG is another adorable meme coin known for presenting competition for some of the already established ones like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The coin has launched and promised numerous benefits from its 200% bonus launch code, to user governance, to its new loot box. But did you know that BIG also dedicates 5% of all investments to its charity wallet? The coin has pledged to regularly donate to charities that aim to protect aquatic life from pollution and harmful fishing, among others. With $29M raised in investments so far, this accounts for almost $1.5M in donations to protect our oceans! It\u2019s also worth mentioning that in addition to 5% of funding donated to charities that help ocean sanctuaries, they have also given $1000 to ACT International. This is also known as the Luna Charity, which is an organization that supports children who have suffered the impact of different tragic events such as violence, war, and natural disasters.\n\nNew Treaty Enforced With Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain technologies like Solana and Ethereum can transcend beyond the realm of finance. These networks can also track illegal fishing and criminal behavior on the high seas. So far, many organizations have fought to enforce an ethical set of principles, but it has been extremely difficult to police them. This is because, on international waters, there are no laws that govern fishermen. After all, it has been nearly impossible to regulate. This means the government has no control over who does and how much they take. They also believe illegal and unregulated fishing accounts for around $23.5 billion a year! So it\u2019s a serious problem.\n\nSome countries have grouped and negotiated specific regulations for sections of high waters, like rules governing tuna fishing in the Pacific or fish stocks in the Atlantic between Greenland and Europe, but experts state that the existing patchwork makes it too hard to manage biodiversity in international waters. Liz Karan, senior manager for the high seas at the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit organization, mentioned that small Pacific island nations suffer the most from this system. She noted that the EEZs of countries like Kiribati, Nauru, and the Solomon Islands leave gaps for large-scale international fishing vessels to come in.\n\nThe solution?\n\nWorld Wide Fund for Pandas, a conservation organization, suggests that the government should mandate fishermen tag fish with a scannable code that is uploaded to a blockchain ledger. This way businesses and customers can confirm the source of any given tuna for sale at a retailer. This transparency will allow consumers to avoid contributing to an ill-gotten catch. It\u2019s possible that blockchain technology can operate as the means to close these governance gaps.\n\nFor More On Presale Token Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

        "content": "\u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d is a phrase that has reverberated around the world of crypto more and more in recent times. While a centralized exchange (CEX) and its order book model can offer a great user experience and convenience, numerous events over the last 12 months have highlighted their faults.\n\nFor your coins to be safe, you need complete control. Decentralized exchanges and their automated market maker (AMM) models may seemingly offer the solution, but these can also be beset with issues including impermanent loss and slippage. D5 Exchange, a new decentralized exchange (DEX), will offer the best of both worlds \u2013 the convenience and user experience of a CEX, but the safety of a DEX.\n\nPowered by Gridex Protocol, the beta version of D5 Exchange will be released in March, providing a secure, seamless, and complete on-chain trading experience. D5 uses Gridex\u2019s proprietary Grid Order Maker Book (GMOB) model to enable the instant trading of ERC20 tokens (more chains will be added in the future).\n\nWithout the need for additional permissions or smart contracts, anyone can further expand upon the protocol. The Grid Price Linear Movement (GPLM) algorithm manages transaction execution and settlement based on the GMOB model. The GPLM aims to use the same amount of resources as the Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM) algorithm in order to lower gas consumption when running on Ethereum.\n\nWith its Maker Orders protocol, users will benefit from a smoother trading experience thanks to the availability of liquidity composed of internal Maker\u2019s trading needs and aggregation of Uniswap V2, V3, and Curve as external liquidity. Additionally, the DEX will offer well-known Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism for quicker, less expensive transactions.\n\nMain features\n\nTo recap, the main features of D5 Exchange are:\n\nPermissionless listing and incentivized orders\n\nProvides the best rate from multiple liquidities\n\nComplete decentralization, so users are always in control of their assets\n\nNo impermanent loss and no slippage\n\nLow costs and high order fill rate\n\nAt its core, D5 Exchange provides the user experience of a CEX but the decentralization and transparency of a DEX.\n\nAbout D5 Exchange\n\nD5 is the first aggregator combining the power of Order Books and AMMs, providing a revolutionary on-chain trading experience. It is here to shake up the game with its innovative platform that brings user experience, decentralization, and transparency to the forefront. The future of DeFi is here, and D5 Exchange is leading the charge.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to join the DeFi revolution and reap the rewards!

        "title": "Coinbase launches its very own Layer 2 Network; why it matters - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Coinbase announced the launch of its own Layer 2 Ethereum Network called \u201cBase\u201d. Nairametrics understands that the network was built on what is known as the \u201cOptimistic Rollup technology\u201d and was designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum users.\n\nCoinbase also announced a partnership with the Optimism Foundation, a non-profit organization, that writes software codes to scale the Ethereum technology, as the core developer for the new network. Base is also built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack.\n\nThe technology being implemented is known as the \u201cSuperchain.\u201d It is a layer 2 scaling solution that allows multiple transactions to be processed off-chain and then batched together and submitted to the Ethereum blockchain as a single transaction. This will allow for faster and cheaper transactions while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.\n\nMore details about Base: The reasoning behind launching Base falls within Coinbase\u2019s mission statement. Coinbase believes on-chain is the next online and will help onboard over a billion users into the cryptocurrency space. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products and an open ecosystem where anyone can build.\n\nThe announcement said: \u201cTo bring in billions of users to the cryptoeconomy, dapps need to be easier, cheaper, and safer to interact with. For this to happen, we need to make it even easier for developers to build these dapps.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, Base is built with the security and scalability you need to power your decentralized apps. It leverages the underlying security of Ethereum, along with Coinbase\u2019s best practices, to enable you to confidently onramp into Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.\n\nBase is also expected to make it easier to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Per the announcement, Base makes it easy to build decentralized apps with access to Coinbase\u2019s products, users, and tools. Users are expected to enjoy seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools, which will enable developers to serve the existing 110 million verified users on Coinbase who all have over $80 billion in assets on the platform.\n\nBase is also expected to reduce Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee charges, especially during times of high activity on the network. The announcement explains that Base will offer a full EVM equivalence at a fraction of the cost and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform.\n\nDevelopers, for example, will be able to set up gasless transactions for their dapps with easy developer APIs for account abstraction, and securely build multichain applications with easy-to-use bridges.\n\nWhat the Industry is Saying: The Ethereum community appears to have taken a bullish view of Coinbase\u2019s Base. A prominent member of the crypto community and host of the Bankless Show, Ryan Sean Adams, said the move \u201cis a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum,\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that this could set a precedent for cryptocurrency companies and financial institutions to use Ethereum as the settlement layer of choice. He said:\n\n\u201cThey choose Ethereum instead of launching their own L2. This is a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum. This sets precedent that other crypto companies will follow, then Fintechs, then banks. Eventually the world will use Ethereum as a settlement and property rights system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sebastien Guillemot, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm dcSpark, suggested that Coinbase made a wise decision to go with a layer 2 as opposed to an independent sidechain, noting that \u201calmost all\u201d cryptocurrency transactions and value locked on Ethereum resides on layer 2s these days.\n\nBut there has also been some criticisms. Gabriel Shapiro, the general counsel of investment firm Delphi Labs, explained in a February 23 Twitter post that launching a centralized layer-2 network \u201copens the door\u201d to unwanted SEC scrutiny.\n\nWhat you should know: Coinbase has approximately 110 million verified users and has partnered with 245,000 companies in over 100 countries since it was founded in 2012. Its cryptocurrency exchange is the second largest in terms of trading volume, behind Binance according to CoinGecko. Adams added, \u201cIf Coinbase converts 20% of its 110m verified users to Layer 2 users in the coming years, this alone will 10x the total number of crypto native users.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he explained that the layer-2 network is currently in its testnet phase."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow in popularity, investors are looking for ways to predict the price of its digital assets better.\n\nThe second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market is Ethereum (ETH). With so many variables affecting the price of ETH, it can be difficult for investors to forecast its price accurately. Thus, investors are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help predict the price of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum for several reasons.\n\nAI seemingly has the ability to analyze vast amounts of data; with so much data available on Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market as a whole, AI can quickly identify chart patterns and trends. In turn, Finbold has gathered projections made by CoinPriceForecast, the finance prediction platform that uses machine self-learning technology, to gauge Ethereum price for the end of 2023.\n\nAccording to the latest long-term forecast, retrieved by Finbold on February 23, Ethereum\u2019s price will climb above $2,000 by the middle of 2023 and hit $2,146 by the end of the year marking a 31% increase from today to the year\u2019s end.\n\nEthereum end of 2023 price prediction. Source: CoinPriceForcast\n\nEthereum technical analysis\n\nAs new data becomes available, AI can incorporate it into its analysis and adjust its predictions accordingly. AI can provide investors with more up-to-date forecasts as further information becomes available.\n\nHowever, technical analysis and the opinions of market analysts who have a sense of the sentiment in the crypto market on a day-to-day basis also need to be weighed in to have an overall view of the the cryptocurrency\u2019s future price outlook.\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical indicators on TradingView\u2018s one-day gauges are bullish, with the summary aligning with the \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment at 17 while moving averages are for the \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 14. Oscillators are pointing at \u2018buy\u2019 with 3.\n\nEthereum 1-day gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trading expert Michael van de Poppe noted that $1,600 is a solid level to look for long positions with Ethereum, with the digital asset likely to continue its uptrend.\n\n\u201c$1,600 is a great level for longing on Ethereum. Most likely, the trend will continue from here.\u201d\n\nLonging Ethereum. Source: Michael van de Poppe\n\nFinally, with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade on Sepolia set for February 28, investors may see ETH\u2019s price surge sooner rather than later. With the cryptocurrency market continuing to grow and evolve, the use of AI in cryptocurrency investing will likely become even more prevalent.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin have started 2023 in the green \u2013 what crypto holders should expect next? - South Florida Caribbean News",
        "content": "The biggest digital currencies by market cap have climbed slightly over the last few days, and specialists are optimistic they\u2019ll perform better in 2023 than in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has entered the new year registering modest gains, but even if it barely moved over the last months, it\u2019s crucial to note that it grew by 1% in the first week of January. A look at exchange platforms shows that the oldest cryptocurrency is trading at over $16,500, slowly increasing in value. In January 2022, Bitcoin was trading over 60% higher than it\u2019s now, but let\u2019s stay positive and remember that it remained the biggest digital coin in the sector, despite the bear market.\n\nEthereum was also up at the end of 2022 and entered 2023 with a growth of 1,9%. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap had some terrible periods before and after the Merge. Let\u2019s remember that in November, it plunged to around $1,100 due to the shift from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake protocol. But in December, it registered an increase in value and remained almost flat over the first week of January 2023.\n\nInvestors interested to buy Ethereum online should have a quick look at Binance to have a clear picture of the coin\u2019s evolution in 2022 and the first month of 2023. According to the Ethereum Foundation, ETH holders will have an interesting 2023 because the blockchain will introduce Proto Danksharding in the following period, and it won\u2019t be the only update of the ecosystem. The introduction of withdrawals will definitely make waves in the sector. Testing for the feature starts in January, but stakeholders will benefit from it by the end of March.\n\nHowever, even if cryptocurrencies had some catastrophic months, experts believe they\u2019ll bounce back. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that digital currencies have been in a freefall over the last few months due to the negative events in the worldwide economy. The average value of cryptocurrencies dropped, based on statistics from exchange platforms. Then came the implosion of FTX, which also had a negative impact on the sector. Crypto investors have several reasons to be pessimistic about digital coins\u2019 evolution in 2023, but analysts believe it\u2019s important to keep their faith. Despite the events from last year, the overall crypto ecosystem has potential because its decentralised nature allows it to bounce back. The sector has good survival instincts, to say so.\n\nThe crypto market seems to always bounce back\n\n2022 wasn\u2019t the first time the market entered a bear phase. Bitcoin registered some dramatic drops in price in 2014, when the returns decreased by 58%, and its value remained depressed until 2017. Then in 2018, it plunged in value for over 18 months. And we all remember that it survived crypto winters and came back stronger every time.\n\nEthereum also went through similar stages over the years, experiencing some steep declines, followed by sharp spikes in price. Crypto specialists often compare Bitcoin and Ethereum with cockroaches that just don\u2019t want to die. They continue to survive the most challenging instances because they\u2019re largely decentralised systems. Besides, the collapse of FTX has triggered an increased adoption of DeFi, which is powered by cryptocurrencies and is predicted to become a bright spot for the sector.\n\nDeFi\u2019s rise\n\nThe crash of FTX had no impact on DeFi\u2019s evolution, and finance experts believe that investors will most likely shift towards digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin to benefit from their application-based ecosystems.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain houses several crypto applications like commerce, decentralised social media, and NFT-based gaming. Applications use the Ethereum blockchain because it enables them to use or build ETH currencies and complete transactions. Even if at the moment, only 5% of the overall number of internet users take advantage of crypto, it\u2019s expected their number to grow due to these applications.\n\nIt also seems like value in the market will move from speculative digital assets to application-driven and utility ecosystems like Ethereum.\n\nMarket regulation\n\nAs the news announced for some time, the market will face regulation in the near future, which isn\u2019t a bad thing because it could benefit it in the long term. Investors usually deride moves to regulate the space. The blockchain and the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) came to life as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. Crypto enthusiasts have visions of switching from controlled traditional finance to a more decentralised one. However, not that digital currencies are moving into the mainstream, and more and more people demand regulation. The fall of FTX also triggered an increase in the number of investors requiring a formal framework.\n\nFinance analysts state that regulation will definitely bring some adjustments in the industry, but the policies aim to create a more sustainable ecosystem and attract more institutional investors.\n\nConsidering the above, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the crypto market has strong potential to grow, especially as people consider digital currencies as speculative assets they can add to their portfolios to gain income.\n\nWhat does 2023 bring for Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s competitors?\n\n2022 was a bad year not only for Ethereum and Bitcoin but for all the other altcoins. The bear market caused drops in prices for all cryptocurrencies, and few disappeared completely from the market.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts bet on projects linked to scalability on the Ethereum blockchain, like Arbitrum and Polygon, to trigger market growth. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that other altcoins won\u2019t have their place in the spotlight in 2023. Even if they still have some challenges to overcome, Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana are expected to perform well in 2023.\n\nCardano passed the 4,000 smart contracts mark and has one of the best-developed networks in the sector, so investors will maintain their interest in it.\n\nSolana registered growth in the NFT sector, despite the bear market and remained a leader in the market due to its low fees and fast network.\n\nAvalanche continued to invest in upgrading the network despite the crypto winter and made some important partnerships with Ethereum\u2019s competitors."

        "content": "Over the past 7 days, Coinbase NFT has recorded crypto trading volumes of less than 5 Ethereum. However, a drop in sales does not discourage the company behind the marketplace, which still considers it a viable project.\n\nCoinbase not discouraged by drop in crypto volumes on its NFT marketplace\n\nAccording to data from Dune Analytics, Coinbase reportedly recorded NFT trading volumes of less than 5 Ethereum (the equivalent of about $7,700) over the past seven days.\n\nThis is a huge drop in Non-Fungible Token sales. Indeed, while there have been only 47 sales on Coinbase NFT in the past 7 days, in June last year, the marketplace had recorded records of more than 1,000 NFT sales in just 24 hours.\n\nIn this regard, Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi reportedly stated that the company continues to view Coinbase NFT as a viable project. Here are her words in response to questions on the topic from shareholders:\n\n\u201cWe continue to see medium and long-term opportunities here. We\u2019ve got a very lean team on it now, but we\u2019re not throwing in the towel by any means.\u201d\n\nCoinbase NFT and its new goals compared to other marketplaces\n\nChoi\u2019s speech relates to what had already been pre-announced by the platform regarding Coinbase NFT\u2019s goals.\n\nRest assured, our mission for Coinbase NFT hasn\u2019t changed and we remain optimistic about our future as we continue building. We\u2019re excited to find more opportunities to work with with creators in the future. \u2014 Coinbase NFT \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@Coinbase_NFT) February 1, 2023\n\nBasically, Coinbase\u2019s Non-Fungible Token platform, instead of competing with current leaders OpenSea and Blur in NFT sales, prefers to redefine its mission and focus on catering to creators.\n\nIndeed, it appears that the suspension of creator drops on the marketplace in early February would serve to let the platform focus on features and tools requested by NFT creators themselves.\n\nSome people seem to like this mission, to the point of preferring Coinbase NFT to OpenSea\n\nIn response to the news that @opensea no longer enforces creator royalties, we have blocked their marketplace and all others that participate in this practice. @Coinbase_NFT will be our preferred marketplace to buy and sell @DeathbatsClub . \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 M. Shadows (@shadows_eth) February 20, 2023\n\nNFT sales for the past seven days of OpenSea and Blur\n\nAs we continue to look at the charts from Dune Analytics, dominating the NFT marketplace scene in sales are OpenSea and Blur.\n\nIndeed, in the last week, Blur recorded NFT trading volumes worth nearly 76.5 ETH (the equivalent of about $127,000). The number of sales actually amounted to only 52.\n\nOpenSea, on the other hand, recorded 304 sales in the last week with an NFT trading volume of nearly 80 ETH (the equivalent of over $133,000).\n\nThis great competition between the two platforms has recently led OpenSea to want to implement 0% fees to win over the user base lost to Blur.\n\nIn contrast to Coinbase, which wants to target creators, both OpenSea and Blur are instead targeting users eager to get higher returns from their NFT investments.\n\nThat is why OpenSea reportedly dropped its 2.5% fee."

It will be providing all of the connected users a safe and economical method of creating decentralized apps, or for that matter, dApps onchain. It will also supposedly be extremely user-friendly and accessible by anyone and from just about any place on the globe.\n\nThe aim and intention of Coinbase, where Base is concerned, is to be able to convert onchain into the next online, along with onboarding 1B+ users within the crypto-economy. In order to be able to achieve this effectively, Base will be playing the role of a home, in the case of Coinbase\u2019s onchain products, as well as an open ecosystem wherein just about any user will be capable of creating.\n\nCoinbase is an American publicly traded company that deals in Cryptocurrency. The company works as a crypto exchange platform. All the employees work from a remote location as everything is virtual, and the company does not have a physical headquarter.\n\nCoinbase happens to be working on the development of Bse within itself with the proper utilization of its collective expertise in the creation of crypto products, all the while focussing on the decentralization of the chain over a period of time. However, they happen to be absolutely clear about the fact that there are no plans afoot to bring out a new network token.\n\nThe idea behind the creation of Base happens to be the desire to make it the most convenient place for developers to be able to create onchain. It has been duly secured by Ethereum, which makes it safe as well as upgradable for the added boost in the case of decentralized apps. It has also been sufficiently boosted by Coinbase in order to make it more convenient for the creation of decentralized apps and being connected with Coinbase\u2019s products, users, as well as tools.\n\nBase happens to have many prime features along with very economical fees and provides complete EVM-like facilities at a much lesser cost. It also happens to be open-source, with its focus on being decentralized as well as permissionless. It will also allow any user to be able to build a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain that is boosted by Optimism.\n\nIn order to be able to rope in an almost endless number of users to the cryptoeconomy, there is a requirement for dApps to be more convenient, along with being more economical as well as secure for carrying out interactions. In the creation and development of Base, Coinbase is looking into certain aspects. In their opinion, Base needs to be offering convenient and safe connectivity with Ethereum L1, other L2s, along with other L1 ecosystems. It also needs to be open-source as well as decentralized.\n\nWhere Coinbase is concerned, there also happens to be the factor of a Base Ecosystem Fund that has been duly set up. It will be instrumental in making investments, as well as backing nascent stage projects that happen to be created on Base on the condition of meeting certain requirements."

        "title": "LayerZero's Testnet Bridge Between Ethereum And Goerli Sparks Community Backlash - Crypto Mode",
        "content": "Developing for the Ethereum ecosystem often involves using one of its testnets. Goerli is, along with Sepolia, a fan favorite. Unfortunately, getting testnet ETH for development purposes can be difficult, although the solution by LayerZero isn\u2019t the best approach either.\n\nMore Liquidity For Goerli Developers\n\nIt is commendable to see a new approach to bring more testnet ETH to Goerli. Unfortunately, while there is a faucet developers can request funds from, it doesn\u2019t have an infinite supply. Pre-PoS, it used to generate coins through mining, but that is no longer the case. Goerli is subject to proof-of-stake rules, making itmore challenging to get testnet currency. Overall, there is a hard limit on available Goerli liquidity, which has become a hindrance.\n\nDevelopers relying on solutions like Blockdaemon can have an account manager send them some funds. Unfortunately, that supply isn\u2019t endless either. Eventually, the funds will run dry unless something changes. Developers already have to wait hours \u2013 if not days \u2013 to claim funds from the default faucet. LayerZero came up with a potential solution, although it meets some criticism.\n\nOne way of bringing more liquidity to the testnet is through a bridge. The testnet bridge lets users convert mainnet Ethereum liquidity into Goerli-based ETH. Moreover, the project has an initial Goerli-ETH price is $0.1, with a seeded pool on Uniswap. Users can convert between ETH and gETH, or ETH to mETH on the Goerli network. That should make it easy to create two-way liquidity and ensure developers don\u2019t have to twiddle their thumbs.\n\nThe Community Isn\u2019t Amused\n\nThe approach by LayerZero solves a pressing issue, but there are many uneasy questions. First, it introduces another ETH-based ticker on Uniswap, which may cause novice users to buy the \u201cwrong Ethereum\u201d. While they can eventually convert gETH to ETH again, they would also pay fees and potential slippage costs. That is not fair, yet it will likely cause issues eventually.\n\nSecond, the community consensus is how Goerli-ETH should be a public good. However, when tying that good to monetized services, things take a very dark turn \u2013 a bridge needs to make money. In addition, some people feel this will drain the faucet even further and prevent developers from using the testnet altogether. The Goerli-ETH supply is already limited, and making it a \u201cpremium feature\u201d through this bridge sends the wrong signal.\n\nPublic good? This is gonna drain faucets and restrain developers from using the testnet\u2026 What\u2019s going on @PatrickAlphaC @austingriffith ? \u2014 lulox.eth \ud83d\udc31 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 (@LuloxEth) February 22, 2023\n\nFurthermore, the liquidity on Goerli today could be used as liquidity for the Uniswap pool. That further strains the circulating supply and creates monetary incentives that shouldn\u2019t even exist. People now have an extra reason to hoard an already scarce asset and convert it to Ether to the highest bidder. That will have long-term consequences for Goerli-ETH."
