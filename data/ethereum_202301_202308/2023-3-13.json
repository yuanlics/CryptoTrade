        "title": "Ethereum Now Featured Twice in Crypto Top 10 \u2014 Thanks to Lido - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum now commands two out of the top 10 market cap spots, after the premiere ETH staking derivative flipped Binance\u2019s stablecoin earlier this week.\n\nLido Staked ETH (stETH) is now worth more than $10 billion, per CoinGecko, eclipsing Binance USD (BUSD), which now has only $8.4 billion in circulation.\n\nBUSD had about double that at the start of the year, ranking it in seventh place, slightly behind XRP.\n\nIts issuer Paxos has faced compounding redemptions after a Wells notice from the SEC claimed the stablecoin represents an unregistered securities offering.\n\nClick play to watch stETH flip BUSD and enter the top 10 | Chart by David Canellis\n\nLike other liquid staking providers, Lido allows ether holders to stake their ETH in return for a separate derivative token, stETH.\n\nStaking directly to the Ethereum blockchain without services such as Lido requires 32 ETH ($56,500) to operate a staking validator node. All staked ether cannot be withdrawn until the network\u2019s next big upgrade, Shanghai, goes live next month.\n\nStETH turns ETH staked via Lido into an immediately liquid asset, which can either be traded on crypto exchanges, lent out or used as collateral for loans across DeFi protocols.\n\nThe token is backed by ether locked in staking, but its price isn\u2019t directly pegged; stETH has wavered from ETH parity at times.\n\nLido also automatically pays stETH holders daily staking rewards passed down from the Ethereum blockchain. There\u2019s currently just shy of 5.6 million ETH ($9.9 billion) staked inside Lido\u2019s protocol (excluding interest), according to Nansen, up 150% from around 2.3 million ETH ($4.1 billion) one year ago. Etherscan shows more than 171,000 wallet addresses hold stETH.\n\nMeanwhile, ether dominance \u2014 which measures how much of the crypto market is ETH \u2014 hovers a touch under 20%, while bitcoin dominance is almost 46%.\n\nEther liquid staking derivatives find product-market fit\n\nIn any case, ether staking derivatives like stETH have exploded in popularity in recent months, making the best of the lengthy lockup periods associated with participating in Ethereum 2.0 consensus.\n\nThe earliest ETH stakers locked their tokens in the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain back in Nov. 2020, when ether was less than $450.\n\nETH has since rallied as much as 1,000%, reaching a high of $4,878 one year after the Beacon contract went live, before dropping 64% to under $1,800 today.\n\nETH goes up and down, but the number of ETH staked in consensus can only increase (for now)\n\nMore than 17.6 million ETH ($31.3 billion) has been staked, representing nearly 15% of the circulating supply overall.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum is a security\u2014CFTC is wrong - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has clarified that, in his view, ETH is an unregistered security\u2014as are most other tokens in the digital currency industry.\n\nOn March 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam expressed a different perspective. In his view, ETH is a commodity and thus falls under the regulatory purview of the CFTC. Noting that ETH had been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, he said, \u201cwe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, New York Attorney General Letitia James weighed in late last week with a lawsuit against KuCoin, accusing it of selling unregistered securities, specifically ETH.\n\nSo, who\u2019s right? Is ETH a security? According to the Howey Test, it absolutely is.\n\nETH is a security according to the Howey Test\n\nFirst, let\u2019s begin with a simple explainer of what The Howey Test is and why it matters. This will be crucial to understanding why ETH is a security.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, \u201cThe Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the Howey Test, an investment contract exists if there is an \u201cinvestment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the Howey Test is used to determine what is and isn\u2019t a security in the United States. It\u2019s a well-known term within the digital currency industry as it has been brought up in relation to high-profile cases like SEC vs. Ripple.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the Howey Test further. In order to qualify as an investment contract, there has to be:\n\nInvestment of money.\n\nIn a common enterprise.\n\nWith a reasonable expectation of profits.\n\nWith those profits being derived from the effort of others.\n\nAstute observers will immediately see that, in all likelihood, the Ethereum ICO from 2014 meets all four criteria. During the sale, more than 7 million ETH tokens were sold in the first 12 hours alone, with coins sent to a wallet controlled by ETHSuisse, a company based in Switzerland.\n\nSo, under the guise of a \u2018decentralized\u2019 ICO, we have:\n\n1. The investment of money. Everyone who sent BTC to the Ethereum ICO wallet address will attest to that.\n\n2. In a common enterprise, in this case, EthSuisse. This was a company based in Zug, Switzerland. This firm has since been dissolved, and the Ethereum Foundation has taken control.\n\n3. With a reasonable expectation of profits. Why else does anyone buy into ICOs? The hype around Ethereum was insane including by its main pitchman Vitalik Buterin.\n\n4. With the profits being derived from the efforts of those who had developed the Ethereum blockchain and would develop it in the future.\n\nI\u2019m not a securities expert, but I possess basic powers of logical deduction, and based on those four simple criteria that make up the Howey Test, ETH is a cut-and-dry security. That the common enterprise that accepted the cash has since been dissolved does not change anything. All four criteria of the Howey Test have been met.\n\nWhat defines a commodity? According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, commodities are \u201cgoods that can be freely sold to the public. It can be agriculture, fuel, or metals.\u201d It\u2019s much more difficult to see how the argument that ETH tokens fit this definition would hold up in court.\n\nMost ICO tokens are worthless and will go away\n\nAccording to the legal opinion of both the Chairman of the SEC and the New York Attorney General, and according to the logic above, Ethereum, and most other tokens sold via ICO, are unregistered securities.\n\nThat means the people involved in the entities that sold them are legally liable for doing so, and most tokens will share the fate of KIN after the SEC wins its lawsuit against Kik Interactive. Not only do we have qualified opinions and logic to go on, but legal precedent favors the notion that ETH and most other ICO tokens are securities, too.\n\nAll of this should cause readers to radically reassess what the future of the industry might look like. Whereas Satoshi\u2019s original Bitcoin is in the clear, according to Gensler and others, almost everything else can and will be targeted.\n\nThe next few years are going to change everything. Smart developers should switch to a \u2018set in stone\u2018 protocol that scales infinitely and utilizes tokens not issued in any ICO or offering\u2014the original Bitcoin, BSV.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says he is bullish on the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) after a month-long market correction.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs executive says in a new strategy session that ETH could be setting the stage for a major run to the upside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really bullish. I look at the chart. The chart looks great. It feels like we\u2019ve just had this nice kind of month-long correction. I am looking at the ETH [chart], but you can use any of the charts. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s just going to trigger this. I then went back and looked at all the other previous pick-ups from the low and then versus stuff like Amazon back in 2003-04. I look at all of this stuff and normally it always goes higher and faster than people expect. And then corrects.\u201d\n\nPal sets price targets of between $2,000 to $3,000 for an Ethereum run to the upside. However, he says the price of ETH could go even higher since Ethereum is burned when used in transitions, making it more scarce.\n\n\u201cIt could be anywhere between $2,000 and $3,000. Let\u2019s call it that. It could be even higher. I don\u2019t know. Because there are a lot of mechanics in ETH which is very lopsided because of the burn. The more people come into the network, the less ETH is around. I think it might become a problem for ETH, but it\u2019s going to give it a lot of upside volatility.\u201d\n\nPal says Ehtereum may go on an unexpected V-shape recovery.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk of a V-shape up. That\u2019s the risk I think is underpriced.\u201d\n\nEthereum is worth $1,673 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum: Shanghai withdrawals and recent updates for ETH holders - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, the $28 billion worth of staked ether will start to become available in a few weeks.\n\nDue to the high yield, around 17.5 million ETH have been invested in self-hosted or staking-as-a-service validators.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the $28 billion worth of staked ether (ETH) will start to become available thanks to Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThis supply, which is now unavailable for withdrawal and cannot be sold, will gradually be restored to the public markets and have an impact on the price of Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum website, Shanghai may become live in the first half of 2023. According to some analysts, the change might go into effect as soon as April 15, which is U.S. tax day. Staking into Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain hasn\u2019t permitted ETH withdrawals since late 2020.\n\nEthereum guaranteed participants in its proof-of-stake validation a variable 3-12% annualized yield as payment for their multi-month pledge to refrain from selling.\n\nAround 17.5 million ETH have been invested in self-hosted or staking-as-a-service validators as a result of that high yield.\n\nShanghai update staking reward\n\nThe future updates consist of two simultaneous upgrades that have been combined to cover every aspect of the upgrade.\n\nShanghai alludes to modifications made to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, primarily making it possible to deposit staked ETH to execution layer wallets. The Beacon Chain, now known as Capella, must adapt concurrently with the Shanghai upgrading.\n\nA lot of investors might be preparing for a large exodus of ETH, which would be bad for pricing or less secure for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Nevertheless, the new upgrade has restrictions that prevent customers from withdrawing all of their staked ETH at once.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade to Ethereum distinguishes staking payouts from the 32 ETH minimum requirement formerly necessary to activate Proof-of-Stake validator keys.\n\nIn summary, withdrawing validators\u2019 incentives is much simpler and quicker than withdrawing the greater 32 ETH amount from validator activation. Around 18 months will pass before all prizes and the first 32 ETH can be fully withdrawn.\n\nThe post-Shanghai method will permit around 1,800 validators to withdraw their entire initial deposit plus rewards each day. This function deftly restricts the daily withdrawal of ETH.\n\nEthereum chooses 1,800 at random and gives no technical justification; the quota is just eight complete withdrawals every epoch and is meant to reduce sell pressure on ETH.\n\nEthereum developers made staking easy and withdrawing difficult\n\nThe Ethereum developers made stakes simple and withdrawals challenging. Instead of the typically preferred 0x00 prefix, validators will need to alter their credential prefixes to 0x01 before withdrawing.\n\nA withdrawal address must be manually specified by validators because, for some reason, it can only be done so once. Any error could prevent a validator from withdrawing in the future.\n\nOnly after the validator has a withdrawal address set and moves up in the long queue to become eligible for withdrawal can withdrawals take place."

The initiative was aimed \u201c to help projects who are otherwise strong but in a liquidity crisis.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the changes in stable coins and banks, #Binance will convert the remaining of the $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including #BTC, #BNB and ETH. Some fund movements will occur on-chain. Transparency. \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) March 13, 2023\n\nThe move also comes in the wake of Paxos, BUSD's owner and issuer, being hit by a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the agency claiming last month that the firm violated investor protection laws. Paxos announced it would halt BUSD minting and \"end its relationship with Binance,\" for the stablecoin.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how much money from Binance's fund has been converted or is earmarked to be converted into the mentioned coins.\n\nThe ETH address shared by CZ shows some substantial transfers over the past few hours, with the original wallet almost emptied at the time of this writing. Transactions are continuing to be executed at the time of writing.\n\nIt's worth noting that last September Binance began auto-converting USDC deposits into its native BUSD\u2014effectively delisting the rival stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt reached out to Binance for additional comments but was yet to hear back by press time.\n\nUSDC regains USD peg\n\nFurthermore, Binance's decision comes hot on the heels of the USDC stablecoin depegging from its intended $1 price.\n\nThe depegging event was triggered by the ongoing crisis surrounding the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SBV), where the firm holds about $3.3 billion.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was among the 20 largest banks in the U.S. when it failed Friday after a bank run by customers. California state regulators placed the bank under the control of the FDIC, which in turn created a new entity\u2014the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara\u2014through which the remaining assets will be managed.\n\nUSDC plummeted to an all-time low of $0.87 on Friday night.\n\nThe collapse of SBV, preceded by the meltdown of the Silvergate Bank, also sent shockwaves through the stock market, while the crypto industry saw a depressing drop as well, with Bitcoin crashing below $20,000 for the first time since mid-January.\n\nIn a separate move, the Federal Reserve moved to shut down the Signature Bank on Monday morning, another crypto-friendly bank with total assets of around $117 billion as of the end of last year.\n\nThe scare, at least for now, appears to be short-lived though: according to a joint statement from the Fed, U.S. Treasury, and FDIC on Sunday, all depositors of now-shuttered Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank will be able to get their funds out on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Circle is now out of the woods, which is a huge positive for the crypto world,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.\n\nCircle has meanwhile stated that it will \u201ccover any shortfall\u201d caused as a result of the $3.3 billion in its funds held by the collapsed SBV.\n\nThe Boston-based company also reiterated that USDC is 100% collateralized with cash and U.S. Treasuries.\n\nAccording to the firm, \u201cUSDC is currently collateralized 77% ($32.4B) with U.S. Treasury Bills (with a three month or less maturation period), and 23% ($9.7B) with cash held at a variety of institutions, of which SVB is only one.\u201d\n\nThe latest news helped the broader crypto market flip green again, with Bitcoin trading around $22,280 by press time, up 9.1% over the day.\n\nUSDC is changing hands at $0.989, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "The Shapella hard fork has been executed on the Goerli testnet \u2014 the last test run before Ethereum validators will be able to withdraw their Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThere were, however, issues with the hard fork. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko noted that while deposits were being processed, the process didn\u2019t run as smoothly as it could have because several testnet validators didn\u2019t upgrade their client software before the Goerli fork.\n\nDeposits are being processed (https://t.co/CxYtPcGMCp), but it seems like several validators haven't upgraded. Looking into it\n\n\n\nOne challenge with testnet validators is that given the ETH is worthless, there's less incentive to run a validator/monitor it. \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) March 14, 2023\n\nHe blamed it on testnet validators having \u201cless incentive\u201d to make the upgrade given that the Goerli ETH \"is worthless\u201d but expects validators to make proper adjustments ahead of the fork on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum researcher \"terence.eth\" explained that it took 15 epochs for Shapella to be forked onto the Goerli testnet because network participation was below the two-thirds threshold:\n\n15 epochs later, Goerli has finalized.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the Client software. We just had to get the offline operators to upgrade. It was a good stress test.\n\n\n\nOn to the next one. Mainnet! https://t.co/s573n5pC9f \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) March 15, 2023\n\nThrough Ethereum Investment Proposal EIP-4895 staked ETH from the Beacon Chain will be \u201cpushed\u201d to the execution layer.\n\nWhile the Shapella upgrade comprises five different EIPs, EIP-4895 has been by far the most anticipated as it moves Ethereum one step closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake system.\n\nShapella is expected to take effect on the Ethereum mainnet in early April following a few delays in preparing the Sepolia and Goerli testnets for the fork.\n\nThe hard fork will allow for partial and full withdrawals, and will theoretically unlock 17.6 million ETH when Shapella is forked, which equates to over $30 billion at current prices.\n\nHowever several mechanisms are in place to prevent a flood of the ETH supply from hitting the market, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable phased validator withdrawals, allowing users who have been staking to access their staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\n\n\nThere are 522K active validators on Ethereum, and once the upgrade comes, only ~1.6k-1.8k validators would be able to exit per day pic.twitter.com/ewCvD7u1ER \u2014 ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) March 8, 2023\n\nThe number of withdrawals allowed within a 24-hour period will only represent about 0.40% of the total staked ETH because only an approximate 2,200 withdrawals can be processed per day.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Shanghai upgrade could benefit liquid staking providers and cement ETH's layer 1 dominance.\n\nThis is because, in most cases, a maximum of 10 validators can be assigned to an epoch and it takes approximately five or six minutes for an epoch to be processed.\n\nIf each of the 2,200 validators withdraws the full 32 ETH staked per day it would only account for about 70,000 ETH \u2014 a fraction of the 17.6 million staked.\n\nThe execution on Goerli was shared in a March 15 live stream by EthStaker on YouTube."

        "title": "Will Ethereum 2.0 Kill Mining? \u2013 Robotics & Automation News - Robotics and Automation News",
        "content": "Therefore, as a mine, you are considering mining Eth 2.0. You\u2019ve been hearing a lot of excitement about it, so you\u2019re interested to find out whether it\u2019s worthwhile for your money and your time.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of mining Ether 2.0 in this post so you can decide for yourself. Furthermore, ether Systems, a stock exchange, enables ethereum code to carry out their operations immediately.\n\nHow Ever will Mining Be Affected by Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum will undergo a significant update in 2020 called Serenity, often known as Ethereum 2.0. By safeguarding the database and authenticating transactions, miners run and maintain a Cryptocurrency.\n\nThey get Ether, the commodity that underpins Ethereum, in exchange. Because it will enable nodes other than miners to verify and conduct trades, Ether 2.0 will render mining obsolete.\n\nIn addition, it will eliminate the need for miners to contribute by lowering the amount of processing power and bandwidth needed to maintain the Ethereum network.\n\nThough this may be terrible news for miners, Ether 2.0 has several potential advantages. For instance, Ethereum 2.0 will allow miners to validate transactions more quickly and get more rewards.\n\nAdditionally, it will enable them to generate a new revenue stream by offering their computer capacity for sale to other users in the network.\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s Benefits for Mining\n\nWhat benefits does Ethereum 2.0 provide miners, then? One is that mining is done in a far more effective manner. The new PoS technique is intended to enable mining with far less technology, reducing the need for power.\n\nAdditionally, it implies that miners will indeed be able to extract minerals more effectively, allowing them to reap greater returns for their labourers.\n\nBecause of how much more attack-resistant the algorithmic program is, producers will be more likely to forfeit their rewards or income. The third feature of Ethereum 2.0 is its increased scalability.\n\nAs a result, the network will be able to process more payments at once, making it quicker and simpler to use. The advantages of this will be significant for both individuals and enterprises.\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s Drawbacks for Miners\n\nThe second drawback of Ethereum 2.0 is that it will take more time to execute transactions, from ten min to 3 minutes on average. It is because Bitcoin 2.0 will utilize a slower consensus process called Piece of Stake (PoS) compared to the one it now uses, termed Formal verification (Pow).\n\nSome people consider this a positive development since it will make Ethereum 2.0 more secure and egalitarian. However, miners will have to wait much longer to get paid for their labour, making it less desirable for them.\n\nUsers will cut the block incentives the miners will earn with Ethereum 2.0 in half, which brings us to the final and third disadvantage. As a result, they will only get 1.5 ETH for each brick they mine rather than the usual 3 ETH.\n\nAlthough it may not seem like a significant concern, the fact that mining requires buying things (in the form of power bills) means that mines will either have to accept lesser earnings or find a method to reduce their expenses.\n\nThe Miners\u2019 Opinion on Ethereum 2.0\n\nYou undoubtedly want to know what miners think about this whole situation. After all, many individuals may lose their jobs if Ether 2.0 does deal with mining. For several reasons, many miners genuinely support the migration to proof-of-stake.\n\nFirst, proof-of-work is increasingly concentrated, with major powers like Russia holding a significant mining capacity. Decentralization, one of the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies, suffers from this standardization.\n\nSince proof-of-stake eliminates the need for costly mining hardware, anybody with a pc may participate in Ether 2.0. A more decentralized and secure network may result from this.\n\nSecond, actual evidence is using more and more energy. According to an analysis by Gathering important data, Ethereum\u2019s yearly carbon emissions are comparable to that of Las Vegas and will only increase as the network expands. Ether 2.0 will be much more energy-efficient via evidence.\n\nWhat Possibilities Does Ethereum Miner Have in the Future?\n\nIt is due to Ethereum 2.0 possibly switching to a proof-of-stake method, which eliminates the need for mining. What does this entail for miners, then? Well, it may imply that they\u2019ll need to locate another source of income. Or, it can mean they will need to find another source of income.\n\nOf course, Ether 2.0 may either not be deployed in its entirety or will be postponed permanently. In such a situation, miners may exhale with relief and continue their regular work.\n\nBalance Out\n\nSo, will mine disappear as a result of Ether 2.0? It\u2019s difficult to say. On the one extreme, the network changes will significantly reduce the profitability of ETH mining. Conversely, it\u2019s conceivable that the total rise in ETH consumption will balance out the decreasing payouts, allowing miners to carry on making money.\n\nOne thing is for sure: Ethereum blockchain is going through a significant transition, so producers will want to be ready for any possible repercussions. Only the future will reveal whether Ether 2.0 will affect miners.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n"

The group used Ethereum Layer-2 network Polygon for the trades.\n\nA number of institutions worldwide have also leveraged Ethereum and Polygon to issue tokenized bonds.\n\nStill, NAB considers its recent stablecoin transaction a milestone for the bank.

        "content": "Crypto markets are flying as banks and traditional finance stocks get hammered by investors grappling with the collapse of several large banking institutions.\n\nAs a new trading week begins, bank stocks are proving to be the biggest losers, with some of them suffering as much as 75% in losses mere hours into the open.\n\nA look at Yahoo Finance\u2019s list of top losers shows a long list of banking stocks bleeding out badly.\n\nFollowing the recent closure of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, fears of a spreading banking contagion have rocked the sector as investors look to see who could be next on the chopping block. At time of writing, First Republic Bank (FRC) and Western Alliance (WAL) are taking the worst hits from the market turmoil, both down roughly 60%.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) bull and head of ARK Invest Cathie Wood warns that if the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t pivot on interest rates, more banks will be destroyed.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed continues to focus on lagging indicators like the CPI, and does not pivot in response to the deflationary forces telegraphed by the inverted yield curve, then this crisis will devour more regional banks and further centralize, if not nationalize, the US banking system.\n\nAs a result, [ARK Invest is] not surprised that BTC and ETH appreciated as US regional bank stocks imploded. Their blockchains are decentralized, transparent, and auditable. Banks are not and, in the last few days, have become less so.\u201d\n\nBitMEX founder and crypto veteran Arthur Hayes is also expecting the Fed to flip dovish again and print more money, presumably boosting risk assets like crypto.\n\nThat\u2019s a\u2026 savage move in the 2yr.

        "content": "Staking rewards are compensation for services to keep the Ethereum network secure, ConsenSys executives said Monday in a blog post that argued the process should not be confused with an investment.\n\nRewards and fees that network validators might receive are not yield on a loan, nor are they a dividend on investment, argued ConsenSys General Counsel Matt Corva and Bill Hughes, the company\u2019s director of global regulatory matters.\n\n\u201cStaking is a data integrity mechanism that Ethereum and similar blockchain networks require to function, not an investment scheme,\u201d they added in a blog post. \u201cService agreements that offer technical staking solutions are not investment contracts or any other type of enumerated security.\u201d\n\nStaking is a process in which crypto holders participate in validating transactions on the blockchain. In return, the block\u2019s proposer receives a reward paid in the blockchain\u2019s native crypto, such as ether.\n\nRead more: The Investor\u2019s Guide to Staking\n\nFounded in 2014, ConsenSys is a blockchain technology company focused on the Ethereum ecosystem. The firm hosts more than 17,000 Ethereum validators \u2014 representing 3% of all Ethereum validators, according to its website.\n\nValidator rewards come from two places: the protocol-specified rewards and a portion of the transactional fees paid by users who want their transactions added to the network, the ConsenSys executives said.\n\n\u201cRewards aren\u2019t a mythical construct dependent on the acts of a specialized manager, such as funds entrusted to a hedge fund or other money manager who enjoys discretion over how the funds are invested to generate a reward,\u201d Corva and Hughes wrote.\n\nRegulation amid a challenging backdrop\n\nThe declaration comes just days after New York Attorney General Letitia James called ether a security in a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin.\n\nSome industry watchers have said regulators are likely to continue a \u201cregulation-by-enforcement\u201d trend seen in recent months, particularly as contagion in the space has impacted companies like Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.\n\n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s on the same page that we would like to have a more broad, comprehensive legal framework for the entire crypto space,\u201d Wilshire Phoenix co-founder William Cai told Blockworks. \u201cBut the two words \u201ccrypto space\u201d really encompasses so many different pieces, and asking for a comprehensive legal framework\u2026seems to be a difficult task.\u201d\n\nThe ConsenSys blog post also comes about a month after the SEC charged Kraken with failing to register crypto staking products as securities. The crypto exchange settled on both counts \u2014 paying $30 million and ending its on-chain staking services for US clients.\n\nFollowing the Kraken settlement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a tweet that \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are not securities,\u201d adding that the company would \u201chappily defend this in court.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, added in a blog that staking does not meet the Howey Test, which the SEC and US courts use to determine whether an asset is a security.\n\n\u201cWhen a customer asks us to stake some of their crypto, they aren\u2019t giving up one thing to get something else \u2014 they own exactly the same thing they did before,\u201d Grewal wrote. \u201cStaking customers retain full ownership of their assets at all times, as well as the right to \u2018unstake\u2019 those assets consistent with the underlying protocol.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A crypto analyst known for accurately calling Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bottom believes that bullish price actions are in store for Ethereum (ETH), Fantom (FTM) and one low-cap altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Smart Contracter tells his 221,400 Twitter followers that Ethereum rival Fantom looks ready for an uptrend after completing its corrective move down and breaking out of a diagonal resistance.\n\n\u201cNice FTM downtrend break on USD pair and BTC pair and macrostructure is a big clear three wave move down. Hard not to be looking for longs on some things now in light of this weekend price action.\u201d\n\nSmart Contracter practices the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis approach that tries to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset typically resumes its uptrend following a three-wave move down or an ABC wave.\n\nAt time of writing, FTM is trading for $0.413, well above the analyst\u2019s diagonal resistance at $0.37.\n\nNext up is the blockchain indexing protocol The Graph (GRT). According to the crypto trader, GRT also looks bullish after concluding its ABC wave down.\n\n\u201cSo many alts look amazing.\n\nGRT also has a clean ABC down on weekly after five-wave rise.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, GRT is worth $0.144, up over 10% in the past day.\n\nLooking at Ethereum, Smart Contracter says the top altcoin looks strong after rallying from a low of $1,372 on March 10th to close the previous week above $1,500.\n\n\u201cDamn, ETH weekly looking hella bullish now, absolute solid buy back heading into the close.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,678, an increase of over 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum (ETH) has been making headlines after he recently transferred 200 ETH to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. While trying to sell, investors often transfer their cryptocurrency to exchanges.\n\nThe Ethereum founder used the ETH hoard as collateral on Reflexer to create 150,000 RAI tokens, according to earlier Peckshiled reporting. Then, Buterin traded 132,500 RAI for 378,500 USD Coin (USDC). For 50,000 Dai, the remaining 17,500 RAI were exchanged (DAI). According to PeckShield, the exchange of ETH into the stablecoins USDC and DAI was completed in less than three hours.\n\nEtherscan, a blockchain monitoring service, also recorded the transactions. In order to create 100,000 RAI, Buterin initially sent 200 ETH to Reflexer. Then, Buterin immediately donated 300 ETH to Reflexer to generate 50,000 RAI. According to Etherscan, Buterin spent over $200 to handle both transactions.\n\nIn addition, he had recently sold 9.9 billion CULT tokens, the CultDAO\u2019s native token, for 58 ether (ETH). According to blockchain analyst PeckShield, he also sold his shares in BITE and MOPS. According to Coindesk, the sales totaled 220 ether, which is worth $332,420 at the moment.\n\nBite and the majority of the other coins described in the r/Testingtesting62831 forum were tagged as Buterin as \u201cshitcoins\u201d that have no redeeming cultural or moral significance, and will probably lose most of the money they put into them on March 9. \u201cI strongly oppose these proposals,\u201d he said.\n\nBy selling tokens like Dogelon Mars (ELON) in May 2021, Buterin launched a similar dumping that resulted in reductions in the value of 40% and 90%, respectively. Coming back to Ethereum, after Vitalik Buterin\u2019s most recent remarks about the network, the price projections for Ethereum are optimistic."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Prediction For Q2: Big Eyes Coin Becomes Top Earning Crypto With Vault Pin - Atalayar EN",
        "content": "Since there is a limited supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum, considering how they\u2019re becoming more widely used, many experts predict that their prices will increase over the long term. Moreso, having survived the Silvergate crisis, the duo are expected to begin another attempt to bring back the bull run.\n\nGovernment regulations, investor sentiment, and rivalry from other cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) are a few variables that could impact their prices in the near future. In this article, we will make Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions as well as highlight how Big Eyes Coin is becoming a top-earning crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Price Prediction After Silvergate Brouhaha\n\nIn Q2 2023, it's predicted that the price of the biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, will increase as more organisations and individuals choose to use it as a source of value and a hedge against inflation. But there's also a chance that regulatory ambiguity and greater rivalry from other cryptocurrencies will stagnate it or could even push its price lower.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin has shaken off the effects of the Silvergate crisis, gaining close to 9% in the last 24 hours. As Bitcoin makes another attempt to bring back the bull run, experts have predicted that Q2 of 2023 might just signal the return of Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s best days.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Banking on DeFi Ecosystem\u2019s Growth\n\nIn terms of market capitalisation, Ethereum is presently the second-largest cryptocurrency, and its price has historically been quite volatile. Similar to Bitcoin, a number of variables, such as investor sentiment, technical advancements, and competition from other cryptocurrencies, affect the price of Ethereum. The adoption of decentralised applications (dApps) and the expansion of the decentralised finance (DeFi) network, however, makes Ethereum price prediction a bit difficult.\n\nHowever, with more DApps being created on its blockchain and the DeFi ecosystem growing, it's predicted that Ethereum's price will increase in Q2 2023. However, there's a chance that greater rivalry from other smart contract platforms and unpredictability in the regulatory environment will have a negative effect on its price.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Top Earning Crypto \u2018CATs\u2019 Home $31.4m\n\nCat-themed crypto, Big Eyes Coin, has introduced yet another avenue for its teeming followers to earn big on their investments and grow their finances.

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash ranks higher in decentralization than Litecoin and Ethereum Classic.\n\nBCH whales have been reaccumulating during the recent crash.\n\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] has been overshadowed by its more popular counterparts for the major part. Nevertheless, it has managed to retain a sizable following, and it is perhaps the most underrated cryptocurrency as far as decentralization is concerned.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Cash Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin Cash happens to be doing quite well on the decentralization front. A higher hash rate is often considered a good measure of decentralization for PoW networks, and it also translates to higher network security.\n\nBCH\u2019s hash rate has been above the 1 EH/s level for the last three months. Its hash rate at press time was as high as 1.78 EH/S.\n\nFor context, 1 EH/S is a million times more than 1 TH/S. Litecoin\u2019s latest hash rate figure came in at 716.06 TH/S while ETC\u2019s hash rate was 107.13 TH/s at press time.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash outperformed Litecoin and Ethereum Classic in terms of hash rate. Despite these findings, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s hash rate is lower than Bitcoin\u2019s 355.37 EH/S hash rate, hence BTC is still king in that regard.\n\nEven so, Bitcoin Cash does have a higher block size than BTC, and this facilitates a higher TPS. This is why, for some, BCH is a more preferable option as a peer-to-peer payment than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash price action\n\nBCH is still heavily undervalued compared to BTC yet both have a similar circulation and maximum supply.\n\nBitcoin Cash traded at $114.16 at press time, which represented a 25% discount from February highs. Nevertheless, it still showed a bit of an upside from its current weekly low of $105.05.\n\nBCH\u2019s price action reflects movements in the overall crypto market. But is Bitcoin Cash more likely to achieve a sizable bounce back? So far the recent pivot was underpinned by significant whale accumulation.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BCHs worth today?\n\nWhales in the highest address category holding over 1 million BCH have been adding to their balances. The same applies to addresses within the 1,000 to 100,000 BCH category. These addresses increased their holdings since 9 March, hence buying the dip.\n\nDespite the accumulation, addresses within the 100,000 to 1 million BCH category have been contributing to some selling pressure.\n\nThis may explain the limited upside. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s dormant circulation metric indicates that a significant amount of the cryptocurrency exchanged hands during the recent selloff.\n\nOn the other hand, the transaction volume indicated a surge in activity on 9 March. This observation confirmed the influx of buying activity observed when the price bottomed out."

        "title": "Crypto Is Recovering Slowly: 2 Cryptos to Buy Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a stellar January and February, the crypto market has pulled back since the beginning of March. Even with the recent decline, the collective market cap of crypto is still up about 20% in 2023 and optimists are hopeful that the strong start to the year might signal an end to a brutal bear market that has gripped crypto since late 2021.\n\nThe exact timing of when this bear market will end is uncertain, but eventually this crypto winter will probably thaw just like those in the past. In preparation for a potential crypto spring, there are two cryptocurrencies to buy today.\n\nWhat these two might lack in originality is made up for in their track records of innovation, history of weathering multiple bear markets, and the continuing ability to disrupt the status quo. For these reasons, and many others, Bitcoin (BTC 1.02%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.43%) are recognized as the top assets in their class.\n\nThe original cryptocurrency\n\nFor Bitcoin, one of the main reasons it is the most valuable cryptocurrency is simply because it was the first, dating to 2009. Although this head start has receded in significance in recent years as other cryptocurrencies have jockeyed for market share, Bitcoin has remained at the top due to its inherent characteristics, which make it an attractive long-term investment. In the past five years it has returned more than 140% and over the decade it has notched a 44,300% return.\n\nTo many, Bitcoin is viewed as an asset that preserves wealth. Ingrained into Bitcoin's code is a feature that ensures it will become increasingly scarce, because only 21 million bitcoins will ever enter circulation. In addition, the rate of new coin creation is dwindling. Today, there are about 19.25 million coins in circulation, and the remaining 1.75 million will enter the supply gradually until 2140, when the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nIn addition to being completely decentralized and highly secure, Bitcoin does something that fiat currencies have failed to do -- protect purchasing power. Unlike currencies such as the U.S. dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and many others, Bitcoin's supply rate is growing extremely slowly. The central banks that control fiat currencies are able to inflate the supply in hopes of accomplishing a host of objectives. Whether the central banks achieve those objectives is a topic for another day, but what inevitably does happen through this process is a decrease in purchasing power. Bitcoin aims to resolve this by offering holders a way to increase their purchasing power with time as supply growth dwindles and demand increases.\n\nA groundbreaking invention\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is viewed by many as a store of value, Ethereum derives its value from its seemingly infinite number of use cases. When Ethereum came into existence in 2015 it completely changed the crypto economy. With the arrival of Ethereum, developers could now use computer code to cause specific actions to take place when particular criteria were met. Known as a smart contract, this code essentially turned Ethereum into programmable internet money that didn't require any one person or entity to oversee transactions.\n\nThis innovation laid the foundation for an entirely new and lucrative sector -- decentralized finance (DeFi). With these fancy new smart contracts, developers could optimize existing traditional financial processes, such as lending, because there's no need for a bank. Terms -- such as the loan's value, interest rate, and duration -- are all written into the smart contract. Outside of finance, smart contracts have the potential to even revolutionize industries such as real estate, supply chain management, and healthcare. As a result of this long term potential, Ethereum has treated investors to generous returns. Despite being newer than Bitcoin, Ethereum has actually outperformed the original cryptocurrency over the past five years and is up more than 180%.\n\nAll you need are these two\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in the way they are used, both serve a unique purpose. As a result, they a make up a majority of the value of the cryptocurrency asset class -- roughly 60%, with Bitcoin at 41% and Ethereum at 19%.\n\nBecause Bitcoin and Ethereum are so big, as they go, so goes the rest of the market. For this reason, they offer investors the simplest and most effective means to prepare for crypto's recovery. Rather than trying to find an obscure, unproven cryptocurrency, keep it simple. Investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum has treated investors well in years past and likely will for years to come."

Since it launched in July 2022, Aztec Connect has amassed more than 100,000 users, the announcement notes.\n\nFrom March 2024, Aztec will no longer run a sequencer, meaning the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions. \u201cContract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be ceased,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nAs Aztec has fully open-sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol, the firm encourages the Aztec community to fork, deploy and operate a new version of the system. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it,\u201d Aztec said.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the shutdown of Aztec Connect marks a milestone in the development of a decentralized general-use encrypted blockchain. Before launching Aztec Connect in July 2022, Aztec first experimented with using a zk-Rollup with Aztec 1, which was \u201cslow, inefficient, costly\u201d and limited in functionality to \u201cbasic private transfers.\u201d\n\nSource: Aztec\n\nAztec emphasized that the research made with Aztec Connect will be usable and critical to the development of a next-generation blockchain, providing a basis for a fully programmable version of encrypted rollups, adding:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It\u2019s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted blockchain.\u201d\n\nAfter closing Aztec Connect, Aztec plans to focus on developing the universal zero-knowledge language known as Noir and the next-generation encrypted blockchain.\n\nRelated: Crypto projects respond to privacy coin ban in Dubai\n\nThe news comes amid ConsenSys preparing to release its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup on a public testnet on March 28.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets have been abuzz over the past few days as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB have seen a dramatic uptick in value. But, while the market has been experiencing some upswing, one digital asset is prepping for an even bigger push forward. DigiToads is a brand-new addition to the Ethereum chain, and its presale is attracting investors all around. Let\u2019s discuss what you could expect in the coming months.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\nDigiToads and its presale performance\n\nDigiToads is a new project in the cryptocurrency market that has been gaining attention for its innovative features. It is a P2E gaming, deflationary, staking reward token, and meme coin all rolled into one. The project also plans to launch a Metaverse called \u201cThe Swamp\u201d with a DAO Treasury and a toad NFT Collection.\n\nThe current stage of its presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in on the ground floor and see substantial returns on their investments.\n\nDigiTaods presale is divided into ten separate phases, and each one starts with the increased price. This dynamic model stimulates adoption and hype to get as early as possible to gain higher rewards once the project launches.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of how DigiToads price is scheduled to update over the presale phases:\n\nStage Price Stage 1 $0.01 Stage 2 $0.012 Stage 3 $0.016 Stage 4 $0.02 Stage 5 $0.024 Stage 6 $0.027 Stage 7 $0.036 Stage 8 $0.042 Stage 9 $0.047 Stage 10 $0.05 Launch $0.055\n\nThis model suggests that the earliest TOADS adopters can increase their initial deposits by 900% at the debut, which will grow even further thanks to the project\u2019s fascinating potential.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\nIs Bitcoin bouncing back?\n\nBitcoin is the first and most broadly utilized decentralized digital currency, enabling instantaneous, borderless, and anonymous payments to and from anybody globally. It was quite a trip for BTC, with the price hitting about $70,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, the last year has been a massive letdown for BTC enthusiasts, with the price falling to as low as around $15,000. The year 2023 started splendidly for Bitcoin, with a price increase of almost 50%. Regaining momentum in Bitcoin prices is an encouraging sign for the market as a whole and an indication that Bulls are preparing to reclaim control.\n\nIs Ethereum going up?\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has also had a rough year. Experts, however, are optimistic because the price had a stellar January, rising by about 33% and setting a new monthly high not seen since July 2022.\n\nBNB overview\n\nBNB is the native coin of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. BNB has a lot of practical applications, and its popularity is growing as the exchange does. But BNB has had its share of difficulties as well. There was mounting anxiety among investors about the transparency of major crypto exchange platforms, particularly because of last year\u2019s collapse of the FTX exchange.\n\nHowever, BNB started to see a resurgence of support from bulls after breaking $300 in January 2023\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nTo sum up, DigiToads Presale is an exciting opportunity to diversify your portfolios and potentially see substantial returns. The project\u2019s innovative features, including its deflationary nature and staking rewards, make it a well-rounded investment that stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe recent bounce back in the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin is a positive sign for the overall market and provides a tailwind for projects like DigiToads to gain traction and succeed.\n\nVisit The Website: https://digitoads.me/cgp\n\nPresale Registration: https://digitoads.me/buycgp\n\nJoin The Community: Linktr.ee/digitoads"

The network uses Optimistic Rollups technology to process transactions off-chain and then settle them on the Ethereum network, enabling faster and more efficient transactions.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of the Arbitrum network is its low gas fees. The network achieves this by batching and compressing transactions, resulting in fewer on-chain interactions and lower gas fees. This makes it more affordable for users to transact on the network, which can help increase the adoption and usage of decentralized applications built on Ethereum.\n\nAnother key feature of the Arbitrum network is its compatibility with existing Ethereum dApps and smart contracts. Arbitrum allows developers to integrate their dApps and smart contracts with the network without the need to rewrite their code. This is a significant advantage over other Layer 2 solutions that may require more complex and time-consuming integration efforts.\n\nIn addition to its technical features, the Arbitrum network also offers a high degree of security. The network uses a range of security mechanisms, including fraud proofs and advanced cryptography, to ensure the safety and integrity of transactions. The network is also governed by a decentralized community of validators responsible for maintaining the network and making decisions about its future development. This helps ensure that the network remains decentralized and resilient to attacks.\n\nExamples of What Can Be Done With the Network\n\nThe Arbitrum network offers a range of exciting possibilities for developers and users alike. Some examples of what can be done on the network include:\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) applications: The Arbitrum network can be used to build and run DeFi applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, and stablecoin systems. These applications can benefit from the network\u2019s fast transaction processing times and low gas fees, enabling efficient and affordable transactions. Gaming and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The Arbitrum network can also be used to build and run gaming applications and NFT marketplaces. These applications can leverage the network\u2019s fast transaction processing times and low fees to enable seamless in-game and affordable NFT transactions. Supply Chain and Identity Management: The Arbitrum network can also be used to build and run supply chain and identity management applications. These applicons can benefit from the network\u2019s security and decentralization features, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of both the supply chain data and identity information. Cross-Chain Interoperability: The Arbitrum network can also be used to enable cross-chain interoperability between different blockchains. This could allow for the seamless transfer of assets and data between different blockchain ecosystems, enabling greater interoperability and connectivity across the entire blockchain space.\n\nThe Arbitrum network\u2019s fast transaction processing times, low fees, and security and decentralization features make it a compelling choice for a wide range of use cases.\n\nAdding Arbitrum to Your MetaMask Wallet Is Easy\n\nAdding Arbitrum to your MetaMask wallet is a straightforward process that can help you take advantage of the benefits offered by this Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. With faster transaction processing times and lower gas fees, the Arbitrum network offers a compelling alternative to using the Ethereum network alone for decentralized applications.\n\nBy following the step-by-step guide outlined in this blog, you can easily add Arbitrum to your MetaMask wallet and start using it to transact and interact with decentralized applications built on the Arbitrum network. Whether you\u2019re a developer looking to build on a more scalable platform, or a user looking for a faster and more affordable way to transact on the Ethereum network, adding Arbitrum to your MetaMask wallet is a smart move.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes MetaMask Accept Arbitrum?\n\nYes, MetaMask does accept Arbitrum. In fact, MetaMask currently supports the Arbitrum One network, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. To add the Arbitrum network to your MetaMask wallet, you can follow the steps outlined in our earlier sections. Once added, you can use your MetaMask wallet to transact on the Arbitrum network, taking advantage of its faster transaction times and lower gas fees compared to the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Is the New RPC URL for Arbitrum?\n\nThe new RPC URL for Arbitrum is https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc. This URL is used for connecting Arbitrum network and is required when adding the Arbitrum network to your MetaMask wallet or any other Ethereum wallet that supports the network. Make sure to enter this URL correctly when adding the network to your wallet to ensure that you are properly connected to the Arbitrum network.\n\nWhat Is the Chain ID for Arbitrum?\n\nThe chain ID for the Arbitrum One network is 42161.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens continued to move sharply higher on Tuesday amid the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout. However, a few stablecoins lost their pegging to the US dollar amid the crisis but mainstream tokens, particularly, the US dollar were flexing muscles.\n\n\n\nBitcoin advanced another 10 per cent, hitting $24,000-mark. A flight from stablecoins pushed Bitcoin's store of value higher. Its largest peer Ethereum was trading 5 per cent higher and was hovering around $1,700-levels. Altcoins outperformed the blue chips tokens, rallying up to 40 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe closure of three crypto-friendly banks, Silvergate, SVB, and Signature, is likely to result in short-term liquidity issues since these banks acted as the primary ramps for dollars into crypto assets. SVB's transaction halt had caused a sharp 10 per cent de-peg of USDC over the weekend, said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead at CoinSwitch.\n\n\n\n\"We might see a rapid shift in the usage of new banking partners by the crypto industry. Many in the industry are pivoting to Mercury, BCB Group, Axos, and a few other banks that cater to crypto startups. This could also spark a flight of crypto companies to other more favorable jurisdictions like Switzerland, Hong Kong, Dubai, and the UK,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged stablecoin Tether, all other top and popular crypto tokens were rallying sharply on Tuesday. BNB was up 7 per cent, followed by Litecoin and Polygon, which rallied 4 per cent each. Solana, Dogecoin, Polkadot and Shiba Inu advanced 3 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, regaining the 1 trillion mark. It jumped another 6 per cent to $1.08 trillion in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 24 per cent, close to $90.50 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph (GRT) is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GRT price chart has broken out of the descending trendline with good volume, it is up by 29 per cent for the day. Currently it is retesting the support after breaking out, an upward movement is expected to continue. The next resistance for GRT token is expected at the $0.15 level and the next support could be expected around the $0.10 levels.\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "U.S. regulators offer a bailout to customers affected by SVB and Signature bank collapses.\n\nWill there be alternatives to these crypto-friendly banks and their payment systems to provide liquidity?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were both up by more than 9% in the last 24 hours retracing their weekend losses and propping up the crypto market. The stablecoins also saw a surge as they regained their peg.\n\nThe U.S. regulators were able to take out negative sentiments among investors following the collapse of the crypto banks by offering bailout to depositors.\n\nIt should be noted here that Signature Bank and SVB collapsed in just a couple of days from each other. Thus, bringing down the banking and crypto sectors.\n\nSignature was the only viable option for most crypto companies after Silvergate shut its shop and on Sunday the U.S. said adieu to it as well.\n\nCrypto firms reveal their exposure to Signature\n\nSeveral crypto companies including Coinbase, Paxos, and Celsius have come forward to disclose their exposure to the bank.\n\n\u201cAs of close of business Friday March 10 Coinbase had an approximately $240m balance in corporate cash at Signature,\u201d the exchange announced on Twitter.\n\nAs of close of business Friday March 10 Coinbase had an approximately $240m balance in corporate cash at Signature. As stated by the FDIC, we expect to fully recover these funds. https://t.co/XY5L7m4RMs \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) March 12, 2023\n\nBlockchain company Paxos said (at press time) it held $250 million at the bank while Celsius admitted that Signature held their funds without disclosing the amount.\n\nThe companies shared hope that they will be able to recover the funds following the joint statement from different U.S. regulators. \u201cAll depositors of this institution will be made whole,\u201d the regulators said in relation to the Signature bank context.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe crypto market, eventually, recovered on 13 March. Most of the cryptocurrencies registered positive gains and investors were seen returning back to their trading activities. However, the question remains- Is this recovery just a calm before the storm?\n\nCrypto companies will now have to transfer their funds elsewhere with the demise of these banks. Circle has already moved its funds from SVB to BNY Mellon and others will soon follow suit.\n\nNotably, the collapse of these lenders will also affect crypto liquidity. The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and Signature\u2019s Signet were real-time payment platforms that allowed users to conduct transactions 24*7.\n\nNow that they are gone, investors might have to limit their payments to banking hours unlike earlier. It looks like crypto liquidity will be affected in the absence of these platforms unless an alternate system comes up."

        "title": "Dogetti on its Way to Greatness While Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Dip - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The news surrounding Silvergate\u2019s issues is huge, causing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices to dip. But it does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s the end for the crypto industry. Dogetti (DETI) is a new meme coin that is still gaining success in its presale, which gives a lot of hope to token enthusiasts.\n\nRecently, a major European asset manager stated their belief in digital assets and that these coins are not destined to fail.\n\nEU Asset Manager Says Digital Assets are Here to Stay\n\nAmundi Chief Investment Officer Vincent Mortier, along with macroeconomist Tristan Perrier released a thematic analysis paper to examine the state and perspectives of the crypto industry.\n\nThe two executives from the leading European asset manager argued that crypto giant Bitcoin failed to be an inflation hedge for the previous two years due to huge changes in policy and market interest rates, pressuring \u201call asset classes\u201d.\n\nAccording to the paper, nominal interest rates might cease to surge or drop due to high inflation but would not rise. If it happens, it can lead to a bull market, which is a favorable environment for an asset with finite supply and a long duration. Such a coin attracts investors due to its future potential rather than its current status.\n\nDuring market volatility, it is important to invest in the long-term, which is one great benefit of purchasing DETI coins.\n\nDogetti Holders are in for a Treat at Launch\n\nEarly investors who had bought DETI in its Presale Stage 1\u2014when the coin was sold at $0.00007\u2014are going to enjoy a huge increase when the coin launches on a crypto exchange.\n\nThe token is now in Stage 2, selling for $0.00029 each. That means the price has seen a huge increase of about 300%!\n\nWhen Dogetti ends Stage 5, which is also the time the coin launches, DETI will be selling for $0.0007 each. We are looking at a 900% increase from Stage 1!\n\nThe longer you wait to purchase DETI, the more you possibly lose millions of dollars in the future! If you buy at a later date nearing the final stage of the presale, you will only receive fewer tokens than if you had bought them earlier.\n\nAside from generating wealth for all \u201cfamily members\u201d, Dogetti is a coin that never forgets to give back to its community. One of the best features of joining the Dogetti family is its 2% protocol. For every transaction, 2% will be redistributed to all holders, meaning you gain extra coins just by having DETI in your wallet. Dogetti will also take 2% from every transaction and add it to its charity wallet. The whole family is encouraged to cast votes on which charities they want to support.\n\nLastly, the meme coin will get 2% from every transaction and split it between liquidity and burn wallets. This ensures the stability of the project as well as the family in the long term.\n\nInstitutions Look Beyond BTC and ETH\n\nA top executive of Coinbase, David Duong, hinted that institutional investors might be open to investing in digital assets other than the top two giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn a live stream with crypto analyst Scott Melker, the head of Coinbase\u2019s institutional research said that 55% of their institutional clients are into Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the remainder is in altcoins. This means that a lot of attention is poured into the ecosystem outside of BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been performing poorly after Silvergate shut its operations, sending the whole crypto market into meltdown. On March 9th, Bitcoin and Ethereum traded at $21,637 and $1,533, respectively. BTC\u2019s price decreased by 7.31%, while ETH saw a 6.21% decrease in the past seven days.\n\nNevertheless, many investors are still hoping that the crypto market will recover. If you want to invest long-term and avoid market volatility, you might want to try presale coins like Dogetti.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Shrinking, Dogetti Still Continues to Thrive in Presale Phase - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Recently, increasing market regulations have had a detrimental effect on Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, Dogetti (DETI), since its presale, has formed itself as the brightest meme coin in the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin Plunges Due to Unending Inflation\n\nThe US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s hardline testimony to Congress prompted traders to price in a higher \u201cterminal,\u201d and as a result, Bitcoin (BTC) is perilously close to falling below US $20,000 for the first time in two months. By the start of the second week of March, Bitcoin had lost about 1% against the US dollar. The next morning, it lost another 0.9%, which allowed for a collapse in the BTC/USDT pair to roughly $22,000.\n\nThe Fed has increased interest rates by 450 basis points (bps) since last year, causing risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, to tremble. As fear, uncertainty, and doubt spread in the cryptocurrency market, investors are shifting away from Bitcoin towards tokens that facilitate smart contracts. Although there is still a considerable distance between the current price and $20,000, if the dip is extended further by momentum traders, there is a possibility that the gap between them could narrow.\n\nETH Alert: 90% decline since March 2020\n\nSince June 2022, the price of Ethereum has increased by 78%, but this does not imply success. The volume profile of the digital asset strongly suggests a significant correction in the cryptocurrency market. The ETH volume profile showed approximately $64.25 million ETH traded between $270 and 450, with buying volume outpacing the selling volume by nearly 1 million ETH between July 2020 and November 2020.\n\nFollowing Powell\u2019s speech, Ethereum (ETH) recovered from an intraday low of US$1,540 on March 7 to close the session 0.25% lower. The performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world was actually worse, falling more than 0.7% on the ETH/USD pair. A recent purchase of 65% of Ethereum at a lower price in March 2023 suggests that even if a considerable price decline is inevitable, the potential to secure profits may still be high.\n\nThe majority of the top-20 altcoins took a stiffer boost just after the hawkish Fed chair\u2019s remarks, though Bitcoin and Ether limited overnight losses to one or two percentage points.\n\nDogetti \u2013 Meme Coin with Future Potential\n\nDogetti (DETI), a meme coin that is relatively new, is currently in the second phase of its presale. With sales of more than 7,205,450,000/50,000,000,000 DETI tokens thus far, the dog-themed coin has gotten off to a flying start, raising more than $515,741 in total. Dogetti offers a family code called \u201cWISEGUY25\u201d that entitles you to a massive 25% discount on your purchase.\n\nThe mirror protocol of Dogetti, which enables users of its digital currency, DETI, to amass more coins just by keeping them in their digital wallets, is one of the platform\u2019s main attractions.\n\nIn addition, Dogetti recently introduced DogettiDAO and DogettiNFTs, allowing customers to mint their own customized NFT pets. Since the demand for these digital assets is only expected to increase, this entry into the NFT market is wise. The collaboration between Dogetti and Uniswap offers traders high levels of security, low fees, and quick transactions. As a result of its hybrid consensus mechanism, Dogetti is able to process transactions swiftly and securely, making it the perfect platform for DeFi applications that demand low-cost, swift, and efficient transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the decision to invest in digital currencies can be volatile, but the likelihood of good yields is impossible to ignore. With distinct characteristics like its re\ufb02ective protocol and NFT opportunities, Dogetti (DETI), a cryptocurrency, has exhibited great commitment. Dogetti is an enticing potential investment due to its burgeoning family. Right here, you can buy your very own Dogetti.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "NAB has completed an intra-bank cross-border transaction using NAB-issued stablecoin, which represents a world-first by a major financial institution on a layer-one public blockchain.\n\nThis pilot transaction on the public and permissionless Ethereum blockchain, involved deployment of stablecoin smart contracts for seven major global currencies. The pilot\u2019s success demonstrates the potential to cut cross-border transactions from days to minutes and brings NAB one step closer to enabling clients who operate in multiple jurisdiction and currencies a simpler and faster experience, starting with corporate and institutional clients.\n\nNAB Executive General Manager, Markets, Drew Bradford, said NAB was investing to develop Australia\u2019s safest, simplest and most secure digital asset ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to pursuing the right digital asset opportunities with clear customer benefits. Bringing multi-currency stablecoins to market demonstrates NAB\u2019s focus on simplifying international banking protocols to increase speed and transparency while lowering costs and reducing complexity for customers,\u201d Mr Bradford said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that elements of the future of finance will be blockchain enabled and we\u2019re already witnessing rapid change in the tokenisation market. The stringent governance frameworks we have in place ensures we can support the creation of a safe and reliable digital financial system.\u201d\n\nNAB\u2019s Australian stablecoin, AUDN, which will be fully backed one-for-one with the Australian dollar and managed as a liability of the bank, will be the cornerstone for NAB\u2019s ambitions in digital assets.

As a result, Bitcoin has surged past the $22,000 mark after hitting its lowest point since January. Within a day, the cryptocurrency has gained nearly 10 percent. Ethereum has also followed a similar trajectory and is trading above the $1,600 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin has seen a modest increase over the last 24 hours after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and USDC issuer, Circle announced its support to protect Silicon Valley Bank investors. Large-scale borrowing by small banks in the US, which are the major partners of tech companies, is experiencing high volatility as a domino effect. With funding figures not looking up anytime soon, more tech startups are expected to withdraw their existing reserves further impacting the market. This might also affect Crypto prices in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin has a price target of $18,400 with the possibility of visiting the $21,800 region before the expected decline. For Ethereum, a key support level remains at $1,423 and a break below this level could lead to a retest of last November's lows. The key resistance to watch out for is around $1,460, which represents the February lows. MATIC is currently trading around $1.08, Solana around $17.99 and TRX around $0.05938.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cTwo major US financial institutions have made headlines this week, as both Silicon Valley Bank and Circle faced significant challenges. Silicon Valley Bank's depositors were granted full access to their funds on Monday, following restrictions on withdrawals and transfers due to concerns about the bank's liquidity position. Meanwhile, Circle has been grappling with the aftermath of the failure of its key banking partner, Signature Bank, which has highlighted the dependency of the stablecoin ecosystem on some centralized entities.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market cap is back above the $1 trillion mark and BTC has surged by over 8 percent in the last 24 hours and is trading above the $22,300 mark. ETH which follows the BTC trajectory jumped by over 7 percent during the same period. The positive mood of the market is mainly due to the federal regulators hinting towards recovering Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s customer deposits. The news has uplifted investor sentiment with a promise of more liquidity in the market. The momentum will depend on the further regulatory recourse of SVB fallout.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe financial sector in the United States has been rocked by the failure of many banks and financial institutions in the previous week, notably Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank. In response, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) value jumped from a low of $19,736 last week to its current level of $24,835, carrying the broader crypto market up with it.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contract platform and second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap fortunes, now look bullish after rebounding from last week\u2019s low of $1,379 to regain support at $1,600 as it tests resistance at $1,700 midway through the month.\n\nHowever, despite the bullish turn of events, according to the 1,565 community votes cast by the members of the crypto tracking platform CoinMarketCap by press time, ETH is set to change hands at an estimated average price of $1,560 by March 31, a decrease of -7.67% or -$129.58 to ETH\u2019s current price, as per data retrieved on March 14.\n\nETH end of March price estimation.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nDue to the Ethereum Shanghai update, the roughly $28 billion worth of ether that has been staked will begin to become accessible in a few weeks. This supply, which at this time is unable to be withdrawn or sold, will be progressively returned to the public markets, which will affect the price of Ethereum. With that being said, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum whales continue to buy up ETH during the recent market dip:\n\n\u201cEthereum whales with 1,000 to 10,000 $ETH added around 400,000 ETH to their holdings in the recent crypto market dip, worth around $600,000,000.\u201d\n\nETH March whale purchases.

Its summary aligns with the \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment at 16, which results from moving averages (MA) pointing at \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 14, and oscillators in the \u2018buy\u2019 area at 2.\n\nEthereum is now testing resistance at $1,700, trading at $1,688; it is up 6.41% in the last 24 hours.\n\nETH 1-day price change.
