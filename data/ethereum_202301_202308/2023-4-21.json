        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated tech update, often referred to as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade, starting April 12 enabled withdrawals of some 18 million tokens, worth $35 billion, previously locked up in staking contracts. After the upgrade, ETH\u2019s price rallied to $2,100, its highest level in 11 months, defying earlier concerns the unlocking could lead to significant selling pressure and a price crash. The token recently has dropped below $1,900, aligning with a broader crypto market decline."

        "content": "Late last night, stablecoin issuer Tether minted one billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, the minting represented an \"inventory replenish.\" He added that it was \"an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for the next period [of] issuance requests and chain swaps.\"\n\nUSDT is the crypto industry's most-popular stablecoin, pegged to 1:1 to the United States dollar. It is commonly used to facilitate trading on large exchanges that don't accept fiat currencies.\n\nTether's dominance in the stablecoin market is growing\n\nTether is the dominant stablecoin issuer on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe total amount of USDT on Ethereum amounts to over 35 billion tokens. Its closest competitor, the Circle-issued USDC, accounts for less than 30 billion tokens. Meanwhile, Binance USD \u2014 which is not currently minting new tokens \u2014 makes up less than seven billion tokens.\n\nBroadening the scope to the entire stablecoin supply across multiple blockchains further intensifies Tether's dominance in the sector.\n\nUSDT comprises over 81.5 billion dollar-pegged tokens, while USDC still remains under 30 billion tokens. No other stablecoin is even close.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAre USDT supplies indicative of crypto market trends?\n\nSome argue that the supply of USDT has historically indicated the direction in which the price of bitcoin \u2014 or the crypto market, as a whole \u2014 will trend.\n\n\"Generally, Tether issues new USDT when they see and anticipate higher demand for it,\" Simon Cousaert, a research director at The Block, explained. \"This indicates new cash is coming into the system \u2014 generally used to buy bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies.\"\n\n\"I don't subscribe to Tether conspiracies, but I do subscribe to supply and demand,\" Decentrader founder and well-known crypto trader filbfilb once similarly tweeted when discussing the relationship between USDT's supply and the bitcoin price in 2020 \u2014 when the foremost cryptocurrency was trading under $11,000.\n\nFurthermore, one study from BDC Consulting conducted correlation tests on many indicators last June. It concluded that the supply of USDT \"does feature a strong and statistically significant correlation\" with the bitcoin price. \"The resulting model with market entries and exits timed with the USDT supply spikes yielded an ROI [return on investment] of 229%, showing that stablecoin supply data can be used in trading,\" it said.\n\nTether reported a net profit of $700 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, which it said was additional to its reserves, in February. At the time, it claimed its consolidated total assets amounted to at least $67.04 billion, while its consolidated total liabilities amounted to $66.08 billion \u2014 reflecting excess reserves of at least $960 million."

The tweet featured lyrics from Liang Jingru\u2019s renowned song, \u201cHappy Breakup,\u201d leaving the community in speculation and intrigue.\n\nVitalik\u2019s love life has always been shrouded in mystery, with speculations of him dating Chinese women and indulging in hot pot dinners at Chinese restaurants. Now, with afrawang.eth, a blockchain professional, in the spotlight, rumors abound about her being Vitalik\u2019s long-rumored Chinese girlfriend.\n\nCurious followers have flooded the tweet with inquiries about their relationship status, fueling the gossip fire.\n\nJustin Sun Jokes About Ethereum Price Drops After Vitalik\u2019s Speculated Breakup\n\nInterestingly, after afrawang.eth published an article on the 18th, the price of Ethereum took a tumble from its lofty height of $2,100. By the 19th, it had dipped below the $2,000 mark, hitting a low of $1,888 before rebounding to its current trading price of $1,902.\n\nWhile some speculate that Vitalik\u2019s supposed breakup may have influenced Ethereum\u2019s price drop, there is no confirmation of the news, leaving it all as mere speculation.\n\nIn a humorous turn of events, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, couldn\u2019t resist poking fun at the situation.

        "content": "The Merge represented the Ethereum network\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. 218 days later, more than 103,092 ETH has been eliminated from the supply of the world\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nAt current prices, this amounts to a little over $197 million. Deflation on the network is on the rise as the supply declined by 0.146% per year.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Ethereum monitoring site \u2018ultrasound.money,\u2019 the current supply of ether stands at nearly 120,416,113 million coins.\n\nThe currency burn rate over the last 30 days was found to be at 1,125k ETH and a supply growth of -0.37%.\n\nAt this pace, the Ethereum supply is expected to reach 118.1 million by the year 2025.\n\nIssuance rewards for stakers, on the other hand, will be at 3.9% per year, while the burn rate for the non-stakers will stand at 1.8% per year.\n\nContrastingly, if Ethereum had not undergone the Merge and instead continued to rely on miners to secure the network, the supply of the token would have increased by more than 2.5 million ETH, which translates to an astonishing $4.9 billion in the current market value.\n\nETH\u2019s supply, for one, would have increased by 3.53% every year.\n\nWhile the Merge was indeed responsible for the reduction in ETH supply by a considerable amount, the aspect of burning ether can be attributed to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which was implemented via the London upgrade in August 2021. Its main purpose is to slash inflation on the Ethereum network and exert deflationary pressure on the token\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shapella upgrade on April 12 enabled stakers to unlock their staked Ether. The exodus of tokens following the event slowed down.\n\nWithin a week, the amount of staked ether trumped the number of ETH being withdrawn for the very first time."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be facing resistance at key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000, with the potential for a stock market downturn with the Federal Reserve tightening into a recession that could affect all risk assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have had a pivotal status since 2020, with definable diminishing supply and low but increasing adoption making a strong case for long-term bullishness.\n\nOn April 21, Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone stated that the yield curve\u2019s highest probability since 1982 suggests a growing consensus that the worst of a US recession may be over. However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain. Investors should remain vigilant of potential downside risks, especially in light of broader market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum gas fees soared in the past few days due to the frenzy surrounding meme-inspired cryptocurrencies. The popularity of these coins has led to the growing demand for transactions on the Ethereum network, resulting in higher fees.\n\nMemecoins made a remarkable comeback, with Pepe The Frog leading the way. Recently deployed memecoins, including $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO, took over top gas-burning altcoins, per market analysis platform Sentiment.\n\nMemecoins go Crazy\n\nData indicates that Ethereum\u2019s average gas price for transactions on April 20 has spiked to 81.94 gwei (gwei serves as a unit of measurement for Ether \u2013 1 gwei equals 10-9 ETH). It marks a significant increase from 60.82 gwei on April 19 and 44.42 gwei during the same period last year.\n\nEthereum educator Anthony Sassano highlighted the staggering surge in daily fee revenue on the Ethereum network in his recent post. According to Sassano, the remarkable success of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 platforms, notably Arbitrum, outperformed the BTC network.\n\nThe revenue surge has been attributed mainly to the ongoing meme frenzy gripping cryptocurrency markets. The observations also highlighted the growing dominance of Ethereum in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nDespite the high fees, users persist in utilizing these networks. This suggests that these networks\u2019 benefits and opportunities outweigh the financial costs.\n\nA Small Market\n\nWhile some analysts view this as an indicator of its growing usability, critics have raised concerns, pointing out that the extensive usage being touted is primarily limited to a few thousand users gambling on memecoins.\n\nAnother factor is the increased activity of a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) trading bot known as \u201cjaredfromsubway.eth\u201d. This bot has been front-running memecoin trades significantly, spending a remarkable 455 ETH (equivalent to $885,000) and utilizing 7% of the total gas on the network in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum gas fees have been the topic of discussion within the Ethereum community. High gas fees can make using the network expensive for certain activities, such as small transactions or interacting with low-value smart contracts.\n\nOngoing efforts are to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reduce gas fees, including Layer-2 scaling solutions and other optimization techniques to make the network more efficient and cost-effective for users.\n\nZk-Rollups Making Waves\n\nButerin highlighted during the ETHSeoul event last year that the fundamental advantages of Zero-knowledge Rollup technology are expected to position them as the superior choice for Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum have been experiencing impressive growth recently. These solutions are essential for increasing transaction processing capacity, reducing network congestion, and improving the user experience on Ethereum.\n\nBundling multiple transactions into one transaction through layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce gas fees, making it more accessible for users to interact with the network.\n\nThe combined growth of Zk-rollups and the maturity of Ethereum has the potential to create a robust future.\n\nHowever, after successfully completing the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum now faces an uncertain short-term future as ETH stakers seek alternative avenues to deploy their recently withdrawn holdings, which raises concerns about the potential detrimental impact on the price of ETH.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum remains the top secure and decentralized ecosystem in the blockchain space, with over 3500 different decentralized applications (DApps) and a vibrant and creative developer community, making it a favored choice for developing high-quality projects.\n\nEthereum has also outlined several upcoming upgrades and improvements in its roadmap, with the next major hard fork being sharding.\n\nSharding aims to increase the network\u2019s throughput directly without relying on layer 2 solutions and is expected to be a significant milestone in the evolution of Ethereum. It will enable the network to handle much larger transactions than it currently can, further enhancing its scalability and potential for future growth.\n\nThe future for Ethereum looks great \u2013 memecoins, on the other hand, are a very murky market."

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn\u2019t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.\n\nZurich, Switzerland, September 21st, 2018 \u2013 Cryptocurrency payment solution UTRUST has announced that it has secured a partnership with Ethereum Classic Dev Team , signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). ETCDEV will collaborate with UTRUST to integrate ETC into the UTRUST platform, with the assistance from the Ethereum Classic Cooperative .\n\nThe partnership between ETCDEV and UTRUST comes at a time when demand for ETC is rising rapidly, due to the recent integration of ETC by Coinbase, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency brokerage, wallet, and custodian.\n\nAdditionally, the decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to declare Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities, cleared Ethereum Classic from potentially being considered a security. As such, merchants can freely accept ETC as an alternative payment method to fiat and consumers can use it knowing that the utilization of ETC cannot be considered as an act of illegally distributing securities.\n\n\u201cEthereum Classic is one of a select few cryptocurrencies, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, with clear institutional demand,\u201d\n\nsaid Nuno Correia, CEO, and co-founder of UTRUST.\n\nEarlier this year, Grayscale Investments, the $2 billion investment arm of Digital Currency Group, launched Ethereum Classic Investment Trust, enabling retail traders and institutions in the regulated US market to invest in Ethereum Classic. With it, Grayscale Investments allocated $90 million into ETC, demonstrating confidence in the long-term adoption rate of ETC as a leading cryptocurrency.\n\nRelatedNews\n\nCorreia added, \u201cWhile blockchain payments have undoubtedly disrupted financial transactions, at UTRUST we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to add a much-needed layer of consumer protection, as well as instant transactions and low fees, for anyone who wants to utilize Ethereum Classic for payments.\u201d"

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nUsers and proponents of the blockchain space are in for an improved experience when registering for domain names in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) protocol. A range of options, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and other debit and credit cards, can be used now for .eth domains. The process used to require payments through Ethereum earlier. Many users then considered it a barrier, as they had to use their crypto wallets for the registrations.The web3 payment gateway, MoonPay, would be used from now on by users for payments while it has been integrated with the Ethereum Name Service website. On top of this, ENS has also launched version 3 of its user interface for a better experience while signing up on the platform. Users had to go through multiple transaction approvals before while using crypto wallets.Nick Johnson, the founder of Ethereum Name Service, has said the move could simplify blockchain for beginners and make it easier for them to obtain digital identities. He stated, \u201cThis allows us to reach those who are either just entering the space or who are not yet comfortable with transacting and would prefer to use the currency and payment form they understand best.\u201dBree Blazak, Vice President at MoonPay, also welcomed the initiative and claimed how the partnership with Ethereum Name Service could make registrations simple with common payment methods. The payment experience for beginners to the domain would, thus, be made simple.The platform upgrade of ENS is likely going to uplift the status of ENS as a provider of readable names for crypto wallets in place of complex numeric numbers, which are created by wallets, blockchain protocols and platforms. Users of ENS can also host censorship-resistant websites through names that can be linked to in-use common domain name services (DNS).With decentralized domain name service registrations increasing in the last couple of years, Ethereum Name Service has witnessed over 2.3 million names created through 550,000 unique addresses.Unstoppable Domains and Ethereum Name Service are two leaders in the crypto space who have been responsible for inducting users into the web3 world through decentralized identities."

        "content": "Criticism has been leveled at a new euro-pegged stablecoin released in France due to a decision to restrict peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nFrench bank Societe Generale-Forge (SGF) released the Ethereum-based stablecoin called EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on April 20, which is available to only qualified institutional clients.\n\nAccording to observers who reviewed its smart contract code, itsERC-20 transfers need to first be approved by a centralized registrar \u2014 presumably one controlled by the bank \u2014 before the transaction is processed.\n\nIn an April 20 tweet, pseudonymous smart contract engineer \u201calephv.eth\u201d explained:\n\n\u201cThey coded it so they have to whitelist all users, process all user transfers, and even process your ERC20 approvals before they process your 'transferFrom' lmao.\u201d\n\nShe further mocked the code in a separate post, stating it was a \"radical commitment to inefficiency in the name of regulation.\"\n\nNonfungible token project founder \u201cfoobar\u201d tweeted to his over 127,000 followers on April 20 that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst code I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d and described the stablecoin as a \u201claughing stock.\u201d\n\nFrance launched a stablecoin on Ethereum and it's the worst code I've ever seen\n\n\n\nEvery ERC20 single transfer has to be approved in a separate eth tx submitted by a centralized registrar\n\n\n\nWhat a laughingstock, is this your CBDC?https://t.co/hKkHiQTCyN pic.twitter.com/S6tRfh54wz \u2014 foobar (@0xfoobar) April 20, 2023\n\nCrypto researcher Mason Versluis tweeted that the code was \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d and suggested the French bank \u201cstop trying to weasel\u201d into crypto.\n\nBREAKING: France launches stablecoin on #Ethereum, but every single transfer has to be approved in a separate ETH transaction submitted by a centralized registrar!\n\n\n\nAbsolutely horrible. Keep your centralized bullshit over there, stop trying to weasel it into crypto.\n\n\n\nNews Via:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mcg9fvUoSp \u2014 MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) April 20, 2023\n\nPlenty of others chipped in on the criticism, but Ether (ETH) investor Ryan Berckman provided a more neutral analysis.\n\nHe explained that many traditional financial firms like SGF will take \u201cbaby steps\u201d as they move into blockchain and digital assets:\n\n\u201cObviously, non-compliant, non-composable, allowlist-style stables are going to be uncompetitive in the market. Baby steps, they are coming from tradfi, they\u2019ll see it soon enough and switch to a USDC-style denylist.\u201d\n\nBerckman explained SGF may also be incorrect in its claim to be the first bank to launch an institutional stablecoin on a public blockchain. He pointed to the AUDN stablecoin minted on Ethereum in March by National Australia Bank (NAB), which claimed to be the second bank to launch a stablecoin.\n\nRegardless, Berckman expects more banks to follow suit in the months to come, stating that he is \u201ccertain\u201d SGF won\u2019t be the last bank to launch a stablecoin on a public network.\n\nRelated: Israel\u2019s central bank says CBDC could be issued if stablecoin use increases\n\nSGF\u2019s stablecoin isn\u2019t intended for public use \u2014 at least to begin with.\n\nEURCV is only strictly available to institutional clients onboarded by the bank through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, according to the bank\u2019s April 20 announcement.\n\nThe stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between assets in traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.\n\nA total of 10 million EURCV tokens were minted on Ethereum on April , according to Ethereum explorer Etherscan. All 10 million tokens are held by one wallet address.\n\nThe stablecoin was launched on the back of growing demand for a new settlement asset to process on-chain transactions.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s prices have been on a decline of late and the number of put options has increased.\n\nMEV and bot activity on the Ethereum network went uphill.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] prices started to decline massively over the past few days. A lot of optimism was observed before Ethereum\u2019s Shapella Upgrade, which allowed addresses to unstake their ETH from the beacon chain. However, as time passed, the sentiment around ETH started to change.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nOver the last 24 hours, the value of ETH declined by 5.94% according to CoinMarketCap\u2018s data. The decline in prices was complimented by bearish sentiment from traders.\n\nThis was indicated by the fact that a large sum of OTM (Out of the money) block puts, which expire at the end of the month, made up 15% of daily trader volume.\n\nFor context, OTM block puts are option contracts with a strike price that is below the current market price of the underlying asset. These options would only be profitable if the price of the asset was to decrease significantly before the option expires.\n\nHence, the spike in block puts implied that traders were expecting ETH prices to fall further.\n\nBots and Sandwiches\n\nOn the Ethereum network, it was observed that there was a lot of bot activity going on. According to EigenPhi\u2019s data, over the past month, MEV bots on Ethereum set a new record by earning $1.035 million in profits through 11,640 transactions. This included $940,000 in profits from sandwich attacks.\n\nA sandwich attack is a type of front-running attack used by MEV (miner extractable value) bots in which they place two trades around a target trade to exploit the price difference for profit.\n\nThe high number of MEV bots and sandwich attacks can cause Ethereum\u2019s network to slow down due to increased congestion and transaction fees. This can lead to a negative impact on the network\u2019s overall efficiency and user experience.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe Ethereum network was also impacted in terms of gas fees. Santiment\u2019s data indicated that Ethereum lost its spot with respect to fee distribution. New assets such as APED and BOBO have taken the lead in this area.\n\nHowever, the interest in NFT trading on Ethereum remained unaffected. For the third consecutive month, Ethereum NFTs saw a trading volume of over $1 billion, according to Delphi Digital\u2019s data."

        "title": "How to stake Polygon (MATIC) - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Polygon network, formerly the Matic network, is an Ethereum-scaling protocol that reduces cost and embeds high security. In a short span, Polygon has gained a high level of traction.\n\nA string of solutions on a single network sets Polygon apart from other Ethereum scaling projects. It empowers developers to zero in on a scaling solution that works best with their applications. Polygon Labs has been consistently working to develop scaling solutions based on plasma sidechains, a blockchain bridge, different types of zero-knowledge proofs and Optimistic Rollups.\n\nProcessing bundles of transactions on the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain drastically reduces the burden on the Ethereum main chain, making transactions faster. The throughput rate in the Ethereum base layer is roughly 14 transactions per second, while Polygon has the potential to handle exponentially higher transactions per second.\n\nAnyone wanting to participate in the network by updating transactional data on the system must stake Polygon (MATIC). In the Polygon network, a validator\u2019s job is to ensure the network\u2019s security and add transactions to blocks. Validators stake, allowing users to delegate tokens in exchange for rewards net of any commissions charged by validators.\n\nStaking of MATIC, explained\n\nAnyone looking to stake MATIC has to delegate tokens to a validator. Stakers can earn rewards against the staked funds. For now, there are no minimum staking requirements though validators can decide the minimum acceptable limit for staking. Validators might charge fees or commissions for these services. Staked MATIC tokens have an unlocking period of 80 checkpoints, approximately three to four days. Stakers wanting to exit just need to send an unbound request.\n\nIt helps to factor in validators\u2019 credibility before delegating funds to any of them. One can hop to the Polygon staking dashboard to get information about validators, viewing metrics such as active validators, their uptime, commission and the amount required to stake. These metrics are valuable tools to help select reliable validator(s):\n\nUptime refers to the number of blocks signed in a specific time period. A validator\u2019s uptime should be close to 100%. Otherwise, it indicates the validator is unreliable, as reflected in their public performance metrics.\n\nCommission rate is the percentage of one\u2019s rewards the validator receives for their services.\n\nThe stake amount indicates the total number of tokens delegated to a validator.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a decentralized, noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet is accessible as a mobile app and browser extension on Google Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Opera and Edge.\n\nHere are the steps to stake MATIC on MetaMask:\n\nStep 1: Add MetaMask as a browser extension.\n\nTo stake MATIC on MetaMask, users need to visit the MetaMask website and set it up as a browser extension. Go to \u201cDownload.\u201d One can choose between the currently used browser and iOS or Android. Select the download option for the browser to add MetaMask.\n\nStep 2: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon blockchain.\n\nMetaMask is compatible with different blockchains. To connect MetaMask to Polygon, go to \u201cNetworks\u201d and \u201cAdd network.\u201d In the window that appears, users must populate relevant data regarding the Polygon blockchain.\n\nStep 3: Transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask.\n\nTo transfer MATIC tokens to the MetaMask wallet, copy the address from the wallet and feed it in as the destination address on the exchange or another wallet. Now, transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask.\n\nStep 4: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon Wallet.\n\nOn the following link, click \u201cMetaMask\u201d to connect MetaMask to the Polygon wallet. https://wallet.polygon.technology/\n\nStep 5: Stake MATIC via MetaMask.\n\nOnce the connection is established, staking is enabled.\n\nStep 6: Delegate MATIC.\n\nSelect a validator to which tokens will be delegated.\n\nOne needs to use the control panel for staking. Click on the button \u201cApps\u201d and then select \u201cStaking.\u201d Put the validator\u2019s name in the search bar and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d All relevant information, such as the number of tokens staked, uptime and commission amount, is visible next to the validator\u2019s name.\n\nFeed in the MATIC amount for staking and click \u201cContinue.\u201d In the pop-up extension window, click \u201cConfirm.\u201d The transaction might take a few minutes to complete, depending on traffic.\n\nTo execute a transaction, stake MATIC and begin receiving rewards, users must buy a voucher and pay for gas. Click \u201cBuy Voucher.\u201d Specify details like the gas limit and price, and re-confirm the transaction.\n\nDelegation is now complete. Users can \u201cStake more\u201d or withdraw the rewards using the control panel. However, note that all transactions on the Ethereum network are paid in Ether (ETH). Therefore, the delegator must have enough ETH in the wallet to pay for the transactions.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on Coinbase Wallet\n\nTo stake MATIC on Coinbase, users need to use a wallet, as they don\u2019t provide a staking feature on the exchange. If users have funds on the exchange but not in the wallet, they will need to move funds to the wallet. Even though Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t have a built-in staking feature, there is a way to do it.\n\nHere are the steps leading to staking MATIC on Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStep 1: Install Coinbase wallet.\n\nInstall Coinbase Wallet on your smartphone. If it is an iPhone, go to the Apple App Store; visit the Play Store for Android.\n\nThe process includes creating a new wallet, agreeing to the terms of service, picking a username, setting privacy preferences, creating a passcode and backing up the wallet with a recovery phrase to help access the account in case users forget the passcode.\n\nStep 2: Move funds to the wallet.\n\nOpen the wallet and go down to the bottom right. Tap there and scroll down the screen that appears. The link \u201cConnect to Coinbase\u201d will be visible. Hit the link, and it will ask for authorization. Once done, the wallet will establish the user\u2019s connection to their wallet.\n\nHit \u201cBuy or transfer.\u201d When the exchange prompts you to select a coin, select \u201cMATIC wallet.\u201d Now, users can feed in the number of coins they want to transfer. The wallet will ask for a verification code. Once successfully deposited, funds will be transferred. MATIC tokens on Coinbase exchange are ERC-20 tokens, meaning they run on top of the Ethereum network.\n\nStep 3: Stake MATIC.\n\nVisit the Polygon website. On the top menu, click \u201cUse Polygon\u201d and \u201cStaking.\u201d On the next page, click \u201cBecome a delegator.\u201d\n\nThe user is taken to a page displaying a list of validators and their relevant details. One can sort the list in line with four parameters: performance, commission, stake and random, by clicking a drop-down list on the right of the page. The user can view the validators as a grid or a list. They can also search for a specific validator using a search box on the left.\n\nWhen users click any of the validators, they are taken to the page displaying further details of the relevant validator, such as MATIC staked, the commission asked, checkpoints signed and health status. Users can go through the list and click any validator.\n\nA different page displays further details of the validator. This includes the amount of MATIC their Ethereum wallet balance holds and its value in dollars, their stake, heimdall fee, rewards earned, performance index, checkpoints signed and more. Heimdall fees refer to the fees the validator has to pay using the Polygon network to submit checkpoints.\n\nThe user must log in by clicking the button at the top-right using their credentials. Users without an account on Polygon must create one and click the \u201cBecome a Delegator\u201d button.\n\nUsers need to populate the number of MATIC coins they intend to delegate and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d When the user clicks \u201cContinue,\u201d a pop-up appears. The user must tap the \u201cDelegate\u201d button to complete the process.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is a decentralized, noncustodial mobile app wallet for storing, exchanging and transferring crypto assets. Here is the process to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet:\n\nStep 1: Set up a Trust Wallet.\n\nSet up a Trust Wallet on your mobile phone. Select the preferred operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app.\n\nIf users have already been using Trust Wallet, they must import the wallet. Otherwise, they have to set up a new wallet. To import an existing wallet, click the \u201cI already have a wallet\u201d button and confirm a six-digit passcode.\n\nIf a user is uninitiated with the wallet, they must read and agree to the privacy policy and terms of service, create and confirm a six-digit passcode and back up the wallet with a recovery phrase.\n\nTrust Wallet allows a wallet for several coins, but a multicoin wallet is usually the most suitable. As MATIC staking occurs on Ethereum, one requires an adequate amount of ETH and MATIC on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nStep 2: Connect Trust Wallet to Polygon.\n\nLog in to the Polygon staking dashboard and click \u201cBecome a Delegator.\u201d From the list of wallets, select \u201cWalletConnect\u201d to connect to Trust Wallet on Polygon. A QR code will appear on the screen.\n\nReturn to the Trust Wallet app, go to the settings and choose WalletConnect. Click the \u201cNew Connection\u201d button. Scan the QR code on the Polygon staking dashboard. Click \u201cConfirm\u201d to establish the connection.\n\nStep 3: Delegate and approve transaction.\n\nSelect the validator and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d Feed the number of MATIC coins to be staked and click \u201cContinue.\u201d To approve the transaction, confirm the smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app.\n\nGet back to the Polygon staking dashboard and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d Confirm yet another smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app. Delegation is active and users can begin accruing rewards.\n\nHow to stake using Ledger\n\nLedger is a popular device for storing cryptocurrencies. Before staking MATIC with Ledger, one needs to prepare for it.\n\nStep 1: Prepare for staking.\n\nThe process starts with updating Ledger Live to the latest version using the link: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download\n\nConnect the Ledger device to \u201cMy Ledger\u201d and install the latest version of the ETH app on the Ledger device. Enable blind signing in the ETH app settings. When the preparation process is completed, Close Ledger Live or problems might arise when working with MetaMask.\n\nUsers also need to ensure MATIC is stored in the Ledger Ethereum account and not in the Polygon account, as MATIC staking happens on the Ethereum network.\n\nStep 2: Connect Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.\n\nConnect the Ledger device to the desktop and open the ETH app within. Now, link the Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.\n\nOnce the connection is established, go to the Polygon Wallet app.\n\nConnect your Ledger Ether account to MetaMask by following these steps.\n\nOnce done, go to the Polygon Web Wallet app, select \u201cConnect to a Wallet\u201d and then MetaMask.\n\nWhen MetaMask opens in the browser, select the Ledger account, click \u201cNext\u201d and then \u201cConnect.\u201d Ledger displays \u201cSign message.\u201d Select \u201cSign message\u201d and simultaneously press both buttons to confirm. Now, MetaMask is connected to the Polygon Wallet app.\n\nStep 3: Select a validator.\n\nSelect \u201cPolygon Staking.\u201d In the app\u2019s top-right corner, click the \u201cLogin\u201d button and select MetaMask again.\n\nChoose a validator from the list that appears. Users need to consider two parameters: a high score for \u201cCheckpoint signed\u201d and a low \u201cCommission.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Delegate.\n\nClick the \u201cDelegate\u201d button, fill in the amount of MATIC to be staked and click \u201cContinue.\u201d MetaMask displays \u201cGive permission to access your MATIC?\u201d\n\nReview the fee amount; if it looks satisfactory, click \u201cConfirm.\u201d Ledger now displays \u201cReview transaction.\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cAccept and send\u201d and press both buttons simultaneously to \u201csign the transaction.\u201d Ledger now displays \u201cApplication is ready.\u201d\n\nReturn to the Polygon Web Wallet App, select a validator and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d\n\nReview and confirm the transaction through MetaMask and Ledger devices. When the Ethereum network confirms the transaction, the screen will display \u201cDelegation Completed.\u201d\n\nHow to stake MATIC using ZenGo wallet\n\nZenGo is a self-compatible wallet. It\u2019s compatible with WalletConnect, with no seed phrase vulnerability. Let\u2019s go through how users can stake MATIC using a ZenGo wallet.\n\nStep 1: Install the ZenGo wallet on your mobile phone.\n\nVisit the ZenGo website, select an operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app on the mobile phone. To accelerate the search, one can scan the QR code.\n\nOpen the ZenGo app, enter an email address and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d ZenGo requires the user to confirm their email address. For confirmation, reach the inbox by tapping \u201cOpen My Email\u201d in the ZenGo app, then tap \u201cTap to Confirm\u201d in the email received. After email address verification, enable biometrics to make the app even more secure.\n\nCreate a Recovery Kit for the safety of funds and easy access when changing devices. As a noncustodial wallet, ZenGo shares an encrypted secret key share. Part of the key stored on the device helps unlock the wallet and use it with a face scan. Once the Recovery Kit is created, tap \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Connect ZenGo wallet to Polygon.\n\nUsers need to connect the ZenGo wallet to Polygon. Open the link https://staking.polygon.technology/\n\nGo to the Polygon staking dashboard. In the upper right part of the screen, tap \u201cLogin.\u201d\n\nTap WalletConnect from the list of available connections. WalletConnect protocol enables one to connect ZenGo to Polygon. The QR code will appear.\n\nGo to the ZenGo wallet homepage and tap the \u201cConnect to Apps\u201d button in the upper right corner. Scan the QR code.\n\nStep 3: Select a validator and delegate MATIC.\n\nNow begins the process of delegating MATIC. Make sure to have MATIC in ERC-20 and 0.05\u20130.1 ETH for fees, as the delegation happens on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOn the Polygon staking dashboard, scroll down to find information such as the network\u2019s overview, active validators, their amount of stake, uptime, commission, amount of stake and health metrics.\n\nSelect a validator after considering the metrics and tap \u201cDelegate\u201d at the bottom-right of the screen.\n\nIn the pop-up box that appears, users need to enter the amount of MATIC to be staked and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d You can stake with an amount as low as 1 MATIC. To confirm the transaction, return to the ZenGo app and approve the transaction in the pop-up window.\n\nRevisit the Polygon staking dashboard and tap \u201cDelegate.\u201d In the ZenGo wallet, confirm the transaction and wait for approval.\n\nOnce delegation is active, the user will begin receiving rewards. At each checkpoint, rewards get accrued.\n\nRewards are received in the \u201cMy Account\u201d section of the Polygon staking dashboard. Users can also unstake, stake to multiple validators or restake funds. To withdraw the rewards accrued, users must have a minimum of 2 MATIC in their account.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs a prominent layer-2 network, the Polygon protocol is a solution that helps Ethereum expand in size, security, efficiency and use cases. As the unit of payment and settlement in the network, MATIC helps power the system. The Matic network went live in 2020, rebranded to Polygon in February 2021, and is being used by developers to build Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications.\n\nThe Polygon protocol has been instrumental in making Ethereum usable and pulling it out of the mess the blockchain found itself in after rapid growth. Transactions were stuck for hours over a lack of scalability, with the cost of executing transactions often more than the transaction amount itself. The Polygon protocol has effectively transformed Ethereum into a full-fledged multichain system with the advantages of Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and vibrancy.\n\nMATIC token is here to stay and keeps playing an increasingly important role in retaining the functionality of Ethereum ecosystem. Staking, meanwhile, will serve as a mechanism to ensure proper governance and security of the network."

        "title": "Ethereum's Recent Pump is Good News for Cryptos Like Deelance - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Like many cryptos, Ethereum (Ether) sure is happy that it\u2019s 2023. After a long, cold crypto winter that saw Ethereum drop in value by 36.22% over the last year, it\u2019s truly turned the corner in 2023. Year-to-date as of April 19, Ethereum has gained 65.14% and stands at $1,981.50. It\u2019s been on a solid pump recently, too, bumping up in value by 11.08% in the last month, as it has 2k in its sight yet again.\n\nThe big boost that Ethereum has experienced in 2023 has also had a trickle-down effect on other cryptos that are based on the blockchain. One of those is a new Upwork replacement that\u2019s set to hit $300,000 in the near future.\n\nIt\u2019s called Deelance (DLANCE), a first-of-its-kind freelancing and recruitment platform based on the blockchain that\u2019s revolutionizing how freelancers connect with potential employers. The platform has raised just shy of $300,000 in presale thus far, as investors are gobbling up the available $DLANCE tokens \u2013 just as you should now.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll dive more into Deelance to figure out why it\u2019s such an amazing new crypto project, and reveal how Ethereum\u2019s price pump adds more credence to the project.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nEther\u2019s Success Leads to the Same for Others on the Blockchain\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been true that Ethereum has to be successful in order for the other crypto projects that are based on it to be successful. For instance, while Ethereum struggled for much of 2022, there were certainly smaller alt coins that are based on the Ethereum blockchain that fared just fine.\n\nThat being said, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt when Ethereum does well. In fact, when Ether performs well, it usually follows that the solid projects with good underlying fundamentals on the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain do well, too. That\u2019s because investors start to do more research and take notice of the projects based on Ethereum.\n\nDeelance is one of those, and it\u2019s definitely benefitting from the bounceback success that Ethereum has experienced this year. In a short amount of time in presale, Deelance has been able to raise more than $294,000. It\u2019s blowing through pressale stages, with investors who wait, missing out on the lower prices that are available. That\u2019s because there\u2019s a price increase that occurs with each new presale stage. This is why it\u2019s essential that you act now so you can get the biggest potential return on your investment.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nDeelance is a Viable Replacement for Upwork\n\nUpwork has established itself as a leading freelancing platform based on Web2. It has a market capitalization of $1.37 billion. That being said, there are some major issues that the platform has, and it shows in its stock price. In the last year, Upwork\u2019s stock has dropped 51.18% in value, though it\u2019s leveled off a bit with \u201conly\u201d a 4.22% drop in 2023 year-to-date.\n\nDeelance provides a lot of advantages over a platform like Upwork \u2013 and others such as Freelancer and Fiverr \u2013 because it\u2019s a Web3 platform. It offers significantly lower fees for both freelancers and clients than all those other platforms, and it offers instant withdrawals with no fees since it can be done in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile having a large number of freelancers make the switch from Web2 to Web3 would have seemed unlikely maybe even a year or two ago, more and more people are comfortable with the move today. Part of the reason for that is the recent success of Ethereum, which is drawing more positive attention to projects such as Deelance.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nDeelance is a New Way to Work\n\nDeelance is more than just another freelancing platform. It\u2019s providing freelancers with a new way to work.\n\nUsers on the platform can create their own professional identity on the Deelance Metaverse. There, they can socialize with other people, buy commercial land or office space, put up billboard advertisements to increase their own brand awareness, get exclusive access to a Metaverse VIP experience, and even gain access to unique tools and services. Since all of this uses the $DLANCE token, too, it provides a great use case for why it\u2019ll increase in value.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nWhile working in the Metaverse, Deelance users will be able to interact with buyers in an office space. There, they can discuss potential projects, or progress on projects, which allows them to connect in a way that really wasn\u2019t possible before now. Buyers and sellers can interact directly with each other, which increases the chances that connections will be made.\n\nAnd speaking of connections, freelancers can build their own network of colleagues in the Metaverse lobby arena. This is great, as freelancers often are out all on their own. This networking capability allows them to connect with others to learn and potentially build up their own business, too.\n\nThis aspect of Deelance is what\u2019s setting it apart from all of the competition in its industry. Plus, it aligns quite well with Ethereum and the forward-thinking approach. After all, Ethereum did just go through The Merge last fall, which significantly upgraded how the blockchain works, which resulted in significant gains for the project.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nBuy Deelance Now to Get the Biggest Return on Your Investment\n\nDeelance, a new Web3 freelancing and recruitment platform, is benefitting from two major developments \u2013 the shift in work culture to freelancing and the gig economy, and the recent pump of the Ethereum blockchain that it\u2019s based on.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum is approaching $2,000 again is bringing a lot of great positive attention to cryptos based on the blockchain, which Deelance is. Yet, the real reason Deelance has been so successful in presale thus far is its own approach and design. It\u2019s positioned itself as a great replacement for Upwork, Freelancer and Fivrr, and investors are taking notice, pumping almost $300,000 into the presale thus far.\n\nIf you want to get in on the ground level of this great opportunity, you better act quick. There\u2019s a price increase with each new presale stage, and the current stage ends in about four days. So, buy Deelance now before you miss out.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The top 10 Ethereum ecosystem projects and tokens for 2023 are compiled in this article\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin is Ethereum, which is more than simply virtual currency. By creating a worldwide network that protects an ecosystem of decentralized apps (DApps) from decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more, Ethereum has expanded on the use cases of Bitcoin. Due to its decentralization in nature, Ethereum ecosystem projects and tokens are trending. This article gathers the top 10 Ethereum ecosystem projects and tokens in 2023.\n\n1. MakerDAO\u2013 An Ethereum project called MakerDAO enables cryptocurrency lending and borrowing. By depositing Ethereum-based tokens like UNI, YFI, or BTC into the protocol, users can borrow money by forming a collateralized debt position for the amount they want to borrow. When it comes time to return, the loan amount must be in DAI stablecoins, and any interest must be paid in the governance and utility token MKR. MakerDAO processes loans in DAI stablecoins.\n\nAs of April 21, 2022, MakerDAO (DAI) has a price of US$1.44 and a market valuation of US$207,255,730.\n\n2. 1INCH- The 1INCH native Ethereum token is used on the 1INCH decentralized exchange (DEX). By combining the best cryptocurrency exchange rates from all DEXs, the Ethereum-based DEX protocol seeks to provide its consumers with the best rates. Like other DEXs, 1inch enables direct token exchange between users.\n\nAs of 21 April 2023, the price of 1INCH (INCH) is US$0.5098, and its market cap is US$415,412,451.\n\n3. Sandbox\u2013 The native token and means of exchange in the Sandbox ecosystem is The Sandbox SAND. Users can use SAND to monetize their gaming experiences by buying property, building in-game assets, or listing them on The Sandbox Marketplace.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices Fall as Increase in Selling Pressure Causes Drop in Values of Most Cryptocurrenc... - Gadgets 360",
        "content": "Bitcoin price in India and international markets dropped on Friday, after days of seeing its value rise. Industry experts say that at present, the selling pressure on investors has increased, triggering a period of volatility for crypto assets. On Friday, the world's most popular cryptocurrency opened with a loss of 2.22 percent to trade at $28,245 (roughly Rs. 23.2 lakh). While it remains the most expensive cryptocurrency, BTC is currently trading at a similar price on both national as well as international exchanges. In the last 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin has dropped by $613 (roughly Rs. 50,370).\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped for the second consecutive session due to an increased selling pressure,\u201d Edul Patel, CEO of crypto investment platform Mudrex told Gadgets 360. Selling pressure garners heat when majority of the traders begin selling, indicating that the majority is betting on the market price to decrease. \u201cThis resulted in the loss of the rally and wiped out the weekly gains of Bitcoin. Despite this, there is still substantial support down to the late-March lows of $26,500 (roughly Rs. 21 lakh) and Bitcoin has seen a 40 percent increase over the past six weeks.\u201d\n\nEthereum followed Bitcoin in a conventional market movement and reflected a loss of 0.10 percent at the time of publishing. The value of Ether is hovering around the mark of $1,940 (roughly Rs. 1.60 lakh) after having fallen by $157 (roughly Rs. 12,899) in the last three days.\n\nOn Friday, most cryptocurrencies saw their prices fall alongside Bitcoin and Ether. These included altcoins like Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Ripple, and Cardano as well as Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot.\n\nShiba Inu, Avalanche, and Tron also saw their values drop on Friday.\n\n\u201cMarket performance has been sideways with a downward bias in the last 24 hours. The two-day continuous drop could be triggered by a $400 million (roughly Rs. 3,268 crore) sell order on Binance. On the regulatory front, the US seems to be lagging as market liquidity seems to be moving away from the country. Greed seems to be on a decline, as the crypto fear and greed index stands at 50, down two points in the last 24 hours and lowest since March 15,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch told Gadgets 360.\n\nThe overall crypto market valuation dipped by 1.45 percent over the last 24 hours. As of Friday, the crypto market cap stood at $1.20 trillion (roughly Rs. 98,26,980 crore), showed the data by CoinMarketCap. In the otherwise top-to-bottom loss-ridden price chart, LEO and Bitcoin SV managed to record miniscule price hikes.\n\nWhile there are several factors that could have led to the crypto market hitting a speed breaker after rallying for days, it could also be due to the possibility of stricter oversight that could make it risky for miscreants to engage with the sector. The European Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly backed the European Union's (EU) first set of rules to regulate the cryptoasset markets.\n\nCalled MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets \u2014 these rules largely revolve around consumer protection and prevention of market manipulation and financial crimes in the crypto sector. The MiCA bill is aimed at preventing insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation of crypto-assets.\n\n\u201cThe crypto market faces headwinds, but long-term tailwinds for Bitcoin are highlighted in 3iQ's 2023 Outlook. Key market indicators showed a \u2018Sell' sentiment amidst prices of BTC and ETH decreasing after a good run in the past few days. Investors must proceed with caution,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets 360.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nApple is opening its first stores in India, one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi. What does this mean for Apple customers in India? We discuss this and more on Orbital , the Gadgets 360 podcast.

        "content": "zkSync Era\u2019s integration would allow better provision of liquidity for 1inch users.\n\nAlas, development activity on the network remained very low.\n\nOn 20 April, the 1inch Network [1INCH] announced that it has adopted the Zero-Knowlege (ZK) scaling solution through its expansion to zkSync Era. Known to be connected with the cutting-edge ZK rollup technology, zkSync Era is an Ethereum [ETH] layer two (L2) whose purpose is to provide more cost-effective and faster transactions.\n\nRead 1inch Network\u2019s [1INCH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFirst of its kind\n\nAccording to the announcement, the expansion would allow users on the DEX aggregator to enjoy the benefits of the ZK system. This includes lower fees, better access to liquidity, and higher transaction speeds.\n\nAlthough zkSync Era was only launched in March 2023, it has proven to be one of the best projects with real utility. Hence, the reason there is so much hype behind it, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) has been soaring.\n\nFor context, the TVL hike means that enough liquidity has been entering into chains under the protocol.\n\nReacting to the integration, 1inch\u2019s co-founder Sergej Kunz mentioned that the project was excited to be the first to be implemented on the zkSync network. He affirmed that:\n\n\u201cAs zkSync Era gains steam, 1inch users will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\u201d\n\nIn response, the CEO, and co-founder of Matter Labs, the firm behind the zkSync idea, Alex Gluchowski did not hide his eagerness to see the outcome of the collaboration. Like Kunz, Gluchowski said:\n\n\u201cAs the largest DEX aggregator by on-chain volume, 1inch will provide deeper liquidity to zkSync Era while offering DeFi users greater transparency and empowering them to execute faster trades at better rates and with less slippage on their transactions.\u201d\n\nEcstasy in the land amid restraints in development\n\nAccording to Santiment, the network\u2019s social volume rose to 41. The metric takes into consideration the search texts for an asset.\n\nAn increase, as seen at press time, implied that participants have a high precedence for 1INCH.\n\nSimilarly, its social dominance also increased to 0.464%. When this metric spike, it shows that the asset has ascended into one of the top assets being discussed among the top 100 in market capitalization.\n\nDespite the update, the 1inch Network development activity remained clustered at a low point. At the time of writing, it was 1.12.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 INCHs worth today?\n\nThis means that there has been a continued downturn in public contribution on GitHub. However, there was a chance that the expansion could impact the metric positively considering the hype around zkSync Era.\n\nAdditionally, 1inch also pointed out that several protocols were immediately available via the network on zkSync Era. Some of these include SyncSwap, Mute, and SpaceFi."

        "content": "In the crypto space, projects are not created equal. PolkaDot (DOT), Ethereum (ETH), and Uwerx will lead the next bull market cycle. A unique value proposition drives each, and analysts expect all three to post excellent returns in 2023.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot (DOT) was created by Gavin Wood, one of the core developers of Ethereum (ETH). Polkadot (DOT) presents the solution for blockchains\u2019 core problem: their natural isolation. Polkadot (DOT) creates a foundational layer, or layer zero, allowing for the free flow of assets and information between all the Polkadot (DOT) chains. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) core blockchain is the Relay chain that provides security and relays information and assets, as the name suggests. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) other chains are called parachains, and these purpose-specific chains can hyper-specialize, allowing for an enormous ecosystem. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) elegant solution to interoperability will drive its growth in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the oldest smart contract-capable blockchain. Ethereum (ETH) launched in 2015, and the developers at Ethereum (ETH) have been shipping upgrades to the network ever since. The most recent upgrade saw Ethereum (ETH) transition to proof of stake, and the coming Ethereum (ETH) hard fork, the Shanghai hark ford, will enable staking withdrawals. Making analysts expect that once Ethereum (ETH) can be withdrawn, investors will rush to buy Ethereum (ETH) so they can stake the Ethereum (ETH) token and earn passive income from validator rewards.\n\nUwerx (WERX)\n\nUwerx has analysts and experts buzzing. This relatively unknown microcap crypto project has outrageous upside potential in 2023. Uwerx will release a decentralized blockchain based freelance platform that will set a new standard for the freelancing industry. Until now, centralized platforms have choked innovation through high platform fees and unnecessarily heavy bureaucratic systems. Uwerx provides a blockchain-driven solution and replaces intermediaries with smart contracts. InterFi Network and SolidProof have both already audited the protocol, and liquidity will be locked for twenty-five years after launch.\n\nUwerx flags all the indicators of a hidden gem, and this project could become a blue chip as early as 2024. With millions of freelancers ready to migrate to a better alternative and Uwerx providing one, the growth potential remains obscene. Analysts have predicted WERX can rally by up to 9,000% in 2023 alone, and Uwerx is an opportunity to buy a potential blue chip crypto project at a lucrative price.\n\nParabolic Year For Uwerx\n\nWhen Uwerx breaks into the mainstream, its disruptive nature will do the rest. With lower platform fees and better security, Uwerx will offer a fundamentally superior service to those currently available on the market. 2023 belongs to freelancers and Uwerx holders.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum won't make you a millionaire, but AI crypto certainly can - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, many people are wondering if they should invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. While these two cryptocurrencies have been around for some time and have seen significant growth, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, a new type of cryptocurrency known as AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. In this article, I will explore the world of cryptocurrency, examine Bitcoin and Ethereum, and discuss the potential of AI crypto investment.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates independently of a central bank and can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network and is created through a process called mining. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) through its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that prices can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it a risky investment for those without a high tolerance for risk.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n\nBitcoin has been around for over a decade and has seen significant growth in its value. However, whether or not it is a good investment depends on a variety of factors. While some investors believe that Bitcoin is a safe investment due to its limited supply and increasing demand, others argue that it is too volatile and risky.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of investing in Bitcoin is its volatility. The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it difficult to predict its future value. Additionally, Bitcoin is not backed by any government or financial institution, which means that it is not subject to the same regulations and protections as traditional investments.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum cannot be mined using traditional mining methods. Instead, it uses a process called proof-of-stake (PoS) to create new Ether tokens. PoS is a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method of creating new tokens compared to proof-of-work (PoW), which is used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo mine Ethereum, you need to join a mining pool or set up your own mining rig. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of earning Ether. Setting up your own mining rig can be expensive and time-consuming, but it gives you more control over the mining process.\n\nWhat is AI Crypto?\n\nSome AI crypto uses algorithms to analyze market data and make predictions about future market trends. Avorak AI is one of these projects. They allow investors to make more informed decisions about when to buy and sell their investments. Additionally, AI crypto is designed to be more resistant to market manipulation and fraud, making it a potentially safer investment option.\n\nInvesting in AI Crypto\n\nAvorak provides heavy incentives for holding AVRK. The revenue model, which gives 49% of all revenue back to holders, creates a truly passive income. Unlike the \u2018passive income\u2019 tokens of the past couple of years that simply minted the token into the ground pretending to be yield, the revenue comes from the product itself, meaning there is no inflation to the token.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is still a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity.\n\nInvesting in AI crypto could bring the kind of gains buying early into Bitcoin and Ethereum gave. Avorak bringing new technologies to blockchain makes it a prime target for investors, and they are raising capital fast. Getting in before the launch will guarantee lower prices and help investors on the ladder to be ready for the climb to the top.\n\nWant to learn more about Avorak AI?\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Shanghai's Blockchain Advancements: Will They Ignite A Surge In Ethereum, Bitcoin, And Big Eyes Coin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The upcoming Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, marking the end of a two-year shift to proof of stake, has been a topic of interest in recent news. The transition to proof of stake will allow access to approximately $34 billion worth of over 18 million Ethereum (ETH), causing investors to feel uncertain about the potential effects on the value of ETH, Bitcoin (BTC), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBelow, we will delve into this subject to examine the potential implications for ETH, BTC, and BIG.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Optimistic Future: A Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is set to bring about technical improvements to the network and enable staking withdrawals, completing the transition to proof of stake that has been ongoing for two years. However, the distribution of approximately 18 million ETH, valued at $34 billion, to validators after the upgrade has sparked investor concerns regarding the impact on the market value of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough the withdrawal queue restricts the number of daily requests, analysts predict that the short-term pricing impact will not be as severe as initially anticipated. Moreover, traders have already had access to staked ETH via liquid staking services like Lido even before the Shanghai upgrade. Consequently, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects will become more optimistic, given that the market has already priced in the upgrade\u2019s potential effects.\n\nOn the day of its debut, Ethereum\u2019s price increased by 2.95%, reaching a trading price of $1,985.98 and a market capitalization of $239.22 billion. Additionally, the rising competition in cryptocurrency custody is expected to lead to more ETH being locked up, attracting the attention of significant institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered, and potentially leading to a long-term price increase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Halving Cycle Shows Familiar Trends from Previous Cycles\n\nNew data suggests that the progress of the current Bitcoin halving cycle is similar to that of previous cycles, with BTC price fluctuations following a comparable pattern. On Thursday, BTC saw a 0.72% increase, which may be partially attributed to the Shapella upgrade. However, analysts are already discussing the potential impact of the block subsidy halving slated for next year, which is expected to reduce the number of BTC miners can create per block.\n\nBTC/USD has risen by nearly 70% in 2023, and the upcoming halving is anticipated to act as a catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach all-time highs, similar to what occurred in previous cycles.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Sees Major Victories\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a cryptocurrency inspired by felines, has raised an impressive $33.6 million in presale during the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. The Big Eyes Coin platform offers several exciting features, including the BIG COMP, a contest that awarded two winners $100K. The platform also boasts the Big Eyes Excali-Paw Chest, which could grant users up to $1 million in $BIG, as well as the BIG Loot and Mintable trading cards available on OpenSea. Moreover, investors can take advantage of the recently launched Stage 13, which is another exciting feature.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a unique cryptocurrency that places a high value on its investors, providing them with exclusive experiences. Despite its current price of $BIG 1891.89, token holders believe that the asset has enormous potential and are optimistic that its value will increase significantly once it hits the blockchain.\n\nNavigating the Current Market Trends for Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the current market climate of cryptocurrency, having a well-diversified portfolio of assets is essential. Although Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are already considered commodities, it won\u2019t be long before Big Eyes Coin (BIG) becomes recognized as a valuable asset with the potential for substantial returns.\n\nJoin the BIG Space!\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This legal action has sparked interest among the cryptocurrency community, particularly those who are familiar with Celsius Network and Fong\u2019s involvement with the platform.\n\nBitcoin And Ether Dip After Shanghai Upgrade\n\nContrary to optimistic predictions, Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped below the $30,000 level. This has come after a tumultuous trend, including a dip to 1.47%, but still surging across the week by 5% and then fluctuating after the weekend. Meanwhile, after enjoying a 12% surge throughout the week post the Shanghai Upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) dipped by 40%, to the $2k mark.\n\nSignUpToken.com: Future Of Crypto Gearing Towards Launch\n\nSignuptoken.com is an innovative project in the crypto industry, and it stands out as the only project that offers a presale through email sign-ups.

        "title": "Alt Season is Here: Why Dogetti, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Could be Key Players in 2023's Crypto Rollercoaster - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance fades, many analysts of the crypto market are suggesting that we are entering an alt season, where altcoins take a larger share of the market, leading to a rally in prices. Three altcoins to watch this coming season are Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which all look to make incredible gains.\n\nDogetti off to a Brilliant Start\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a newcomer to the market, which is currently in its presale stage, showing promising gains as more and more investors are purchasing tokens while it is still at a low price. DETI offers a unique blend of a cryptocurrency that pledges to donate to user-chosen charities whilst redistributing a percentage of each transaction amongst its token holders. Operating on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, DETI will be due to benefit from ETH\u2019s recent gains and after the presale ends on the 20th of June, DETI will be set onto a successful blockchain with exciting prospects. DETI uses a proof of stake mechanism, which will increase demand for the coin and protect it against any restrictions that may come into place against the proof of work mining system.\n\nEthereum Accelerating with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum (ETH) has permanently moved to a proof of stake system from proof of work, with its recent much-hyped Shanghai upgrade. Following this upgrade, ETH saw a spike in price as interest caused the value to rise above the $2k threshold, and as Bitcoin (BTC) looks to enter a decline many suspect that ETH could take its place. ETH has long been BTC\u2019s biggest competitor but has yet to reach the dizzying heights that BTC has done in the past. This, however, could all change if we enter an alt season as we are predicted to do, and the reign of BTC could be brought to a dramatic end.\n\nDogecoin Turning Heads\n\nThe final altcoin that offers a tempting alternative to the mainstream crypto of Bitcoin (BTC) is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE has seen admirable gains over the past month, and looks to continue its rise, in what one trader, CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) has predicted could be \u201cthe mother of all alt seasons\u201d. DOGE currently operates on its own blockchain under a proof of work system, and while we have been seeing the rise of proof of stake, DOGE\u2019s similarity in this sense to BTC could be an advantage to the coin nearing the top of the market. DOGE may have begun as a joke, but it seems to have succeeded in its aims to threaten the concept of an ever-serious approach to crypto by its predecessors.\n\nAs 2023\u2019s altcoin season rapidly approaches, investors are gearing up to find the currencies on the market, or due to be released imminently, that have the potential for the biggest rewards. Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three such coins, and as they gain traction and receive more attention, they stand to become some of the biggest players this season.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Israel's Central Bank Launches Digital Currency; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Signuptoken.com Can Capitalize - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have gained significant attention as widely used digital currencies. However, alongside these established players, newer cryptocurrencies like Signuptoken.com (SUT) have also emerged as potential contenders in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nAmidst this changing payment landscape, Israel\u2019s Central Bank is reportedly considering the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which refers to a digital form of fiat currency issued and regulated by a country\u2019s central bank.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Digital Shekel Or SHAKED?\n\nThe Steering Committee on the Potential Issuance of a Digital Shekel, or \u201cSHAKED,\u201d is in charge of the Bank of Israel\u2019s investigation into the feasibility of releasing a digital shekel. They have identified a number of scenarios that could influence the creation and use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including things like CBDC issuances by other nations, a decline in the use of cash in transactions, the adoption of stablecoins or other private payment methods, competition within the domestic payment system, and technological developments in the payments industry.\n\nThe Bank of Israel acknowledges the necessity to proactively address these issues and maintain control over the nation\u2019s payment system as the landscape of digital currencies continues to change. As a viable means of navigating these adjustments and ensuring that Israel stays at the forefront of financial innovation, CBDC is being taken into consideration. Although negotiations over the creation of \u201cSHAKED\u201d are ongoing, no official decision has been made.\n\nWhy Does Signuptoken.com Gain Attention\n\nSignuptoken.com (SUT) has unveiled groundbreaking features poised to revolutionize the crypto world, positioning it as a valuable asset comparable to gold.\n\nSUT, an ERC-20-based cryptocurrency, is committed to generating financial growth for its members. Despite being a relatively new player in the crypto space, Signuptoken.com has ambitious plans to launch on the Uniswap blockchain once it reaches one million sign-ups.\n\nWhat sets Signuptoken.com apart from other altcoins is its unique approach to fundraising. Unlike traditional initial coin offerings (ICOs) or presale programs, Signuptoken.com only collects email addresses, ensuring equal opportunity for all to increase their financial assets. By joining the exclusive Millionaires Club email list, members may even become eligible for early retirement.\n\nPoised to be a safe asset, Signuptoken.com (SUT) has responded to the clamor from its esteemed Millionaires Club members by introducing a highly anticipated referral system. Also, SUT ensures the security of its funds by taking measures to instill confidence in its platform. It acquired audits and secured listings on established crypto platforms such as CoinSniper and Solidity Finance.\n\nBitcoin And Ether \u2014 Likened To Gold\n\nAccording to CoinTelegraph, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are similar to safe-haven investments like gold in that they offer stability during macroeconomic turbulence. She cites their endurance over the most recent banking crisis, outperforming other asset classes, as proof of their widespread acceptance and adoption, pointing to a potential upheaval of the established order of things.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies gain popularity and come under regulatory pressure from the US government, Wood anticipates that they will play a significant role in the upcoming election. But only some people are as enthusiastic about this idea as she is. The world\u2019s largest hedge fund\u2019s founder, Ray Dalio, is skeptical of Bitcoin due to its volatility and central banks\u2019 unwillingness to accept it as a legitimate form of payment. After the US dollar and the euro, gold continues to be a substantial reserve held by central banks, according to Dalio.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and the growing interest in CBDC by Israel\u2019s Central Bank reflect the changing landscape of digital assets. With \u201cgold\u201d cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SUT establishing their existence in the crypto world and CBDC being considered a potential digital currency by central banks, the future of payments and financial systems is likely to be shaped by the continued evolution of digital assets.\n\nProvide Your Email on the Signuptoken.com Roster\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Hit New Highs During Meme Season - Here's Why - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The hype around meme-inspired cryptocurrency has caused a spike in the price of Ethereum gas in recent days. The rising demand for transactions on the Ethereum network is a direct effect of the rising value of these tokens.\n\nThere was a 10-month spike in Ethereum\u2019s gas prices. According to data provided by Glassnode, the median price of ETH gas on a seven-day moving average has risen to 43.641 gwei, a level not seen since June 30 last year.\n\nThe network utilizes a measurement system based on the gwei. To perform a transaction or launch a smart contract on the Ethereum network, a certain amount of gas is required.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum $ETH Median Gas Price (7d MA) just reached a 10-month high of 43.641 GWEI Previous 10-month high of 43.620 GWEI was observed on 30 June 2022 View metric:https://t.co/6QGDfZoULY pic.twitter.com/n9qDcd6NqD \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 21, 2023\n\nGas is a unit of computing effort that is used on the Ethereum network to carry out a certain operation. Gwei is the currency used to denote the cost of the gas needed to perform an action on the network.\n\nOne Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 Ether (ETH), which means that if the gas price is 20 Gwei, it would cost 0.00000002 ETH to execute the operation. The price of gas can vary depending on network congestion and demand.\n\nSince miners are driven by higher gas prices to include transactions with higher gas costs in the blocks they mine, higher gas prices usually result in faster transaction processing times.\n\nETH market cap at $229.8 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Up 35%\n\nThe median gas price across a 7DMA peaked at 150 gwei in May 2022 and has since decreased significantly to the low-to-mid-teens. Then, beginning in March 2022, it began to settle at roughly 20 gwei, where it remained until the Merge went live in September of that year.\n\nAs of April 20, 2023, the average gas price for Ethereum transactions was 81.94 gwei, up from 60.82 gwei on April 19 and 44.42 gwei in 2022, representing a rise of 34.74% and 84.46%, respectively.\n\nMemecoins are the buzz of the town right now, and Pepe The Frog is spearheading the charge. According to market analysis platform Santiment, recently deployed memecoins such as $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO have surpassed the top gas-burning altcoins.\n\nIn particular, PEPE\u2019s market cap has increased to little over $89 million in just a few days, making it the sixth largest memecoin.\n\nEthereum Edges Bitcoin In Daily Fees\n\nMeanwhile, independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano stated that the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, had generated 28 times the revenue of Bitcoin through its daily fee structure.\n\nAdditionally, he mentioned layer-2 Ethereum platforms that have exceeded the BTC network in terms of daily revenue, such as Arbitrum One.\n\nImage shows the daily and weekly revenue of various blockchains. Source: Twitter\n\nThe findings also showed Ethereum\u2019s rising prominence in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, gas fees have been a topic of conversation. Certain activities, such as small transactions or interacting with smart contracts of low value, can become prohibitively costly due to the network\u2019s high gas fees.\n\n-Featured image from Zipmex"
