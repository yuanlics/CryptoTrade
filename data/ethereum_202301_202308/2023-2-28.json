        "title": "What is Ethereum? Explained With Features and Applications - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Ethereum is considered by many to be the second most popular cryptocurrency, surpassed now only by Bitcoin. According to The Motley Fool, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has some big-name founding members, including Microsoft, Intel, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of Ethereum by the corporate world,\u201d says CNBC, \u201cmeans it could eventually be bigger than its early stage rival.\u201d That means it\u2019s time to get to know the Ethereum platform, including its features and applications, and what makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin.\n\nOur \u201cEthereum Explained\u201d Ethereum tutorial video lays it all out for you, and here we\u2019ll cover what\u2019s discussed in the video.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based computing platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications\u2014meaning not run by a centralized authority. You can create a decentralized application for which the participants of that particular application are the decision-making authority.\n\nEthereum Features\n\nEther: This is Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency.\n\nSmart contracts: Ethereum allows the development and deployment of these types of contracts.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine: Ethereum provides the underlying technology\u2014the architecture and the software\u2014that understands smart contracts and allows you to interact with it.\n\nDecentralized applications (Dapps): A decentralized application is called a Dapp (also spelled DAPP, App, or DApp) for short. Ethereum allows you to create consolidated applications, called decentralized applications.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): Ethereum allows you to create these for democratic decision-making.\n\nThese are Ethereum\u2019s essential features. Before going deep into the Ethereum tutorial, let\u2019s discuss each of these features in more detail.\n\n1. Ether\n\nEther (ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency. It is the fuel that runs the network. It is used to pay for the computational resources and the transaction fees for any transaction executed on the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoins, ether is a peer-to-peer currency. Apart from being used to pay for transactions, ether is also used to buy gas, which is used to pay for the computation of any transaction made on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso, if you want to deploy a contract on Ethereum, you will need gas, and you would have to pay for that gas in ether. So gas is the execution fee paid by a user for running a transaction in Ethereum. Ether can be utilized for building decentralized applications, building smart contracts, and making regular peer-to-peer payments.\n\n2. Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are revolutionizing how traditional contracts work, which is why you need to use the tutorial to become more familiar with them. A smart contract is a simple computer program that facilitates the exchange of any asset between two parties. It could be money, shares, property, or any other digital asset that you want to exchange. Anyone on the Ethereum network can create these contracts. The contract consists primarily of the terms and conditions mutually agreed on between the parties (peers).\n\nThe smart contract\u2019s primary feature is that once it is executed, it cannot be altered, and any transaction done on top of a smart contract is registered permanently\u2014it is immutable. So even if you modify the smart contract in the future, the transactions correlated with the original contract will not get altered; you cannot edit them.\n\nThe verification process for the smart contracts is carried out by anonymous parties in the network without the need for a centralized authority, and that\u2019s what makes any smart contract execution on Ethereum a decentralized execution.\n\nThe transfer of any asset or currency is done in a transparent and trustworthy manner, and the identities of the two entities are secure on the Ethereum network. Once the transaction is successfully done, the accounts of the sender and receiver are updated accordingly, and in this way, it generates trust between the parties.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nSmart Contracts Vs. Traditional Contract Systems\n\nIn conventional contract systems, you sign an agreement, then you trust and hire a third party for its execution. The problem is that in this type of process, data tampering is possible. With smart contracts, the agreement is coded in a program.\n\nA centralized authority does not verify the result; it is confirmed by the participants on the Ethereum blockchain-based network. Once a contract is executed, the transaction is registered and cannot be altered or tampered, so it removes the risk of any data manipulation or alteration.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example in which someone named Zack has given a contract of $500 to someone named Elsa for developing his company\u2019s website. The developers code the agreement of the smart contract using Ethereum\u2019s programming language.\n\nThe smart contract has all the conditions (requirements) for building the website. Once the code is written, it is uploaded and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEVM is a runtime compiler to execute a smart contract. Once the code is deployed on the EVM, every participant on the network has a copy of the contract. When Elsa submits the work on Ethereum for evaluation, each node on the Ethereum network will evaluate and confirm whether the result given by Elsa has been done as per the coding requirements.\n\nOnce the result is approved and verified, the contract worth $500 will be self-executed, and the payment will be paid to Elsa in ether. Zack\u2019s account will be automatically debited, and Elsa will be credited with $500 in ether.\n\nThe Ethereum tutorial video includes a demo on the deployment of an Ethereum smart contract.\n\nTake a deep dive on Bitcoins, Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Multichain Blockchain platforms with the Blockchain Certification Training Course!\n\n3. Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nEVM, as mentioned above in this Ethereum tutorial, is designed to operate as a runtime environment for compiling and deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts. EVM is the engine that understands the language of smart contracts, which are written in the Solidity language for Ethereum. EVM is operated in a sandbox environment\u2014basically, you can deploy your stand-alone environment, which can act as a testing and development environment. You can then test your smart contract (use it) \u201cn\u201d number of times, verify it, and once you are satisfied with the performance and the functionality of the smart contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum main network.\n\nAny programming language in the smart contract is compiled into the bytecode, which the EVM understands. This bytecode can be read and executed using the EVM. Solidity is one of the most popular languages for writing a smart contract. Once you write your smart contract in Solidity, that contract gets converted into the bytecode and gets deployed on the EVM, thereby guaranteeing security from cyberattacks.\n\na) How Does EVM Work?\n\nSuppose person A wants to pay person B 10 ethers. The transaction will be sent to the EVM using a smart contract for a fund transfer from A to B. To validate the transaction; the Ethereum network will perform the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nThe miner nodes on Ethereum will validate this transaction\u2014whether the identity of A exists or not, and if A has the requested amount to transfer. Once the transaction is confirmed, the ether will be debited from A\u2019s wallet and will be credited to B\u2019s wallet, and during this process, the miners will charge a fee to validate this transaction and will earn a reward.\n\nAll the nodes on the Ethereum network execute smart contracts using their respective EVMs.\n\nb) Proof of Work\n\nEvery node in the Ethereum network has:\n\nThe entire history of all the transactions\u2014the entire chain\n\nThe history of the smart contract, which is the address at which the smart contract is deployed, along with the transactions associated with the smart contract\n\nThe handle to the current state of the smart contract\n\nThe goal of the miners on the Ethereum network is to validate the blocks. For each block of a transaction, miners use their computational power and resources to get the appropriate hash value by varying the nonce. The miners will vary the nonce and pass it through a hashing algorithm\u2014in Ethereum, it is the Ethash algorithm.\n\nThis produces a hash value that should be less than the predefined target as per the proof-of-work consensus. If the hash value generated is less than the target value, then the block is considered to be verified, and the miner gets rewarded.\n\nWhen the proof of work is solved, the result is broadcast and shared with all the other nodes to update their ledger. If other nodes accept the hashed block as valid, then the block gets added to the Ethereum main blockchain, and as a result, the miner receives a reward, which as of today stands at three ethers. Plus, the miner gets the transaction fees that have been generated for verifying the block. All the transactions that are aggregated in the block\u2014the cumulative transaction fees associated with all the transactions are also rewarded to the miner.\n\nc) Proof of Stake\n\nIn Ethereum, a process called proof of stake is also under development. It is an alternative to proof of work and is meant to be a solution to minimize the use of expensive resources spent on mining using proof of work. In proof of stake, the miner\u2014who is the validator\u2014can validate the transactions based on the number of crypto coins he or she holds before actually starting the mining.\n\nSo, based on the accumulation of crypto coins the miner has beforehand, he or she has a higher probability of mining the block. However, proof of stake is not widely used as of now compared to proof of work.\n\nd) Gas\n\nJust like we need fuel to run a car, we need gas to run applications on the Ethereum network. To perform any transaction within the Ethereum network, a user must make a payment, in this case paying out ethers, to get a transaction done, and the intermediary monetary value is called gas.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, gas is a unit that measures the computational power required to run a smart contract or a transaction. So, if you must do a transaction that updates the blockchain, you would have to shell out gas, and that gas costs ethers.\n\nIn Ethereum, the transaction fees are calculated using a formula (see screenshot below). For every transaction, there is gas and its correlated gas price. The transaction fees equal the amount of gas required to execute a transaction multiplied by the gas price. \u201cGas limit\u201d refers to the amount of gas used for the computation and the amount of ether a user is required to pay for the gas.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the Ethereum network showing the transaction cost. You can see for this particular transaction, the gas limit was 21,000, the gas used by the transaction was 21,000, and the gas price was 21 Gwei, which is the lowest denomination of ether. So, 21 Gwei * 21,000 gave the actual transaction fees: 0.000441 ethers, or about 21 cents as of today. As mentioned, the transaction fee goes to the miner, who has validated the transaction.\n\nTo understand the gas limit and price, let\u2019s consider an example using a car. Suppose your vehicle has a mileage of 10 kilometers per liter and petrol costs $1 per liter. Under these parameters, driving a car for 50 kilometers would cost you five liters of petrol, which is worth $5. Similarly, to perform an operation or to run code on Ethereum, you need to obtain a certain amount of gas, like petrol, and the gas has a per-unit price, called gas price.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nIf the user provides less than the amount of gas to run an operation, then the process will fail, and the user will be given the message \u201cout of gas.\u201d And Gwei, as noted above, is the lowest denomination of ether used for measuring a unit of a gas price.\n\ne) How is Ethereum Mining Different from Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin Ethereum Hashing Algorithm SHA-256 Ethash Time is taken to mine a block An average of 10 minutes An average of 12-15 seconds Reward 12.5 BTC 3 ETH USD - 04/10/2019 1 Bitcoin = 5249.03 1 Ether = 180.89\n\n4. Decentralized Applications (Dapps)\n\nLet\u2019s compare decentralized applications with traditional applications. When you log in to Twitter, for example, a web application gets displayed that is rendered using HTML. The page will call an API to access your data (your information), which is centrally hosted. It\u2019s a simple process: your front end executes the backend API, and the API goes and fetches your data from a centralized database.\n\nIf we transform this application into a decentralized application when you log in, the same web application gets rendered, but it calls a smart contract-based API to fetch the information from the blockchain network. So, the API is replaced by a smart contract interface, and the smart contract will bring the data from the blockchain network, which is its back end.\n\nThat blockchain network is not a centralized database; it\u2019s a decentralized network in which the participants of the network (the miners) validate (verify) all the transactions that are happening using the smart contract on the blockchain network. So, any transaction or action happening on a Twitter-type application that has now been transformed will be a decentralized transaction.\n\nA Dapp consists of a backing code that runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network. It is a software designed to work in the Ethereum network without being controlled by a centralized system, as mentioned, and that is the primary difference: it provides direct interaction between the end-users and the decentralized application providers.\n\nAn application qualifies as a Dapp when it is open-source (its code is on Github), and it uses a public blockchain-based token to run its applications. A token acts as fuel for the decentralized application to run. Dapp allows the back end code and data to be decentralized, and that is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\n\n5. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nA DAO is a digital organization that operates without hierarchical management; it works in a decentralized and democratic fashion. So basically, a DAO is an organization in which the decision-making is not in the hands of a centralized authority but preferably in the hands of certain designated authorities or a group or designated people as a part of an authority. It exists on a blockchain network, where it is governed by the protocols embedded in a smart contract, and thereby, DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making\u2014or, we can say, decentralized voting systems\u2014within the organization. So, before any organizational decision can be made, it must go through the voting system, which runs on a decentralized application.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. People add funds through the DAO because the DAO requires funding in order to execute and make decisions. Based on that, each member is given a token that represents that person\u2019s percentage of shares in the DAO. Those tokens are used to vote in the DAO, and the proposal status is decided based on the maximum votes. Every decision within the organization must go through this voting process.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All!

The results of polls are publicly available, ensuring a transparent and fair democratic process by eliminating voting malpractices.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with DAO, voting systems are adopting Ethereum.

Banking Systems\n\nEthereum is getting adopted widely in banking systems because with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized system; it is challenging for hackers to gain unauthorized access. It also allows payments on an Ethereum-based network, so banks are also using Ethereum as a channel to make remittances and payments.\n\nEthereum is getting adopted widely in banking systems because with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized system; it is challenging for hackers to gain unauthorized access.

Agreements\n\nWith Ethereum smart contracts, agreements can be maintained and executed without any alteration. So in an industry that has fragmented participants, is subject to disputes, and requires digital contracts to be present, Ethereum can be used as a technology for developing smart contracts and for digitally recording the agreements and the transactions based on them.\n\nConclusion\n\nHead over to our \u201cEthereum Explained\u201d Ethereum tutorial video to see an in-depth demo on how to deploy an Ethereum smart contract locally, including installing Ganache and Node in a Windows environment.\n\nAnd if you want to take your career to the next level, what are you waiting for?

        "content": "An audited version of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard is now available on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe standard has been implemented through the smart contract EntryPoint, which has been running for a few weeks already \u2014 and is designed to change how users interact with wallet services.\n\nMost of Ethereum\u2019s existing wallets are externally owned accounts (EOA). The list, which makes up a majority of wallets now in the Ethereum ecosystem, includes providers like MetaMask and imToken.\n\nAnd it even extends to hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano, where only one key controls an account \u2014 meaning that if its key is compromised or lost, any tokens within the wallet would be, too.\n\nWith account abstraction, the idea would be to make the account flexible to match users needs, according to Yoav Weiss, a security fellow at the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, including its native token, ether (ETH).\n\n\u201cFor some users, this may simply mean getting the user experience of a bank \u2014 where someone can always help recover your bank account even if you lose your password,\u201d Weiss, an author of the ERC-4337 proposal, told Blockworks. \u201cFor more sophisticated users, it could mean adding more controls or features to your account.\u201d\n\nAn example? Adding two-factor authentication to spend more than $5,000 dollars, Weiss said. The measure also allows users to use the cryptographic signature of their choosing, and it also authorizes transactions securely through cell phones.\n\nUnlike EOAs, account abstraction enables users to use smart contract wallets with arbitrary verification logic.\n\n\u201cSo now, users don\u2019t need to think about writing down 12 words on a piece of paper, but instead, they are able to add and remove devices and include recovery options with a friend or a lawyer,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nImplementing an ERC-4337 standard\n\nAccount abstraction has been in the works for over nine years. It\u2019s been difficult to reach a consensus and change an entire protocol to support it.\n\n\u201cWe needed to better understand security and better understand usability, but you can\u2019t [take] action for something that requires a protocol change because there is no input, and that\u2019s where ERC-4337 comes in,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nERC \u2014 short for Ethereum request for comment \u2014 is an opt-in standard that no one is obligated to use. Instead of changing consensus rules, ERC ensures everyone agrees to a standard before they begin using it on-chain.\n\nOne prevalent example: the ERC-20 token standard. ERC-20 doesn\u2019t alter Ethereum at its protocol level. But, because developers have agreed tokens should follow ERC-20 rules, it has set a standard.\n\n\u201cHaving a standard creates an ecosystem,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd what ERC-4337 does is it will create a standard for account abstraction.\u201d\n\nExisting products such as Gnosis Safe and Argent have already implemented features such as social recovery. But in order to maintain them, they would have to connect to a centralized relayer.\n\nIf a centralized relayer is attacked, users would not be able to access their accounts.\n\nERC-4337 will introduce a new mempool for user operations.\n\nThis mempool is serviced by \u201cbundlers\u201d \u2014 similar to validators and miners \u2014 but on an accounts function level. So rather than submitting a transaction, a user would submit a user operation to the mempool, and bundlers will take it from the mempool and include it in blocks on Ethereum or any other EVM chain, Weiss said.\n\nOne of the first protocols to comply with the ERC-4337 standard for bundlers is Stackup.\n\n\u201cWe have a test for bundlers to make sure they are ready, and stackup was one of the first ones to be ready,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nThe company will allow developers to build customized Web3 transaction flows and wallets using the latest ERC-4337 smart contract.\n\n\u201cDevelopers won\u2019t need to think about how each blockchain works, the wallet only needs to support ERC-4337, and it can be deployed and used on any EVM chain,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum moved to proof of stake. Why can\u2019t Bitcoin? - MIT Technology Review",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining, the computationally intensive process by which new coins are created and accounted for, has become a global concern. After China cracked down on the process in mid-2021, miners sought out other areas of the world where energy was cheap, but not always clean. In places like Kazakhstan, miners put pressure on the power grid, which relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal-fired power stations, causing localized blackouts and contributing to civil unrest. In upstate New York, where miners took over shuttered factories and empty warehouses, locals have complained of rising energy bills and the high-frequency whine of whirring data center fans\u2014and worried about the environmental toll mining is taking. The US currently hosts 38% of all bitcoin mining operations.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of energy as a single US household does over the course of nearly a month. But does it have to be that way? The Bitcoin community has historically been fiercely resistant to change, but pressure from regulators and environmentalists fed up with Bitcoin\u2019s massive carbon footprint may force them to rethink that stance.\n\nA variety of other countries, including Kazakhstan, Iran, and Singapore, have also set limits on crypto mining. In April 2023, the European Parliament is due to pass a landmark crypto bill called Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which mandates environmental disclosures from crypto firms. The law is expected to go into force sometime in 2024.\n\nThat may be just the start for the EU: the European Central Bank has previously stated it cannot imagine a world where governments would ban gasoline-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles but not act on Bitcoin\u2019s persistence in pumping out CO2. \u201cSome members of the European Parliament are already wondering why Bitcoin is not following Ethereum,\u201d Alex de Vries, the data scientist behind Digiconomist, a website that tracks cryptocurrency energy use, told MIT Technology Review.\n\nEfforts to crack down on Bitcoin\u2019s waste are gaining steam in the US as well. In November, New York became the first state to enact a temporary ban on new cryptocurrency mining permits at fossil-fuel plants. The new law also requires New York to study crypto mining\u2019s impact on the state\u2019s efforts to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nSo what would it take to make a switch?\n\nProof of work vs. proof of stake\n\nCryptocurrencies have no central guardian, like a bank, to oversee their public ledgers\u2014the shared digital record of every transaction on the blockchain. Instead, they rely on consensus mechanisms to agree on updates. In proof of work, the approach Bitcoin relies on, a worldwide network of computers\u2014known as \u201cminers\u201d\u2014spends electricity trying to win a lottery of sorts. Whoever wins gets to append the next block and collect new coins in the process. The chance of winning is in direct proportion to the number of computations a miner does. As a result, massive server farms have sprung up around the globe dedicated solely to winning this lottery.\n\nProof of stake, the approach Ethereum now uses, does away with this massive energy consumption. Instead of miners, proof-of-stake systems employ vast numbers of \u201cvalidators.\u201d To become a validator, you have to deposit, or \u201cstake,\u201d a set amount in coins\u201432 ether, in the case of Ethereum. Staking gives validators a chance to check new blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain so they can earn rewards on top of their staked coins. The more coins you stake, the better your odds of getting picked to add the next block of transactions to the chain."

        "title": "Do 'Ethereum killers' have a future? Here's what the crypto community says - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Repeated outages of one of the most popular blockchains believed to have the potential to dethrone the Ethereum network sparked a conversation among community members about the future of those carrying the burden of being called an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nA member of a cryptocurrency forum on Reddit opened a conversation on Ethereum killers and questioned their ability to succeed in the current crypto space. According to the community member, those dubbed as Ethereum killers are unlikely to succeed because they do not get the same adoption that Ethereum does.\n\nIn addition, the community member argued that even if a chain becomes faster than Ethereum, the market capitalization of Ether (ETH) is very high. Therefore, the crypto user believes that \u201cno ETH killer will actually kill ETH.\u201d\n\nVarious members of the community chimed in and gave their thoughts on the issue. From pointing out that the so-called ETH killers did not deliver on promises to suggesting dropping the term \u201cETH killer\u201d altogether, crypto community members discussed the future of ETH killers.\n\nCommunity member commenting on the topic. Source: Reddit\n\nOne community member argued that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as an Ethereum killer.\u201d The Reddit user believes that there\u2019s only Ethereum, and then there\u2019s the rest of the layer-1 networks that fight for the remaining market share of the layer-1 market.\n\nRedditor comparing 2018 to the recent cycle. Source: Reddit\n\nOne Redditor argued that the term ETH killer should be dropped because at this point, \u201cETH has become entrenched.\u201d The community member believes that while ETH can still be dethroned, it cannot be killed. \u201cAt that stage, the whole market would have to be wiped out which is also a statistical unlikelihood,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRelated: Solana Labs co-founder: We don\u2019t want to kill \u2018beautiful\u2019 Ethereum\n\nWhile many of the arguments are pro-Ethereum, some still believe that things can still go south for the network. A community member said that the idea that ETH \u201cwill never fail is ridiculous.\u201d The Reddit user argued that ETH\u2019s adoption doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a done deal, as many argued that the space is still in its early stages. They added:\n\n\u201cWe are either early and it\u2019s way too premature to call absolute certainties or it\u2019s done and we are no longer early.\u201d\n\nAs others contributed serious arguments to the discussion, some joined in to add a touch of humor to the somehow heated online debate. One community member posted, \u201cEthereum is the true Ethereum killer killer,\u201d while another said, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill ETH makes ETH stronger.\u201d\n\nThe discussion came a few days after Solana, one of the most recognized Ethereum killer blockchains, suffered another issue on its network. On Feb. 25, Solana faced a slowdown in block production, leading to a network restart. The incident led to various disruptions in user transactions. The issue also sparked outrage on Twitter, with some mocking the network and calling it a \u201ctransaction killer.\u201d"

        "title": "Smart Contracts on Ethereum - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Smart contracts are programs that run on their own and can be executed on a blockchain. These contracts are intended to automate the execution of contractual agreements, and their application cases are rapidly expanding.\n\nThis article will look at the applications and limitations of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform on which developers can create decentralized applications (DApps). It is a decentralized, open-source platform for developing smart contracts and other blockchain-based applications.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain enables code execution in a trustless, decentralized environment.\n\nWhat Are Smart Contracts?\n\nSmart contracts are computer programs that operate on a blockchain like Ethereum. They are intended to automatically carry out the terms of an agreement without the use of intermediaries.\n\nSmart contracts are secure, transparent, and immutable, making them an excellent solution for a wide range of business applications.\n\nSmart Contract Use Cases on Ethereum\n\nSupply Chain Administration\n\nSmart contracts can be used to manage supply chains by automating product tracking and verification as it moves through the chain. The movement of products can be tracked transparently using smart contracts, and the authenticity of products can be verified at each stage of the supply chain.\n\nServices in Finance\n\nSmart contracts have the potential to be used in financial services, such as insurance and lending. Smart contracts can be used to automate claim and loan processing, reducing the time and cost associated with these processes.\n\nProperty Management\n\nSmart contracts can be used to automate the buying and selling of property in the real estate industry. Smart contracts can be used to manage the transfer of ownership, the transfer of funds, and other real estate transaction processes.\n\nGaming\n\nIn the gaming industry, smart contracts can be used to provide transparency and fairness in online gaming. Smart contracts can be used to manage gaming assets and enforce game rules.\n\nSwitching Tokens\n\nA simple and one of the most common use cases for smart contracts is token switching.\n\nSmart contracts allow users to create liquidity pools with token pairs. Subsequently, investors can use them to switch one token for another. The standard way of operations is that as one begins to increase in terms of volume, the price of the other token will follow. This is done as a way of stabilizing the pool\u2019s value.\n\nToken switching is a valuable tool for day traders who want to gain access to a coin or token which isn\u2019t available on their exchanges of choice.\n\nFlash Loans\n\nWith flash loan technology, investors can instantly borrow and speculate on token prices. In fact, the key feature of a flash loan is that whoever is borrowing, returns that very same amount and the loan fees in under a minute or one block transaction (however, smart contracts can have different time frames coded in).\n\nBy using this technology, investors found a rather unique way of playing the crypto markets as they can speculate by buying a coin in their preferred platforms and selling it on a different one. If everything runs its course, day traders can effectively pocket the difference and thus profit, or even use a trading bot to do so.\n\nWhile becoming rarer, flash loans are still a great tool in the crypto universe.\n\nApplications That Are Decentralized\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts can be used to create decentralized applications (DApps). These applications can be used to automate a variety of business processes, including supply chain management and financial services.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts Have Limitations\n\nComplexity\n\nSmart contracts can be complex and difficult to write. Even experienced developers can struggle to write smart contracts that are secure and free of bugs. This complexity can lead to errors that attackers can exploit.\n\nImmutability\n\nSmart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once they are deployed. This can be a limitation if the smart contract contains a bug or vulnerability. If a bug is discovered after the smart contract has been deployed, it cannot be resolved without the creation of a new contract.\n\nCost\n\nThe deployment and execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain can be costly. The cost of deploying a smart contract is determined by the contract's complexity and the current gas prices on the Ethereum network.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability issues on the Ethereum blockchain may limit the number of smart contracts that can be executed on the network. This can result in high transaction fees and long processing times.\n\nLegacy System Integration\n\nSmart contracts may be difficult to integrate with legacy systems, limiting their adoption in some industries. Businesses may need to modify their existing systems in order to use smart contracts, which can be costly and time-consuming.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain's smart contracts are a powerful tool for automating business processes, but they have limitations. Some of the limitations that businesses must consider when using smart contracts are their complexity, immutability, cost, scalability challenges, and integration with legacy systems.\n\nDespite these limitations, smart contract use cases on the Ethereum blockchain are expanding, and the benefits of using smart contracts can outweigh their drawbacks. Some of these limitations are likely to be addressed as the Ethereum network evolves and improves.\n\nFor example, Ethereum 2.0, which is currently being rolled out, aims to address the current Ethereum network's scalability issues.\n\nFinally, smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain have a diverse set of applications for businesses looking to automate their processes. However, businesses must be aware of smart contract limitations, such as their complexity, immutability, cost, scalability issues, and integration with legacy systems.\n\nBusinesses can make informed decisions about how to use this technology to improve their operations by understanding the benefits and limitations of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Today: The market is trading in red today, as most of the significant coins see a decline. Investors are currently exercising caution when it comes to investing in riskier assets, primarily due to concerns surrounding mounting macroeconomic issues, which have been exacerbated by higher-than-anticipated inflation rates.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stands at 1.07 trillion USD, a decrease of 0.36% over the past day. The total crypto market volume in the last 24 hours increased by 28.36% and is currently at 45.38 billion USD.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) decreases by 0.51%\n\nThe second largest crypto, Ethereum price today dropped by 0.51% in the last 24 hours. The market cap for Ethereum is 199.31 billion USD. Moreover, trading volume increases by 14.87% over the previous 24 hours. Each ETH token is trading for 1,628 USD, holding on to the support level of 1600. Source: coinmarketcap\n\nA step further to Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Sepolia testnet, Ethereum\u2019s second test network, has successfully replicated withdrawals of staked ether (ETH), marking a significant step towards the highly anticipated Shanghai Upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain. This upgrade, which was triggered at epoch 56832, allows validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer and introduces new features to the execution and consensus layers.\n\nOnce implemented, the Shanghai Upgrade will signify Ethereum\u2019s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network, enabling validators to withdraw rewards earned from adding or approving blocks to the blockchain. The announcement of the live and finalized Shapella network on the Sepolia testnet was shared by Ethereum developers and clients on Twitter. The next upgrade will occur on the Goerli testnet, followed by the mainnet, ultimately finalizing the Shanghai upgrade."

        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum With Liquid Staking - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Discover the easy and secure way to stake Ethereum and earn rewards while supporting the network\u2019s security.\n\nIn 2022, the Ethereum blockchain transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.\n\nProof of stake is common in crypto and involves validators \u201cstaking\u201d \u2014 or depositing \u2014 their cryptocurrency on a blockchain to help secure the network. In return, they\u2019re eligible to receive a share of newly minted coins. The sticking point in Ethereum, however, is that each individual can only deposit Ethereum tokens (ETH) in 32-ETH increments (around $52,000 as of February 2023) to participate. That is a lot of capital to lock up indefinitely!\n\nThat\u2019s where liquid staking comes in. Essentially, liquid staking services give you derivative tokens in exchange for your ETH. The service stakes the ETH on your behalf and generates a yield; it takes a percentage of any rewards as a commission. In the meantime, you can use the derivative tokens, which simulate ETH, to generate additional income through decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Thus, you have the best of both worlds. Or, you might say, you can have your stake and ETH it too!\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Liquid Staking Platform\n\nLiquid staking is popular. Here are the most-used liquid staking platforms:\n\nName of Platform Tokens APR* Market Share** Lido stETH 4.8% 75% Coinbase cbETH 3.89% 16% Rocket Pool rETH 7.4% or 4.86% 5.5% Stakewise sETH2, reTH 5.68% 1.3% Frax Finance frxETH, sfrxETH 7.39% 1.1%\n\n*Annual Percentage Rate: As of Monday, Feb. 6. Note that these values change frequently.\n\n**Sourced from Dune Analytics and @ThorHartvigsen\n\nLido : Built by Ethereum veterans, Lido has become by far the most popular liquid staking platform, capturing nearly 75% of the market. While its liquidity is an attractive feature, its popularity poses centralization risks . Lido\u2019s stETH token tracks ETH 1:1 and offers an APR of 4.8% before charging a relatively standard commission of 10% on your earnings. (For example, if you stake 100 ETH, you can hypothetically earn 4.8 ETH and pay 0.48 ETH in commission for a net yield of 4.32 ETH. )\n\nCoinbase : As the largest crypto exchange, it is little surprise that Coinbase quickly shot up to second position despite being a newer entrant into liquid ETH staking. It offers the lowest reward (3.89% APR) and the highest commission (25%) on this list. Moreover, unlike many competitors, it takes custody of users\u2019 private keys during the staking process. Despite these issues for individuals, Coinbase is well-placed to capitalize on any increase in institutional capital in the space.\n\nRocket Pool : The ability for users to run their own nodes makes Rocket Pool arguably the most decentralized option on this list. For those willing to put up 16 ETH, it offers a high 7.4% APR, but you can also get started with just 0.01 ETH for a 4.86% APR. At 15%, its commission is on the higher side.\n\nStakewise : What distinguishes Stakewise is its dual-token model. It offers sETH in exchange for the staked token and rETH for staking rewards. The model has interesting applications, such as easily utilizing your rewards without affecting the principal, but the accompanying complexity is often challenging for new users. It offers 5.68% APR with a 10% commission.\n\nFrax Finance: Frax has recently enjoyed rapid growth thanks to its high APR (7.39%). The catch? It uses a complicated mechanism that newcomers to DeFi might find challenging. The process also involves two tokens \u2014 users first need to deposit ETH to mint the stablecoin frxETH and then swap it for sfrxETH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Ethereum Wallet\n\nOnce you\u2019ve zeroed in on your choice of platform, the next step is hooking up an Ethereum wallet. If you don\u2019t have one yet, we recommend MetaMask, the most widely used Ethereum wallet in the world (30 million users as of March 2022), which works across both smartphones and home computers.\n\nTo get started, download the app for Android, iOS, or Chrome, and follow the instructions to set up an account. Then load up your wallet with some ETH by pressing \u201cBuy ETH\u201d on the home screen of your wallet.\n\nSource\n\nThis will open a screen where you must select your region, the token you wish to buy (select Ethereum), the amount, and your payment method, which will vary depending on where you live. After you fill in these details, you will be asked to select a provider. If you have never used one, you must complete a KYC process.\n\nUpon completing the transaction, your MetaMask wallet should display an updated balance.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the good part.\n\nStep 3: Use Liquid Staking to Put Your ETH to Work\n\nFor this article, we will be completing the process with Lido. Even if you choose a different provider, you should find the steps below helpful.\n\na) Go to the Ethereum Section of the Lido website, and click \u201cStake Ethereum.\u201d\n\nb) Go to \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d and select your wallet. For this article, we\u2019ll assume it\u2019s MetaMask.\n\nc) Your wallet will prompt you to connect to the Lido website. Select your wallet and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nd) Select the amount of ETH you want to stake and click \u201cSubmit.\u201d (Note: You will have to keep a small amount of ETH to cover gas fees.)\n\ne) Click \u201cConfirm.\u201d The confirmation screen should appear after a few seconds.\n\nSuccess!\n\nStep 4: Use Your Liquid Tokens\n\nIf you complete these transactions, you can put these tokens to work and earn an additional yield, which can exceed 4% APR. There are various DeFi applications for your liquid tokens, such as using them as collateral to get loans on Aave or lending them on Maker. If the exchange rate for your liquid token suddenly shoots up in value, you can even sell it, although you\u2019d give up your claim on the staked ETH and lose your deposit. According to Lido, the most popular way of utilizing stETH is by providing liquidity on Curve. You can read more about possible use cases here.\n\nStep 5: Exchange Your Liquid Tokens for ETH\n\nRedeeming your ETH is usually a straightforward process. Aside from Lido, the other platforms host a mechanism to convert your liquid token back into ETH. Lido recommends you do the exchange on Curve or Balancer. Remember that the amount you get depends on the exchange rate!\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are bullish on Ethereum, liquid staking seems like a no-brainer. It allows you to get paid while you wait for the price to (perhaps) increase. However, there are several complexities here to consider. For instance, the exchange rate of your liquidity token could increase or decrease significantly. Moreover, these are also largely unregulated markets, so you need to carefully study the underlying structure and the team before committing significant amounts of your capital."

        "content": "Action Mounts on Goerli ETH Despite Switch to Holli Testnet\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nMarkets\n\nThe Goerli testnet may have given way to a new one, but that hasn\u2019t stopped traders from speculating on the price of Goerli ETH.\n\nOn Sunday, Polygon\u2019s Mudit Gupta flagged that GoETH were trading for $0.69 each. Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, shared data showing that users traded $1.5M worth of GoETH over 24 hours.\n\nThis despite the fact that Ethereum\u2019s devs are transitioning away from the Goerli network to a new testnet called Holli.\n\n\u201cTestnet Ether is supposed to be free but is being marked up by speculators,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cKeyboard warriors will tell you that the developers are buying it but no, they are not. Maye 0.1% are buying for consumption.\u201d\n\nExperiment With Code\n\nGoerli is a testnet used by developers to experiment with code before launching to the public on the Ethereum mainnet. GoETH is used to pay for transactions of the testnet.\n\nGoETH was initially freely distributed to users via \u201cfaucets,\u201d websites that issue coins to users without charge. However, developers resorted to purchasing testnet coins amid a shortage last year. Without GoETH, devs cannot experiment on the test network, posing a threat to innovation on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGupta launched a faucet that distributed 6M GoETH for free. The coins he distributed would be worth $4M at current prices.\n\nDenali Marsh, a blockchain engineer for Kava Labs, said he bought 10 GoETH for testing last week.\n\n\u201cI tried every faucet including yours, but swapping was the only way to get the amount I needed quickly,\u201d Marsh tweeted. \u201cSpeculation on public utilities is gross but the market drives solutions.\u201d\n\nGupta replied that monetizing testnet coins offers a short-term solution, but lamented that people have not invested the same resources into solving the underlying problem they\u2019ve spent on devising methods to profit from it.\n\nThe GoETH speculation comes despite Ethereum\u2019s devs making plans to abandon the test network. \u201cY\u2019all know [Goerli is] deprecated and soon to be fully unsupported testnet right?\u201d Adams tweeted.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nDifferent Strategies\n\nOn Feb 24, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that a new testnet, Holli, will launch later this year to replace Goerli.\n\n\u201cOver the years, application developers\u2019 usage of testnets grew exponentially,\u201d Beiko said. \u201cThe distribution methods for GoETH (informal allocations + easy-to-game faucets) became less and less reliable, leading to the current issues around acquiring GoETH.\u201d\n\nBeiko said Ethereum\u2019s devs are considering different strategies for issuing test tokens on Holli, urging community members to reach out with suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to fix live testnets, but fairly easy to set up the next ones with better starting conditions,\u201d Beiko said. \u201cIf you have strong opinions about this, now\u2019s a good time to make them heard.\u201d"

        "content": "What does Ethereum need to be better? According to its founder, it\u2019s all about the user experience. And on February 28th, Vitalik Buterin talked about the many issues in the Ethereum network that need to be fixed before truly solving that particular one.\n\nVitalik explained in his blog that he faced many inconveniences while using the Ethereum network to process payments due to high transaction fees, which sometimes ended up costing more than the product he wanted to pay for.\n\nVitalik\u2019s Issues with ETH Date Back to 2021\n\nVitalik recalled that his troubles with Ethereum payments date back to 2021 when he visited Argentina and tried to pay for tea. To his surprise, the 0.003 ETH transaction was not accepted, perhaps because it was below the exchange\u2019s minimum deposit of 0.01 ETH.\n\nDespite this, Vitalik decided to send the 0.007 ETH needed to complete this transaction. This represented a three-fold overpayment of the product\u2019s price, but he did not give importance to that fee and chose to think about it as a simple tip, realizing that it was an error that needed to be worked on to improve the user experience.\n\nIn 2022, he learned that things didn\u2019t change that much. Vitalik tried to pay for tea again at another place. Gas fees prevented him from using his ETH this time, as the transaction was not processed because the receiving contract \u201crequired extra gas to process the transfer.\u201d\n\nThose bad experiences served as a lesson for him to understand that \u201csimple-and-robust UIs are better than fancy-and-sleek ones.\u201d He also learned that many users do not even know what gas limits they need to process their transactions, so default values should be improved.\n\nPayment Delays Can Be Irritating for Many Users\n\nVitalik also complained about the \u201csurprisingly long time delay between my transactions,\u201d which has been irritating, as there is always the doubt of who is to blame when transactions are not confirmed quickly.\n\n\u201cSometimes, a transaction would get accepted in a few seconds, but other times, it would take minutes or even hours.\u201d\n\nHe added that although the team has worked to improve these issues with the EIP-1559 update, which ensures that most transactions are accepted in the next block, there is always the risk of things not working perfectly because \u201coutliers still remain.\u201d\n\nFor example, if many people make transactions at the same time, there is a risk that the network will experience a spike in fees, resulting in the rejection of many transactions. This problem can cause significant money losses even for the most expert users, as \u201cwallet UIs suck at showing this.\u201d\n\nBrave wallet deployed a workaround for this problem. The team listened to his suggestions and increased the maximum base fee from 12.5% to 33%, improving both the interface and the user experience.\n\nButerin ended his statement by indicating that, especially in Southern countries, many people choose centralized solutions instead of decentralized alternatives because of how outdated the applications are regarding user experience.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum Merge helped speed up the average time to process transactions, there is still a lot to correct to achieve the global adoption that crypto enthusiasts dream of."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 9.8% between Feb. 19 and Feb. 25 after the price resistance at $1,725 proved stronger than expected. Still, the correction was insufficient to break the six-week-long ascending channel and did not cause Ether derivatives metrics to turn bearish.\n\nEther (ETH) price index in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s price resilience can be partially explained by the operational failure of some of its smart contract blockchain competitors. For instance, Solana (SOL) faced a 20-hour-long outage on Feb. 25, which was only resolved after a network upgrade coordinated by validators. The network restart also involved purging some of the latest slots, although Solana developers said that \"no confirmed user transactions were rolled back or impacted.\"\n\nNEM (XEM) experienced a \u201cchain halt\u201d on Feb. 27 that lasted for 15 hours, causing multiple exchanges to halt deposits and withdrawals, and developers promised to release an update to prevent further misbehavior. Curiously, the latest post from the official NEM account on Twitter, excluding a Merry Christmas greeting, was a \u201cPlease Stand By\u201d image posted in July.\n\nThe regulatory environment remains shady for cryptocurrencies, and the latest victims were global payment processing companies Visa and Mastercard. According to a Feb. 28 Reuters report, the firms are delaying the launch of new partnerships with crypto companies until market conditions improve and a more transparent regulatory framework is established.\n\nIn more positive news, Ethereum's Sepolia testnet was successfully hard forked on Feb. 28 in preparation for the Shanghai upgrade. The much-anticipated mainnet update expected for March should finally allow validators to withdraw their staked Ether from the Beacon Chain. Developers are now prepping the Goerli testnet to enter a similar stage.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,560 support retest on Feb. 25 has impacted crypto investors' sentiment.\n\nETH futures show increased demand for leverage longs\n\nThe annualized two-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (backwardation) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders became slightly bullish as the Ether futures premium (on average) flirted with the 5% threshold on Feb. 26. More importantly, it shows resilience even as Ether price declined by nearly 10% between Feb. 19 and Feb. 25.\n\nThe increased demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of positive price action. Consequently, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions risk metrics show resilience despite a 10% price slide\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin says 'more still needs to be done' over high Ethereum txn fees\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 9% level on Feb. 27, signaling stress from professional traders. However, the situation improved on Feb. 28 as the index moved to 5 \u2014 indicating a similar upside and downside risk appetite.\n\nIt makes sense for fundamental analysts to avoid adding bullish positions ahead of the Shanghai upgrade, especially since Ethereum developers have a history of delaying significant network changes.\n\nDespite the range of concerning factors, options and futures markets signal that pro traders are conservatively bullish and trust that the ascending pattern will hold. From a technical analysis standpoint, investors appear to believe that the bullish trend will continue unless Ether breaks below the channel support at $1,520.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "'Account abstraction' supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For years, Bitcoiners have repeated the mantra \u201cbe your own bank.\u201d But in truth, storing any type of crypto in a wallet has been a lot closer to stuffing cash under your mattress than to a complex financial institution like a bank.\n\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s an improvement in that crypto can be transferred across the globe in minutes and it\u2019s secured with cryptography \u2014 but it\u2019s also a lot less user-friendly than a bank and doesn\u2019t offer anywhere near as many features.\n\nYour crypto could be stolen in a $5 wrench attack. You could lose the seed phrase and your funds forever. And that\u2019s if you were technically minded enough to even figure out the complicated process of setting up a wallet in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s all set to change with the surprise announcement at WalletCon in Denver this week of \u201csmart accounts,\u201d also known as \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d on Ethereum \u2014 and every other chain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (the EVM is the software responsible for executing Ethereum-based smart contracts).\n\n\n\nChains that can now take advantage of smart accounts include Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche and Gnosis Chain.\n\nYears in the making, the new ERC-4337 standard transforms a crypto wallet into something with all the features of a real bank.\n\n\u201cIt gives you the same features a bank would without having to trust a bank,\u201d says Ethereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss, who was one of the co-authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) alongside Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is a way to appeal to the next billion users.\u201d\n\nThe benefits include two-factor authentication, signing transactions on your phone, the setting of monthly spending limits on an account, the use of session keys to play blockchain games without constantly having to approve transactions, decentralized recovery of wallets; smart accounts can be configured to autopay bills and subscriptions \u2014 the list goes on.\n\n\n\nLedger co-founder Nicolas Bacca tells Magazine he\u2019s hugely impressed with the technology\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction will completely change the crypto user experience,\u201d he says.\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nWhat does account abstraction mean?\n\nAccount abstraction is a complicated technical term for something that is actually incredibly user-friendly. Weiss and zkSync hope to replace it with the more descriptive term \u201csmart accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is a confusing term,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cThe accounts are abstracted from the network; they are not abstracted from the user. The user is using a very concrete wallet that does very specific things. From the user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not account abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s more like using a smart account.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlex Jupiter, senior product manager at MetaMask, says \u201caccount abstraction\u201d means different things to different developers.\n\n\n\nIn part, that\u2019s due to the fact that non-EVM scaling solutions, including StarkWare and zkSync, have implemented a modified version of ERC-4337 in the protocol itself, while Ethereum implements the standard on top of it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would\u2019t say Ethereum came up with a workaround that\u2019s not quite as good,\u201d Weiss explains. \u201cWe came up with a standard that can work everywhere, focusing on interoperability and defragmentation, and it can be implemented more efficiently at the protocol level, for example, by rollups.\u201d\n\n\n\nA variety of EIPs to add smart accounts to the protocol have been suggested but would have required a hard fork and did not get enough support, as they\u2019d take attention away from more important upgrades, such as the Merge.\n\nThe native implementations upgrade all user accounts to smart accounts, while Ethereum\u2019s new standard requires users to set up a new account. Weiss explains there will inevitably be a hard fork in future to enable the upgrading of all accounts, but \u201cit\u2019ll take a long time to get there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction is extremely powerful.\n\n\n\nHere are a few of the things you can do to make the most of it: pic.twitter.com/jWavGLzBhE \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) February 25, 2023\n\nWhat are the benefits of smart accounts?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits for adoption is that it allows new users to onboard into the decentralized world of crypto without ever having to worry about complicated seed phrases or understand the technical process of setting up a wallet.\n\n\n\nThey can simply open a smart account via a smartphone app using a fingerprint or face scanner.\n\nWhile there are plenty of crypto wallets currently available as smartphone apps, they come with numerous security risks and are unsuitable for holding larger amounts of cryptocurrency due to the risk of hacks. But because smart accounts enable the cryptographic keys to be stored on the phone\u2019s hardware security module, phone wallets can now be almost as safe as a hardware wallet.\n\nMagazine tries out the onboarding process for noobs at StarkWare Sessions in Tel Aviv, Israel where gaming wallet Cartridge is handing out limited edition Briq NFTs.\n\n\n\nThe whole process takes less than 30 seconds and is completely intuitive. Users scan a QR code, choose a username, and then create a passkey using the phone\u2019s fingerprint scanner.\n\nExisting crypto users will need to reconceptualize what they thought a crypto wallet was and how to access it. The noncustodial Cartridge Controller is actually a web-based wallet that interacts with StarkNet. Instead of private keys, it makes use of Android or Apple \u201cPasskeys,\u201d which are both based on the WebAuthn standard, an intiative to standardize user authentication for web apps using public-key crytography.\n\nThe Cartridge stand at StarkWare Sessions. Source: Twitter\n\nWhile a web wallet sounds like a scary proposition to long-term crypto users, Bacca is impressed with Cartridge\u2019s implementation and says Ledger is building a similar web-based wallet that he says is secure thanks to WebAuthn.\n\nUsing a smartphone as a hardware wallet\n\nThere are a couple of catches to using a smartphone as a hardware wallet. The larger screen on a smartphone still presents a security risk, as it can be hacked to trick users into approving transactions.\n\n\n\nHowever, this risk can be mitigated, as smart accounts enable users to set permissions requiring two-factor authentication for higher value transactions (using a hardware wallet, for example) or to set a daily, monthly or yearly spending limit from the account.\n\nBacca says Ledger is experimenting with this functionality now. \u201cSo, for example, you could use your phone when you only want to do a small purchase or you could use your hardware wallet when you want to do a bigger purchase, and this can be scripted in the account,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are prototyping a web application for that.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bigger problem for using a smartphone wallet on Ethereum is that the security module uses a different cryptographic signing system (elliptic curve) than crypto. With smart accounts, the two systems can finally talk to each other, but it requires a lot of work and a lot of gas.\n\nMotty Lavie, founder of StarkNet\u2019s smartphone-based Braavos Wallet, explains it takes 240,000 computational steps to take advantage of the smartphone security module:\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Ethereum, to implement that, each transaction would be very, very costly. On StarkNet, this is a marginal cost that\u2019ll add a few cents to the transaction, which makes it viable.\u201d\n\n\n\nLudicrously high gas fees are a problem unique to Ethereum, however, and gas costs are more than low enough on all the other EVM blockchains and layer 2s for smartphone wallets to work just fine. Various teams are also working on gas-optimized versions of the process and, longer term, a precompile could be added to Ethereum, making the process a cheap EVM operation rather than a smart contract. (A precompiled contract carries out common cryptographic functions without using a lot of bandwidth.)\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen these wallets gain traction and users get used to this great usability, it\u2019ll be easier to promote this change in Ethereum itself,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cIf we can add this precompile, it\u2019ll be a game-changer for the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nHow to recover your account\n\nFor crypto users who don\u2019t trust the cloud, smart accounts also provide other recovery options than a seed phrase.\n\n\n\nIf a user loses their phone, time-locked social recovery means a group of trusted friends or even a commercial service can help them recover it without putting the enclosed funds at risk.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever expect to lose access [to a bank account] because if you lose your password you can always call your bank, they will verify your identity and reset your password,\u201d Weiss explains.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you can actually use a recovery service that lets you reset the password for your mobile phone \u2014 your wallet \u2014 but they cannot steal your wallet; they can only help you recover it.\u201d\n\nMotty Lavie, co-founder of Braavos Wallet at StarkWare Sessions. Source: Twitter\n\nBraavos employs a version of a time-locked recovery process that involves creating a seed phrase. Unlike normal seed phrases, this one can only put in a request to regain access to the account after four days.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow the benefit here is that if your phone indeed gets lost or wrecked or whatever, then, you can get control on your account back in four days.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if an attacker stole your seed, then you would automatically get notified that someone has got control over your account,\u201d he adds, noting that\u2019s plenty of time to withdraw the funds before the hacker can get them.\n\n\n\nBraavos is also working toward using zero-knowledge proofs to put the seed phrase \u201cunder the hood\u201d so that the user can just interact with a decentralized \u201cforgot password\u201d-style prompt.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that will be a major move in terms of UX [user experience],\u201d he says.\n\nBlockchain gaming smart wallet\n\nBacca explains that Ledger is already working along with Argent and Cartridge on \u201cplugins\u201d that enable gamers in StarkWare to set a session key, enabling numerous low-value transactions to go through automatically so they don\u2019t have to painstakingly approve each one.\n\n\u201cYou could load a small piece of code to your account so it will modify the way it\u2019s acting with a specific game. So, you could say, \u2018If I am going to play that game\u2026\u2019 actions can be signed automatically for one hour,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking that account abstraction will completely change the crypto user experience.\u201d\n\nHappy to join the builders' council with chief strangeness officer @sylvechv and team \u2013 let's get this party open, decentralized and secure for all. More details https://t.co/7WUCrgCDwZ https://t.co/CNPNa1dLtM \u2014 Nicolas Bacca (@BTChip) December 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an added bonus, smart accounts mean the game developer could decide to become the \u201cpaymaster\u201d and cover the cost of the transaction fees to encourage use.\n\n\n\nTransactions can also be bundled together to save on gas fees, explains Jupiter. \u201cLike a shopping cart scenario, I\u2019m going to reserve these 10 items and then pay for them all at once,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nMetaMask is building a new addition called Snaps that will crowdsource development of new features for the wallet. This will likely enable innovative uses of smart accounts that nobody\u2019s even thought of yet. A Snap that enables smart accounts was built at ETH India where it won \u201cBest ERC-4337 Tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nSmart accounts make crypto subscriptions possible\n\nBack in December, Visa\u2019s crypto research team published a paper demonstrating how smart accounts on StarkWare can be used to pay \u0430 mortgage, TV subscription and utility bills automatically from self-custodial crypto wallets.\n\n\n\nThey gave a hypothetical example of someone who wants to go on holidays and have their bills paid automatically from their crypto wallet, after they get paid in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\n\nYou can already do this from bank accounts of course, or via a custodial wallet, but both require trusting a centralized service. The paper explains that the difficulty doing it on Ethereum is because it has two types of accounts: user accounts (also known as externally owned accounts, or EOAs) and smart contract accounts.\n\n\n\n\u201cA user account, controlled by a private key, can send transactions,\u201d explains Visa Crypto. \u201cA smart contract has associated code that can be executed, however, a smart contract cannot initiate transactions on its own. Transactions must always originate from a user account and be signed by the user.\u201d\n\nVisa Crypto designed a method to autopay bills from crypto accounts. Source: Visa\n\n\n\nSo, if you get paid in crypto every two weeks, you have to manually initiate \u201cpush\u201d transactions to pay each bill after funds are deposited into your wallet.\n\n\n\nSmart accounts make \u201cpull\u201d payments, initiated by a biller, possible. So, for example, an electricity company could set up an auto payment smart contract on its website and list out its functions \u2014 e.g., it will only initiate one transaction per month and set a maximum amount that it will charge. The user can then approve these conditional pull payments via their smart account, enabling automated bill payments after their bi-weekly pay comes in.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, crypto becomes useful for a whole host of new payment applications.\n\nBacca created the world\u2019s first Bitcoin wallet and argues that Bitcoin already lets you be your own bank. But he adds, \u201cThe problem is the lack of things you can do with your money.\u201d That\u2019s one reason he\u2019s excited about recurring payments.\n\n\n\n\u201cBasically, saying \u2018Okay, so I am buying a subscription for a service,\u2019 and then the wallet will start sending money directly matching the subscription for a given period of time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you can script your account, there are a lot more use cases that come to mind and that are similar to what we do in Web2.\u201d\n\nTimeline of Account Abstraction (Yoav Weiss)\n\nHow ERC-4337 works\n\nSome of the functionality that smart accounts enable was already available via smart contract wallets from Gnosis and Argent; however, these solutions require centralized components called relays to pay transaction fees for the operations.\n\n\n\nThe new ERC-4337 standard on Ethereum decentralizes that part as well with new decentralized infrastructure called \u201cbundlers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe process works like this: A smart wallet signs a \u201cuser operation,\u201d which gets fired to a special mempool, which is basically just an organized queue of transactions (albeit a different queue to Ethereum\u2019s normal mempool).\n\n\n\nBundlers are like miners or validators and take user operations from the mempool and deliver the desired result back to the wallet. The bundlers also pay for the gas (transaction fee) required and are compensated by the user\u2019s contract account, or by a third party known as a \u201cpaymaster.\u201d This could be a decentralized app or it could be a wallet provider.\n\n\n\nThe first production grade bundler to be deployed on mainnet is from wallet and infrastructure provider Stackup, but more will be available soon. As it\u2019s decentralized and permissionless, anyone can run a bundler."

        "content": "Smart accounts, enabled by the launch of the new ERC-4337 standard, are now available on Ethereum and are expected to help mainstream adoption by finally making crypto user friendly.\n\nEthereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss will make the surprise announcement at WalletCon in Denver today that the core contracts for ERC-4337 \u2014 known by blockchain developers as \u201caccount abstraction\u201d \u2014 have passed an audit by Open Zeppelin and will be made available on every Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network including Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche and Gnosis Chain.\n\nNew users will no longer need to learn about complicated seed phrases or the technical process of setting up a wallet to onboard into the decentralized world of crypto, Weiss told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThe next billion users are not going to write 12 words on a piece of paper. Normal people don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give them better usability, they shouldn\u2019t need to think about cryptographic keys.\u201d\n\n\"EIP-4337 is going to take a year or whatever\" - @sashaaldrick of @gelatonetwork\n\n\n\nYou're in for a big surprise \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) February 25, 2023\n\nAccount abstraction also enables the unique cryptographic keys used for cryptocurrency to be stored on standard smartphone security modules, upgrading them to de facto hardware wallets. However the screen remains a security issue compared with traditional hardware wallets and gas costs could be prohibitive on mainnet initially \u2014 although other EVM chains and Layer 2s have low enough fees to make it viable.\n\nIt also enables the use of two-factor authentication; signing transactions on your phone using a fingerprint or face-scan; the setting of monthly spending limits on an account; and the use of session keys to play blockchain games without constantly having to approve transactions.\n\nUsers who lose their phone or device can use time-locked social recovery of their account via a group of trusted friends or even a commercial service. Weiss said:\n\n\u201cIt gives you the same features a bank would without having to trust a bank.\u201d\n\nThe standard has been in development for two years with the team funded via grants from the Ethereum Foundation. While similar functionality is available on smart contract wallets from Argent and Gnosis, these solutions require centralized components called relays to pay gas fees whereas ERC-4337 decentralizes the entire system.\n\nWeiss was one of the lead authors of Etherum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4337 alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and five others. He said Buterin had first posted about the concept nine years ago \"before Ethereum even launched, it has taken us this long to get here.\"\n\nThere have been numerous proposals to enable account abstraction prior to this but all required a difficult hard fork of Ethereum, and took a back seat to more pressing upgrades like the Merge. ERC-4337 is an alternate approach that makes use of decentralized infrastructure called \u201cbundlers.\u201d\n\nYour guide to why 'smart accounts' are the hottest thing in crypto right now and will help bring about mainstream adoption.\n\n\n\nThey are the key upgrade enabled by Ethereum's new 'account abstraction' ERC-4337 standard that's being launched today. https://t.co/vFoKhdv4Cl \u2014 Cointelegraph Magazine (@CointelegraphZN) March 1, 2023\n\nIn very simple terms, the process works like this: a smart wallet signs a \u201cuser operation\u201d which gets fired to a special mempool, which is basically just an organized queue of transactions (albeit a different queue than Ethereum\u2019s normal mempool).\n\nBundlers are like miners or validators, taking user operations from the mempool and delivering the desired result back to the wallet. The bundlers also pay for the gas (transaction fee) required and are compensated by the user\u2019s contract account or by a third party known as a \u201cpaymaster.\u201d This could be a decentralized application (DApp) or it could be a wallet provider.\n\nThe first production grade bundler to be deployed on mainnet is from wallet and infrastructure provider Stackup, but more will be available soon. \u201cIt\u2019s permissionless; anyone can run a bundler,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s not censorable.\u201d\n\nSmart accounts, or account abstraction, is shaping up as a key theme for crypto in 2023. The technology has already been incorporated natively into zk-Rollup layer 2 solutions from StarkWare and zkSync and Visa designed an automated crypto bill payment system that makes use of it.\n\nRelated: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, tweeted this week that an added advantage of account abstraction is that projects can use plain and easily understood language to onboard new users rather than arcane technical terms.\n\n\u201cBecause the contract handles the esoteric blockchain stuff, you don\u2019t have to use words like \u2018gas\u2019 or \u2018nonce\u2019 to accurately describe what\u2019s happening. This is a huge win for crypto adoption and security.\u201d"

        "content": "In a new blog post published on Feb. 28, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin documented the continued need to improve the network to better facilitate Ether (ETH) as a means of payment.\n\nButerin shared how he tried to pay for tea for himself and friends at a coffee shop in Argentina in 2021 but had to pay 0.01 ETH (around $40 at the time), as that was the minimum deposit for the owner\u2019s exchange account. \u201cI did not mind the 3x overpayment and treated it as a tip,\u201d the co-founder wrote.\n\nIn another instance, Buterin explained how he tried to pay for tea at another location in 2022, but two separate transactions failed due to requiring \u201cextra gas to process the transfer\u201d and a UI glitch in his mobile wallet. Buterin also raised the issue of unpredictable transaction times, writing:\n\n\u201cMany times, there has been a surprisingly long time delay between my transaction getting accepted on-chain, and the service acknowledging the transaction, even as \u2018unconfirmed.\u2019 Some of those times, I definitely got worried that there was some glitch with the payment system on their side.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, outliers nevertheless remain on the Ethereum network despite recent improvements. \u201cIf you send a transaction at the same time as when many others are sending transactions and the base fee is spiking up, you risk the base fee going too high and your transaction not getting accepted,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven worse, wallet UIs suck at showing this. There are no big red flashing alerts, and very little clear indication of what you\u2019re supposed to do to solve this problem.\u201d Buterin added that even experts could be confused about how to speed up transactions in such cases.\n\n\u201cGood user experience is not about the average case, it is about the worst case. A UI that is clean and sleek, but does some weird and unexplainable thing 0.723% of the time that causes big problems, is worse than a UI that exposes more gritty details to the user but at least makes it easier to understand what\u2019s going on and fix any problem that does arise.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues, Buterin raised the problem of the internet being \u201cnot 100% reliable\u201d and the need for possible offline proof that customers indeed transfered their transaction data directly to the merchant. Another issue raised was \u201closing a small amount of BTC and ETH\u201d due to secret-sharing-based off-chain social recovery methods for wallets, which Buterin deemed as fragile.\n\nAccording to YCharts, Ethereum transaction fees have fallen to an average of $0.656 at the time of publication, which is much lower than the average of $20 witnessed during the peak of the crypto bull market in 2021.\n\n\u201cAlong with the all-important issue of high transaction fees due to scaling not yet being fully solved, user experience is a key reason why many Ethereum users, especially in the Global South, often opt for centralized solutions instead of on-chain decentralized alternatives that keep power in the hands of the user and their friends and family or local community.\u201d"

But price momentum will need to be matched with strengthening fundamentals in what is likely to be a volatile year for risk assets. As we expand coverage to L1 assets, markers for adoption and protocol monetary policy will be paramount.

        "content": "The Ethereum Sepolia Testnet was successful as validators geared up for the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nThe Georli Testnet is next but Vitalik said there is more work to be done.\n\nAs the Shanghai Upgrade inched closer, Ethereum [ETH] developers successfully deployed the Sepolia Testnet on the blockchain. The Sepolia, the second Testnet, finalized its checkpoint at 56830 while the epoch activated at 56832. Also, several Ethereum developers confirmed that the Georli Testnet would be next before the final upgrade.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe developers used the Testnet to simulate the staking withdrawal activity that would eventually happen with the Shanghai Upgrade on the Ethereum Mainnet. And, as soon as Georli is announced successful, validators who staked 32 ETH and above can withdraw their rewards.\n\nIt is noteworthy to reference that Ethereum also passed through similar stages of Testnets before the success of the Merge in 2022.\n\nAmbush on the road to Shanghai\n\nAt one point, the validator count decreased significantly around the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the number of addresses holding 32 ETH and more improved from the downturn of January. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the addresses slightly decreased to 129,364 as of 25 February. This metric describes the Ethereum externally owned address qualified for validating on ETH 2.0.\n\nWhile the drop might have signaled a lack of interest, the on-chain analytic platform revealed only minimal voluntary validator exit. Between 10 \u2013 26 February, the number of departures was only 20 among the hundreds of thousands.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been fluctuations in the participation rate since the Ethereum Foundation confirmed the period the Shanghai Upgrade would occur.\n\nThe participation rate measures validator responsiveness while tracking the proportion of missed blocks and total slots. At press, the participation rate was 99.462%. This implied that involvement in staking was at one of its highest points since the new year began.\n\nTemporary glitches bring more work\n\nBut since the Testnet announcement, only a few reactions have come from the Ethereum community \u2014 most enthusiastic. However, the blockchain co-founder Vitalik Buterin took to his blog to share some thoughts.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAlthough unrelated to the Sepolia success, Vitalik referred to the glitches ETH wallets had in times past, as well as challenges with the User Interface (UI).\n\nHe also pointed out the previous transaction delays but noted that EIP-1559 had helped improved block stabilization time. However, he did not fail to admit that more needs to be done. The founder opined:"

        "content": "Ethereum has already seen a slowdown in its price over the past couple of days. Now, while investors mainly seem indifferent to the crypto market at the moment, some whales have taken this time to fill up their bags. This has brought their balances to a new seven-year high.\n\nEthereum Whales Go On Buying Spree\n\nSantiment reported on Tuesday that top Ethereum whales have been filing up their bags recently. These top ETH whales which are not exchange addresses added a significant sum to bring their collective total to more than 25 million ETH.\n\nInterestingly, the last time that the balances of these top 10 non-exchange addresses held this much ETH was back in 2016. Now, in 2016, when the top wallets held this much ETH, the price of the digital asset exploded over 1,000%, going from a meager $0.93 to over $12 by the time the rally was done.\n\nTop 10 non-exchange addresses now hold 25 million ETH | Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to Santiment, these whales had increased their holdings to this level over the last week. This was when the prices of digital assets in the space were beginning their descent, triggering panic in the space.\n\nAnother factor that could signal a resumption of the bull trend for ETH is the fact that the digital asset is still dominant for fee distribution. There is more ETH spent than WETH and USDC combined, which shows that the cryptocurrency is still very much dominant and front of mind for investors.\n\nBut Could ETH Face Pressure From Shanghai?\n\nIt is no longer a secret that the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is set to happen sometime in March and will reportedly enable withdraws for staked ETH. Given that there is currently over 17 million ETH worth more than $28 billion staked on the Beacon Contract, there are already expectations of a dump.\n\nETH price struggles to hold above $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nHowever, Ethereum developers have already assured the community that all of the ETH will not be available for withdrawal immediately. Perhaps a staggered withdrawal process will help to mitigate the effects of stakers who decide to sell their tokens.\n\nIt is still important to bear in mind that some of these investors have not had access to their tokens for over a year, which could lead to immediate selling once they get their hands on them. But with the price of the digital asset already down so much from its 2021 all-time high, it is possible that stakers will want to wait for better prices before selling.\n\nNevertheless, the Shanghai upgrade will no doubt have implications for the crypto market. But whether these implications will be good or bad remains to be seen. Right now, crypto investors are still neutral, dragging prices to a standstill.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Cryptorobin, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He is the founder of Cardano , one of the most popular and fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the world. Hoskinson\u2019s work has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance, bringing new ideas to the table, and developing innovative solutions that are changing the way we think about money.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, Hoskinson earned a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder. He later completed doctoral coursework in the same field at the same university, but he did not finish his Ph.D.\n\nCharles Hoskinson was born on November 5, 1987, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His parents were both teachers, and they instilled in him a love of learning and a strong work ethic from a young age. Hoskinson excelled in school, and later studied mathematics and computer science at the Metropolitan State University of Denver.\n\nCareer Proceedings\n\nHoskinson\u2019s career began in the early 2000s when he started working as a contractor for the US Department of Defense. After that, he worked for a number of other technology companies, including Factom and Ethereum, where he served as one of the co-founders.\n\nIt was during his time at Ethereum that Hoskinson became interested in the potential of blockchain technology. He quickly recognized that this new technology had the power to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.\n\nHow did Hoskison founded Cardano?\n\nIn 2015, Hoskinson founded IOHK, a technology company that specializes in blockchain development. Shortly thereafter, he began work on Cardano, a new cryptocurrency that would be built on a highly secure and scalable blockchain network.\n\nUnlike many other cryptocurrencies, Cardano was designed from the ground up to be highly flexible and adaptable. It was designed to be able to support a wide range of different applications and use cases and was built with an eye toward sustainability and long-term growth.\n\nSince its launch in 2017, Cardano has become one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the world. It is now valued at billions of dollars and is widely regarded as one of the most promising blockchain projects currently in development.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s Contributions to the Crypto Industry\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s contributions to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have been significant. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the industry, and his work has helped to advance the field in a number of key ways.\n\nOne of Hoskinson\u2019s most important contributions has been his emphasis on the importance of security and scalability in blockchain technology. Unlike some other blockchain projects, which prioritize speed and low fees over security, Hoskinson has always believed that security should be the top priority. This has led him to develop innovative solutions that make blockchain networks more secure and more resistant to hacking.\n\nAnother key contribution that Hoskinson has made to the industry has been his emphasis on interoperability. He has long believed that blockchain networks need to be able to communicate with one another in order to be truly effective, and he has worked to develop protocols and standards that make this possible."

        "title": "How Much Wash Trading Is Really Happening on Blur? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpstart marketplace Blur has risen to the top of the NFT world in recent weeks, vaulting ahead of longtime leader OpenSea through tokenized trading rewards. The cause of the surging trading volume has split opinion in the NFT space, prompting a notable Web3 analytics firm to discount much of the recent trading data from the Blur marketplace.\n\nCryptoSlam, a leading platform for tracking NFT sales, announced on Friday that it would remove $577 million worth of Blur trades from its data due to \u201cmarket manipulation.\u201d The platform also said that it will filter future Blur trades on its platform through an updated algorithm that excludes what it sees as suspicious sales.\n\nOn-chain data shows that Blur\u2019s sudden rise in NFT trading volume is primarily fueled by whales\u2014that is, traders with significant holdings of a given asset\u2014who are constantly buying and selling NFTs via the marketplace\u2019s bid pools in an effort to \u201cfarm\u201d token rewards for the next airdrop. But there\u2019s some disagreement in the space over whether that kind of DeFi-like token flipping really constitutes wash trading.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur, for its part, points to data aggregated on Dune Analytics that shows a much smaller percentage of wash trading on its platform, and CryptoSlam confirmed to Decrypt that it has expanded its methodology to denote alleged wash trades. But is this merely a quibble over semantics or a disagreement over how to interpret what\u2019s really happening right now in the rapidly changing NFT space?\n\nA changing space\n\nIn an email to subscribers on Friday, CryptoSlam explained the decision to filter out a large chunk of the recent Blur trading data. The platform said that about 1% of high-value NFT traders are driving the majority of trading volume on Blur lately, flipping NFTs at a rapid rate in an effort to generate trading rewards on the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThis misrepresents the current NFT market,\u201d CryptoSlam wrote in the email, \u201cand puts traders at risk who often chase projects\u2019 rising action.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udca5CryptoSlam Update: We're Cleaning Up the Wash Trades \u26a1\ufe0fWe're taking action to remove nearly $500 Million in wash trades, retroactively as well as applying an updated algorithm to prevent future wash trades. \u26a1\ufe0fThis comes after they took similar action https://t.co/ArHdTqRe08\u2026 https://t.co/9OHvQKhgLe \u2014 CryptoSlam! (@cryptoslamio) February 24, 2023\n\nThat figure expanded to nearly $824 million as of Monday morning, representing over 80% of Blur\u2019s total NFT trading volume ($1.02 billion) that CryptoSlam had recorded since the marketplace launched its BLUR token airdrop on February 14. CryptoSlam has yet to analyze all of Blur\u2019s trading data from its October 2022 launch up until the airdrop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy contrast, CryptoSlam says that rival marketplace OpenSea had facilitated about $6.6 million worth of \u201cwash trades\u201d between February 14 and early Monday, out of over $249 million in total volume\u2014adding up to about 2.5% of its total trading volume. In other words, by CryptoSlam\u2019s criteria, OpenSea is still handling more organic NFT trading volume than Blur.\n\nWash trading in the NFT space, as it has most commonly been described, occurs when a trader buys and sells NFTs between their own wallets, often at inflated sums, or when multiple traders do the same in a coordinated fashion. It\u2019s typically done to manipulate trading volume metrics or game token reward models, as seen with earlier NFT marketplaces like LooksRare and X2Y2.\n\nRandy Wasinger, CryptoSlam\u2019s founder and CEO, told Decrypt that unfiltered trading data paints what the company believes is an inaccurate picture of trading trends. CryptoSlam has a duty to separate \u201ctrue sales from wash, farming, or otherwise artificial on-chain trades,\u201d he said.\n\n\"These flagged transactions are the byproduct of token farming incentives recently introduced by Blur in their war with OpenSea and other marketplaces,\u201d Wasinger said. \u201cThey're not arm's-length transactions between an unrelated buyer and seller.\u201d\n\nAs Decrypt reported last week, Blur surged ahead of OpenSea in terms of total trading volume following the airdrop of its own Ethereum token on February 14. Blur launched some $290 million worth of free BLUR tokens to traders, based on the current value of the token, and promised another similar airdrop ahead with its \u201cSeason 2\u201d campaign.\n\nBlur\u2019s gamified rewards model dangles free tokens in front of traders who use the platform exclusively\u2014which means not using rivals like OpenSea or X2Y2\u2014and who trade via its bidding pools. The marketplace has generated some $487 million worth of total NFT trades over the last week alone, per data from DappRadar.\n\nIn practice, the marketplace\u2019s heaviest users are constantly buying and selling assets, with some NFTs being flipped multiple times a day. According to public blockchain data surfaced last week, about 50% of Blur\u2019s NFT trading volume is being generated by just 300 wallets, while 1% of traders (565 wallets) make up 74% of the total asset value locked in Blur\u2019s bid pools.\n\nIn other words, a relatively tiny amount of users who are trading NFTs en masse like fungible tokens are heavily skewing the data. But even as Blur takes the lead in terms of raw NFT trading volume, OpenSea still has more daily wallets making trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlurred terms\n\nWhen asked Friday about CryptoSlam's claim that it had handled $577 million worth of \"wash trades\u201d from the February 14 airdrop up until that point, a Blur representative pointed to another resource\u2014a Dune dashboard based on public blockchain data, compiled by pseudonymous Web3 data analyst Hildobby.\n\nHis Dune dashboard points to about $345 million worth of wash trading through Monday, since Blur's October launch, or nearly 14% of its total recorded volume. He also previously declared Blur\u2019s trading volume \u201clegit\u201d in early February, albeit ahead of the recent surge, and has detailed his methodology for tracking wash trades on NFT marketplaces.\n\nLooks like @blur_io has seen more (wash excluded) trading volume than @opensea almost every day in the first half of February \ud83d\udd25 Source: https://t.co/yPbPkHn08h pic.twitter.com/beigRmpKW4 \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) February 15, 2023\n\nHildobby's methodology for categorizing wash trades comes down to four key elements. He flags trades if: the buyer and seller used the same wallet, an NFT is traded back and forth repeatedly between multiple wallets, if a wallet has purchased the same NFT three or more times (only for NFTs using the ERC-721 token standard), or if the buyer's and seller's wallet were both initially funded by the same wallet.\n\n\u201cWe typically like to reference analysts who have a history of doing thorough research with well-documented methodologies, rather than taking bold claims at face value,\u201d the Blur rep said of CryptoSlam\u2019s announcement. \u201cIntellectual rigor is required to develop an understanding of what\u2019s happening so that we can improve the space.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s Wasinger told Decrypt that its previous methodology for singling out wash trading was very similar to Hildobby\u2019s, but that it has since expanded its criteria to \u201cidentify a new class of wash trades.\u201d In short, it targets sales from traders who are providing liquidity to NFT trading pools without much consideration of their status as collectibles or unique assets.\n\n\u201cThis new class of wash trading is more difficult to detect and involves a key determination\u2014that during a small time period, a particular wallet's trading activity signals that it has no regard for the metadata of a particular collection,\u201d Wasinger said. \u201cSo we assume that it is trading an asset that has a similar risk profile and is \u2018substantially identical\u2019 to other assets that were recently traded.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlam, which raised a $9 million seed round in 2022 and is backed by Mark Cuban, has previously taken action to exclude suspicious or manipulated data from its reporting. In early 2022, the company said that it had removed more than $8 billion worth of trading data from upstart marketplace LooksRare, which likewise incentivized traders with token rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn LooksRare, traders were pricing the NFTs at exaggerated values and selling them amongst their own controlled wallets to create the illusion of organic trades. There may be some coordination happening with Blur trades as well, but much of the volume appears to come from NFT whales rapidly trading assets back and forth within the platform\u2019s bid pools.\n\nThe Blur representative said that the startup had \u201cbeen extremely careful\u201d in developing a token incentive model that didn\u2019t reward trades based solely on enormous sums of NFT trading volume, and said that it was \u201cfortunate enough to learn from [LooksRare\u2019s] mistakes and focus on rewarding liquidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany analysts have misunderstood the volume on Blur and compared it to LooksRare,\u201d the Blur representative added, \u201cwhich is understandable [because] the details are nuanced and good research is difficult to do in the space.\u201d\n\nIs it wash trading?\n\nBoth CryptoSlam and Hildobby are talking about wash trading, but they\u2019re not exactly saying the same thing. CryptoSlam has specifically expanded its own criteria to deal with what many in the NFT space call airdrop farming\u2014trading huge amounts of NFTs with the apparent external motivator of boosting the amount of reward tokens they\u2019ll receive as a result.\n\nIt\u2019s a debate that has raged across the NFT community in recent weeks. Some NFT creators and collectors have decried Blur\u2019s gamification tactics and how flippers are apparently forcing major market-wide shifts. OpenSea, long the market leader, recently cut some of its creator royalty protections as it scrambled to adapt to Blur\u2019s sudden market dominance.\n\nOthers in the space see it as a natural evolution for NFTs. After all, financial gain has long been a key motivator for NFT traders. The idea of unique NFTs trading hands over and over again and being flipped like fungible tokens doesn\u2019t sit right with everyone\u2014but if it\u2019s possible on the blockchain, traders will find a way to maximize the opportunity.\n\nWasinger admitted that \u201cwash trading\u201d may not be the best descriptor for what\u2019s happening at Blur. He said that \u201cinorganic trading\u201d is a better fit, and it\u2019s a broader term that encompasses what he called \u201csome judgment calls in the code\u201d beyond Hildobby\u2019s own stated methodology.\n\nBut currently on CryptoSlam\u2019s website, it\u2019s all categorized as wash trading. CryptoSlam\u2019s primary goal with the move, Wasinger said, was to clean up the data on its platform, which showed suddenly skyrocketing Ethereum NFT trading volume without context on the impact of Blur\u2019s mechanics. In his view, it gave the wrong impression of the market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe aggregate volume we're now reporting is significantly cleaner than it was before,\u201d he said.\n\nIt appears that the entire NFT market is reckoning with Blur\u2019s sudden impact, from creators to rival marketplaces and even data sources. The trading spike has muddled previously reliable metrics, and it has forced players in the space to reconsider their perceptions of NFTs and how they\u2019re used."

        "title": "Why Is Ethereum Seeing A Surge In 2023? Is It A Good Time To Invest? - ABP Live",
        "content": "In recent times, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making headlines due to a sudden surge in value. The altcoin hit its all-time high in October 2021 at the $4,899 level. Despite ETH being down by nearly 66 percent from its all-time high, it has gained about 84 percent from its lowest cycle in the past seven months. However, several reasons are attributed to the recent surge above the $1,600 and $1,700 levels.\n\nUpcoming Shanghai Update\n\nEthereum's upcoming Shanghai update, scheduled for release in March this year, could be the primary driver behind the surge in the altcoin's value.\n\nOne of the crypto world\u2019s long-awaited events since 'The Merge' last year, the Shanghai Update promises to enhance Ethereum's liquidity by unlocking the staked ETH in the Beacon Chain.\n\nAccording to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, the update's primary focus is to address the platform's scalability challenges by fragmenting the ETH database, enabling the network to scale while preserving its decentralized nature.\n\nThe Shanghai update is one of the most anticipated events in the cryptocurrency industry, attracting the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nAs a result, traders and investors are likely to buy ETH to take advantage of its anticipated utility services post-update, driving its value further.\n\nEase Of Macroeconomic Relaxation\n\nIn 2022, many macroeconomic factors affected the global economy. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates aggressively to address inflation. On the other hand, there were issues such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n\nWhen interest rates are increased aggressively, it can impact people who borrow large amounts of money. As a result, they may be less willing to invest in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and instead keep their cash on hand.\n\nALSO READ: Why Crypto Is More Volatile Than Stocks\n\nLast year, the Fed cranked up interest rates eight times since March 2022, including four consecutive 0.75 percent base points increases to tackle inflation.\n\nHowever, the Fed has hiked 0.25 percent base points this January, as inflation showed signs of easing a bit. Investors and traders may anticipate fewer interest rate hikes than last year and may be interested in buying crypto assets.\n\nIncreased Institutional Adoption\n\nIn the past three months, there has been increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, contributing to Ethereum's rise in value. In the past three months, ETH has surged by 36 percent.\n\nMany large corporations and financial institutions, such as Visa, announced a proposal last December to enable Ethereum holders to set up programmable payments from their own self-custodial wallets. This would further eliminate banks and centralized third parties from the transaction process.\n\nSurge In Bitcoin Price\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have exhibited a positive correlation in the past years. If BTC surges in value, ETH also tends to follow suit. This is likely because BTC is seen as a store of value, and in times of market volatility, it is the first cryptocurrency investors would turn to.\n\nALSO READ: Bitcoin Is Seeing A Resurgence This Year After A Challenging 2022: Here\u2019s Why\n\nSo, generally, when BTC's value increases, it can increase investor confidence and investment in the broader crypto market, including Ethereum. However, this is not the only factor that has influenced Ethereum's value, but it could be one of the factors.\n\nHODLing\n\nHODLing \u2014 cryptospeak for holding assets for an extended period of time \u2014 can contribute to a surge in the price to a certain extent through increased confidence in the cryptocurrency. When more people hold Ethereum for a more extended period, it suggests that they believe in its long-term value and potential.\n\nThis might have attracted new buyers who saw the existing holders as a signal of the asset's value. And this again, the upcoming update could be one of the reasons why investors and traders might be holding it.\n\nIs This The Right Time To Invest In Ethereum?\n\nInvesting in assets is always a wise decision, but it's crucial to remember that investing is a long-term process focusing less on immediate or short-term profits.\n\nWith a high market capitalization, Ethereum is one of the leading cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has a finite supply, Ethereum possesses vast utility and is poised to undergo numerous upgrades, resulting in exceptional scalability and applications soon.\n\nALSO READ: How Crypto Diversification Can Protect Your Portfolio Against Volatility\n\nWhether or not to invest in such a cryptocurrency ultimately depends on the investor's preferences and convictions. But, while investing, it is always suggested to do your own research before putting your hard-earned money on any asset.\n\n(The author is the CEO and co-founder of Mudrex, a global crypto investing company)\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs, and views of ABP Network Pvt.

Third party data shows that OKX holds the largest 100% clean asset reserves among major exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to continue the monthly publishing of our proof-of-reserves in line with our unwavering commitment to transparency and trust here at OKX,\u201d said Lennix Lai, Managing Director of Financial Markets.\n\n\u201cOur data shows that hundreds of thousands of our users have taken an active interest in viewing our historical reserves and using open-source tools to verify their liabilities are included. Proof-of-reserves is far from a niche topic \u2013 it is of vital importance to building user trust and we are dedicated to ensuring OKX shows continued leadership in this area.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u2018proof-of-reserves\u2019 mean?\n\nProof-of-reserves is a report of crypto assets that ensures the custodian (in this case OKX) holds the assets it claims to hold on behalf of its users. OKX uses the Merkle tree (hash tree) to prove this claim in two ways. First, users can find their balance in the tree and prove their assets are held in the total OKX balance. Second, the total OKX balance is compared to the publicized OKX on-chain wallet balance to determine proof-of-reserves.\n\nWhat are \u2018clean reserves\u2019?\n\nAssets are considered \u2018clean\u2019 in PoR when a third party analysis determines they do not include an exchange\u2019s platform token, and are solely made up of high market cap \u2018traditional\u2019 crypto assets such as BTC, ETH and USDT. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant monitors PoR across the industry, and found OKX\u2019s assets to be \u2018100% clean\u2018."
