        "content": "Address outflows from whales contributed heavily to ETH\u2019s latest sell pressure.\n\nSome whales are re-accumulating, but it may not be enough to turn the ship around.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been on an overall bearish trajectory for the last seven days \u2013 an outcome that saw it shed last month\u2019s gains. But what has been driving this bearish retracement?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nOutflows from whale addresses may have largely contributed to ETH\u2019s downside. A recent Glassnode alert offered some confirmation. It revealed that the number of addresses holding 100 or more ETH recently fell to their lowest level in the last eight years.\n\nThe Glassnode alert warrants a look at whether other whale categories have been contributing to sell pressure. We found that addresses holding at least 1,000 ETH and those above the 10,000 ETH (Denoted by blue and black respectively) have been trimming their balances.\n\nIn other words, they have been contributing to the downside.\n\nWe also found something interesting. Retail buyers (smaller accounts) holding at least 0.01 ETH have increased their balances overall. This is during the same period that whales have been selling off some of their ETH.\n\nIn other words, ETH\u2019s price action in the last few weeks has been significantly influenced by whale games.\n\nOne in the chamber?\n\nWe looked into the supply distribution which collaborates with the Glassnode address activity analysis above. However, we observed that addresses holding over 10 million ETH have been growing during the month.\n\nIn addition, the same whale category controls the second largest share of ETH in circulating supply.\n\nIt was unclear whether the aforementioned address category represented private addresses or exchange addresses. Aside from that, addresses holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH shifted in favor of accumulation in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso, investor confidence remained favorable for the bulls, judging by the steady rise in weighted sentiment.\n\nETH\u2019s MVRV ratio has also been steadily rising during the last four months and was at its highest level during the same period. The above information coincided with the latest price action.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH\u2019s bearish assault slowed down in the last three days, but the press time momentum was not yet strong enough for a substantial bounce back.\n\nETH exchanged hands at $1894 at press time. It was, at press time, showing signs of a potential bounce back at the RSI mid-point. Moreover, the MFI has already indicated that there has been some accumulation in the last few days."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Solana (SOL) will come close to its all-time highs once Ethereum (ETH) kicks off its bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 446,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana could go up to $250, an increase of more than 870% from its current price of $25.75.\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst, Solana\u2019s rise will likely be triggered by Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade, which is expected to further elevate the leading smart contract platform\u2019s scalability. The InvestAnswers host mentions a prediction made by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm that sees Ethereum rising to $9,700 following the update.\n\n\u201cPer Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case\u2026\n\nThe next question is always, \u2018Well if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what\u2019s the price of Solana?\u2019 I calculated it for you. It\u2019s going to be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700.\n\nRemember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x and of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time.\u201d\n\nWhile the InvestAnswers host believes that Ethereum could rally to $9,700, he doesn\u2019t see the surge happening in the coming months.\n\n\u201cGreat to see $9,700 ETH. Maybe we\u2019ll see in the bull run. I doubt we\u2019ll see it in the first quarter of 2024, but perhaps early 2025.\u201d\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the anonymous analyst reiterates his prediction that the flagship crypto asset will soar by over 40% from current levels by early next year.\n\n\u201cI did say many times a few months ago, I would not be surprised if we had a $42,000 Bitcoin target by somewhere between January and April of 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $29,804 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has set a new record with a massive $52 billion worth now securing the ETH network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer IntoTheBlock, the Ethereum network is currently being secured by a staggering $52.3 billion, marking the highest value ever reached.\n\nRecent data reveals that the total value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has reached an ATH of 26,232,679 ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum network is currently being secured by a staggering $52.3 billion, marking the highest value it has ever reached. As the value of #ETH used to secure the network increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for any potential attacker to gain control over it. pic.twitter.com/2hrzj82Nk0 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 21, 2023\n\nIntoTheBlock notes that as the value of ETH used to secure the network increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for any potential attacker to gain control over it.\n\nEthereum migrated to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus during the Merge upgrade last September. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus was used by Ethereum for the first seven years of its life, much like Bitcoin.\n\nThe network's security was then derived from the enormous quantities of energy needed to solve mathematical puzzles, as any attacker would have to obtain 51% of the chain's energy usage, which is a nearly impossible feat.\n\nEthereum is now secured by stakers rather than miners. To be a validator, which is in charge of ensuring the validity of new blocks, stakers must stake 32 ETH.\n\nConsensus mechanisms, which allow a decentralized network to confidently decide which blocks to add to the chain, are the most important aspect of any blockchain's security. If the consensus mechanism is exploited, as might happen in a 51% attack, the chain could suffer irreparable harm.\n\nEthereum Deneb/Cancun testing efforts progress\n\nChristine Kim summarizes the Ethereum ACDE call, a twice-weekly conference call where Ethereum client teams debate and plan updates to the Ethereum execution layer (EL).\n\nThis week, developers talked about DevNet 8 planning and some adjustments to Deneb/Cancun EIPs. Various teams are working on new software releases in advance of DevNet 8.\n\nDevelopers will move on with the launch of the following test network once all client releases have passed the pertinent Hive tests for DevNet 8, which is scheduled to debut sometime in the first week of August, according to developers.\n\nA shadow fork of Sepolia has already been finished by developers with a small number of clients, and this helped to find a few flaws in the client code."

        "content": "Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) registered the highest inflows into centralized exchanges (CEX) in the past two months. These significant asset movements have suggested a potential price dip for ETH.\n\nCoinGecko data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing a slight price decline, losing 2.5% of its value in the past week. As of this writing, the Ether token changes hand at $1,892.65, with a negligible 0.2% gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Registers $383 Million Worth Of ETH In CEX Inflows\n\nAccording to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum witnessed the largest inflows into centralized exchanges in the past two months. The data analytics platform found that at least $383 million worth of ETH was deposited into these exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also revealed that a significant percentage of the CEX inflows came from a single address and in a single transaction. This deposit came from an old wallet that accumulated 61,216 ETH during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nThis pre-mine wallet had been dormant for eight years, with its constituent ETH worth more than $116 million untouched. On Wednesday, July 19, this address became activated, and its stash of Ether tokens was abruptly moved to another address associated with the Kraken exchange.\n\nData from Whale Alert shows that a significant amount of Ether tokens has been transferred to crypto exchanges by several whales over the past week. Notably, more than 200,000 Ether tokens have been transferred to Coinbase in separate transactions within this period.\n\nIndeed, the movement of massive amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges can signal impending selling pressure, which can drive the asset\u2019s price down. However, not all large transfers to an exchange precipitate a downward price movement, as the whales might not intend to sell immediately or all at once.\n\nTotal ETH Staked Reaches All-Time High\n\nThe Ethereum network has been experiencing a steady increase in the total amount of ETH staked on the blockchain. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this figure has reached $52.3 billion, representing its highest value ever.\n\nThe data analytics company also noted that with an increasing amount of staked ETH, the Ethereum blockchain is bound to become even more secure, as there will be a corresponding decrease in the risk of the network being taken over by a single entity.\n\nIt is worth noting that this surge in staking activity can be linked to the successful launch of the Shapella upgrade. The Shapella upgrade offered a new dimension to ETH staking, as investors can now lock and unlock their assets at will.\n\nThis increased flexibility eliminated a substantial portion of risk that has been attributed to ETH staking in the past.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,886.82 | Source: ETHUSD daily chart from TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Getty, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum buyers have been struggling to push the price above the significant resistance region of $2K. Nevertheless, the price is currently navigating a crucial range bounded by that level and the dynamic support provided by the 100-day moving average.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn June 21st, Ethereum managed to surpass the 100-day moving average and continued its prevailing uptrend after a pullback, eventually reaching the critical resistance area at $2K. Yet, the bullish momentum faded due to increased selling pressure around this level, resulting in minor rejections.\n\nNevertheless, the price finds support at the 100-day MA, currently situated at $1,867, which has prevented further declines over the past few weeks. A breakout from this significant price range will likely play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum\u2019s overall prospects in the mid-term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nUpon analyzing the 4-hour timeframe, a bearish trend for Ethereum becomes evident as the price broke below its multi-week upward trendline after facing rejection at the $2K resistance zone. A subsequent pullback confirmed the breakout.\n\nAt present, ETH remains confined between two critical price levels: the static resistance at $2K and the critical support at $1,850. This suggests the potential for a range-bound market stage characterized by consolidation candles and the absence of a strong trend.\n\nThe price is expected to remain within this range until a breakout occurs, revealing the upcoming direction for Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe provided chart displays the Estimated Leverage Ratio in correlation with ETH\u2019s price. This metric gauges the average leverage employed by participants in the futures market. Generally, higher values indicate more investors are taking on greater leverage and risk in the derivatives market.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Estimated Leverage Ratio has seen a slight increase, suggesting that the futures market may be getting overheated due to the recent bullish price trends. However, it hasn\u2019t reached concerning levels yet. Nonetheless, if the metric continues to surge, caution is advised as it could lead to a short or long-squeeze event.\n\nIn such a scenario, Ethereum\u2019s price could experience a sudden and significant movement."

Chainlink says it is as an onramp for TradFi institutions to get into tokenized digital assets.\n\nThe week\u2019s news\n\nOn Monday, G20 watchdog the Financial Stability Board issued nine top-level recommendations for regulators on overseeing crypto companies and markets. It also issued revised recommendations on the oversight of stablecoins.\n\nThe recommendations are designed to prevent crypto crashes on the scale of FTX and Terra incorporate feedback from the FSB\u2019s public consultation on the topic, including calls for cross-border cooperation between regulators, governance requirements for crypto issuers, and mandatory disclosures for the industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe following day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accepted Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Spot ETF proposal for official review.

The bill aims to bring clarity and a \u201cmuch-needed regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nThe act includes a pathway for blockchains to be certified as decentralized. The SEC would have an opportunity to push back against assertions made by token issuers that their projects meet the standard outlined in the act.

Since its launch in October, the platform, which is recognized as a \u201cmarketplace for professional traders,\u201d had made a commitment to provide token rewards to traders. Traders are now able to claim Ethereum-based tokens from their \u201ccare packages\u201d with an anticipated commencement time of approximately 1:30 PM ET, after experiencing a slight delay.\n\nThe distribution of tokens took place in three distinct phases, specifically aimed at Ethereum NFT traders who met the eligibility criteria and actively engaged in Blur\u2019s competitive marketplace prior to its official launch. Additionally, tokens were allocated to users who listed their NFTs for sale during the month of November, as well as traders who placed bids on NFTs within the Blur platform. Blur had originally intended to distribute governance tokens to eligible users in January, but the airdrop was subsequently delayed in order to implement additional enhancements.\n\nIn March 2022, Blur successfully secured $11 million in a seed funding round, with Paradigm taking the lead. The company\u2019s primary objective is to cultivate a strong user base by providing traders with token rewards that hold the potential for significant value. Blur\u2019s growth has been fueled by the anticipation surrounding the upcoming token halving, resulting in occasional instances where it surpasses OpenSea in terms of NFT trading volume.\n\nIT'S TIME FOR $BLUR Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official @BLUR_io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming. pic.twitter.com/tSbOPLqYTW \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 13, 2023\n\n\n\nThe introduction of token rewards generated a sense of enthusiasm among users. However, it also raised concerns regarding the practice of \u201cwash trading,\u201d where users could potentially manipulate trades in order to artificially inflate their rewards. In contrast to certain other marketplaces, Blur has managed to avoid encountering substantial challenges related to dubious trades. However, it is worth noting that approximately 13% of its trades are categorized as suspected wash trading, which is higher compared to the approximately 2% observed on OpenSea.\n\nThe token airdrop by Blur has the potential to enhance its momentum even more, as traders capitalize on the incentives, with the backing of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Huobi."

        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Published: 23 Jul 2023 \u2022 9:30\n\nHaving a clearly set out roadmap, with milestones for success is crucial for crypto projects, especially in presale. Hoping to become the next big crypto coin, Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP) has outlined a clear roadmap, drawing inspiration from the path taken by top coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The project\u2019s roadmap provides a strategic plan that outlines the goals, development stages, and anticipated achievements of a crypto token.\n\nScorpion Casino Token, Ethereum, and Solana are three notable tokens that have demonstrated the significance of a well-defined roadmap in attracting investor confidence and participation.\n\nIntroducing Scorpion Casino Token: The Next Big Crypto Coin\n\nScorpion Casino Token has emerged as a promising contender in the crypto market, positioning itself as the next big crypto coin for growth investing. This token introduces a unique feature set that appeals to investors seeking opportunities in the online gambling industry. The SCORP token is deflationary, with automatic burn mechanisms triggered after every transaction and every time the casino generates profits. It also leverages reputable platforms like BetRadar and CoinsPaid to offer users a seamless and secure gambling experience.\n\nScorpion Token\u2019s roadmap outlines the development stages of the project, including the creation of the number one social online gambling platform. The roadmap introduces exclusive rewards, such as enrolment in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which offers VIP services, cash-back incentives, extra staking rewards, and additional SCORP tokens. These milestones provide a clear progression of the project\u2019s growth, inspiring confidence and attracting investors seeking potential returns in the booming crypto and online gambling industries.\n\nEthereum: Empowering the Blockchain Industry\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the pioneer of blockchain-based smart contracts and decentralised applications, has established itself as a leading cryptocurrency. With a robust infrastructure and a large developer community, Ethereum has become a symbol of innovation and versatility in the crypto space. To maintain its position, Ethereum continues to upgrade its roadmap, enhancing its offerings and keeping up with the evolving needs of the industry.\n\nThe roadmap consists of a series of planned upgrades aimed at scaling the platform into a maximally resilient network. The recent Shapella upgrade was just one milestone in Ethereum\u2019s journey. However, the roadmap extends beyond this upgrade, with several major improvements still in the pipeline. Notably, the introduction of distributed validator technology (DVT) will enable solo and squad staking, empowering users to participate in securing the network and earning rewards. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement instil confidence in investors, as they see the platform\u2019s dedication to remaining a powerful global blockchain platform for decentralised applications.\n\nSolana: Unlocking Unprecedented Scalability\n\nSolana has gained attention as a high-performance blockchain platform aiming to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. Positioned as one of the fastest blockchain platforms in existence, Solana offers developers an opportunity to create dApps at scale. Solana\u2019s roadmap focuses on scalability, security, and decentralisation. By addressing these key aspects, Solana aims to provide developers with a platform where they can build complex applications without compromising speed or security. Through a combination of Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanisms, Solana eliminates traditional blockchain limitations, attracting investors who seek the next big thing in the crypto market.\n\nHaving a clearly defined roadmap and achieving significant milestones are vital factors in driving investor confidence and participation during crypto pre-sales. Tokens like Scorpion Casino Token, Ethereum, and Solana have demonstrated the power of transparent roadmaps that outline ambitious features, upgrades, and partnerships. These roadmaps serve as blueprints for investors, providing them with a clear vision of a project\u2019s potential and its steps towards success.\n\nFor more about Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP):\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

        "content": "A decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on top of the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) has been hacked to the tune of about $3.2 million.\n\nNew data reveals that Conic Finance (CNC), which provides omnipools, or liquidity pools that allow all trades on a network to occur in a single transaction, to Curve Finance (CRV) has been exploited for $3.26 million, according to crypto security firm Beosin.\n\nIn response to the attack, which only affected the protocol\u2019s Ethereum omnipool, Conic Finance disabled deposits into it.\n\nHowever, about an hour later, Conic provided an update saying that the exploit has been fixed in a way that it could never happen again.\n\n\u201cThe root cause was a re-entrancy attack that was able to be performed because of a wrong assumption as to what address is returned by the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools. A fix to the affected contract is being deployed.\n\nThe exploit cannot be done again for the ETH Omnipool. Withdrawals are safe. No other Conic omnipools are affected by this issue. A more detailed post-mortem will be published soon.\u201d\n\nConic says they have reached out to the bad actor via the transaction and warns that anyone else contacting users to recover funds is attempting to scam them.\n\n\u201cConic has reached out to the exploiter via a [transaction] sent from the official Conic Multisig address. Other [transactions] claiming to recover funds on behalf of Conic are a scam.\u201d\n\nThe debacle had a significant impact on the price of CNC. The digital asset fell a staggering 77.16% on the day, free falling from $5.92 all the way down to $1.34.

        "content": "Total ETH staked reached its highest value.\n\nAs positive sentiment waned, the price stagnated within a narrow range.\n\nEthereum [ETH] validators have deposited $52.3 billion into the ETH2.0 contract to secure the L1 Chain. According to on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock, this marked the highest value it has ever reached.\n\nThe Ethereum network is currently being secured by a staggering $52.3 billion, marking the highest value it has ever reached. As the value of #ETH used to secure the network increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for any potential attacker to gain control over it. pic.twitter.com/2hrzj82Nk0 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 21, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nTo become a validator on the Ethereum PoS network, validators are required to deposit 32 ETH into the ETH 2.0 contract. As of the time of writing, the total number of ETH deposited into this contract by validators running the network was 27.05 million ETH, per data from Glassnode.\n\nThis represented 22.46% of the leading altcoin\u2019s total supply.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nValidators on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network are grouped into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator on the committee is responsible for producing blocks for each 12-second slot.\n\nA validator on the committee is charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot. However, if the assigned validator is unavailable, it will result in a missed block.\n\nData from Glassnode revealed that on 13 April (a day after the Shanghai Upgrade), the missed block count touched an all-time high of 658. This could be because some validators intentionally took their nodes offline during the upgrade and a day after it for a proper assessment of the impact of the upgrade.\n\nThis, however, soon declined. With only 42 missed blocks recorded on 21 July, missed block count has dropped by 94% since the 13 April high.\n\nFurther, to ensure that the PoS network runs optimally, there has to be a high degree of participation by Validators on the network.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior block space efficiency.\n\nOn 12 May, validators\u2019 participation rate slipped to its lowest point since December 2020. This dropped to 96%. It has, however, regained its spot at 99%, where it sat at the time of writing. This means almost all the network validators actively participated in block production.\n\nETH market continues its sideways movement\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $1,892.25, with its price trading within a narrow range since the middle of the month.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe narrow movement of the market was confirmed by the state of the alt\u2019s Bollinger Bands at press time. ETH\u2019s price was positioned by the middle line of this indicator.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s price moves in this manner, it suggests that the asset was experiencing a period of relative stability or consolidation at press time. In this situation, there might not be a strong directional trend in the price movement, and the market might be indecisive."

Because if it can\u2019t, if it breaks through that level, we are entering into no man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the market cap of BNB is $37.6 billion.\n\nAlthough Merten is cautious on altcoins, he says that Ethereum could swim against the tide.\n\n\u201cOut of all the cryptocurrencies out there, one that has stood out that looks at least more bullish to me is the price pattern of Ethereum. Over the last more than a year, it has been building an ascending triangle. This is a bullish pattern where you have a flat range of resistance, ascending lows that line up, squeezing and coiling in price, usually to bounce to the upside.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that there\u2019s no guarantee of that as with all technical patterns, we\u2019re just simply working with what we have.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,883 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto Architecture Provider Anoma Planning On Launching 'Intents' on Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Anoma Foundation plans to launch intents on Ethereum, CEO confirms at EthCC, Paris.\n\nIncentivized Request For Comments (RFC) will also launch on the architecture.\n\nAnoma\u2019s partner, Namada, launched privacy swapping on the Osmosis exchange.\n\nSwiss-based non-profit decentralized architecture protocol Anoma is set for a wave of new developments in the coming months, according to the company\u2019s founders Adrian Brink and Christopher Goes. Speaking at the EthCC conference in Paris, France, last week, the founders announced Anoma and its partner, Namada, are planning to launch several innovations set to enhance the efficiency of its platform and improve the project\u2019s muti-chain capabilities.\n\nOn the main stage of the Ethereum conference in the French capital, Adrian outlined his team\u2019s plan for bringing intents to the Ethereum network. An informal definition of intent is a signed set of declarative constraints which allow a user to outsource transaction creation to a third party without relinquishing complete control to the transacting party. Intents allow users to have a more efficient and user-friendly platform, away from the conventional transaction models.\n\nWith the launch of intents on Ethereum, developers can use Anoma\u2019s architecture to create novel applications, including end-to-end decentralization, information flow control, and fully programmable intents. Speaking on the launch of intents on Ethereum, Adrian Brink stated:\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to understand that Anoma is an architecture, not a blockchain. This distinction allows existing applications to utilize Anoma\u2019s properties to the extent they require. For example, rollups could employ Anoma\u2019s counterparty discovery to decentralize their sequencer or use Anoma to generate intents for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Brink also launched Anoma\u2019s first incentivized Request for Comments (RFC) program to welcome the community to participate in developing the platform. The program is set to launch later this fall, with contributors gaining a share of the Anoma genesis distribution as they participate in the program. This encourages developers and researchers in Ethereum and broader communities to review principal technical developments on Anoma and share feedback and EIPs to Anoma\u2019s current architectural design.\n\nFinally, Anoma\u2019s partner, Namada, a Proof-of-Stake L1 for asset-agnostic multi-chain privacy, confirmed they have introduced added privacy features to Cosmos-built, Osmosis exchange. The new privacy feature, \u201cShielded Swaps\u201d, adds a layer of privacy to transactions on platforms that do not natively support privacy. The interchain privacy model will also introduce an incentivization model for multi-chain users \u201cwho contribute to the increased privacy for all fellow Namada users,\u201d the press release concluded.\n\nThe latest additions follow the recent $25 million fundraising round in June, led by crypto-focused venture capital firm CMCC Global. Other investors in the round included Electric Capital, Delphi Digital, Dialectic, KR1, Spartan, NGC, MH Ventures, Bixin Ventures, No Limit, Plassa, Perridon Ventures, Anagram, and Factor, among others. This brings the total funds raised to $51 million after a $26 million raise in 2021.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Canadian crypto miner HIVE has disclosed to be involving Ordinals in one of its many Artificial Intelligence projects.\n\nHIVE CEO Aydin Kilic has also stated that they will use their own GPU to create generative AI art.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies, a Canadian crypto miner has disclosed that it would be using Ordinals in one of its AI initiatives. According to the report, it would involve old Ethereum mining rigs to inscribe generative art on Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to HIVE CEO Aydin Kilic, this initiative is an exercise in technical prowess, and Ordinals would enable it to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs by providing a new way.\n\nAfter a decision by Ethereum to switch to the Proof-of-Stake, it used the data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs to mine altcoins. In this case, it changed the way transactions are verified on the network and drastically reduced its energy consumption. The post-merge event forced the company to explore alternatives to Ethereum mining. Generative art pipeline using new technologies is said to be perfectly in line with its corporate strategy of maximizing profit.\n\nKilic said:\n\nWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [\u2026] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSince its inception, Ordinals has led several innovations with Bitcoin. Just as people inscribe data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, Ordinals has been a windfall for Bitcoin miners. For the past few months, Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscription have come down after the popularity of BRC-20 tokens sent it high.\n\nMore on the HIVE Initiative\n\nAccording to Kilic, the HIVE project is a very ambitious one since it taps into different areas of the HIVE business. This is said to include cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that\u2019s fully integrated. It\u2019s a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.\n\nIn addition to creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic disclosed that HIVE is closely working with its custody providers to transact uncommon sats which are found through Ordinals. These uncommon sats are the first Sat of each Bitcoin block. With this, about 272 of them are in possession of HIVE.\n\nHIVE can boast of several achievements since its inception including going public in 2017 and trading on TSX Venture Exchange in Canada using the symbol HIVE.V. Under the HIVE, it has been trading on Nasdaq since 2021. As of press time, its shares were exchanging hands at $5.66 with a market cap of $477 million.\n\nRecently, MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor mentioned that Ordinals has a huge potential in app development. He also observed that the ability to commit data to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that is not related to transactions has several potential applications.\n\nThe whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
