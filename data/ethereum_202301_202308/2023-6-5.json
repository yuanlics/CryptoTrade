        "title": "The ETH Question: Why does the SEC avoid taking action against Ethereum when all else are fair game? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance today in a move that has rocked the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe complaint notably includes language in which the SEC clearly elucidates that it considers many of the tokens that traded on Binance to be unregistered securities and lays out its case against several it considers notable offenders. The SEC identifies these \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d as including (but not limited to) Solana, Cardano, Polygon, Filecoin, Cosmos, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Algorand, Axie Infinity, and Coti.\n\nToday\u2019s filing contains some of the SEC\u2019s most explicit language to date in clarifying its judgment, but once again avoids taking on the big question: is Ethereum a security or not? If so, why is the SEC silent on it? And if not, what is it?\n\n\u201cCrypto Asset Securities\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s argument for designating these tokens as \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d is exhaustively outlined in Section VIII of the complaint (pages 85 through 123). Notable patterns emerge from the filing: the process of initial coin offerings (ICOs), vesting of tokens, allocations for the core team, and the promotion of profit generation through ownership of these tokens, are all repeated themes.\n\nBut Ethereum is not listed among these. Gensler has remained consistently vague on the question of whether Ethereum and its namesake coin count as securities. ETH is commonly held as an investment, suggesting it could be classified as a security, but it is also extensively used day-to-day as a medium of exchange across protocols, making its function more akin to cash or ACH settlement.\n\nGensler has previously suggested that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d in the crypto space could be seen as a security, but has notably refused to clearly state as much about Ethereum. When pressed to say the words, \u201cI believe Ethereum is a security,\u201d the Hon. Chair just will not do it. Gensler\u2019s reluctance to classify Ether is curious when his SEC is so eager to claim as much for others. Why?\n\nThe Ethereum problem\n\nIt might be a simple matter of intragovernmental contention. Ethereum could potentially fall under the purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regards Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether as commodities, not securities. Not only do the two categories differ wildly from one another, this overlap could create a regulatory tug-of-war that would Gensler\u2019s public stance on Ethereum while trying to avoid the appearance of infighting within the federal government.\n\nAnother analysis from Protos, argues that Gensler\u2019s evasion on the matter may be a consequence of the SEC\u2019s earlier inaction following the infamous DAO hack, which saw the blockchain fork into Ethereum Classic and put the entire ecosystem at risk. However, at the time the SEC did nothing, and now Gensler finds himself in the unenviable position of making up for his predecessors\u2019 oversights. Now that the Ethereum ecosystem has spent years recovering and building credibility, retroactively declaring it an unregistered security would have unforeseen, but no doubt disastrous, consequences for investors.\n\nIn other words, protecting investors in this case would mean protecting them from the protector.\n\nHowever, perhaps another reason could lie beneath Gensler\u2019s reluctance to clearly classify Ethereum: he may not know.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are innovative and novel. They represent a fundamental shift in how we understand finance and asset ownership, and in the case of decentralized ecosystems like Ethereum, they introduce entirely new paradigms.\n\nIf this is true, it\u2019s not unreasonable to suspect that most people\u2014even those deeply involved in the space\u2014may not fully understand the implications of these innovations just yet. Anything that is fundamentally new will resist categorization, and Ethereum does so\u2014this lack of a concrete \u201cconcept\u201d that both defines Ethereum but fits into previous understandings is the core problem around regulating it.\n\nThis regulatory ambiguity presents a complex challenge for Ethereum, but it does not lessen the urgency to address it. The advancement of the crypto industry hinges on obtaining clear legal definitions for Layer 1 (L1) tokens, such as Ethereum, that function simultaneously as mediums of daily exchange and investment vehicles within their respective ecosystems. The ambiguity in their status poses a significant hurdle, stalling progress and fostering uncertainty in a space that is ripe for growth and innovation.\n\nThe dichotomy of these tokens\u2019 roles blurs the boundary between conventional asset classes, forcing us to confront inadequacies in existing legal structures. To propel the crypto industry forward, regulators must acknowledge and address this nuanced reality. Until a refined framework emerges that accurately captures the dual functionality of these L1 tokens, regulatory ambiguity will continue to shroud the industry, stifling its full potential and deterring mainstream adoption. This unique crypto space requires equally unique rules\u2014ones that can encapsulate its dynamism and complexity.\n\nMaking meaningful progress\n\nThe path towards comprehensive crypto regulation is obscured by two significant obstacles, which must be addressed urgently for the sector\u2019s responsible advancement.\n\nFirstly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must establish a formal position on Ethereum. Given the SEC\u2019s historical inaction in restraining Ethereum\u2019s growth when opportunities were present, it has inadvertently fostered an environment where investors are left in regulatory limbo. The SEC, as the protector of investors, has a duty to provide some form of regulatory guidance\u2014even if it proves to be temporary\u2014to offer a foundational starting point and eliminate the current state of speculation. The lack of clear regulation is not merely an inconvenience; it is a failure to provide the necessary protections for participants in an increasingly significant market.\n\nSecondly, authentic, open-ended discussions about the nature of digital assets are crucial. This implies engaging in conversations devoid of preconceived notions, biases, ideological posturing, or empty rhetoric. We often speak of making space to \u201chave the conversation,\u201d but acknowledging that conversation needs to take place and actually having one are two very different exercises indeed. Perhaps everyone in the industry\u2014as well as those watching over it\u2014would benefit from practicing the latter.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The prices of Bitcoin, Ether, and other top cryptocurrencies dropped marginally just after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase\u2014just one day after the agency filed another blockbuster lawsuit against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBitcoin was immediately down about 1%, Ether 0.7%, and BNB, Binance\u2019s digital currency, dipped to a low of 1%. Bitcoin began the day at $25,700 and dropped to a low of $25,400. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies sagged about 0.7%.\n\nIn the lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC specifically detailed \u201ca non-exhaustive list\u201d of 13 cryptocurrencies that it argued were securities, including pages of details outlining these tokens\u2019 releases. The most prominent include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). After the SEC\u2019s lawsuit became public, SOL was down approximately 2%, ADA 0.6%, and MATIC 2.6%.\n\n\u201cFrom the time of their first offer or sale, each of these Crypto Asset Securities was\n\noffered and sold, and continues to be offered and sold today, as an investment contract and thus a\n\nsecurity,\u201d wrote the SEC.\n\nThe depression in the market mirrors the price action seen on Monday, when the SEC sued Binance, as both cryptocurrencies and the share prices of publicly traded crypto companies, including Coinbase, took a hit.\n\nIn its suit against the U.S. crypto exchange, the SEC alleges Coinbase was operating as a broker, national securities exchange, and clearing agency without registering with the agency.\n\n\u201cYou simply can\u2019t ignore the rules because you don\u2019t like them or because you\u2019d prefer different ones: The consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201d said Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, in a statement shared with Fortune."

        "title": "Ethereum gas reaches new low \u2013 What it means for ETH - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH\u2019s daily active addresses and daily transactions have declined of late.\n\nOn-chain metrics gave hope for a price uptick in the coming days.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has witnessed quite a few interesting developments over the last few days. At first glance, it seemed that network usage had increased, while the rest of the metrics suggested otherwise. Not only that, but ETH underwent a price correction as well.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nLooking at the bigger picture\n\nGlassnode Alert\u2019s 5 June tweet revealed that Ethereum\u2019s mean gas price had reached a one-month low at press time. A lower gas price can lure new users onto the network and, in turn, increase the number of transactions.\n\nHowever, that has not been the case, as other datasets revealed that Ethereum\u2019s key network stats have declined. For instance, Artemis\u2019 data revealed that ETH\u2019s number of daily transactions had declined since the end of May.\n\nAdditionally, after spiking on 2 June, ETH\u2019s daily active addresses also waned. The blockchain\u2019s TVL and DEX volumes also followed the same trend, which did not look good for the blockchain\u2019s overall health.\n\nEthereum has more challenges to tackle\n\nEthereum witnessed yet another price correction on 6 June. The correction caused ETH\u2019s price to decline by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. At press time, it was trading at $1,816.79, with a market capitalization of over $218 billion.\n\nThis happened after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, one of the most prominent crypto exchanges.\n\nLookonchain\u2019s data revealed an interesting whale transaction. As per the tweet, an ETH holder quickly dumped 10,265 ETH worth $19.1 million before the market crashed after the SEC sued Binance, with an average selling price of $1,861.\n\nWill the declining trend continue?\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s data gave hope for a trend reversal as a few on-chain metrics were positive. ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was decreasing. A decline in the metric suggests that the token was not under selling pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s taker buy/sell ratio was green, indicating that buying sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market. However, the recent price dip was accompanied by a surge in its trading volume, which could cause trouble over the coming days.\n\nMarket sentiment around Ethereum remained unaffected\n\nHowever, Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s price action made news in the community, as evident from the rise in its social volume. Still, most mentions seemed to have been positive, as ETH\u2019s weighted sentiment shot up."

        "content": "TRX has been bridged to Ethereum, according to an announcement from TRON founder and former CEO Justin Sun.\n\nTRON\u2019s TRX token has been introduced to the competing Ethereum blockchain thanks to an official effort to bridge the asset across the two networks.\n\nTRX Is Live On Ethereum\n\nJustin Sun, the founder and former CEO of TRON, wrote on Twitter:\n\n\u201c[TRON] has now expanded its reach by going live on the Ethereum blockchain ... TRX is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSun said that TRX was added to Ethereum via BitTorrent Bridge, a feature of TRON's BitTorrent Chain (BTTC). Sun and TRON began to acquire the BitTorrent brand in 2018 and have launched numerous products under the BitTorrent banner since then.\n\nTRX\u2019s price has seemingly benefited from the news. The token's value gained 10% over 24 hours on June 2 \u2014 the same day that the feature was announced. Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw gains of just 1.2% over the same 24-hour period.\n\nThough market speculation may have boosted prices, the actual use of TRX on Ethereum appears to be limited. Etherscan data indicated that just 29 addresses held the coin and that just 119 transfers took place on the first day of availability.\n\nEthereum Remains Dominant\n\nTRON's blockchain went live in 2018, about three years after Ethereum\u2019s 2015 launch. The two chains share some features, such as support for custom tokens, support for decentralized applications, high transaction throughput, and staking support.\n\nThough both blockchains are generally considered competitors, Ethereum (ETH) is by far the more successful project. Its token, ETH, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a total supply valued at $228 billion.\n\nTRON (TRX) has a considerably lower market cap of $7.5 billion but remains squarely among the top ten assets by market cap as it ranks at #7.\n\nEthereum (ETH) also has a higher trading volume. ETH had a $6.8 billion 24-hour trading volume on June 2, while TRON (TRX) reported a $580 million trading volume.\n\nTRON is also highly controversial. The most recent of those controversies concerns a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It alleged that Sun, TRON, and related parties illegally offered securities and engaged in wash trading."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that both Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are on the verge of igniting breakout rallies.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe says that Litecoin\u2019s halving narrative could push the peer-to-peer payments network to a level last seen in December 2021.\n\nAccording to the crypto strategist, LTC is one resistance area away from a rapid price expansion.\n\n\u201cLitecoin is doing absolutely great, too. It is on the edge of having a breakout\u2026\n\nI think the halving is going to take place in (August), which means that we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think having a very strong rally is definitely likely if it breaks through $100.\n\nIf it breaks through $100\u2026 so then I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to peak out around the area of $160 to $180.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Litecoin is trading for $93.39, a slight decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nVan de Poppe also says that the leading smart contract platform Ethereum is also in the same boat. According to the crypto strategist, ETH has a chance to take out its immediate resistance as long as it is trading above $1,800.\n\n\u201cOnce we start to take these out ($1,903), I think we can start accelerating towards $2,800. So as long as Ether stays above $1,800, I think this can actually go quite fast.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,881, a fractional decrease on the day.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum has just had its first major upgrade, or \u201chard fork,\u201d since transitioning to a proof-of-stake system. The Shanghai upgrade allows validators to withdraw the staked ether (ETH) that has been locked in the network.\n\nWhile the primary objective of the upgrade is to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, which unlocks validator withdrawals, the changes include other significant upgrades that will impact Ethereum app developers and many of the chain\u2019s users.\n\nThe evolution of the ethereum blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has undergone a number of upgrades and changes since its initial launch in July 2015. Some of the most significant:\n\nFrontier (2015): This was the initial release of the Ethereum network, allowing users to create and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nThis was the initial release of the Ethereum network, allowing users to create and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.

This upgrade included a fee burn mechanism, which helps to reduce the overall supply of ETH and introduces a more predictable fee model for users. Paris (The Merge \u2014 2022): The Paris upgrade was initiated when the proof-of-work blockchain achieved a terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000, which occurred at block 15,537,393 on September 15, 2022. The upgrade was triggered on the next block and marked a major milestone for Ethereum as it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Along with this shift, the upgrade included improvements to the execution clients, similar to Bellatrix on the consensus layer, enabling the execution clients to receive instructions from their connected consensus clients through the activation of a new set of internal API methods known as the Engine API.\n\nThese upgrades have brought numerous improvements to the Ethereum network across security, efficiency and scalability and have enhanced the functionality of the network.\n\nWhy is the upgrade important?\n\nThe upgrade is set to change the way the blockchain functions. One of the key changes is a reduction in gas fees for layer-2 solutions like Polygon and Optimism. This update aims to enhance the overall functionality of the blockchain while reducing transaction costs.\n\nAnother significant change is the ability for users to access and unstake their Ethereum tokens, which were previously locked in a smart contract when they became validators on the proof-of-stake-based Ethereum blockchain known as the Beacon Chain. This update provides users with more flexibility when managing their staked ETH tokens.\n\nThe Shanghai update brings technical improvements to the smart contract feature, which will help to position Ethereum as a major player, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve its technology and enhance value to users.\n\nInstitutions preparing for upgrades\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is expected to have a positive effect on the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies as it addresses concerns about security and reliability. It is likely that this increased level of trust will lead to further investment in this space.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, institutions need to be aware of potential impacts on investments and understand how to prepare for upgrades.\n\nUpgrades can impact assets in a variety of ways:\n\nUpgrades are not always successful. The network may experience downtime or technical issues, temporarily impacting investment value.\n\nUpgrades may change the way the network operates, directly impacting assets (e.g., reducing the cost of transactions or increasing the efficiency of dApps).\n\nUpgrades may include new features and functionality, attracting new users and developers to the network\u2014potentially increasing asset value.\n\nInstitutions preparing for an upgrade should review available documentation, including timelines for rollouts of updates, code commits and network changes. They should also ensure wallet and service compatibility.\n\nHow could the upgrade impact investors and ETH prices?\n\nThe option for full withdrawal may lead to a reduction in the number of validators on the network, but the extent of its impact will depend entirely on the number of validators who actually choose to withdraw. It is possible that the Total Value Locked on the Beacon Chain could decrease as stakers claim their rewards and unstake their assets, which could lead to a drop in ETH prices.\n\nOn the other hand, allowing the unstaking of ETH will attract more investors to staking, resulting in an increase in the amount of ETH staked. This is due to the rising popularity of liquid staking derivatives that provide stakers with liquidity flexibility while earning rewards on their staked ETH, without worrying about when they can withdraw assets.\n\nThis may increase the price of ETH, or at least help it recover further from the loss in value that occurred with the recent bank failures. The impact of these changes ultimately depends on the actions of the majority of validators regarding their rewards and unstaked assets.\n\nHowever, the daily withdrawal limit prevents a run on ETH withdrawals and will hopefully mitigate the effect of the upgrade on the market price of Ethereum. The market is notoriously hard to predict, and popular assumptions may prove to be inaccurate.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade brings significant changes to Ethereum, marking an important moment for the crypto industry, reshaping the way Ethereum functions and granting stakers newfound accessibility to their ETH holdings.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum has grown in popularity over time. Because of its rising usage, ETH has become a popular cryptocurrency and has evolved into the second-largest one. Even though there are multiple sites for buying, trading, and sending Ethereum, users wonder whether they can do the same on the Cash App.\n\nEven though the application is called \u201cCash App,\u201d it allows users to send and receive Bitcoin. However, can users buy Ethereum using the app? Before that, let us get to know the app a little better.\n\nWhat is Cash App?\n\nThe Cash App, which was formerly known as Square Cash, is a mobile payment service that was released in 2013. It was developed by Square, Inc., with its services available in the US and the UK.\n\nUsing a smartphone app, users can send and receive money between and among friends, family, and companies. Peer-to-peer money transfers, the opportunity to buy and sell Bitcoin, a card to make purchases, and the choice to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies are just a few of the features offered by the app.\n\nTo ensure smooth transactions, users may connect their bank accounts or debit cards to their Cash App account. Because of its straightforward layout and practical payment alternatives, it has become increasingly popular.\n\nAlso read: How to Stake BNB?\n\nCan you buy Ethereum on Cash App?\n\nThe app does not currently support the purchase of Ethereum. While users can buy Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash through the app, Ethereum is not available for direct purchase on the platform.\n\nTo acquire Ethereum, individuals will need to utilize alternative cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini. Both of these offer Ethereum trading options. It\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrency offerings can change over time, so it is recommended to verify the available options on the app to always double-check."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck predicts that the price of ETH will reach $11,800 in 2030 and that ETH will become a competitor to U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanEck discounted Ethereum at 12% to calculate its value in current dollars, finding that in the base case, the discounted price today is $5,359.71.\n\nVanEck, which manages a $69 billion ETF, predicts that the price of ETH will reach $11,800 in 2030, and ETH will become a competitor of U.S. Treasury bonds. The specific valuation methods are cash flow forecast and FDV calculation. https://t.co/bxTUJ3T4t3 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 5, 2023\n\nThis is stated in a report written by Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets, and Patrick Bush, a research senior investment analyst for digital assets.\n\nIn this report, VanEck presents the results of its analysis and offers a clear valuation methodology for Ethereum, taking into account transaction fees, MEV and \"security as a service.\"\n\nAdditionally, it evaluates market share across key sectors and investigates Ethereum's potential as a store of value in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.\n\nVanEck projects that by 2030, ETH network revenue will have increased from a yearly average of $2.6 billion to $51 billion. This is predicated on the assumption that ETH controls 70% of the market for smart contract protocols.\n\nAccording to VanEck researchers' base case, Ethereum would generate $51 billion in revenue during the fiscal year that ends on April 30, 2030. It subtracts 1% for a validator fee and 15% for the global tax rate from this amount to get cash flows to Ethereum of $42.90 billion.\n\nThus, it arrives at a base-case 2030 price target of $11,848 per token. This is discounted to a current price of $5,300 at a 12% cost of capital derived from ETH's recent beta.\n\nEthereum to see economic shift\n\nThe main objective of Ethereum's EIP-4844, often known as \"proto-danksharding,\" is to increase the scalability of Ethereum.\n\nIt is intended to be deployed during the Deneb-Cancun upgrade, which is scheduled to occur in the latter half of Q3 or the first quarter of Q4, 2023.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the introduction of EIP-4844 is expected to dramatically cut the costs associated with using Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, which are predicted to be at least 10 times lower and possibly even up to 100 times lower.\n\nAlthough there may be a short-term decrease in ETH burning due to the fee reduction on L2 solutions, the development of Ethereum's total economic activity is anticipated to lead to greater value accumulation in the medium term."

        "content": "A recent report from Nansen revealed that 67% of new NFTs minted last month on Ethereum are currently in a profitable state. Well, this might seem to be an optimistic development, however, there\u2019s a catch. Zooming out and shedding light on the whole picture, the blockchain data and research platform tweeted,\n\n\u201cNew NFT mints have been on a decline since summer, with NFTs minted in May being 65% lower than that in April, AND the lowest it\u2019s been since June \u201921.\u201d\n\nTypically, whenever a new collection is minted, the percentage of new mints in profit is higher in the first month. However, that starts dropping after a few months, as illustrated below.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto, NFTs: UAE Central Bank Issues New AML, CTF Guidance for Institutions\n\nMacro state of affairs in the NFT market\n\nThe mint downtrend typically signifies that people are steering away from the NFT market currently. In fact, even secondary sales are on the drop. According to data from Dune Analytics, the monthly active traders have been dropping on markets like OpenSea. From January\u2019s 359.2k, the number dipped down by more than half, to 149.4k, in May.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the NFT sales have dropped by more than 15% over the past month. Specifically, the 30-day sales volume stood at $416.8 million. The number of buyers and sellers has also been on a downtrend. Specifically, they\u2019ve diminished by 30-50% each in the same period and reflected respective values of 65.5k and 55.4k at press time.\n\nDespite the not-so-appealing trends, Ethereum is currently the top blockchain in terms of sales volume. Other counterparts like Bitcoin, Solana, and Polygon rank lower, for they\u2019ve only managed to settle $40 million to $188 million in volume in the same monthly window.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Flips Cardano, Solana to Claim 2nd Spot in NFT Sales"

Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, suggested that Coinbase refocus its attention on Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEchoing Rochard's sentiment, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, known for his advocacy of Bitcoin, also expressed support for prioritizing the main cryptocurrency amid regulatory challenges. The founder of Twitter further emphasized the scarcity of censorship-resistant technologies at scale, including Tor, Bitcoin and Nostr.\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man and current owner of Twitter, promptly responded to Dorsey's pro-Bitcoin stance with a concise yet attention-grabbing tweet, injecting his characteristic wit into the conversation. Musk, who has previously expressed interest in Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, tweeted: \"DOGE ftw,\" an abbreviation for \"for the win.\" With this simple reply, Musk emphasized his ongoing enthusiasm for Dogecoin, adding an interesting twist to the ongoing discussion surrounding Bitcoin's prominence.\n\nWhile Dorsey has yet to respond directly to Musk's tweet, he made a notable comment regarding Ethereum. In response to a question about ETH's classification, Dorsey affirmed its status, implying that he believes Ethereum should be considered a security. This statement adds a new layer of complexity to the ongoing debates surrounding the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies and may spark further discussions within the industry."

Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as validators replaced the miners.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these speakers to withdraw their staked Ethereum 2.0. Additionally, with numerous developments on the Ethereum blockchain, let us learn about ETH a bit more.\n\nAlso read: How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nEthereum in a nutshell\n\nVitalik Buterin built the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum in 2015, along with the Ethereum Foundation, to support the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, it has developed to become one of the biggest and most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum is distinguished from Bitcoin by its programmability.\n\nThe blockchain has grown to accommodate a wide range of applications.

        "title": "Can Cardano's Price Hit $100? \u2013 GeekWire - GeekWire",
        "content": "Cardano is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. A dedicated community of investors and users back this long-standing top-10 cryptocurrency. With smart contracts enabled on Cardano, we\u2019re seeing more DeFi, NFT, and other projects choosing Cardano.\n\nEven with its many advantages, ADA\u2019s price has decreased since the mainnet launched in 2017. After surviving the bear market of 2018-2019, the coin enjoyed a great rally in 2021.\n\nThere was about $95 billion in market capitalization when Cardano reached its all-time high at $3.10. On the other hand, some Cardano investors think the upside is much higher, and $100 is a common price target. Can it happen?\n\nBefore we decide whether the Cardano coin price can hit $100, let\u2019s talk about how it compares to Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\n\nCardano \u2013 Proof-of-Stake smart contract platform\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum, launched the Cardano blockchain project in 2015. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) raised nearly $62 million for Cardano\u2019s development.\n\nThe Cardano mainnet launched in September 2017 with limited functionality. Cardano got a series of upgrades over the next few years that improved its decentralization and added smart contracts and Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Cardano blockchain uses ADA as its native asset. The ADA token helps the network pay transaction fees, incentivizing validators to keep it secure.\n\nCardano\u2019s ambitious roadmap and methodical development approach are heavily influenced by peer review. The Cardano blockchain\u2019s consensus protocol, Ouroboros, is a provably secure Proof-of-Stake protocol.\n\nCardano uses the EUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) model for its transactions, which makes it unique. The smart contract language Cardano uses, Plutus, is suited to formal verification because it\u2019s written in Haskell.\n\nCan Cardano reach $100?\n\nCardano should be compared to Ethereum if you\u2019re looking for a smart contract platform. Ethereum was worth $550 billion at its peak.\n\nCardano\u2019s native asset ADA is currently circulating at approximately 34 billion coins. If ADA were $100, Cardano\u2019s market cap would be $3.4 trillion, about six times greater than Ethereum.\n\nADA Price Implied Market Cap $5 $170 Billion $10 $340 Billion $20 $680 Billion $50 $1.7 Trillion $100 $3.4 Trillion\n\nThe calculations say there are 34 billion ADA in supply.\n\nCardano\u2019s low adoption makes it hard to match Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization and surpass it by a factor of 6. Cardano users make about 62,000 transactions daily, while Ethereum users make about 950,000.\n\nThe market cap for all cryptocurrencies was $2.9 trillion in November 2021. By January 2023, Cardano will also have $3.4 trillion in market capitalization at $100 per ADA. Apple has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, Saudi Aramco has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, and Microsoft has a market cap of $1.8 trillion.\n\nADA has a hard time reaching $100 based on these two comparisons alone. An asset with a market cap of $12.7 billion must rise 270x to reach $100. ADA can only reach $100 by reducing its supply. Since there\u2019s no burning mechanism, ADA\u2019s supply will only decrease slightly in the future.\n\nCardano price prediction \u2013 Will Cardano rise?\n\nThe price of Cardano still has the potential to rise, even though it seems unlikely in practical scenarios.\n\nThe project has a lot of key milestones to hit, so Cardano still has lots of upside potential. There are five major phases in Cardano development, also known as eras. Here\u2019s how they work:\n\n\u25cf Byron \u2013 Foundation\n\n\u25cf Shelley \u2013 Decentralization\n\n\u25cf Goguen \u2013 Smart contracts\n\n\u25cf Basho \u2013 Scaling\n\n\u25cf Voltaire \u2013 Governance\n\nWhile progress along these roadmap phases is sometimes linear, the Cardano project is now in the smart contracts phase. Currently, the project is focusing on improving Cardano\u2019s smart contract capabilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nCardano does not have a realistic chance of hitting $100 since that would mean a market cap of about $3.4 trillion. There needs to be more adoption or potential for Cardano to speculate on such a valuation.\n\nCan Cardano go high? Well, some crypto investors do not think Cardano is dead, but if there is a major cryptocurrency bull run shortly, it will reach and surpass its current high. It\u2019s more likely to happen if Cardano developers keep executing their ambitious roadmap.\n\nEven though the crypto market is cyclical, no cryptocurrency is guaranteed to reach its all-time highs. Crypto projects peaked during the 2017 bullish run and still have not matched their all-time highs.\n\nDisclaimer: GeekWire newsroom and editorial staff were not involved in the creation of this content.."

The ETH/BTC pair has been showcasing quite a unique behavior, becoming a significant risk indicator on the crypto market. If you are a crypto trader or investor, this is a pair you should not ignore. Here's why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past 60 days, the ETH/BTC pair has seen a 12% increase, an impressive performance given the current market volatility. Moreover, its Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a popular technical indicator used by traders to gauge market trends, is about to perform a golden cross. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, often seen as a bullish signal in technical analysis.\n\nBut it is not just the technical indicators that make this pair intriguing. The ETH/BTC pair's performance has been hinting at a broader shift in the crypto market. Ethereum is gradually cementing its place as a potential safe haven asset in the crypto landscape. Traditionally, Bitcoin has held the safe haven mantle, but recent trends suggest Ethereum may be ready to share the podium or even take the lead.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum has begun to outperform Bitcoin during certain risk-off events, a phenomenon rarely observed on the crypto market. This shift could suggest growing investor confidence in Ethereum's long-term prospects, bolstered by the successful upgrades and the ecosystem's ongoing development.\n\nNonetheless, the ETH/BTC pair's performance offers an essential viewpoint for assessing the health and direction of the crypto market. By tracking its trend, traders can gain valuable insights into the relative strength of these two dominant cryptocurrencies and better inform their investment decisions."

The suit caused the markets to cascade, triggering a massive sell-off and causing roughly $311 million in liquidations across the entire crypto landscape.\n\nBTC Liquidations\n\nOut of the $311 million in liquidations, BTC takes the largest share with $112.27 million in liquidations, Ethereum (ETH) sits at $37.92 million and Ripple (XRP) at $6.72 million. Other altcoins make up roughly $50.16 million.\n\nLiquidations heatmap\n\nAlso read: Binance responds to SEC claims, plans to defend the platform vigorously\n\nBitcoin price remains rational\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action over the last 50 days has set up four distinctive lower highs and lower lows. Connecting these swing points using trend lines reveals a falling wedge formation. This technical formation is a bullish setup, but considering BTC has breached the lower trend line, investors need to wait for more information.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin price has come close to retesting $25,290, which is the midpoint of the 59% rally witnessed between March 10 and March 27. Hence, the likely direction Bitcoin price will head next is south to find a stable support level. The $25,290 barrier will likely provide some respite from bears.\n\nA recovery inside the falling wedge could see Bitcoin price try and retest the upper limit of the wedge at roughly $27,395. A flip of this hurdle into a support floor could trigger a swift move to $30,048. This uptick is likely going to target the buy-side liquidity resting above this level.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nA bearish case scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) price will include BTC sliding lower to retest the 62% and 70.5% retracement levels of the 59% rally at $23,905 and $22,925, respectively. While in the short-term, this move might seem bearish, a revisit to these levels will be an opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate BTC.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nEthereum price could dip lower before a bounce\n\nEthereum (ETH) price currently sits below a critical support level at $1,817, leaving investors guessing where it will head next. A recovery of ETH above the aforementioned level, combined with Bitcoin\u2019s bounce, sounds plausible and could trigger a rebound rally for Ether.\n\nIf successful, Ethereum price could continue its ascent and target the $2,028 hurdle.\n\nETH/USD 12-hour chart\n\nIf the after-effects of the recent sell-off continue to impact the crypto markets, Ethereum (ETH) price could slide lower. In such a case, a retest of the $1,703 support level seems likely. The aforementioned level and the zone, extending from $1,563 to $1,478, are places where long-term holders are likely to accumulate ETH.\n\nRead more: Ethereum exchange supply hits multi-year lows, VanEck analysts predict a rally to $11,800\n\nRipple price to move sideways before revealing its move\n\nRipple (XRP) price has successfully hit targets of the inverse head-and-shoulders, as forecasted in previous publications. The recent sell-off pushed the XRP price into an inefficiency above the $0.483 support level.\n\nGoing forward, Ripple price is likely to consolidate between the $0.483 and $0.515 support levels before making a move to the upside. A successful flip of the $0.515 hurdle is likely to trigger a sweep of the $0.548 hurdle to collect the buy-side liquidity.\n\nXRP/USD 12-hour chart\n\nA failure to move higher after consolidation will signal a waning bullish momentum for Ripple (XRP) price. In such a case, a breakdown of the $0.483 support floor will be the obvious outcome.

Developers can customize their chains and decide exactly to what extent they want their game to live \u201con-chain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZero-knowledge proofs verify zk-Rollup transactions, which is a technical innovation in crypto that allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously to help scale networks and add more transaction privacy.\n\nArgus founder Scott Sunarto co-created Dark Forest, a crypto game launched back in 2020 that uses ZKPs. He believes that many more game elements can be on-chain than the average person might think.\n\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Sunarto said that World Engine will be able to support user-generated content through the blockchain and allow even more complex games like massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to exist fully on-chain.\n\nAnd in a time following the sudden rise and fall of play-to-earn smash Axie Infinity\u2014when many Web3 game developers are shying away from going fully crypto and instead offering optional NFTs\u2014Sunarto is doubling down on the new ways that crypto elements can be used in video games.\n\n\u201cRight now, the only ingredients that you\u2019re really putting on-chain as a game developer are the NFT assets,\u201d Sunarto told Decrypt. \u201cBut now, if you have more parts of the games on-chain, you\u2019re essentially giving more ingredients for players, for other developers to really extend and build on top of the game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSunarto envisions blockchain games in which players creating user-generated content (UGC) are more crypto-literate, and can code their own smart contracts (which power decentralized apps) to add new game elements and features.\n\nAnd crypto scaling features like sharding will be able to help adapt games for growing audiences and effectively add new servers, Sunarto said. The goal is to offer game developers customization while empowering players to develop their own communities and initiatives around Web3 games.\n\n\u201cThey built their own guild system,\u201d Sunarto said of Dark Forest\u2019s players, who also formed their own DAOs or decentralized communities around the title. He added that players took the initiative to create their own smart contract and \u201cpool their resources together\u201d in the game.\n\nWhen it comes to other blockchains protocols like Solana, Avalanche, and even Ethereum scaling network Polygon, Haun Ventures suggested that none are optimized for gaming. Argus is attempting to fill that claimed void.\n\n\"Current blockchains are not designed to run games,\u201d lead investor Haun Ventures said in a statement. \u201cScott and team, with our support, envision the World Engine as an open source, connected layer-2 of sharded blockchains that will serve as the backbone for the 'Internet of Games.'\""

        "content": "Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says Ethereum (ETH) is a security while supporting a Bitcoin-focused approach for Coinbase amid the SEC lawsuit.\n\nIn a noteworthy development, Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has publicly stated his belief that Ethereum (ETH) should be classified as a security amid the latest lawsuit against the US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, alleging the exchange\u2019s unregistered operations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn addition, given Coinbase\u2019s entanglement with the US securities regulator, Dorsey, who is widely known as a Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist, agreed with a statement that the American exchange should pivot to a Bitcoin-only business model.\n\nSpecifically, Pierre Rochard, the VP of Research at Riot Platforms, a prominent Bitcoin mining firm, shared a 2015 tweet from Coinbase CEO in which he remarked:\n\n\u201cRipple, Stellar, and Altcoins are all distractions. Bitcoin is way too far ahead. We should be focused on Bitcoin and sidechains.\u201d\n\nQuoting Armstrong\u2019s statement, Rochard suggested that Coinbase should pivot back to being focused on Bitcoin, to which the former Twitter CEO expressed a 100% agreement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Case with the SEC\n\nInterestingly, the discussion surrounding Coinbase\u2019s focus on BTC occurred shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the exchange.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Coinbase of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, as well as failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThis development particularly stirred the crypto community, given that the SEC had filed a civil action against Binance, a top rival of Coinbase, barely 24 hours before launching the movement against Coinbase, as reported by The Crypto Basic.\n\nIndustry leaders such as Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano network, have described the SEC\u2019s recent action as a threat to financial freedom. Hoskinson particularly believes the SEC aims to replace mainstream crypto assets with a government-controlled CBDC."

        "title": "How ethereum survived its biggest test - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "\u201cIt was a major change, but there\u2019s a lot of talent and trust in the ethereum team,\u201d said Richard Galvin, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DACM. \u201cWe\u2019d been staking for several months and things were going pretty well.\u201d\n\nEach pledge helped secure the ethereum network, which was handling tens of millions of transactions per day, and in return, those \u201cpledgers\u201d, would generate a kind of interest rate.\n\nBut those behind the ethereum protocol \u2013 a group of developers called the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 had restricted those rewards until the underlying technical upgrades were secure enough to open the floodgates.\n\nOn April 12, the developers glued to their screens were awaiting the opening of those floodgates.\n\n\u201cIt was a long time coming, the upgrade had been pushed back many times as they tested everything,\u201d said Sally Yu, investment associate at King River Capital, a web3 venture capital fund based in Sydney.\n\n\u201cBut finally users were going to be able to withdraw ether from the network. It\u2019s quite a milestone in the development of this technology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin vs ethereum\n\nEthereum, which operates like a global computer, allows developers to publish and execute applications powered by smart contracts. These are programmable scripts that facilitate the flow of digital assets.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, ethereum had operated like its older crypto-cousin bitcoin.\n\nThousands of computers had been crunching through mathematical puzzles to secure and verify an enormous, decentralised ledger that tracked the movement of these immutable but programmable digital assets.\n\nRather than a bank monitoring and recording money transactions, a decentralised network of computers did. And rather than individual dollars, they were tiny computer programs.\n\nBut in 2020, the Ethereum Foundation decided to change this model. Rather than rely on thousands of \u201cminers\u201d in the Proof-of-Work system, they wanted to reduce the power consumption and move to what\u2019s known as a Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of crunching through mathematical problems, chewing up power, ethereum would invite users of the network to \u201cpledge\u201d their money \u2013 in the form of ether \u2013 to verify and confirm blocks of transactions as they passed across the ledger.\n\nThese pledges were made through a kind of server called a \u201cnode\u201d. Theoretically, anybody could set up a node, and across Australia several companies were quick to try it out.\n\nValidating transactions\n\nDavid Lavecky, chief executive of Canvas Digital, a payments provider helping the Reserve Bank of Australia with its crypto experiments, had previously been a large ethereum miner.\n\n\u201cBut when the mining stopped all that equipment became obsolete,\u201d Lavecky said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t bother us too much because this new mechanism is much more efficient.\u201d\n\nCanvas was quick to begin running nodes out of Sydney, as were DACM and a distributed ledger technology provider called Trovio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd The Australian Financial Review spoke with two individual software engineers in Brisbane who confirmed they were running one node apiece from their respective offices.\n\nAs it stands, there are roughly 156 validator nodes running across Australia, which account for about 2.2 per cent of all Ethereum activity. In total, there are around 7211 nodes, with the bulk of validators coming from the United States and Germany.\n\nIn return for correctly verifying the millions of ethereum transactions that take place every day, node validators receive a financial reward, paid in ether.\n\nBut if you, or your node, incorrectly verified a transaction block, your \u201cpledged\u201d stash of cryptocurrency would be burnt and lost. The idea was to hold the money to ransom and incentivise participants to keep the system honest.\n\nIt\u2019s also touted as a deflationary system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inbuilt mechanism that means a certain amount of ether is burned as part of the transaction. This helps stabilise the total circulation,\u201d Canvas\u2019 Lavecky said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo participate, each participant is required to stake at least 32 ether, which was worth about $60,000 at the time, or pool funds through some third parties.\n\nIn September last year, the switch to the proof-of-stake system took place. The Ethereum mainnet merged with the Beacon Chain, the original \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d blockchain, and the miners were switched off.\n\nThe rush of those wanting to sign up to validate the new network was immediate. Within two months, 15 million ether \u2013 worth about $US18 billion at the time \u2013 was staked.\n\nAt the time, the network calculated it would begin paying yields returning about 5 per cent on average per validator.\n\nBut the Ethereum Foundation, run by the blockchain\u2019s Russian-Canadian creator Vitalik Buterin, held back on allowing the participating nodes to withdraw their rewards.\n\nAt the time, Buterin and his team outlined the risk of placing too much stress on the network all at once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut after many months of work, and a steady stream of new \u201cstakers\u201d signing up to secure and benefit from Ethereum\u2019s new \u2018proof of stake\u2019 system, the Shanghai upgrade was ready to launch.\n\nYouTube party\n\nThat\u2019s what brings us to April 12. And the thousands of node participants were able to begin withdrawing their staking rewards. At the time, there was about $US36.7 billion of ether locked up for staking.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the Ethereum Foundation was reminding participants that they needed to have upgraded their software to be compatible with the changes.\n\nA watch party on YouTube sprang up, with more than 25,000 onlookers from around the world. Buterin and the developer team took questions. And while it was mostly a celebratory mood, there was an underlying tension.\n\nThe price of ethereum, which had been under pressure for months thanks to the collapse of high-profile crypto exchanges like FTX and Celsius, could take a hit if things didn\u2019t go to plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne analyst said: \u201cThis could still be volatile. There is a queue forming for [ether] withdrawals, and the looming sell pressure from Kraken, Celsius and others \u2013 that have to un-stake.\u201d\n\nBut as 8.30am ticked over, the software upgrade loaded, and it was done. The YouTube watching party broke out into applause and cheers.\n\nA musician called Jonathan Mann launched into a song, singing the YouTube comments out in a real-time performance.\n\n\u201cFor something that was securing billions of dollars, with huge teams working on it all around the world, it all went as expected,\u201d Lavecky said.\n\n\u201cI suppose you can say it was a bit of anticlimax, though a very welcome one.\u201d\n\nThe price of ethereum began rallying immediately. Hours after the upgrade, it rallied above $US2,000 for the first time in almost a year. In the following days, it jumped higher and higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat laid to rest concerns that potential heavy selling pressure would hit the market after the Shanghai upgrade because locked ether would suddenly flood into the market.\n\nBut the withdrawal process doesn\u2019t happen instantly or overnight, and much of the staked ether was sitting at a loss.\n\n\u201cThe amount of ETH entering the market from Shanghai withdrawals is much lower than what was previously expected,\u201d said Matt Maximo, research analyst at Grayscale."

However, ETH struggled to clear the $1,920 resistance and started another decline, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,900 support zone. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,838 swing low to the $1,914 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also testing the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,838 swing low to the $1,914 high.\n\nIf the price stays above the $1,865 support, it could attempt a fresh increase. Immediate resistance is near the $1,900 zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. A proper move above the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,940.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance sits near $1,965, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,000. Any more gains above the $2,000 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,868 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,855 zone. If there is a break below the $1,855 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support.

Ethereum experienced a slightly less drastic drop of 1.6%, trading at $1,870.\n\nInterestingly, this uptick in social media chatter stands in stark contrast to recent trends in the global interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies has noticeably cooled off. Google Trends data shows that global interest in cryptocurrency has dipped to levels not seen since December 2020, marking a significant downturn in public engagement with the crypto sphere.\n\nDespite waning search interest, the increased Twitter conversations might hint at sustained or resurgent interest among a specific group of internet users. It is worth noting that Twitter, with its characteristic brevity and real-time updates, has often been the platform of choice for crypto enthusiasts and experts alike.\n\nNevertheless, it is still too early to declare a definitive rebound in wider public interest in cryptocurrencies based on this social media metric. It would be far-fetched to assume that Twitter chatter might forecast a revival of the struggling crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum on exchanges hits a five-year low.\n\nThe number of ETH holders grows steadily as the price hovers around $1,900.\n\nNew data indicated a dwindling influx of Ethereum onto exchanges in the past few weeks. The most recent chart analysis revealed that the current balance of Ethereum on exchanges reached a new nadir, indicating a decline in overall liquidity on these platforms.\n\nEthereum on exchanges decline\n\nGlassnode Alerts recently unveiled a chart showcasing the ongoing decline of Ethereum on exchanges. It also showed that each passing day marked a new record low.\n\nThe latest data from Glassnode indicated that the current balance of ETH on exchanges stood at approximately 17.2 million, marking the lowest point witnessed in the past five years.\n\nComparatively, back in January, the balance on exchanges exceeded 19 million; at the start of May, it surpassed 18 million.\n\nThis downward trend implied a reduction in available liquidity within exchanges. However, it is important to note that a decrease in ETH on exchanges does not necessarily indicate a decrease in ETH holders.\n\nEthereum holders remain steady\n\nWhile it may seem that Ethereum is leaving exchanges at a higher rate than it is being deposited, the dynamics surrounding the total number of ETH holders tell a different story.\n\nThe Santiment chart showed a steady increase in the number of ETH holders. Currently, approximately 100 million individuals hold varying amounts of ETH.\n\nThis growth has been gradual, with around 98.4 million holders reported at the end of April.\n\nThe declining balance on exchanges and the simultaneous growth in the number of holders can be attributed to two main factors: self-custody and staking.\n\nFirstly, more individuals opt for self-custody, holding their ETH in personal wallets rather than leaving them on centralized exchanges. It provides users with greater control and security over their assets.\n\nSecondly, staking has become increasingly popular. Staking involves locking up a certain amount of Ethereum to participate in the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn return for securing the network, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional ETH. It incentivizes users to hold their ETH in staking contracts rather than on exchanges. As of this writing, the total number of ETH deposits for staking was over 780,000 and growing.\n\nThe ETH TVL and price\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) remained steadfast. As of this writing, the TVL stood at approximately $27.35 billion, accounting for over half of the overall TVL.\n\nThis signified a continual influx of liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem, emphasizing ETH\u2019s ongoing relevance and significance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, a glance at CoinMarketCap data revealed that ETH boasted the third-highest trading volume in the last 24 hours. The total volume of the entire cryptocurrency market surpassed $19 billion, with ETH contributing over $3 billion in trading volume.\n\nFurthermore, ETH maintained its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trailing behind Bitcoin. As of this writing, ETH was trading at approximately $1,900."

        "content": "Memecoins and MEV bot activity affected Ethereum\u2019s gas usage.\n\nRise in NFT trades, increased selling pressure on ETH holders, and shifting trader behavior observed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] historically high gas prices have often deterred users from using the network, leading them to explore alternative protocols. However, the recent decline in gas usage could have positive implications for both Ethereum and ETH in the future.\n\nEthereum is gassed up\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, Ethereum\u2019s daily average gas reached its lowest point in the past two months. As of 3 June, the average gas stood at 24gwei, with the press time gas at 17gwei.\n\nThe decrease in gas fees may be attributed to the recent hype surrounding memecoins, which has increased activity on the network. The utilization of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots could have further contributed to the decline as well.\n\nMEV bots are automated systems that leverage transaction sequencing to exploit profitable opportunities in the Ethereum network. The prevalence of these bots can impact gas fees by optimizing transaction execution, potentially reducing costs for users.\n\nThe NFT angle\n\nThere was consistent gas usage in the Ethereum protocol, facilitated by low gas fees. Moreover, the number of NFT trades on the Ethereum network rose alongside.\n\nNotably, prominent blue-chip NFTs like MAYC and Azuki drove the surge in NFT volume. DappRadar\u2019s data indicated that over the past week, the volume of these NFTs increased by 29.9% and 129% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, was trading at $1,873 at press time. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio increased over the last month, suggesting that the profitability of addresses holding ETH is relatively high.\n\nThis could incentivize these address holders to sell and secure profits, potentially impacting the price of ETH in the near future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nLastly, the put-to-call ratio for Ethereum has declined during this period. This indicates a shift in trader behavior, with a decreased interest in protective put options relative to call options.\n\nSuch a trend may suggest growing optimism among traders regarding the future price movement of Ethereum."

Multiple companies have gone bust, and digital asset prices have plummeted.\n\nThe price has somewhat rebounded for Ethereum (ETH) since the local bottom of around $850.\n\nHowever, on Monday, one of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders transferred millions of dollars worth of ETH to a Kraken address, causing speculation that the ETH had been dumped.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Transfers 22,000 ETH\n\nETH has been enjoying quite steady growth since the start of the year, being up by around 51%.\n\nHowever, the recent move by one of the co-founders of Ethereum has made ETH investors uneasy. Jeffrey Wilcke transferred 22,000 ETH on Monday to another address, then moved it to Kraken.\n\nAt the time of the transfer, 22,000 ETH was worth around $41 million.\n\nJeffrey Wilcke ( the co-founder of Ethereum ) deposited 22K $ETH($41M) to #Kraken 2 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nAnd the price of $ETH dropped by 0.4%.\n\n\n\nAccording to the -2% Depth data on #Kraken, he should not have sold all of the $ETH.https://t.co/ps5Th79BWu pic.twitter.com/HVbEV5IMrf \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 5, 2023\n\nMore interestingly, Wilcke transferred the ETH just hours before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced its lawsuit against Binance. The price of ether then dropped by around 5%.\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,816, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThis was Wilcke\u2019s first transaction on that address in more than two years. In January 2023, Wilcke transferred 9,999 ETH to a different address, from which he then moved to a Kraken-labeled address.\n\nWilcke\u2019s transfer of 22,000 ETH comes just a month after the Ethereum Foundation sold 15,000 ETH.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWilcke still holds over 150,000 ETH, worth around $272 million.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSeeing what ETH insiders do helps better position oneself as a trader and investor.

        "content": "Quick take:\n\nA report by Nansen indicates that 67% of newly minted Ethereum NFTs are profitable.\n\nThe report also points out the declining number of new NFTs mints since the summer.\n\nThe current number of mints is the lowest since June 2021.\n\nThe NFT market has plummeted since June last year. Some say NFTs are dead, while others try to avoid being associated with the term completely. Yet despite the slump, Nansen Research has come up with some interesting statistics.\n\nAccording to a report published Monday, 67% of freshly minted Ethereum NFTs are profitable, which means their floor prices remain above the auction price.\n\nHowever, according to Nansen Research, new NFT mints have been on a decline since the summer, which could explain why the profitability rate remains high.\n\n\u201cNew NFT mints have been on a decline since summer, with NFTs minted in May being 65% lower than that in April, AND the lowest it\u2019s been since June \u201921,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet.\n\nSource: Nansen.ai/Twitter\n\nAs demonstrated in the graph above, NFT profits tend to be higher in the first few days after the mint before declining in the days after.\n\nEthereum NFTs still dominate the industry in terms of volume traded. According to a Dune Analytics board prepared by Hildobby, Ethereum NFTs generated nearly $139 million in transaction volume in May 2023, excluding wash trading. That is a significant decline from this year\u2019s best month of more than $650 million reported in February.\n\nSource: Hildobdy/Dune Analytics\n\nNonetheless, the data shows that the NFT market has rebounded significantly since the start of the year compared to the decline experienced in the second half of 2022.\n\nThe NFT market registered the best period during the first quarter of 2022, largely driven by the launch of the LooksRare NFT marketplace and X2Y2, albeit with significant volume driven by wash trading activity.\n\nA significant bump witnessed in February this year was a result of a ripple effect created by the emergence of Ordinals NFTs, which seemed to reignite the market.\n\n****\n\nStay up to date:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!"

This innovative application empowers users to customize their search results by setting specific parameters using publicly available data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Advanced Filter acts as a search spotlight, allowing users to narrow down results based on their specific requirements. This focused search tool enables users to delve into the most relevant data points for their research, transaction tracking, or investigative needs.\n\nOne notable advantage of the Advanced Filter is its potential to enhance monitoring capabilities for non-fungible token (NFT) lending operations on platforms like Blur. Analysts can swiftly identify leading NFT collections utilized as loan securities using the filters. The tool also provides data on loan requests, identifying popular NFT collections in the lending sphere and assessing the demand for NFT-backed loans.\n\nWhile this tool shows promise, it is still a work in progress and requires refinement. Presently, the filter does not exclude tokens with unfavorable reputations, and there is no option to maintain a blacklist. Nonetheless, news of this development has generated enthusiasm among data analysts and blockchain investigators on Twitter. Many believe that this tool could significantly streamline the process of tracing fund movements associated with fraudulent activities and breaches.\n\nSuggestions for further enhancements have also emerged, including integrating public address name tags into Etherscan's API. Such enhancements could reduce the time spent manually combing through the website for on-chain sleuths. If realized, these advancements could pave the way for more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain analysis tools in the future.\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "Etherscan has recently implemented an advanced filter as a means to streamline and expedite the process of blockchain analysis. The advanced filter facilitates quick access to desired data by enabling users to refine their searches. Etherscan serves as a platform for exploring blocks and analyzing data on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform encompasses a range of features such as transaction history, smart contract data, a block explorer, token information, analytics, and an API.\n\nIndividuals who are keen on expanding their knowledge about the Ethereum blockchain or undertaking research on Ethereum-driven initiatives will discover that the analytical tool is an indispensable asset. It is a common practice among traders and investors to frequently utilize it for monitoring the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEtherscan is an open-source project that is free of cost and is maintained by a team of software engineers. With a global user base of millions, this Ethereum blockchain explorer is among the most extensively utilized. According to Etherscan, the advanced filter enables users to search for transactions based on various criteria such as transaction type, function name, duration, amount, assets, and address sensitivity (sending and receiving addresses). In addition, users have the ability to save their filter queries for future use.\n\nThe significance of the Web3 analytics sector has grown progressively over the years. They are advantageous in terms of understanding the decentralized web ecosystem and making well-informed decisions. Their services encompass network monitoring, data analysis, smart contract auditing, portfolio tracking, and real-time monitoring of blockchain networks. These tools offer insights into user engagement, network usage patterns, and market trends. Additional examples comprise CryptoQuant, Covalent, the Graph, Dune Analytics, Nansen, and Alethio, alongside Etherscan.\n\nIn April 2023, Etherscan implemented a feature to hide token transfers with zero value as a means of enhancing its user experience. Recently, the platform has also broadened its scope by collaborating with the WEMIX3.0 ecosystem.\n\nTo utilize Etherscan\u2019s latest functionality for filtering transaction types, adhere to the following steps:\n\nBegin by selecting \u201cAll\u201d to include all transaction types.\n\nNext, focus on transactions where an Externally Owned Address (EOA) or wallet address sends ETH directly to other addresses.\n\nThen, consider \u201cInternal Txs,\u201d resulting from smart contract logic triggered by regular transactions.\n\nDirect your attention to \u201cERC-20\u201d transactions involving transactions related to ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFinally, explore \u201cERC-721\u201d transactions, which involve transactions related to non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nFurthermore, the latest filter feature includes the following transaction types:\n\n\u201cERC-1155\u201d encompasses transactions involving semi-fungible ERC-1155 tokens (SFTs).\n\n\u201cDeposit\u201d narrows down transactions involving the deposit of ETH into the Beacon Chain Contract for Ethereum validation purposes.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal\u201d covers transactions related to the withdrawal of ETH from the Beacon Chain. This can include automatic reward withdrawals or exiting as a validator.\n\nThe analysis of DeFi exploits can be a complex task, often involving multiple addresses and requiring a comprehensive understanding of the incident. Previously, executing this process necessitated the simultaneous opening of numerous Etherscan windows.\n\n\ud83c\udd95 Advanced Filter (Beta) Refine your Ethereum transaction search with rich filters \ud83d\udd0d pic.twitter.com/DIb5ESYmNP \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) June 2, 2023\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Filter tool offered by Etherscan is a valuable resource for community members as it allows them to streamline their analysis by combining results from various filter fields. This results in a more comprehensive understanding of the exploit at hand. Please take into account the Euler attack that transpired in March of 2023.

        "title": "Ethereum gas fees rising amid meme coin hype - crypto.news",
        "content": "It is widely recognized that cryptocurrencies are subject to volatility, which is no longer a surprising fact. The crypto winter in 2022 led to several incidents and events that brought digital currencies to the forefront of discussions. As anticipated, much of the attention revolved around bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), the two largest coins in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhile in the case of bitcoin, the focus fell entirely on the price drop, Ethereum made the news for several other reasons.\n\nThere are plenty of resources out there on how to open an account on an exchange platform or how to buy Ethereum. However, the most crucial step when getting into crypto is research. One must learn about the project\u2019s history and development to understand its pros and cons and make informed trading and investing decisions.\n\nYou might also like: Binance launches 10 week summer internship program\n\nSo, Ethereum\u2019s evolution over the past months has been interesting. After undergoing its biggest upgrade since inception, known as the Merge, on Sep. 15, 2022, Ethereum managed to complete the final step in the long-awaited transition from proof-of-work (POW) to proof-of-stake (POS) with its latest upgrade, Shanghai, which took place on April 12, 2023.\n\nEthereum is again in the spotlight due to its rising gas fees that reached a 12-month high of 240 gwei on May 5; an increase most likely fueled by the buzz surrounding meme coins.\n\nEthereum gas fees explained\n\nFor individuals not well-versed in the Ethereum network, explaining gas fees and their significance is crucial. Ethereum encompasses more than just a cryptocurrency that can be purchased or traded on exchange platforms.\n\nIt is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform with numerous use cases and applications, accompanied by its native coin called ether (ETH).\n\nAlthough \u201cEthereum\u201d and \u201cEther\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, they refer to distinct entities, which can lead to confusion.\n\nTherefore, the Ethereum platform can be used to develop other crypto projects, conduct transactions and run smart contracts. However, to carry out these actions, users must pay certain fees for utilizing the network\u2019s resources, commonly called gas.\n\nThis represents the computational effort required for the execution of an operation on the Ethereum network. The gas price is expressed in gwei, tiny fractions of ether. One gwei is worth 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nGas prices also vary based on supply and demand and the volume of validation requests on the network.\n\nOn top of that, gas fees serve as an incentive for Ethereum validators, as they get to receive these fees for staking their tokens, verifying transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. As a result, higher gas fees may lead to faster transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nHow the new meme coin season is rising Ethereum gas fees\n\nPaying gas fees is not a new practice for Ethereum users since this feature has been embedded in the platform\u2019s structure since the beginning. However, using the Ethereum network has become costlier as gas fees rise, reaching unprecedented levels. A recent analysis shows that a user had to pay a whopping $118,600 worth of ETH for only one transaction.\n\nGas fees have fluctuated significantly, so these rising values are expected. In May 2022, the gas price hit a high of 150 gwei. In the months leading to the Merge, the price gradually dropped and hovered around 20 gwei.\n\nTherefore, it was less common for gas fees to spike after the completion of the upgrade. Although the Merge didn\u2019t target this issue directly, lowering gas fees was viewed as a by-product of the overhaul, given that switching from miners to validators was expected to help de-congest the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, since gas fees have gone up by more than 50% since April, it\u2019s clear that these expectations haven\u2019t been met. This unexpected surge is probably caused by the latest meme hype that has taken over the crypto sphere. The rise in activity on the Ethereum network coincides with listing the newly-launched meme coin, PEPE, on Binance can\u2019t be just a mere coincidence.\n\nAfter being pushed to the fringes of the crypto industry, the meme scene has entered a period of revival with the emergence of the PEPE token, an Ethereum-based meme coin that has been making waves in the crypto sphere. It began in April this year when the number of active addresses on Ethereum increased by 20,000 since November 2021.\n\nSince PEPE is now listed on all major crypto exchanges and its price soared over a few days, traders wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to cash in on the hype. With more people jumping on the meme bandwagon, the Ethereum network saw a spike in user activity. As a direct consequence, gas fees rose in tandem.\n\nHigher gas prices translate into higher revenue for the network. The fact that users are also eager to trade new coins shows that they\u2019re gaining more confidence, which can help solidify Ethereum\u2019s position in the market. However, there\u2019s also a downside to these events.\n\nGas fees have always been a highly debated topic among crypto enthusiasts and for a good reason. As the gas price rises, it can impede users who want to perform low-value transactions or smart contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say if gas fees will return to more reasonable values as the meme craze cools off. However, it\u2019s helpful to monitor this association closely from now on.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

BTC volume stood at approximately $20.32 billion, rising 76% in the last 24 hours.\"The latest development between Binance and SEC has spooked the global crypto market resulting in a bloodbath across digital assets. The market will respond sharply as the Binance-SEC saga unfolds; we should brace ourselves for a choppy market in the coming weeks. Regulatory clarity is the need of the hour for the global crypto ecosystem,\" Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said.The world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged in a June 5 court filing that the firm operated a \"web of deception\" that included artificially inflating its trading volumes and commingling customer funds.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also sued Binance over regulatory violations in March.Other top crypto tokens were also trading lower. BNB and Solana declined by over 7%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin XRP , Cardano, Polygon and Polkadot also traded with cuts.

        "content": "The average gas fee \u2014 transaction fee \u2014 on the Ethereum network has cooled substantially in the first week of June after reaching a multimonth high in May, owing to the memecoin frenzy and much maximal extractable value (MEV) bot activities.\n\nThe average gas fee has decreased to $7.34, an almost one-third drop from last month\u2019s high of $20. In terms of gwei \u2014 a denomination of Ether ETHUSD that represents one-billionth of one ETH \u2014 the daily median gas price has decreased to 24 gwei from a peak of almost 140 gwei last month, according to Dune Analytics. Cointelegraph\n\nThe memecoin frenzy started in late April and took center stage in May, leading to multiple new memecoins hitting the markets, such as Aped (APED), Bobo Coin (BOBO) and others. The dominance of memecoins in network activity was so high that it created an unusual shift in the top 10 gas-burning altcoins. Instead of ETH, Wrapped Ether (WETH), or Tether USDTUSD, memecoins such as Troll (TROLL), APED and BOBO became the top 10 spenders.\n\nSantiment @santimentfeed \u26fd\ufe0f A highly unusual shift in top 10 gas burning #altcoins has emerged today. Instead of $ETH, $WETH, and $USDT being at the top of the fee distribution list, we're seeing new assets like $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO among them. Read our latest deep dive. https://t.co/7SlmJ59k2m pic.twitter.com/Y2kaLKZTrL\n\nAnother prominent reason for the rise in the Ethereum gas fees was the surging popularity of memecoins on decentralized platforms, with mainstream centralized exchanges taking longer to list them.\n\nMay was not just about the Ethereum memecoin frenzy; Bitcoin Ordinals also gained significant popularity. Ordinals enable decentralized storage of digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, the Bitcoin network registered many new memecoins, with Pepecoin (PEPE) achieving a billion-dollar market capitalization.\n\nOrdinals were introduced in January, and by the end of May, the number of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain had surpassed 10 million. Total fees paid for Ordinals inscriptions rose 700% in May to currently sit at 1,639 Bitcoin BTCUSD. Cointelegraph\n\nWith the memecoin frenzy dying down, Ethereum gas fees have cooled, and Ordinals inscriptions have also decreased significantly."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Solana: Which is Better for Investment? - ClearTax",
        "content": "Ethereum has been one of the most popular blockchains dominating the scene of dApps development. It also facilitates faster and safer payments across the globe. But now, another blockchain has been raging the market \u2013 Solana.\n\nReleased on 16 March 2020, Solana has addressed many issues that Ethereum users have been facing and has risen to a position to act as a viable alternative. Indeed, 2021 has been the year of Solana.\n\nHere\u2019s a competitive analysis between Ethereum and Solana.\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Mechanism\n\nThe performance of both these blockchains depends a lot on the mechanism they use. Ethereum uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism that Bitcoin uses. The network miners take part in this process. This ensures that the network stays decentralised, but there is a catch. The participating barrier within the network is high. This leads to fewer transactions on the network per second and reduces the network\u2019s performance as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana uses the Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism. This protocol cryptographically determines the time passage between two events. The mechanism further adds timestamps to track the order of each transaction.\n\nThis difference in mechanism solves the problem of Ethereum and Bitcoin, where transactions on the blockchain are not logged promptly.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Architecture\n\nEthereum uses a \u2018stateful\u2019 architecture in which all the miners on the network must update their copy of the network each time a new transaction occurs.\n\nThis may seem like a decentralised way to maintain records; however, it slows down the entire process.\n\nSolana solves this problem by using a \u2018stateless architecture\u2019. As all the transactions are time-stamped, the entire network does not need to update itself for each transaction. The updates are processed sequentially, leading to an overall speeding up of the entire process.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana transaction: Speed\n\nThe current version of Ethereum can process approximately 13-15 transactions per second. However, platforms like Polygon serve as a multi-chain Ethereum scaling platform. It helps increase the number of nodes in the network, thereby enhancing the transaction load.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, does not need Layer-2 solutions to speed up its transactions. It uses a Turbine block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller fragments. This process, in turn, makes data transfer across the network an easy task. The entire mechanism helps the blockchain perform at a whopping 50,000 transactions per second.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Smart contracts\n\nEthereum is considered to be Turing complete. This unique feature helps it support a variation in programmability, which helps it to create different smart contracts. Ethereum also uses Solidity as a base programming language for coding its smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana uses Sealevel to manage its smart contracts. Compared to the traditional EVM-based contracts, Sealevel uses a stateless mode and contains only program logic.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: NFTs\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in NFTs, you probably have heard of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces. OpenSea is a famous example in this respect. It runs on the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and aims to build a vibrant open digital economy. This platform supports cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH/WETH), SOL, USDC, and DAI. The wallets that support OpenSea are:\n\nMetaMask\n\nCoinbase Wallet\n\nWalletConnect\n\nPhantom\n\nGlow\n\nFortmatic\n\nKaikas\n\nBitski and many more\n\nFor minting NFTs on OpenSea, there is no fee. On the final sale, you must pay 2.5% as a service fee. There is also a Creator\u2019s fee of 10%.\n\nSolSea is Solana\u2019s NFT marketplace with integrated minting. It uses ALL.ART Protocol has embedded licenses called NFT-PROs for its non-fungible tokens. You can buy NFTs on this marketplace with fiat currencies using Moonpay or FTX Pay. The compatible wallets are:\n\nPhantom\n\nCoin98\n\nLedger\n\nSolflare\n\nTorus\n\nSollet\n\nSlope\n\nSolSea does not have bidding options like OpenSea, but they plan to implement them soon.\n\nThere is a 3% marketplace fee for every successful NFT sale. You can also choose your own creator\u2019s fee.\n\nEthereum and Solana have transaction fees for minting, listing and delisting, which are not refundable. The method to open an account and mint NFTs is similar on both platforms.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: DeFi ecosystem\n\nEthereum has many decentralised finance applications that cater to billions of users. Top Ethereum DeFi apps are:\n\nMetaMask Swap\n\nSushi\n\nPolygon POS Bridge\n\nBungee\n\nLibera.Financial\n\nCowSwap\n\nHEX\n\nAave V2\n\nShibaSwap and many more\n\nComparatively, Raydium, Saber, Serum, etc., are a few DeFi apps available on Solana. Being new to the blockchain world, this platform\u2019s DeFi ecosystem is yet to grow to a larger scale.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Investment\n\n\n\nEthereum and Solana both have their pros and cons. The former has been an older player in this field and thus has a larger market cap than the latter. However, with its new technologies, Solana has addressed many issues that Ethereum users face.\n\nFirstly it\u2019s the network congestion. On busy days, Ethereum transactions can be a real pain to process. Additionally, the higher gas fees are also an issue that needs addressing. However, with its vast DeFi marketplace, Ethereum gives its users many opportunities to diversify their assets.\n\nThe growth of Solana has been worth noticing, especially throughout 2021. It is too early to judge as the ecosystem is relatively new. However, it does have the potential to make its mark in the future.\n\nBoth the native tokens of Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (Ether) are available for purchase from the following exchanges:\n\nKuCoin\n\nBinance\n\nUphold and many more\n\nAs an investor, you should look at the opportunities present in both ecosystems. Conducting thorough research on these blockchains and planning your investment accordingly is the best way to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Last year\u2019s merge to ETH 2.0 was supposed to fix high gas-fee issues, and while it went a long way in addressing them\u2014recent buyer demand has shown that they can still become expensive.

DappRadar\u2019s data indicated that over the past week, the volume of these NFTs increased by 29.9% and 129% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, was trading at US$1,873 at press time. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio increased over the last month, suggesting that the profitability of addresses holding ETH is relatively high.\n\nThis could incentivize these address holders to sell and secure profits, potentially impacting the price of ETH shortly.\n\nLayer 2 Ethereum (ETH) solutions are gaining interest as they solve the scalability difficulties within Ethereum (ETH), which have resulted in high Ethereum (ETH) gas prices since 2020.\n\nEthereum (ETH) smart contract implementation on Layer 2 has increased by 160% yearly, indicating increased Ethereum (ETH) development activity. Some experts say sharding the Ethereum (ETH) network may also assist in cutting gas prices.\n\nFollowing the execution of the Shanghai update last week, approximately 1 million staked ETH worth more than US$2 billion were removed. The long-awaited update went live on April 12th, allowing the withdrawal of staked ETH. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is rest at the US$1.8k barrier.\n\n5 ways to reduce the Ethereum gas prices\n\nUse Simulation Through DeFi Saver\n\nYou don\u2019t know the actual gas fee until you carry out the transaction and pay for the gas. However, you could use the DeFi Saver app to simulate your transactions. First, you\u2019ll create a recipe for Ethereum activities and then run it virtually.\n\nUse a Layer-2 Blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet, also known as Layer One, is frequently congested, making transactions costly. Layer-two blockchains offer users the ability to scale up their transactions, and they do so by utilizing technologies such as Rollups and side chains.\n\nPick your transaction times carefully\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum transaction fees, timing matters. According to gasprice.io, a handy resource for checking real-time gas fees, gas prices usually peak sometime between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Eastern Time. Saturdays and Sundays are usually the cheapest days to transact in ETH. A good rule of thumb is that the cheapest time to make ETH transactions is typically outside of working hours in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nUse DApps That Offer Rebates and Discounts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to avoid Ethereum gas fees is to use Ethereum projects and dApps that offer fee subsidies or nominal fees. If you are looking for such a platform, Balancer is a great one. The platform refunds the gas fees up to 90 percent in the form of BAL tokens. Balancer minimizes the gas fees for high-frequency traders by carrying out traders that don\u2019t leave the vault.\n\nSort Transaction Types\n\nDepending on the sort of transaction, the gas fee varies on the Ethereum blockchain. To save money on gas fees, users may wish to organize and implement similar transactions simultaneously. Consider that they have two Ethereum addresses, each containing 1,000 tokens. Now, if users intend to store all tokens in a new DApp\u2019s crypt to earn higher returns.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) recent hard fork, enabling users to withdraw staked Ether, is poised to position the cryptocurrency as a formidable contender against US treasury bills in the coming years, according to VanEck, a US asset manager controlling a $69 billion exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBecause of this, along with expectations that ETH will account for 70% of smart contract protocols, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency could hit $11,800 in 2030, VanEck said in its recently released Ethereum price prediction report.\n\n\u201cAssuming ETH takes a 70% market among smart contract protocols, this implies a token price of $11.8k in 2030, which we discount to $5.3k today at a 12% cost of capital derived from ETH\u2019s recent beta.\u201d \u2013 VanEck wrote in the report.\n\nIf VanEck\u2019s projections were to materialize, it implies that Ethereum would see a price increase of 531% by 2030 from its current levels.\n\nFurther, VanEck also sees ETH network revenues surging from an annual rate of $2.6 billion to as high as $51 billion in 2030.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Calculations\n\nVanEck said the latest price forecast was made using cash flow projections and fully diluted valuation (FDV) calculations. More specifically, the fund manager evaluated Ethereum by estimating cash flows for the year that ended on April 30, 2030.\n\nThe asset manager arrived at its cash flow figures by projecting Ethereum revenues and deducting a global tax rate and a validator revenue cut. Then, VanEck said it used multiple estimates by applying a long-term estimated cash flow of 7%, minus the long-term crypto growth rate of 4%.\n\nFinally, the investment arrived at the FDV in 2030, divided that figure by the expected number of tokens in circulation, and discounted the final number by 12%.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH was changing hands at $1,870, down 1.82% in the past 24 hours.\n\nETH 1-day price data.

        "content": "The first week of June the crypto market experienced a sharp decline in Ethereum network gas fees, which fell to $7.34 from a peak of $20 in May. Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bot usage and the waning memecoin mania are blamed for the fall. This decrease in gas costs might benefit Ethereum and its native currency, ETH, in the long run.\n\nMemecoin frenzy and MEV bots contribute to lower gas prices on Ethereum\n\nAccording to on-data, the average gas price, or transaction fee, on the Ethereum network dramatically dropped in the first week of June after reaching a multimonth high in May. This occurred as a result of the memecoin frenzy and multiple maximal extractable value (MEV) bot activity.\n\nThe typical gas price is now $7.34, down almost a third from the peak of $20 last month. The market experienced the release of numerous new memecoins, including Aped (APED), Bobo Coin (BOBO), and others, as a result of the memecoin frenzy, which began in late April and gained prominence in May.\n\nSource: Dune Analytics\n\nAverage gas fees on Ethereum in the past six months. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nThere was an interesting movement in the top 10 gas-burning altcoins as a result of memecoins\u2019 overwhelming dominance in network activity. Memecoins like Troll (TROLL), APED, and BOBO ranked in the top 10 spenders rather than ETH, Wrapped Ether (WETH), or Tether.\n\n\u26fd\ufe0f A highly unusual shift in top 10 gas burning #altcoins has emerged today. Instead of $ETH, $WETH, and $USDT being at the top of the fee distribution list, we're seeing new assets like $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO among them. Read our latest deep dive. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/7SlmJ59k2m pic.twitter.com/Y2kaLKZTrL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 19, 2023\n\nAccording to the report, memecoins are becoming increasingly popular on decentralized platforms. As a result, mainstream centralized exchanges are taking longer to list them, which is another significant factor in the increase in Ethereum gas fees.\n\nNot only was the Ethereum memecoin craze in May, but Bitcoin Ordinals also saw a substantial increase in popularity. On the bitcoin blockchain, ordinals allow for decentralized storage of digital art. The bitcoin network, as a result, recorded numerous new memecoins, with Pepecoin (PEPE) reaching a $1 billion market cap.\n\nThe first Ordinals were released in January, and by the end of May, there were over 10 million inscriptions of them on the bitcoin blockchain. In May, the total fees paid for inscriptions on Ordinals increased by 700%, and they now stand at 1,639 Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Dune Analytics\n\nDue to the waning memecoin mania, Ethereum gas fees have been reduced and there have been sharp drops in both Ordinals inscriptions and gas fees.\n\nHow the rise of memecoins influenced Ethereum\u2019s gas charges\n\nETH\u2019s historically high gas prices have frequently discouraged users from utilizing the network, prompting them to investigate alternative protocols. However, the current drop in gas consumption may have favorable long-term effects for both Ethereum and ETH.\n\nEthereum is gassed up\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, the daily average gas price for Ethereum dropped to its lowest point in the preceding two months. As of June 3, the national average gas price was 24 gwei; at press time, it was 17 gwei. Gas prices may have fallen as a result of the current hullabaloo surrounding memecoins, which has increased activity on the network. The use of MEV bots (Miner Extractable Value) may have also contributed to the decline.\n\nSource; Dune Analytics\n\nThe NFT Angle\n\nAutomated systems called MEV bots use transaction sequencing to take advantage of lucrative Ethereum network opportunities. By enhancing transaction execution, these bots\u2019 ubiquity may have an effect on gas prices, possibly lowering user expenses.\n\nLow gas prices made it possible for the Ethereum protocol to have consistent gas usage. The quantity of NFT trades on the Ethereum network also increased at the same time.\n\nSource; Santiment\n\nNotably, the increase in NFT volume was driven by well-known blue-chip NFTs like MAYC and Azuki. According to DappRadar\u2019s data, these NFTs\u2019 volume climbed by 29.9% and 129%, respectively, over the previous week.\n\nAt the time of publication, the price of ETH, the native crypto of Ethereum, was $1,873. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio grew over the previous month, indicating that addresses holding ETH are profitable to some extent.\n\nThis would encourage the owners of these addresses to sell and collect gains, which might have an effect on the price of ETH soon.\n\nShapella hard fork and ETH\u2019s price surge: Uncertain impact\n\nHopes that ETH would prosper after switching from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism were dashed, at least temporarily. The price of the coin dropped by 25% in the three months from the date of The Merge to the beginning of 2023, and it didn\u2019t recover to its pre-transition levels until six months later.\n\nThe price of ETH threatened to surpass $2,000 for the first time since May 2022 after the Shapella hard fork on April 12, 2023, but given the post-Merge depression, it is unclear what effect the move will have on the price of the coin.\n\nFollowing a planned takeover by Binance (BNB) and its eventual cancellation, the FTX (FTT) exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, causing a market drop that negatively impacted ETH."

        "title": "Polygon vs Optimism: How Do They Provide Enhancements to Ethereum? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, scalability solutions have come to the fore as the key to widespread adoption. Ethereum, one of the leading smart contract platforms, has given birth to an array of Layer 2 solutions, two of which are Polygon and Optimism. Both of these platforms provide enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s scalability, transaction speed, and cost-efficiency, albeit through distinct approaches.\n\nThis article will delve deep into both technologies, exploring their architecture, scalability solutions, transactional efficiencies, security measures, and more. We will also compare these platforms head-to-head, allowing you to understand which might better serve your needs in the diverse world of decentralized applications.\n\nPolygon vs Optimism: Major Differences\n\nPolygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network designed to provide a platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It transforms Ethereum into a fully-fledged multi-chain system by leveraging layer 2 technologies.\n\nOptimism, also known as Optimistic Ethereum, is another layer 2 scaling solution that increases the scalability of the Ethereum network, significantly reducing transaction costs and enhancing speeds. It uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups to accomplish these benefits.\n\nPolygon offers the Proof of Stake blockchain network as its primary product. This network serves as a layer 2 and a layer 1 blockchain aimed at reducing transaction fees and improving confirmation speeds for Ethereum. Since Polygon has its own consensus mechanism and deals with transaction security issues like double spends and 51% attacks, it can be considered as a layer 1 blockchain.\n\nHowever, Polygon is also classified as a layer 2 blockchain because it addresses Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem and enables asset bridging through plasma checkpoint-enabled bridges. To achieve this, Polygon uses smart contracts in its Ethereum layer to connect to the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon\u2019s architecture includes two layers: Heimdall and Bor. Heimdall is the proof of stake layer where block finalization and transaction validation happen. The Merkle root hash is published on the Ethereum Blockchain as well. The Bor layer\u2019s responsibility is to produce blocks by collecting all the transactions. The Heimdall layer validates these blocks.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism is a layer 2 blockchain protocol that operates independently from Ethereum. Its purpose is to alleviate congestion on Ethereum and assist with its scaling. Optimism achieves this by processing transactions and grouping them into batches, which are then verified on the Ethereum network. However, it is important to note that Ethereum still incurs costs for validating these transactions. Despite this, Optimism\u2019s transaction fees are significantly lower than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Optimism network is a layer 2 network that operates under the assumption that transactions are valid and not fraudulent, hence the term \u201coptimistic.\u201d However, if a transaction is found to be invalid, there is a 7-day window to challenge it before it becomes permanent and considered valid.\n\nUnderstanding the Technology Behind Polygon and Optimism\n\nPolygon and Optimism are both Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain. The main goal of these technologies is to solve the transaction speed and scalability issues that currently exist in the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon uses a technology known as \u2018secured chains\u2019 and \u2018standalone chains\u2019 based on the Ethereum protocol. It implements a four-layer system comprising the Ethereum layer, security layer, Polygon Networks layer, and Execution layer.\n\nOptimism uses Optimistic Rollup technology. It\u2019s a Layer 2 solution that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain, where computation is handled off-chain and data is stored on-chain. Optimism inherits the same security guarantees as Ethereum.\n\nHow do they achieve scalability?\n\nPolygon achieves scalability by utilizing side chains for off-chain computations while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.\n\nOptimism improves scalability by running smart contracts off-chain and only posting a small amount of data per transaction to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly increases transaction throughput.\n\nTransaction Speed and Cost\n\nPolygon provides a higher transaction speed due to its unique layered architecture. Optimism, while faster than Ethereum, still trails behind Polygon in raw throughput.\n\nBoth platforms offer significantly reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum. However, due to the batch processing of transactions, Polygon tends to be cheaper than Optimism.\n\nSecurity Measures\n\nPolygon combines the Plasma framework and PoS consensus mechanism to ensure security. It also includes optional \u2018checkpoints\u2019 to the Ethereum main chain for added security.\n\nOptimism leverages the security of the Ethereum mainnet by posting transaction data (not computation) to the chain, allowing disputes to be resolved as per Ethereum\u2019s consensus rules.\n\nTherefore, Optimism is more secure than Polygon because Optimism is built on Ethereum which has a larger number of validator nodes compared to Polygon. This means that all transactions on Optimism are validated and finalized on Ethereum, which is one of the most secure cryptocurrencies in the world after Bitcoin.\n\nOptimism, being a layer 2 built on the security of Ethereum, also has strong security. However, this does not imply that Polygon has poor security, as it is a network protocol with good security measures in place.\n\nNetwork Consensus Models\n\nPolygon employs a PoS consensus mechanism with validators who stake tokens for network security. It also utilizes Heimdall and Bor for block production and validation.\n\nOptimism does not have its own consensus mechanism. Instead, it relies on the underlying Ethereum network\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nDeveloper Experience\n\nPolygon provides a variety of developer-friendly tools like the Polygon SDK, and fosters a vibrant community. It is compatible with Ethereum tools, reducing the learning curve for developers.\n\nOptimism also supports Ethereum tooling and community infrastructure, providing a seamless experience for developers already familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring Decentralization: Optimism vs Polygon\n\nPolygon is more decentralized than Optimism, particularly because Optimism has one node called the sequencer. The sequencer is the block producer of Optimism; it submits all transactions from the Optimistic network to Ethereum.\n\nOptimism also remains decentralized as users can submit transactions to Ethereum through the CanonicalTransactionChain smart contract. However, linking Optimism to Ethereum through the smart contract eliminates the advantage of using Optimism instead of Ethereum, as individuals would have to pay the complete Ethereum transaction fee.\n\nOptimism is a network that maintains a degree of decentralization because it\u2019s built on Ethereum\u2019s decentralized platform. On the other hand, Polygon is made up of two layers, Heimdall and Bor, which makes it more decentralized compared to Optimism.\n\nAs Polygon operates on a proof of stake model, validation of transactions is carried out by validator nodes that are under the control of different parties. On the other hand, validation of blocks is the responsibility of Heimdall nodes, which are individual nodes chosen to validate the blocks produced by the Bor layer.\n\nAdoption and Use-cases\n\nPolygon hosts several high-profile projects, including Aavegotchi, Polymarket, and QuickSwap, showcasing its versatility in DeFi, NFT, and DAO applications. Notable projects on Optimism include Uniswap and Synthetix, reflecting its capability to handle complex financial applications.\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nPolygon aims to continue its efforts to expand and diversify its multi-chain ecosystem. It plans to invest in ZK-based solutions, privacy-preserving technologies, and data availability solutions. Optimism plans to further enhance its infrastructure, interoperability, and developer tooling. It also aims to remove the current whitelisting of contracts, opening the platform for broader use.\n\nAdvantages and Limitations\n\nPolygon\u2019s advantages include high scalability, low transaction costs, and Ethereum compatibility. However, it faces criticism over centralization concerns due to its PoS consensus and validator system.\n\nOptimism also offers reduced gas fees and increased transaction speed while maintaining Ethereum-level security. The main disadvantage is the current seven-day withdrawal period due to fraud proofs, which may be a hindrance for some applications.\n\nDeeper Dive into the Technology\n\nPolygon\u2019s architecture includes four main layers. The Ethereum layer enables communication with Ethereum, while the security layer provides validators for PoS consensus. The Polygon Networks layer consists of PoS blockchains and other chains secured by the security layer. The execution layer executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\nOptimism uses an architecture known as Optimistic Rollups, which allows it to run computations off-chain and store the results on-chain. This offloading reduces the load on the Ethereum network, improving scalability and speed.\n\nThe Role of Native Tokens\n\nMATIC, the native token of Polygon, is used for transaction fees and participation in the network\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It also empowers users to participate in network governance. In Optimism, ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, just like on Ethereum. The gas fee model is identical to Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 model, ensuring fee predictability and improved user experience. Optimism has a native token with the ticker OP. It is used for rewards and governance.\n\nInteroperability\n\nPolygon is designed to provide full Ethereum interoperability. It supports Ethereum standards and protocols, which allows for seamless interaction between assets and applications across both ecosystems.\n\nOptimism also offers full Ethereum interoperability. All Ethereum smart contracts can be directly ported to Optimism, preserving the connections and functionalities of Ethereum\u2019s rich ecosystem.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolygon uses a DAO model for governance, allowing MATIC token holders to propose and vote on network upgrades, modifications, and other important decisions. Optimism is also governed through a DAO model. OP is the project\u2019s primary token. It\u2019s used for governance, with OP holders voting on key decisions. It\u2019s also distributed as rewards to supporters of the Optimism ecosystem and to finance future Optimism-based projects.\n\nCommunity and Partnerships\n\nPolygon has a large and active community, and it has forged partnerships with prominent blockchain projects like Chainlink, Decentraland, and Aave, among others. Optimism\u2019s community is vibrant and growing, thanks to its ties to the Ethereum community. It also has partnerships with major projects like Uniswap and MakerDAO.\n\nConclusion\n\nPolygon and Optimism both represent crucial advancements in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, bringing significant improvements to the blockchain\u2019s scalability and transaction efficiency. These platforms aim to preserve Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and security while paving the way for mass adoption through higher transaction throughput and lower costs.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Polygon\u2019s flexible Layer 2 chains or Optimism\u2019s Optimistic Rollups, both solutions have their own unique merits and limitations. The choice between them largely depends on the specific requirements of the users or developers. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, Polygon and Optimism will undoubtedly play pivotal roles in shaping Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nChoosing between Polygon and Optimism depends largely on your specific needs. Both offer scalable solutions with reduced transaction costs. If high throughput is your priority, Polygon may be the better choice. If maintaining security levels comparable to Ethereum is paramount, Optimism may be more suitable."

Instead of each transaction needing to be processed by every node on the Ethereum network, ZkSync aggregates multiple transactions into a single proof that is posted on-chain. This means transactions can be confirmed much faster.\n\nCan ZkSync address Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees issue?\n\nYes, ZkSync can address Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees. By moving transactions off-chain, ZkSync drastically reduces the amount of computational work that needs to be done on the Ethereum mainnet, leading to lower gas fees. Transactions are processed in batches, meaning users only have to pay a fraction compared to executing transactions directly on Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the role of zkRollups in ZkSync\u2019s operation?\n\nZkRollups play a vital role in ZkSync\u2019s operation. They allow for the aggregation of multiple transactions into a single proof that can be verified on-chain. ZkRollups maintain the security of the Layer-1 blockchain while increasing transaction throughput. All the transaction data is available on-chain but the computation and storage are performed off-chain, providing a balance of efficiency and security.\n\nHow does ZkSync contribute to the scalability of Ethereum?\n\nZkSync significantly enhances Ethereum\u2019s scalability. It achieves this by taking most of the computational and storage load off of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, processing transactions off-chain, and then posting a single proof to the Ethereum network. This allows more transactions to be processed per second, thereby contributing to the scalability of Ethereum.\n\nCan ZkSync support smart contracts?\n\nMatter Labs, the team behind ZkSync, announced plans for ZkSync 2.0, which is expected to support EVM-compatible smart contracts. This feature would allow developers to write and deploy smart contracts just as they would on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, but with the scalability benefits of ZkSync.\n\nWhat are the potential use cases for ZkSync?\n\nZkSync can be used for a variety of applications that require high transaction throughput and lower fees. These can include decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and other decentralized applications (dApps) that need to manage a high volume of transactions. It\u2019s also useful for microtransaction scenarios, such as pay-per-use services, where the high fees on the Ethereum mainnet would otherwise make such transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nHow is security maintained in ZkSync?\n\nSecurity in ZkSync is maintained through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and the inherent security of the Ethereum mainnet. With zkRollups, all the data necessary to prove the validity of each transaction is stored on-chain, while the computation is performed off-chain. This ensures that even if the Layer-2 system were to fail, users could still recover their assets directly from the data stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIs ZkSync interoperable with other blockchains?\n\nWhile ZkSync is specifically designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, the principles behind its design could potentially be applied to other blockchains that support smart contracts and have similar architecture to Ethereum. However, each implementation would require careful consideration of the unique characteristics and security models of the underlying blockchain.\n\nWhat makes ZkSync unique compared to other Layer-2 solutions?\n\nZkSync stands out due to its implementation of zkRollups, providing a unique balance between security, scalability, and decentralization. It provides high throughput without sacrificing the strong security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1. Another distinctive feature is its anticipated support for EVM-compatible smart contracts, enabling existing Ethereum developers to deploy their applications on ZkSync with minimal changes.\n\nWhat role does zero-knowledge proof technology play in ZkSync?\n\nZero-knowledge proof technology plays a fundamental role in ZkSync. It\u2019s the mechanism that allows ZkSync to validate transactions off-chain, reducing the computational load on the Ethereum network. In ZkSync, this principle is used to prove the validity of transactions without having to process each transaction on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does ZkSync handle consensus and validation of transactions?\n\nIn ZkSync, transactions are initially processed off-chain by validators who maintain the state of the ZkSync network. These validators batch multiple operations together into a single zkRollup proof, which is then posted to the Ethereum mainnet. The Ethereum network then validates this proof, reaching consensus on the updated state of the ZkSync network. This process ensures both efficiency and security for the ZkSync Layer-2 system.\n\nWhat are the limitations or challenges of using ZkSync?\n\nOne potential limitation of ZkSync, and Layer-2 solutions in general, is the additional complexity they introduce. Users and developers must understand how to interact with a Layer-2 system on top of the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Another challenge lies in achieving widespread adoption: for Layer-2 solutions to be effective, they must be widely used, which requires integration with wallets, exchanges, and other parts of the blockchain ecosystem. Also, while Layer-2 solutions can drastically improve scalability, they still rely on the underlying Layer-1 for security and finality.\n\nIs ZkSync suitable for enterprise applications?\n\nZkSync, with its enhanced scalability and lower transaction fees, can certainly be suitable for enterprise applications. For businesses requiring a high volume of transactions, particularly those that are considering the use of Ethereum for its robust smart contract capabilities, ZkSync could provide the scalability solution needed to make such applications practical. However, each enterprise has unique needs and should consider the implications of Layer-2 solutions carefully.\n\nHow can ZkSync enhance privacy and confidentiality in blockchain transactions?\n\nZkSync uses zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technology that can provide enhanced privacy. The technology allows validators to verify transactions without needing to know the content of the transactions themselves. However, it\u2019s important to note that like Ethereum, ZkSync is not designed to be a privacy-centric blockchain where transaction details are hidden. The details of transactions are transparent, but the technology provides certain privacy-enhancing characteristics.\n\nWhat are the costs associated with using ZkSync?\n\nBy processing transactions off-chain, ZkSync can greatly reduce the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. Instead of paying gas fees for every single transaction, users in ZkSync pay fees only when they deposit into or withdraw from the Layer-2 environment. Within ZkSync, transaction fees are paid in the token being transacted, which can provide a more predictable and user-friendly experience.\n\nHow does ZkSync handle token transfers and asset management?\n\nZkSync can handle token transfers and asset management much like Ethereum, but more efficiently. Any ERC-20 or ERC-721 token can be sent on ZkSync just like on the Ethereum mainnet, but with higher speed and lower costs. This makes it a compelling solution for applications involving frequent token transfers or complex asset management, like decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms.\n\nHow does ZkSync address the issue of transaction finality?\n\nZkSync relies on the security and finality of the underlying Ethereum Layer-1. Once a zkRollup proof is posted and accepted on Ethereum, the transactions included in that proof are considered finalized. By tying the finality of transactions to Ethereum, ZkSync leverages the robust security and decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat are the potential risks associated with ZkSync?\n\nAs with any Layer-2 solution, there are potential risks associated with ZkSync. One risk involves user error: if users are not familiar with the workings of Layer-2, they could make mistakes when interacting with it. Also, there could be smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities in the Layer-2 solution itself, though such risks are mitigated through rigorous auditing and formal verification. Finally, there\u2019s always the risk of insufficient adoption, which could limit the utility of ZkSync.\n\nHow does ZkSync impact decentralization in Ethereum\u2019s network?\n\nZkSync is designed to preserve the decentralization of the Ethereum network. By offloading computational work from Ethereum, ZkSync can help ensure that running an Ethereum node remains feasible for as many participants as possible, thereby supporting the decentralization of the network. Meanwhile, ZkSync\u2019s reliance on Ethereum for security and finality means that it does not introduce additional points of centralization.\n\nHow is ZkSync different from other zkRollup solutions?\n\nZkSync sets itself apart from other zkRollup solutions through a focus on user and developer experience, including planned support for EVM-compatible smart contracts. ZkSync also emphasizes security, using a process of rigorous testing, formal verification, and third-party audits to minimize the risk of smart contract bugs or other vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the team behind ZkSync has a strong commitment to open-source development and community engagement, which helps foster a healthy ecosystem around the project.\n\nAre there any regulatory considerations specific to ZkSync implementations?\n\nRegulatory considerations for ZkSync implementations will largely be similar to those for other blockchain and Layer-2 technologies. These could include considerations around the transmission of digital assets, privacy regulations, and potential securities law implications for certain types of transactions. As with any blockchain technology, it\u2019s important to consider the regulatory landscape of the specific jurisdictions in which the technology will be used.\n\nCan ZkSync achieve the same level of security as Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1?\n\nZkSync is designed to inherit the security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1. By leveraging zkRollup technology, it ensures that all transaction data is stored on-chain, even though computation and storage are performed off-chain. This means that even in the event of a failure of the Layer-2 system, users would still be able to recover their assets based on the data stored on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does ZkSync impact user experience in blockchain applications?\n\nZkSync can significantly improve the user experience in blockchain applications by providing faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees. It also enables users to pay transaction fees in the token they are transferring, instead of having to hold and pay fees in ETH. Furthermore, with its planned support for EVM-compatible smart contracts, ZkSync will allow developers to create more complex applications, further enhancing the potential user experience.\n\nWhat are the future developments and trends in ZkSync technology?\n\nThe most significant future development for ZkSync is the introduction of ZkSync 2.0, which is expected to support EVM-compatible smart contracts. This will allow developers to write and deploy smart contracts in a similar way to Ethereum, but with the benefits of Layer-2. Beyond that, the team behind ZkSync is continuously working on enhancing its technology, and we can expect further advancements in scalability, security, and usability as the project evolves.\n\nCan ZkSync handle network congestion and scalability issues?\n\nYes, ZkSync is specifically designed to address network congestion and scalability issues. By processing transactions off-chain and aggregating them into zkRollup proofs posted on the Ethereum mainnet, ZkSync significantly improves the scalability of the Ethereum network, reducing congestion and allowing for a higher throughput of transactions.\n\nWhat are some notable projects or companies that are using ZkSync?\n\nSeveral notable projects and companies are utilizing ZkSync for their blockchain applications. Some examples include 1Inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator that picks the cheapest crypto prices; Mini Mini Dungeon, a layer-2 play-to-earn game; and Forward Protocol, the WordPress for Web 3.0.
