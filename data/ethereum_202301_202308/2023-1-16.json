        "title": "Ethereum Smart Contracts Deployment Jumped 293% in 2022: Alchemy Developer Report - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Despite the fierce headwinds the crypto industry faced over the last year, Web3 development activity has grown at an impressive rate, according to a new report.\n\nOne such key indicator is the number of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, which grew 293% as compared to 2021, reaching rates that resembled the peaks of the previous year, per the \u201cQ4'22 State of Web3 report\u201d released today by blockchain software and development company Alchemy.\n\nRemarkably, this peak of activity came in the fourth quarter of 2022, just as FTX collapsed, driving hefty outflows of funds across the industry\u2019s largest exchanges.\n\nPer the report, the number of deployed smart contracts in Q4 2022 grew 453% quarter-to-quarter, reaching a staggering 4.6 million.\n\nAdditionally, the deployment of smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet grew 187% over the last three months of 2022\u2014and as much as 721% year-to-year\u2014to reach an all-time high of 2.7 million and signal that more decentralized applications (dapps) may enter the market in the future.\n\nThe report used several sources for data collection purposes, including Dune Analytics, DappRadar, and Github, among others.\n\nQ4 2022 building up across the board. Source: Alchemy\n\nDeveloper activity on the rise\n\nSmart contracts, a term coined by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in the 1990s, are self-executing pieces of computer code that debuted on the Ethereum blockchain, laying the groundwork for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and non-custodial lending and borrowing apps.\n\n\"The Web3 developer community is proving to be extremely resilient. This report shows that they're as focused and motivated as ever to build the future of this ecosystem\u2014while honestly acknowledging the unnecessary setbacks we have seen in 2022,\u201d Alchemy's head of growth Jason Shah told Decrypt.\n\nAlchemy Acquires Ethereum Coding Platform ChainShot\n\nAdditionally, in December Alchemy surveyed 985 developers, and of those, 94% said they were committed to building in Web3, which \u201chighlighted a positive outlook despite being in the thick of crypto winter,\u201d per Alchemy.\n\nFollowing the launch of its Alchemy University in October, the San Francisco-based firm said that more than 100,000 applications poured in, indicating strong interest in building Web3 development skills.\n\n\u201cWe're encouraged by these numbers and expect developer activity to continue to increase in 2023,\u201d Shah told Decrypt, although conceding that this may potentially be happening at a slower rate given decreasing investment in Web3 companies."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have always been pitted against each other. With the start of the new year, the first debate has surfaced comparing BTC\u2019s capped supply of 21 million to ETH\u2019s deflationary supply, with disagreement over which of the two qualifies as sound money.\n\nAn Ethereum-focused Twitter user called \u2018ultra sound money\u2019 compared the supply issuance of both cryptocurrencies and suggested that \u201cif capped-supply BTC is sound then decreasing-supply ETH is ultrasound.\u201d\n\nif capped-supply BTC is sound\n\n\n\ndecreasing-supply ETH is ultra sound pic.twitter.com/L2tsFzPQ7q \u2014 ultra sound money (@ultrasoundmoney) January 15, 2023\n\nThe comparison between the two didn\u2019t sit well with BTC proponents, who quickly pointed out that soundness comes from the credibility of the monetary policy and not an ever-changing one. Dan Held, a famous Bitcoin proponent, pointed out the flaw in the argument and noted that a constantly changing one has less credibility. He said:\n\n\u201cTime builds trust with humans, it\u2019s not all about code. According to your logic, if we spun up another crypto with more deflation, that would be \u201csounder.\u201d\n\nAnother Bitcoin proponent questioned the credibility of Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, reminding that the same monetary policy has \u201cchanged a least 11 times in its seven years of existence.\u201d On the other hand, Bitcoin has not changed its monetary policy once.\n\nEther's historical projected issuance rate. Source: ethhub.io\n\nEther became deflationary in August 2021 with the introduction of Ethereum improvement proposal-1559 (EIP-1559). The upgrade introduced a burn mechanism that automatically burns a portion of the transaction fee, decreasing the overall circulating supply of ETH.\n\nIn response to Alex Gladstein\u2019s argument that \u201cadmins\u201d can arbitrarily change Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano claimed that every change on the Ethereum network had been approved by the thousands of node operators run by community members.\n\nThe term \"admins\" implies that there is a small group with superuser powers that can change things on Ethereum which is completely false and has been proven false many times.\n\n\n\nYou can believe what you want about the sound money vs ultra sound money debate. \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) January 16, 2023\n\nLeo Glisic, the founder of the Maitri network, said that ETH had become sound money now, but BTC won\u2019t hit its cap until the year 2140.\n\nBitcoin has faced similar monetary changes and tweaking of the original code in the past. The most notable one came during 2017 when there was a growing demand for increasing the Bitcoin block size to accommodate more transactions per block and make it more scalable.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin steps out of 'fear' for the first time in nine months\n\nThe majority of the Bitcoin community remained against making any changes to the original code of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a result, the Bitcoin network experienced a hard fork in 2017, leading to the formation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a cryptocurrency with a block size of 8 MB against BTC\u2019s 1 MB. However, today, BCH has had very little on-chain development and is currently trading at a 97% price drop from its all-time high."

The altcoin\u2019s supply growth at the time of writing stood at -34.67 ETH, as its annualized inflation rate dropped to 0.00002%.\n\nWhenever ETH turns deflationary, it means that the rate of new ETH being added to the total supply is decreasing. In other words, since the year started, the leading smart contract blockchain has burned more ETH tokens than it has minted.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

In the last week alone, the alt\u2019s value rose by over 20%, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nThe sharp surge in ETH\u2019s value mirrors the growth in the general cryptocurrency market since the year started following a tumultuous close to the 2022 trading year. According to data from CoinGecko, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has risen by 21% in the past 16 days.\n\nIn addition, since the year began, the daily transaction settlements on Ethereum have surpassed $21 billion, significantly ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s $2.6 billion daily transaction settlements.\n\nEthereum settling over $21b a day in value while Bitcoin struggles to settle over $2.6b in value\u2026 You tell me where the future lies pic.twitter.com/Ez0kcinM1W \u2014 Crypto Maxi (@cryptoMaxi420) January 15, 2023\n\nFurthermore, CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain found that there has been a resurgence of new ETH smart contracts being created. According to the CryptoOnchain, following a decline between August 2021 and October 2022, the number of new smart contracts on the Ethereum network has risen in the last four months.\n\nA high number of new smart contracts on Ethereum can be seen as a sign of strong developer activity and interest in the platform, indicating that the Ethereum ecosystem is healthy and growing.\n\nThis is a positive sign for the future of Ethereum as it suggests that more and more developers are building on the Ethereum blockchain and that the network is becoming more robust and useful.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAhead of the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nWith the Shanghai Upgrade estimated to occur before the close of Q1 2023, a look at the Ethereum 2.0 contract revealed increased on-chain activity. According to Glassnode, the total number of Ether coins sitting in the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract stood at 513,414 ETH. This has gone up by 1.3% since the year began.\n\nLikewise, the total number of validators on the proof-of-stake network stood at 501,666 at press time, having gone up by 1.2% in the last 16 days."

        "content": "The crypto industry is full of people who talk a big game about democracy and freedom, but, at the end of the day, care only about filling their bags and partying in low-tax jurisdictions. Fortunately, there are many others who really do believe in the ideals of decentralization and using blockchain technology to build a better world. One of them is Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.\n\nI was reminded of this after publishing an interview with Buterin conducted by Ukrainian journalist Anna Tutova during his recent visit to Kyiv. In the interview, he shares his experience meeting hackers and others who are turning Ukraine into a hotbed of tech entrepreneurship even as Russia tries to wipe the country off the map with a brutal and illegal invasion.\n\nEven though he was born in Russia, Buterin has expressed solidarity with Ukraine since the outset of the conflict, and, even amid the war, traveled there by train from Warsaw. His condemnation of Moscow has been a welcome change from too many on Crypto Twitter who, under the guise of libertarianism or quiet fascism, have offered tacit support for Vladimir Putin\u2019s war crimes.\n\nButerin\u2019s moral clarity has also been on display in his relationship with Ethereum, the project he invented and arguably the world\u2019s most important blockchain. After publishing the Ethereum white paper when he was just 20 years old, the famously awkward Buterin navigated a tumultuous row with his cofounders\u2014some of whom have since spread lies and venom about him\u2014and an existential hacking incident to help Ethereum flourish.\n\nDuring all of this, Buterin has never sought out the trappings of crypto fame\u2014Lambos, partying with models, and so on\u2014but has instead focused on learning about the world around him. His writing has expanded far beyond crypto and technology to explore sophisticated theories of governance and politics, while his personal interests have included learning Mandarin and tasting the world\u2019s cuisines. Most impressively of all, he has refused to embrace the cult-of-personality lifestyle too many other crypto founders have favored. Instead, he has slowly followed the example of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto and sought to let Ethereum grow more decentralized.\n\nButerin would be the ideal person to elect to public office but for the fact that he is so damn weird (see, for example, \u201cVitalik clapping\u201c), although that weirdness is part of his charm and does nothing to detract from the overarching example he sets\u2014especially as crypto struggles through a moral and financial reckoning post-FTX.\n\nSince we\u2019re opening the week on a positive note, let me add that I\u2019ve discovered firsthand how crypto\u2014which so many like to dismiss as useless these days\u2014is a fantastic tool for paying people in conflict zones. Meanwhile, Bitcoin cracked $21,000 and is enjoying its biggest one-week gain in two years.

        "content": "Masa Finance has launched the first soulbound identity protocol for the Ethereum mainnet, according to a Jan. 17 press release shared with Cointelegraph. The protocol will allow for standardized soulbound tokens to be minted on Ethereum for Know Your Customer verification, credit scores and other use cases.\n\nSoulbound tokens are tokens that cannot be transferred from one wallet to another. The concept was popularized via a blog post from Vitalik Buterin, who argued that these tokens could be used to signify governance rights for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or to prove that a person has attended an event.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Masa Finance founders Brendan Playford and Calanthia Mei argued that soulbound tokens will expand opportunities for DeFi users to build credit and get loans. Mei explained it as such:\n\nWe want to help people tap into [an] on-chain credit system with a Web3 credit score, with the data sources that we have aggregated across Web2 and Web3 representing and helping people build their creditworthiness on-chain. We\u2019re currently working with multiple lending partners in extending DeFi loans to those individuals who have minted a Masa credit score report.\n\nShe emphasized that Masa soulbound tokens are not merely attached to a traditional credit score. The protocol goes beyond traditional finance to incorporate both Web2 and Web3 activity. Mei said that over 10,000 data points are used in a Masa credit score, including a user\u2019s FICO score, Plaid transaction data for credit and debit cards, Web3 wallet transaction history, centralized exchange balances, and other data.\n\nMei believes this system will lead to \u201crisk-based underwriting\u201d in DeFi, which she says has previously not been possible due to the lack of identity protocols on blockchain networks.\n\nThe founders also said there is one other use case currently available for the protocol. Aside from representing a credit score, the second use case for the protocol is .soul domain names. These are similar to ENS names, but with the added benefit that they can be linked to various Masa identity characteristics. Playford explained that \u201cusers can link different attributes, use their pseudonym to verify themselves, show that they\u2019re verified in Web3 without doxing [their] full name, for example.\"\n\nRelated: Lukso co-founder discusses implications of digital self-sovereignty in Web3\n\nPlayford noted that .soul domain names can be transferred from one wallet to another. However, the attributes associated with them will become unattached if the domain is moved. Therefore, users cannot \u201cbuy\u201d the identity or credit score of another person.\n\nAccording to the founders, a third use case will be identity verification, a feature the company is releasing under the name \u201cMasa Green.\u201d It will allow users to mint a Masa Green token to prove their identity, which the company believes will help users to prove they are real humans, not bots. According to Mei, this will help eliminate bots in play-to-earn games and other apps where the community wants only real humans to participate. The company said Masa Green will be available as a \u201cfast follow within the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nMasa is not the only soulbound token protocol to be implemented on a blockchain network. Binance has released its own version, called BAB, which can be used to prove a user\u2019s identity. However, BAB is currently only available on BNB Chain. Masa appears to be the first soulbound token protocol available on Ethereum."

Discover SCENE\n\nNorth Korea-linked cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group has reportedly transferred $63.4 million in Ethereum from 2022\u2019s mammoth Harmony bridge hack, depositing it on Binance, Huobi, and OKX.\n\nAccording to on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, the group used the privacy and anonymity system Railgun before consolidating the funds and depositing them on the exchanges.\n\nRailgun is an Ethereum-based smart contract system that lets users obscure the nature of their crypto transactions, removing identifying information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sleuth claimed that the transfers, made on January 13, involved 350,000 separate wallet addresses.\n\n1/2 North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group had a very busy weekend moving $63.5m (~41000 ETH) from the Harmony bridge hack through Railgun before consolidating funds and depositing on three different exchanges. pic.twitter.com/huDumaJeSh \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 15, 2023\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao said that his team, in collaboration with Huobi, had detected the funds' movements, which they then froze and recovered.\n\nThe Binance chief claimed that the total recovery came to 124 Bitcoin, suggesting that the attackers had converted funds from ETH to BTC.\n\nThough Lazarus reportedly originally made the illegitimate transfers in the form ETH, these tokens could have been later swapped for BTC at many points during the mixing and consolidating process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts. Together, 124 BTC have been recovered.

A blockchain bridge that connects different, incompatible blockchains together.\n\nMany, including blockchain analytics company Elliptic, attributed the attack to the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus.\n\nThe group was said to have used the now-sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, a tool not dissimilar to Railgun.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown, what if any, steps have been taken by OKX, in response to the alleged criminal transfers.\n\nCZ explained that Binance\u2019s security teams are to an extent collaborative and talk to other exchanges, but added that \u201cnot all\u201d other exchanges are collaborative.\n\nOur security teams talk to each other, not all exchanges are collaborative (some have a wrong competitive mindset), but many are. I am actually not in those chats myself. Don't know the details. \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) January 16, 2023\n\nThe CEO added that he is not in those security chats himself and as a result, doesn\u2019t \u201cknow the details.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt has contacted Binance, Huobi, and OKX about the transfers and their responses.\n\nDespite the size of Lazarus\u2019s attack on Harmony, the hack is just a small portion of the overall number of funds the cybercrime syndicate has been implicated in stealing.\n\nLazarus was also implicated, to give just an example, in the March 2022 attack on the Ronin Network, which was estimated at being worth about $622 million. The group was also tied to a scheme that impersonated venture capital companies to spread malware to various crypto-related firms."

This was when developers announced that the Shanghai Upgrade, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH, will go live in March 2023.\n\nNotwithstanding the 1.3% drop observed in ETH\u2019s price at the time of writing, the king of altcoins made a remarkable recovery since the FTX contagion hit the crypto market. The bullish cycle also witnessed ETH sprint towards its pre-FTX market cap levels.\n\nStaking gets hot\n\nThe number of validators on ETH network steadily increased by 0.61% over the seven-day period, per data from Staking Rewards. The revenue from transaction fees also shot up by almost 24% which lent credence to the lucrativeness of ETH staking.\n\nThe annualized reward rate or the reward that validators can expect to earn per year was estimated at 3.8%.\n\nInterestingly, the percentage of eligible tokens that were being staked stood at 13.87%, significantly lower than other popular chains like Cardano [ADA] and Solana [SOL] which had as staking ratio of over 70%.\n\nWhales\u2019 transactions surge\n\nOn-chain indicators corroborated the growing appeal of the network. Whale transactions registered a sharp uptick to hit their highest value in more than two months. As of 14 January, the transactions hit 5646, a jump of almost 30% over the last month.\n\nThe new participants entering the network rose steadily indicating that Ethereum\u2019s adoption was on the rise.\n\nThe increased activity was also highlighted by the velocity indicator which steeply increased to 3.99 on 14 January. This suggested that ETH moved more frequently across wallets.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, ETH investors are wary of the fact that the Shanghai Upgrade could intensify selling pressure in the market. Data analytics firm Bitwise challenged the claim and stated that mass sales will be impossible as the amount of ETH that could be unstaked will be limited at any point of time.\n\nBitwise also predicted that ETH will turn deflationary in 2023 and its total circulating supply will drop by 1% or more, bringing more relief to investors."

        "title": "Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "How does Bitcoin DeFi work? Wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin, layer-1 blockchains like Stacks, and sidechains like Rootstock enable DeFi on Bitcoin. The scripting language used by Bitcoin, termed Script, is not Turing complete, which means it is deficient in several logical operations, such as loops. As a result, the Bitcoin network supports limited programmability despite the Taproot upgrade, meaning that Bitcoin DeFi platforms rely on layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains to host their smart contracts. DeFi on Bitcoin is made possible through wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), layer-1 blockchains like Stacks and sidechains like Rootstock. For instance, wBTC, an Ethereum token introduced in January 2019, is backed one-to-one by Bitcoin (BTC), meaning that one wBTC is always equivalent to 1 BTC. Users can engage with several of Ethereum\u2019s DApps using the wBTC token. An independent layer-1 blockchain called Stacks makes hundreds of billions of dollars in capital in BTC available and offers Bitcoin holders new ways to use and profit from the cryptocurrency. It uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism, which secures its blockchain by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work blockchain. DeFi products like the Stackswap DEX leverage the Stacks blockchain to allow users to trade and mint NFTs, borrow algorithmic stablecoins, and launch and exchange tokens on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, since Stacks and Bitcoin are linked, NFTs created on Stacks settle to and are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Turing-complete smart contracts are made possible on the Bitcoin blockchain by Rootstock, which runs parallel to the blockchain. When BTC is sent to Rootstock, it transforms into RBTC, a smart contract-enabled Bitcoin. Based on bidirectional communication, this protocol serves as a bridge to connect both chains. For instance, Sovryn, one of the first permissionless financial apps, utilizes RSK\u2019s technology to connect to the Lightning Network, Ethereum, Bitcoin and BNB Smart Chain.\n\nWhich DeFi projects are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem? Besides wBTC, Stacks and Rootstock, BadgerDAO, RenVM and Liquid Network promote various use cases of Bitcoin DeFi. BadgerDAO A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called BadgerDAO makes it possible for BTC to be utilized as collateral across various DApps. The BadgerDAO uses the Ethereum-based token BADGER for protocol governance and incentive distribution. Users can earn income on their synthetic BTC assets using Sett Vaults, the first product offered by Badger. Users can lock up their tokenized Bitcoin in SETTs, which are pools of tokens, and let smart contracts manage their holdings to produce a yield in the form of bTokens. The second product from Badger, called Digg, is software that controls the elastic-supply cryptocurrency called the DIGG token, pegged to the price of BTC in United States dollars. Like any other token, DIGG can be deposited into SETTs to provide a yield for its holders and used in DeFi protocols. RenVM The decentralized Ethereum protocol Ren creates tokens that monitor the value of non-Ethereum assets such as Bitcoin and offers liquidity to projects on several blockchains. That said, Bitcoin holders may utilize Ren (needed to pay nodes) to access Ethereum\u2019s array of DeFi products without selling their BTC or moving their assets across blockchains. The Ren virtual machine holds the original funds in storage, accepts tokens from one blockchain, and generates new tokens on another through its RenBridge to exchange assets between blockchains. For example, a user may submit BTC to the RenVM, which would issue renBTC, a new token on Ethereum that would reflect the original Bitcoin, meaning when the user wants to get their Bitcoin back, the transaction may be reversed. Liquid Network The Liquid Network is a layer-2 Bitcoin solution and an inter-exchange settlement network that enables the issue of digital assets like security tokens, stablecoins and other financial instruments privately and quickly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. LBTC, a wrapped version of Bitcoin, serves as the native token on the Liquid sidechain. Users send BTC to a Lightning Network address (a process called peg-in) on the Bitcoin network to use the Liquid Network. A similar quantity of LBTC is minted on the Liquid Network and delivered to the user\u2019s address after the transaction has received 102 confirmations. In addition, peg-out can be initiated to withdraw BTC by sending LBTC for burning to an irrecoverable address, which, when receiving two separate confirmations, lets a Lightning Network member send the original BTC to a user\u2019s Bitcoin network address."

Aside from evaluating the market, the index, depending on its value, may help predict a possible move of crypto prices.\n\nEthereum price may reverse soon, data suggests\n\nWhen the index is in the fear zone (or even extreme fear), this means that investors could be buying a crypto \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. \u2013 at the moment. When it shows 70, as now, it means Ethereum is in fear territory. This and the even worse designation of extreme fear show that the market might be in for correction.\n\nOver the period of the past 24 hours, the native token of the second most popular crypto jumped by 3.62%, hitting a local high of $1,596. A drop by nearly 2% then followed, pushing ETH down to $1,571.\n\nEthereum Fear and Greed Index @EthereumFear Ethereum Fear and Greed Index is 70 ~ Greed Current price: $1,566https://t.co/kvIBEIGPFEhttps://t.co/F4eTo2X4l2 pic.twitter.com/ZDESo8fa04\n\nWhales bet on $400 per ETH\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, several anonymous whales had bought 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400, betting on ETH to go down that much. The options will expire on June 30. Unlike call options, put options allow investors to sell an underlying asset at a strike price they bet on, even if the asset drops lower. This bearish bet might be based on the Shanghai upgrade that is set to launch in February. Among other things, the upgrade will allow stakers to move their staked Ether out of the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract.\n\nStill, despite this bearish bet, Santiment on-chain data aggregator believes that Ethereum still has a chance of rising and catching up with its previous all-time high close to the $5,000 level.\n\nThe team of analysts believes that after Ethereum reached the aforementioned historic peak, it got hit due to extremely high transaction fees of $60. Now that these fees have dropped to merely $2, the price has surged once again, Santiment believes."

        "content": "Well, that was quick. Less than two weeks after cryptocurrencies hit a nadir in the wake of the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has rallied 25% amid speculation the cryptocurrency selloff late last year was too much and too fast.\n\nKey Takeaways With Bitcoin gaining 25% and Ether jumping 20% in the past week, there's a bullish sentiment across the market.\n\nThe fall in inflation contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe market has breached $1 trillion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November.\n\nBitcoin Gains Momentum\n\nWhen Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came last week that inflation is cooling off in most of the U.S. economy, Bitcoin hit a two-month high at $18,856, up 8%, as investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would reverse, or at least soften its rate hike policy. This suggests that Bitcoin is also becoming macro now, no longer a hedge against inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin mining difficulty rose more than 10% to 37.59 trillion from 34.09 trillion on Sunday, a new all-time high. The difficulty of mining tends to increase when a blockchain network grows and is a sign of increased activity. The flagship cryptocurrency jumped traded at $21,130 at 11: 30 PM, New York time.\n\nEthereum Upgrade is on Horizon\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network, gained over 17% in the past week, trading at $1,568 at 11: 30 PM, New York time. Apart from macroeconomic factors, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade on the network that allows users to withdraw their staked Ether has also contributed to this momentum.\n\nSimply put, the Shangahi upgrade follows 'The Merge' that shifted the Ethereum blockchain network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. A tentative timeline of March 2023 has been set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum gains, Avalanche, NEAR, Aave, Polkadot, and Solana also surged over the past two weeks, helping the crypto market reclaim $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe surge in the market has given investors hope that crypto will continue to flourish despite layoffs and bankruptcy. Even a banking giant like Bank of America believes cryptos are the future and a new form of payment as it will likely change ''how and when value is transferred over the next 15 years.''\n\nAs the markets rebound, inflation cools, and signs of economic stability return, traders are optimistic about the resurgence of the crypto bull market.\n\n"

However, since reaching the ATH of 285,000 BTC, the amount of WBTC on Ethereum descended massively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the implosion of LUNA/UST, the balance of Bitcoin wrapped on Ethereum declined by over 35%, which could have been the result of a massive position liquidation that led to the plunge in the number of available wrapped assets on the network.\n\nThe total $WBTC Balance wrapped on #Ethereum has declined by over 35% since the collapse of the LUNA/UST project\n\n\n\nAt the peak, there were 285k #Bitcoin wrapped on #Ethereum, and this has since fallen by 101.55k $WBTC over the course of 2022\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca Live Chart: https://t.co/y3COK5pbuA pic.twitter.com/QWRYyBcV7j \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 17, 2023\n\nAccording to the chart shared by Glassnode, the total number of wrapped Bitcoin on the Ethereum chain is still going down heavily, showing that there is no demand for Bitcoin on the network.\n\nThe uptrend on the chart prevailed only back in October 2020, when the cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged recovery mode. Though we are seeing the same tendencies today, the amount of wrapped Bitcoins on the Ethereum network is not rising, which we might consider a bearish signal.\n\nMarket manipulation?\n\nAt the end of this rally on the market, numerous analysts and traders assumed that market manipulation was one of the main reasons behind such explosive performance of Bitcoin and other assets. One of their main proofs was abnormal open interest on most cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms.\n\nWith the lack of growing demand on Ethereum, which usually occurs after a noteworthy move of BTC, market manipulation could be a solid theory behind the market's 10% spike. Unfortunately, if the assumptions of analysts are true, the first cryptocurrency will reverse in the foreseeable future and reach the $19,500 trading range."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nFor an industry that is expected to be united against a common cause, there seems to be more division than anticipated. Media personality and correspondent with FOX Business Network Charles Gasparino has flagged the unhealthy rivalry, or what he tagged as \"hatred,\" that the members of the XRP community have for all things related to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Gasparino, despite the fact that Ethereum holders are not shown much love by XRP holders, the majority of the people he knows who hold Ethereum notably want XRP to win its ongoing lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC is charging blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc for the sale of $1.3 billion in XRP as unregistered securities. The lawsuit from the regulator was brought on back in December 2020, and millions of dollars have been expended by the blockchain company to defend its stance that its sole use of XRP was as a payment utility.\n\nThe ongoing case has stirred a lot of enmity, and Gasparino believes XRP community members see those who are Ethereum supporters as their enemies, a claim Gasparino's position sharply disagrees with.\n\nCommunity's view\n\nAgainst the position of Charles Gasparino, many community members believed that it is indeed Ethereum maximalists that are constantly talking down to XRP. In one of the comments shared on Gasparino's post, a user with the handle BlackberryXRP shared a post from way back in December 2020, when Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin called XRP a \"shitcoin.\"\n\nLooks like the Ripple/XRP team is sinking to new levels of strangeness. They're claiming that their shitcoin should not be called a security for *public policy reasons*, namely because Bitcoin and Ethereum are 'Chinese-controlled,' the post from Vitalik reads at the time, showing no iota of support from the most renowned figure in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIrrespective of the divergent positions, Gasparino claims Ethereum holders understand what the victory for XRP would mean for the entire industry."

        "title": "Top 4 Cryptocurrencies to Buy and Hold for 2023 and Beyond - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Crypto prices crashed hard in 2022 as the previously up-and-coming sector ran into new headwinds like rising interest rates and the implosion of some large players, such as FTX.\n\nBeneath the surface, there were still reasons for optimism. The Bitcoin (BTC 0.70%) network stayed operational 24/7 with no downtime, remained impervious to hacks, and successfully processed billions of dollars of daily transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH 0.26%) developers successfully pulled off The Merge, Ethereum's transition from proof of work to proof of stake, an engineering feat that some observers compared to changing out the engine of an airliner in mid-flight. Other cryptocurrencies like Tron (TRX -1.01%) served a purpose for people all over the world, while Solana (SOL -0.84%) might benefit from a new product introduction.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bitcoin network stood strong in 2022, processing billions of dollars of transactions daily while being fully operational 24/7. There is plenty to look forward to in 2023. Although some observers feel that Bitcoin has fallen behind smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Bitcoin developers are working on an upgrade called Taro that could allow Bitcoin users to mint assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain, which would bring a new wave of enthusiasm to the oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the same time, a new protocol called Machankura, which was developed by an African developer named Kgothatso Ngako, is making Bitcoin accessible to more people than ever. The service, which allows people to send and receive Bitcoin via text message, is a boon in Africa where many people have cellphones that are not internet-enabled, meaning that Machankura has the potential to bring accessibility to Bitcoin to millions of more users.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nAs mentioned above, Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake in 2022, which reduced its carbon footprint by more than 99% and made it easier than ever for even casual Ethereum users to earn rewards for participating in the Ethereum network. Ethereum users can now use a third-party service like Lido Finance, Coinbase, or Rocket Pool to stake their Ethereum -- basically locking it up to process transactions and secure the network.\n\nUsers seamlessly earn staking fees with interest rates of between 3.87% and 4.6%, depending on which of these pools they are using, with no minimum amount of Ethereum required to get started. These yields are competitive with those of dividend stocks and Treasury bonds, and require minimal effort or technical know-how to get started.\n\nAlthough The Merge was a milestone for Ethereum in 2022, Ethereum isn't done making improvements. In two months, Ethereum is tentatively scheduled for its next big upgrade, Shanghai, which will allow users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. This will give users increased liquidity and remove much of the risk around staking -- investors will be able to withdraw their staked Ethereum if they want to trade it or need the money, as opposed to locking it in for an indefinite time period, which is the case now.\n\n3. Tron\n\nAlthough crypto discourse can often wander into philosophical debate, these pontificators often forget that most people simply want a product that works and is cost-efficient. That's exactly what they are getting with Tron. Tron is fast, it gets user's money from point A to point B safely and reliably, and it is remarkably cheap -- fees on Tron cost less than a penny.\n\nThere is something to be said for this type of simplicity and reliability, and that's why people all over the world are using Tron. There are now more than 130 million Tron accounts, and the Tron blockchain has processed 4.6 billion transactions worth over $6.3 trillion since its inception.\n\nTron is particularly popular with users in emerging markets who want to transact in dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the past 24 hours, more than 2 million transfers using Tether were sent and received on the Tron blockchain, showing that Tron is a key cog in the economic engine of much of the developing world. As people all over the globe continue to use Tron for its simplicity and reliability, it is a good cryptocurrency to have exposure to over the long term.\n\n4. Solana\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies took heavy losses in 2022, few had a worse year than Solana, which fell more than 94% from its high of $260 in November 2021 and was barely able to stay above $10 by year-end. In addition to the challenges that all cryptocurrencies faced, Solana dealt with additional headwinds in the form of the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX. FTX, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and his Alameda Research hedge fund were heavy investors in Solana and many tokens within the Solana universe. For example, Solana and Serum (a Solana token) made up a large portion of the assets on FTX's balance sheet.\n\nBut as the calendar turned to 2023, Solana started to fight back and it has more than doubled since Jan. 1. I don't think it's realistic to expect Solana's rally to continue at this scorching pace all year, but clearly a sense of optimism has returned to Solana and it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that it will chalk up a decent gain for the year.\n\nThe excitement over a new dog-themed meme coin called Bonk, which was AirDropped to many Solana users, is a large part of what's driving the rally. Although it's a silly name and it may not have long-term staying power (at one point Bonk had gained over 3,000% after launching, but then fell more than 50% in a 24-hour period), it seems to have propelled a wave of activity on the Solana blockchain and ushered in a new era of enthusiasm, helping it move past the aftermath of the FTX collapse.\n\nLike Tron, Solana is a fast and cheap blockchain, and a lot of people are using it. Solana has processed more than 130 billion transactions and right now, it is processing well over 3,300 transactions per second. Like Tron, Solana charges negligible fees.\n\nWhile 2020-2021 was an incredible time for crypto, I think it would be unreasonable for investors to expect those types of gains in 2023, or even further out. However, with the progress that these cryptocurrencies are making, I think that it's entirely reasonable to expect that they will finish 2023 up. With slow and steady progress, and gains that are more sustainable than in the past, it would be a welcome change after what crypto investors endured last year."

        "content": "Web3 designer Ric Burton shared how Vitalik Buterin sent him 10,000 Ether (ETH) in 2016 as compensation for Buton\u2019s one-month work in 2014 via a thread he posted on Twitter.\n\nMeeting the community\n\nBurton\u2019s story starts in 2014, just after he got \u201ckicked out of a profitable company\u201d he co-founded. While listening to Bitcoin-related podcasts, Burton says he heard Buterin say, \u201cI want to build a blockchain that I can run programs on.\u201d\n\nWhile admitting being intrigued, Burton said he didn\u2019t change his daily routine to pursue this \u201cEthereum thing.\u201d However, after hearing about Ethereum two more times, Burton says, he finally decided to see Gavin Wood\u2018s speech.\n\nBurton wrote:\n\n\u201cI went along to the gathering and watched Gavin talk about how Facebook\u2019s control of WhatsApp, Instagram & all of the social web was antithetical to the principles upon which the Internet was founded. He talked about trying to shift the pendulum back towards decentralisation. I had absolutely not idea what he was talking about. But I liked the cut of his jib.\u201d\n\nAfter the talk, Burton went up to Wood and asked if ETH needed any designers. Upon this, Wood invited Burton into the core ETH community. \u201cI was hooked,\u201d says Burton, and says he left the UK to fly to the Bay area to meet up with Buterin himself.\n\n\u201cWe met up, jumped on a train, and talked a bit about his plans. I could barely keep up.\u201d\n\nBurton said. According to his thread, the only time Burton had with Buterin was the time they spent together on the train and the car drive to San Francisco the next day, where Buterin context-switched between \u201clearning Mandarin on his phone, talking to engineers about protocol architecture, and engage deeply with Burton\u2019s questions about user interfaces.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Burton said he hadn\u2019t seen Buterin for three years after that. However, Burton continued to stay engaged with the ETH community through Wood. According to the thread, Burton kept designing and adjusting according to Wood\u2019s feedback. At the same time, however, Burton was running out of money. After a month, Burton said had to leave the community because he was \u201cflat broke.\u201d\n\nThe money comes back.\n\nBurton went about his business after leaving the ETH circle until he heard back from someone at the Ethereum Foundation two years later who wanted to pay him some ETH.\n\nHe writes:\n\n\u201cI had no idea what that would involve, but I liked the sound of getting paid. I checked the price of Ether, it had skyrocketed to $1! That meant they were going to pay me ~$10,000\u2014I was over the moon.\u201d\n\nEven though Burton accepted immediately, the transfer never came. Since the price of ETH started to increase, Burton kept asking the foundation for the ETH, fearing they might change their minds about sending it.\n\nEventually, Burton says, \u201cI hit a boiling point.\u201d He sends Buterin a direct message on Skype, \u201cbegging for the Ether.\u201d According to Burton, Buterin apologized for the delay and sent the funds immediately.\n\nBurton finalizes his story by saying:\n\n\u201cThis is the transaction that changed my life. I totally lost my mind. I had around $100,000 of liquidity from this wonderful community. I immediately sold a third of it to pay down debts. I had finally found: community liquidity.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Merkle Tree in Blockchain: What is it and How does it work - Simplilearn",
        "content": "A hash tree, also known as a Merkle tree, is a tree in which each leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of its child nodes' labels. The majority of hash tree implementations are binary (each node has two child nodes), but they can also have many more child nodes.\n\nBut what actually is the Merkle tree in Blockchain, and how it is used in Blockchain? So, if you want to know the answer to all these questions, then you are in the right place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Tree?\n\nMerkle trees, also known as Binary hash trees, are a prevalent sort of data structure in computer science.\n\nIn bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they're used to encrypt blockchain data more efficiently and securely.\n\nIt's a mathematical data structure made up of hashes of various data blocks that summarize all the transactions in a block.\n\nIt also enables quick and secure content verification across big datasets and verifies the consistency and content of the data.\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Root?\n\nA Merkle root is a simple mathematical method for confirming the facts on a Merkle tree.\n\nThey're used in cryptocurrency to ensure that data blocks sent through a peer-to-peer network are whole, undamaged, and unaltered.\n\nThey play a very crucial role in the computation required to keep cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether running.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions\n\nA hash function maps any type of arbitrary data of any length to a fixed-size output. It is commonly used in cryptography since it is a cryptographic function.\n\nThey are efficient and are well-known for one property: they are irreversible. It's a one-way function that's only meant to work in one direction.\n\nSome of the Hash families available are Message Direct (MD), Secure Hash Function (SHF), and RIPE Message Direct (RIPEMD).\n\nNow, take an example, if you use the SHA256 hash algorithm and pass 101Blockchains as input, you will get the following output\n\nfbffd63a60374a31aa9811cbc80b577e23925a5874e86a17f712bab874f33ac9\n\nIn conclusion, these are the following key properties of the hash function:\n\nDeterministic\n\nPre-Image Resistant\n\nComputationally Efficient\n\nCannot be Reversed Engineered\n\nCollision Resistant\n\nWorking of Merkle Trees\n\nA Merkle tree totals all transactions in a block and generates a digital fingerprint of the entire set of operations, allowing the user to verify whether it includes a transaction in the block.\n\nMerkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.\n\nThey're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions.\n\nEach non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nNow, look at a little example of a Merkle Tree in Blockchain to help you understand the concept.\n\nConsider the following scenario: A, B, C, and D are four transactions, all executed on the same block. Each transaction is then hashed, leaving you with:\n\nHash A\n\nHash B\n\nHash C\n\nHash D\n\nThe hashes are paired together, resulting in:\n\nHash AB\n\nand\n\nHash CD\n\nAnd therefore, your Merkle Root is formed by combining these two hashes: Hash ABCD.\n\nIn reality, a Merkle Tree is much more complicated (especially when each transaction ID is 64 characters long). Still, this example helps you have a good overview of how the algorithms work and why they are so effective.\n\nBenefits of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nMerkle trees provide four significant advantages -\n\nValidate the data's integrity: It can be used to validate the data's integrity effectively.\n\nTakes little disk space: Compared to other data structures, the Merkle tree takes up very little disk space.\n\nTiny information across networks: Merkle trees can be broken down into small pieces of data for verification.\n\nEfficient Verification: The data format is efficient, and verifying the data's integrity takes only a few moments.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Is It Essential to Blockchain?\n\nThink of a blockchain without Merkle Trees to get a sense of how vital they are for blockchain technology. Let\u2019s have one of Bitcoin because its use of Merkle Trees is essential for the cryptocurrency and easier to grasp.\n\nIf Bitcoin didn't include Merkle Trees, per se, every node on the network would have to retain a complete copy of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. One can imagine how much information that would be.\n\nAny authentication request on Bitcoin would require an enormous amount of data to be transferred over the network: therefore, you'll need to validate the data on your own.\n\nTo confirm that there were no modifications, a computer used for validation would need a lot of computing power to compare ledgers.\n\nMerkle Trees are a solution to this issue. They hash records in accounting, thereby separating the proof of data from the data itself.\n\nProving that giving tiny amounts of information across the network is all that is required for a transaction to be valid.\n\nFurthermore, it enables you to demonstrate that both ledger variations are identical in terms of nominal computer power and network bandwidth.\n\nUse-Cases of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nThere are more Merkle tree implementations out there.\n\nGit, a distributed version control system, is one of the most widely used. It is used to handle projects by programmers from all around the world.\n\nInterplanetary File System, a peer-to-peer distributed protocol, is another suitable implementation. It's also open-source, allowing computers to join and use a centralized file system.\n\nIt's part of the technique that generates verifiable certificate transparency logs.\n\nAmazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra use it during the data replication process. These No-SQL distributed databases use Merkle trees to control discrepancies.\n\nDecipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain with the Blockchain Certification Training Course. Get trained today.\n\nConclusion\n\nMerkle Tree is an essential fundamental of Blockchain technology, enabling its growth in the IT World. Simplilearn's Blockchain Certification Training was designed for developers who want to decipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain, Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and many other technologies like Merkle Tree. You'll learn the core structure and technical mechanisms of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Dogecoin, and Multichain Blockchain platforms and their underlying technologies.\n\nHope you liked the tutorial on Merkle Tree in Blockchain, in case of any doubts, please ask your questions in the comment section below."

So, let\u2019s start with the basics.\n\nA blockchain is a \u201cshared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust,\u201d according to IBM.\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption to enable it to function as a currency and virtual accounting system, according to Oswego State University of New York.\n\nEthereum is community-run tech that powers the cryptocurrency ether and decentralized apps.\n\nHedera is a company that goes one step beyond blockchains. They are an enterprise-grade network and maker of the HBAR cryptocurrency. Hedera helps developers create applications.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is \u201csoftware that executes smart contracts and computes the state of the Ethereum network after each new block is added to the chain,\u201d according to com.\n\nWhat is Hedera doing to help address an ongoing issue where developers are lacking EVM compatibility?\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of Gossip About Gossip by Hedera, podcast Host and SVP Communications, Swirlds Labs, Zenobia Godschalk, speaks with Nana Essilfie-Conduah, Senior Software Engineer, Swirlds Labs, about where Hedera is with EVM compatibility and what their future looks like in advancing this compatibility and connecting with the community.\n\nGodschalk and Essilfie-Conduah also discussed\u2026\n\nHow Hedera has used EthereumJ to provide support for the Ethereum virtual machines and what limitations they faced with this Developer feedback on Hedera\u2019s EVM feedback and the Hedera\u2019s future roadmap How Hedera engages with community members\n\nEssilfie-Conduah provided insight into what Hedera\u2019s compatibility future looks like. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the pipeline is pushing from Etherum compatibility to equivalence. So, at the low levels, if they\u2019re alcoves that are supported on the EVM that we didn\u2019t before, we are now upgrading the system to be able to handle those things. And, like I said, to be able to get to the point where you can take any smart contract from Etherum, bring it over, and you\u2019ll be good there,\u201d he stated.\n\nNana Essilfie-Conduah is an experienced software engineer and programming analyst in the tech and consulting industries. He is currently Senior Software Engineer at Swirlds Labs and Hedera Hashgraph. He earned a BS in Aerospace Engineering and an MS in Engineering Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Essilfie-Conduah also holds a variety of edX certificates."

        "title": "Web3 developer activity spiked in Q4 2022 despite market volatility - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Web3 developer activity still grew in the last quarter of 2022, according to a new report, despite crypto market volatility and stacks of negative headlines.\n\nEthereum, one of the largest layer-1 (L1) blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, had a 453% increase in mainnet smart contract deployments in the fourth quarter of 2022, signaling high developer momentum amid crypto market volatility, according to Alchemy\u2019s Web3 Development Report.\n\n\u201cAs we saw in Q3 as well, web3 devs are long-term committed to building out this ecosystem because they believe in the technology,\u201d Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, said to TechCrunch. \u201cThat durable belief, paired with more reliable infrastructure, better tooling and increasing consumer adoption every quarter, is compelling devs to dig their heels in despite unfavorable market conditions.\u201d\n\nThe global market capitalization of the crypto market has fallen from over $2 trillion at the beginning of 2022 to about $800 billion by the end of the year, according to CoinMarketCap data. The two biggest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, fell 14% and 8.77%, respectively, from the beginning to the end of the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cSpecifically in Q4, developers appear to be entering a period where deploying more smart contracts is relevant given product maturity, and post-Merge, there is renewed confidence and more affordable deployment costs,\u201d Shah said.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum network went through a system upgrade, dubbed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which shifted the blockchain from proof-of-work (PoW) into proof-of-stake (PoS). The multiyear plan was one of the most talked-about events of 2022 and attracted both developers and investors.\n\nEthereum-focused developer tool downloads also rose 16% quarter over quarter, while Goerli testnet smart contracts, a web3 application developers use to test applications before launching on mainnet, rose 187% during the same time frame, the Alchemy report showed.\n\nThe metrics are a combination of both publicly available data (i.e., NPM downloads for SDK libraries and Dune for Blockchain data) and internal Alchemy data (i.e., API usage, Alchemy Ventures and Alchemy University) that \u201cbest represent the stages of a developer\u2019s journey from ideation to scaling their dApp,\u201d Shah said.\n\nAnd the growth wasn\u2019t limited to Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2 (L2) bridging solutions, like Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet and zkSync, which aim to scale Ethereum, also grew 43% quarter over quarter and spiked 155% in year-over-year growth, the report stated.\n\n\u201cThis report was heavily focused on [Ethereum virtual machine], which uncovered major growth on Ethereum L1 along with L2s like Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism,\u201d Shah said.\n\nOther L1 blockchains, like Solana, saw astronomical growth, Shah said. \u201cWith greater than 1,000% growth in active Solana teams on Alchemy and API usage surging to 277% quarter over quarter, the Solana ecosystem continues to impress.\u201d\n\nThere are benefits to developers building on Solana, like \u201csuper high\u201d transactions per second, incredibly low gas fees (less than 1 cent per transaction) and a strong marketplace, Shah added. \u201cSo this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe web3 dev community is seemingly unflappable,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThey\u2019re as focused and motivated as ever to build the future of this ecosystem while honestly acknowledging the unnecessary setbacks we have seen in 2022.\u201d\n\nSome of those setbacks include the collapse of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022 and the demise of one of the (once) largest crypto exchanges, FTX, in November 2022.\n\nHowever, going into 2023, there might be a slower pace of growth, Shah noted.\n\n\u201cWe expect developer activity to continue to increase, though potentially at a slower rate given decreasing investment in web3 companies,\u201d Shah said.\n\nIn general, many investors are trying to put last year\u2019s chaotic crypto market behind them and look to the future. But the competition in the market will continue to grow as investors write fewer checks and become more selective in a \u201cwait and see game,\u201d TechCrunch previously reported.\n\nEven if growth slows, free access to educational web3 platforms, which help developers onboard and build new skills, and easier-to-use tooling could help accelerate the community.\n\n\u201cWe think developers will continue to pour into the space,\u201d Shah said."

        "title": "Ethereum Full Steam Ahead to Shanghai Update - This Morning On Chain",
        "content": "The Ethereum all developer call confirmed that Shanghai is on track for release, but that's only because of what they cut.\n\nThis week, Ethereum developers met to hold their frequent \u201call developer call\u201d where they discuss the progress they\u2019re making on the blockchain. This time there was a focus on the upcoming Shanghai update, which will allow stakers to recover their staked ETH.\n\nThe news from this call was positive, but with a few caveats. Shanghai is currently expected to roll out in March, and some developers have said they\u2019re not aware of any issues that could push back the release date. That\u2019s a big deal for Ethereum, as right now there are some $23B locked up in Ethereum staking that can\u2019t be withdrawn. That\u2019s a whopping 16M ETH.\n\nDevelopers recently launched their devnet2, an internal testing environment for them to validate that the new version of Ethereum is working without bugs. The deployment worked with some minor bugs, though they were reportedly within their expectations. The developers are expecting to release the first full public testnet in February.\n\nThe downside here is why the Shanghai update is easy to predict\u2013they\u2019ve delayed most of the major items that had previously been planned for this update. There were plans to increase efficiency and decrease cost of layer 2 transactions on Ethereum by a mechanism called \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s what they called it. Ethereum devs also pushed back planned work on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the mechanism that settles smart contracts.\n\nOn the plus side, Ethereum is getting un-staking capabilities ASAP, and it will come in a very low risk manner. As with any technical changes, the fewer changes there are, the easier it is to catch all of the possible bugs in the code. I think after the time it took for the team to roll out The Merge, it\u2019s a good idea to show a little momentum and push out high visibility features quickly to continue rebuilding trust in the development team."

        "content": "When I entered crypto, I succumbed to the contest between blockchain ecosystems, believing one had to be \u201cbetter\u201d than others. I have since realized the future of cryptocurrency is bringing with it a variety of platforms that will excel at different things. With the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), I\u2019ve left behind the days of thinking chains have to compete and embrace a connected interchain future. Let me explain.\n\nSolana, Polkadot, etc. \u2014 what do they have in common? They are individual state machines, each trying to achieve something only one has done before: create a sustainable, robust ecosystem of developers, investors and, most importantly, users.\n\nSo far, Ethereum shows no signs of slowing. Since beginning the summer of 2020 with an 8% share of the total crypto market, Ether (ETH) has since captured nearly 20% of the market and has remained there.\n\nThere is a reason why the first sentence of many pitches for layer-1 solutions includes the term \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d It\u2019s the Moby Dick of crypto \u2014 the liquidity king. And so, many projects take on the challenge of improving upon Ethereum, to \u201cbuild it better.\u201d Unfortunately, the first thing is often a \u201cbridge.\u201d Bridges have exposed users to many risks and resulted in a large number of problems. However, most people are blissfully unaware they are exposed to exploits during the process of bridging and for the entire time that bridged assets are held. Most are also unaware they are holding nothing more than an IOU.\n\nRelated: zkEVM could be the endgame for blockchain infrastructure\n\nThe original token that represents everything they bought sits on its original chain. Meanwhile, they\u2019re trading the equivalent of a piece of paper.\n\nThere are obviously exceptions to the rule. At most, good bridges can decrease risks, but the baseline stays the same. Bridges range from centralized to \u201csemicentralized,\u201d and there is one thing they can never do: actually move an asset to a new chain. Why? Because the two individual networks that the blockchain assets are bridged between have absolutely no way of communicating with one another. They speak different languages because most chains were never designed to communicate with one another.\n\nThe existence of bridges is a symptom of a \u201cme vs. you\u201d mentality, where chains try to get each other\u2019s liquidity.\n\nThe four most expensive decentralized finance hacks in 2022 were all bridge exploits: Ronin, the BNB Smart Chain bridge, Wormhole and Nomad. Combined, users lost more than $2 billion. That\u2019s about the same amount users lost as a result of the FTX collapse.\n\nInter-Blockchain Communication packet lifecycle. Credit: ibcprotocol.org\n\nSo, what if we change the \u201cme vs. you\u201d mentality to \u201cus vs. centralization\u201d? What if we could come together and decide on communication standards?\n\nWhile this may not seem radical for some, it\u2019s novel for crypto. This new system has a name: the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, or IBC.\n\nIBC is a standard for messaging and interacting between different blockchains at the protocol level. It\u2019s the product of years of work on the idea that different blockchains should retain their sovereignty.\n\nAllowing users free flow between diverse blockchains creates higher capital efficiency and faster innovation. In a way, it mirrors a pure capitalist system in which money finds its way to the preferred destination easier, safer and quicker. You can compare it to the Schengen area in philosophy.\n\nWhile IBC is currently a product that only exists in Cosmos, teams like Composable Finance and PolymerDAO are working on bringing it to Kusama, Polkadot, Near and more in the future.\n\nRelated: Programming languages prevent mainstream DeFi\n\nIs IBC perfect? Of course not. It\u2019s only a year old. But its existence is priceless because it shows what the future of crypto could look like. With IBC, it\u2019s possible to move beyond ecosystem wars to create an interoperable, fluid network of different solutions to face a shared challenge: building a permissionless, noncustodial future for all.\n\nIBC is a glimpse into the future of blockchains where ecosystems complement each other and allow users to try out \u201ccompetitors\u201d frictionlessly so that users can decide which products they want to use without restrictions.\n\nWe can move beyond the playground fights of trying to destroy each other\u2019s sand castles. Instead, let\u2019s use our shovels to build safe roads together.\n\nValentin Pletnev is the co-founder and CEO of Quasar Finance.

The developers have recently dropped the news of preparedness for the upgrade\u2019s launch in March. The upgrade will mean that the staked Ethereum will be open for withdrawals.

Ethereum had hit 500,000 validators whereas the total ETH staked reached 16 million figure. While the recent price recovery in the crypto market translated into rise in ETH price, the cryptocurrency could be in for further rise ahead of the upgrade.

While the previous resistance of $1,500 has been broken, it remains to be seen how long the cryptocurrency will take to breach the next resistance level.

Despite a more than 50% drop in crypto values last year, the long-term bull case for digital assets remains firmly intact.\n\nThe technology that powers these digital assets will undoubtedly be used more universally, providing stability, security, and transparency to numerous transactions worldwide. The long-term potential for cryptocurrency investment and the article covers the best cryptos that will make you rich in 1o years.\n\nWhen deciding which cryptos to wager on, it\u2019s imperative to consider the upside and the risks involved. Some cryptos are riskier than others; therefore, finding a balance between growth and safety is critical.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerhaps the most compelling argument to invest in cryptos is that they have shed a ton of value this year. Markets have taken a monumental beating as the Fed continues to wage its battle against rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven its 13-year price history, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC-USD) relative stability rivals that of the conventional stock market and helps to provide a sense of security for those looking to invest in digital currency.\n\nThis also implies greater liquidity for BTC, which may increase its global reach, making it more accessible to wider markets. Furthermore, the growing adoption of Bitcoin by mainstream financial institutions has only been hastened by the Bitcoin ETFs that have sprung up in recent years.\n\nThe current economy is showing clear signs of health and growth, with the most recent jobs report indicating a flourishing labor market. With Bitcoin\u2019s expected halving event within its usual cycle, BTC\u2019s value will likely shoot up in response if the Fed reverses course on its monetary policy in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is the most valuable and preferred blockchain network for developers, dubbed the \u201clifeblood\u201d of everything useful in this sector.\n\nEthereum is unparalleled in creating decentralized applications (dapps) with its robust and scalable platform. It dominates crypto niches such as non-fungible tokens and dapps, holding more than a 50% market share in these markets. Hence, it\u2019s arguably the top crypto in terms of real-world utility.\n\nEthereum made waves in the crypto sphere with the Merge upgrade last year. Even more exciting is the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, slated for some time in March. This upgrade will bring even more options to ETH enthusiasts.\n\nThese upgrades will surely be game changers and only add further value to those already holding Ether tokens. It\u2019s no wonder Ethereum is being hailed as one of the most sought-after cryptos.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano (ADA) token with blue and orange digital background.\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) is an exciting cryptocurrency platform for those looking to load up on a \u201cmillionaire-maker\u201d digital asset.\n\nThe smart contract platform features a native currency, ADA, which allows users to build decentralized applications and create tokens. Plus, with the backing of its team made up of Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and pertinent partnerships, it\u2019s no surprise that Cardano is quickly becoming one of the most promising digital assets on the market.\n\nCardano is making a big move towards the world of DeFi by launching their Layer 2 scaling solution, Hydra. With a potential theoretical maximum speed of up to 10 million TPS, it would certainly make Cardano much more competitive than before.\n\nWith the addition of Djed as an algorithmic stablecoin, Cardano could become one of the leaders in decentralized finance. According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, Cardano outpaced its peers in development activity last year.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image.

This groundbreaking layer-1 blockchain has previously enabled developers to create and deploy formerly-impossible solutions. Thanks to its lightning-fast transaction speeds, this new challenger has quickly gained traction in the Ethereum-dominated market, providing a better user experience.\n\nWith an innovative proof-of-history validation mechanism, Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second while keeping low costs and fees, allowing users to access the benefits of DeFi without breaking the bank.\n\nSolana has proven to be a powerful DeFi platform for multiple projects. The amount of activity on the platform is already huge and impressive. In addition, it\u2019s fast becoming an industry leader in the NFT space, with record-breaking trading volume happening this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the technical infrastructure that Solana has built up over time is only strengthening their position in the market. As such, Solana could easily become the go-to protocol for DeFi and NFTs in the upcoming years.\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nA Binance Coin sits in front of trading charts. Binance price predictions\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBinance (BNB-USD) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of over $45 billion.\n\nThe massive growth in its platform is mainly credited to Binance, which offers a world-class exchange platform that users leverage to buy, sell, and trade digital assets securely and efficiently.\n\nOver the past year, the blowup of FTX has caused waves within the crypto community, with investors growing increasingly concerned about centralized exchanges. Despite this, the truth is that retail investors still rely heavily on exchanges like Binance as an integral part of gaining exposure to cryptos.\n\nIn other words, despite the rising demand for decentralization, Binance still plays a major role in bringing cryptocurrency access to everyday traders.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB utility token is now being used to support web 3.0 decentralized apps on the BNB Smart Chain, and that\u2019s just the start of some exciting times ahead for this burgeoning blockchain. As more developers choose this infrastructure, it\u2019s possible to see a healthy expansion in BNB\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nGolden Polkadot (DOT-USD) dot coin cryptocurrency on computer electronic circuit board background\n\nSource: Thichaa / Shutterstock.com\n\nPolkadot (DOT-USD) saw its value skyrocket in value in 2021 and was one of the standout performers of that year, but it plummeted to multi-year lows as part of the crypto winter last year. Nevertheless, it remains one of the top crypto bets this year due to its burgeoning use cases.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s interconnectivity enables it to act as a bridge between multiple blockchain networks, thereby creating an extremely secure network for efficient data transfer.\n\nThis same underlying technology that allowed Polkadot to gain popularity among investors is still there and provides the potential for future growth. While DOT has recently had difficulty, the fundamentals remain strong.\n\nIt could be an excellent opportunity for potentially huge returns if investors stay patient long enough for its value to begin surging again. Moreover, with Europe\u2019s largest telecom business, Deutsche Telekom, buying a large quantity of DOT tokens in 2021, the platform will continue garnering mainstream attention.\n\nChainlink ( LINK )\n\na digital representation of the chainlink (LINK) cryptocurrency\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock.com\n\nChainlink\u2019s (LINK-USD) ability to create secure, universal connections between various blockchains is extraordinary.\n\nIt has opened up an entire world of potential applications through its abstraction layer technology, bringing us closer to achieving interoperability between disparate blockchains for smart contract development. Its reliable and secure pathways make it easier to develop smart contracts without worrying about compatibility woes from blockchain-to-blockchain interactions.\n\nChainlink has established itself as one of the most important blockchain projects in revolutionizing how we use distributed ledger technology today.\n\nChainlink is a power player in decentralized finance, offering cutting-edge solutions for creating crypto products with added layers of security. This is thanks partly to its extraordinary advisory team including celebrity execs such as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and ex-LinkedIn honcho Jeff Weiner.\n\nThe wealth of experience and knowledge brought to the table by Chainlink\u2019s board members should open lots of doors to developing technology with real-world relevance and usability.\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque held a LONG position in Ethereum and Solana.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe team behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), the dog-themed meme coin, has announced the upcoming beta release of Shibarium, a layer-2 network that will operate on top of Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the team, Shibarium will reportedly minimize costs and increase transaction speeds \u2014though the exact number of transactions per second has not yet been disclosed.\n\nThe announcement did not specify when the testnet will launch, but said that they are \"approaching the finishing touches.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium will be operated and secured via validators and delegators that stake their tokens to receive rewards. These rewards will come in the form of BONE\u2014currently a governance token for decentralized exchange ShibaSwap that will become the Shibarium's gas token\u2014and a soon-to-be-launched TREAT token.\n\nIt is unclear how exactly the TREAT token will be used, and the Shiba Inu team did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe announcement also outlined a new SHIB burning mechanism that will replace the previous Burn Portal, which incentivized users to burn their SHIB but did not require it. After Shibarium is launched, all transactions on the network will require an amount of SHIB to be burned, putting deflationary pressure on the total SHIB supply\u2014an often-requested feature by the Shiba community.\n\n\"By implementing this feature, burning SHIB tokens per transaction will be reflected in the total token supply as we hope it will have a significant impact on the circulating amount of the $SHIB supply over time,\" according to the announcement.\n\nWhile this announcement is for the launch of the Shibarium testnet, it also noted that one key update would not be included until the launch of the mainnet: the integration of ShibaSwap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce the mainnet goes live, ShibaSwap will be moved to the network \"to improve the Liquidity Pools and their curves to attract more liquidity, both in regular and stable pairs.\"\n\nAs for Shiba Inu\u2019s token, SHIB jumped 2.5% over the last day, and a whopping 20% amid the wider crypto market\u2019s rally."

        "content": "Arbitrum and Optimism raked millions in profit despite the extended bear market that hammered decentralized finance (DeFi) activities and Ethereum (ETH) valuation in 2022.\n\nArbitrum And Optimism Win Big\n\nPer on-chain data shared on Twitter, Arbitrum, and Optimism, general-purpose Ethereum layer-2 platforms, made 2,906 ETH and 2,086ETH, respectively. In USD terms, it translates to around $4.6 million and $3.3 million for each protocol.\n\nL2s are amazing businesses Arbitrum made 2,906ETH ($4.6M) of profit in 2022 Optimism made 2,086ETH ($3.3M) of profit in 2022 pic.twitter.com/ViOkPA0Juv \u2014 Kofi (@0xKofi) January 17, 2023\n\nBased on user activity and the number of dApps launched on Ethereum, solid statistics show that developers prefer the first smart contracting over competitors. Since launching, the network has become a hub of activity, spearheading exciting innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse, and gaming.\n\nTrackers in mid-January 2023 state that the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum stands at $26.88 billion, representing more than half of the assets locked across DeFi. The drop in TVL mirrors the fall in ETH prices in 2022.\n\n\n\nIn essence, Ethereum dominates with DeFi activity over the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), trailing at less than a quarter of the TVL of the leading platform, at $4.65 billion.\n\nDespite this dominance, Ethereum\u2019s scaling problem directly impacts Gas fees. As demand picks up, Gas fees fluctuate, leading to as much as $50 on this blockchain to post a simple transaction. Deploying smart contracts cost much more, sometimes upwards of $80, when the network is congested. As an illustration, the average transaction fees on Ethereum stood at $0.63 on January 17. However, on May 1, 2022, this figure stood at over $23.\n\nEthereum layer-2 protocols are part of the scaling attempts made by developers to relieve the mainnet. By routing transactions off-chain, layer-2 solutions can help scale Ethereum but, most importantly, reduce Gas fees by several magnitudes.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 realm, Arbitrum and Optimism dominate. According to L2Beat statistics, Arbitrum and Optimism had TVLs of $2.52 billion and $1.45 billion, with a market share of 52% and roughly 30%, respectively.\n\nRiding on Network Effects\n\nAlthough associated fees in Arbitrum, Optimism, and all other layer-2 networks are negligibly low, these protocols can profit based on activity. For every transfer or smart contract execution of Arbitrum and Optimism, there is an associated fee.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism charge $0.11 and $0.23 for simple transfers, payable in ETH. If a smart contract is deployed, the fees rise to $0.30 and $0.35. They make more fees as more users deploy smart contracts or initiate transfers. Accumulating these amounts over months translate to a tidy profit for the protocol operator.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum layer-2 TVL fell roughly 40% from $7.45 billion to $3.3 billion in July 2022. Outflows were lower compared to layer-1 DeFi. As the market recovers, layer-2 operators may likely post higher revenue as users move assets to dApps launched on these scalable and low-fee protocols.\n\nFeatured image from Flickr, Charts from TradingView.com.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "NEW YORK, Jan. 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Obol Labs announced the close of a $12.5 million Series A financing round. Pantera Capital and Archetype co-led the round, with new participation from BlockTower, Nascent, Placeholder, Spartan, and IEX, and follow-on investment from Coinbase Ventures and Ethereal Ventures. This latest round brings Obol Labs' total financing to $19M, making it the best-capitalized software team focused on developing Distributed Validator Technology to decentralize and secure blockchain staking.\n\nIn September, Ethereum upgraded to Proof-of-Stake, a consensus mechanism that laid the foundation for more democratized network participation by allowing individuals with 32 ETH to run a node and validate the network. However, technical expertise is still needed to operate a node while avoiding offline and slashing penalties. For many that don't have the necessary expertise to maintain a node or want to stake in smaller quantities, exchanges and staking-as-a-service providers have filled a major market gap, now representing ~75% of the estimated $20B staked on Ethereum. While providing an important service, centralized management of stake creates a risk to the integrity of the entire network. For Ethereum to be a global settlement layer, its middleware also must be incorruptible and credibly neutral.\n\nObol Labs, as the leading builder of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), is directly solving the issue of single points of failure in staking infrastructure. DVT is a technology primitive that allows an Ethereum Proof-of-Stake validator to be run simultaneously on more than one machine (mentioned in Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum roadmap). The major breakthrough is the ability to split up a single validator private key, making it possible for a group of people to share validation rights of an Ethereum validator. The company's raise in the depth of crypto winter, as venture funding has decreased by over 60%, validates the importance of DVT for the next generation of Web3 scalability.\n\nRunning a validator as a cluster of nodes means more staking resilience: validators are less likely to go offline; validator keys are less likely to be compromised; and there is less correlation risk for the entire network if validator clients have software bugs. Ultimately, DVT allows network validators of any magnitude to increase resilience, distribution of stake, and security.\n\nCollin Myers, Obol Labs CEO and Co-Founder: \"Turbulent events of 2022, including the FTX collapse, make decentralization a key priority on all levels of the Web3 stack. To make networks more secure, staking must be decentralized by design. Obol's DVT brings decentralization and resiliency to the ground floor of staking products. Our current focus is Ethereum, but in the future, we'll have implementations with Cosmos and Ethereum L2 networks.\"\n\n\"Obol Labs have excelled in bringing together a community of solo stakers and staking-as-a-service providers alike to advance Distributed Validator Technology. Obol plays a critical role in improving validator participation and scaling Ethereum through its next phase of growth. We are also excited to see how Obol advances DVT among other Proof-of-Stake blockchains in the coming year,\" said Paul Veradittakit, General Partner of Pantera Capital.\n\nOis\u00edn Kyne, CTO at Obol Labs, added, \"Today, we think of validators as individuals or single entities. We think validators should actually be run as groups. Instead of only being able to run a validator alone, we want to enable you to run validators with a community of other stakers cooperatively.\"\n\nObol Labs is actively working with leading liquid staking protocols like Lido, Stakewise, and more to implement DVT into their operator set. In addition, a large majority of Obol's earliest seed supporters are the likes of Coinbase Ventures, Figment, Blockdaemon, Chorus One, and a collection of other industry-leading validators that are actively testing, adopting, and helping build Obol's DVT technology.\n\n\"Today, staking-as-a-service protocols and providers make up the most adopted segment of the staking industry, which makes it the most critical segment to advance infrastructures that improve staking resiliency and decentralization,\" said Ash Egan, Founder and General Partner of Archetype.\n\nIn addition to working with larger validators, Obol Labs is helping to improve solo validator participation with their active community of 9,000+ members across 20+ countries. Together, at-home validators participating in Obol Labs testnets are running hundreds of multi-continent distributed validators on the Ethereum Goerli network with other operators using the recently launched DV Launchpad.\n\nObol Labs' Series A will accelerate the Obol Network's roadmap for bringing DVT to Mainnet Ethereum. Obol will also support the advancement of DVT across other Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Cosmos, as well as the L2 ecosystem to help address the resiliency of sequencers.\n\nAbout Obol Labs:\n\nObol Labs is an R&D team building infrastructure technologies for Ethereum and other Proof-of-Stake blockchains to scale consensus and ensure decentralization. Consisting of members across 13+ countries, the core team is currently focused on bringing Distributed Validator Technology to Ethereum.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDeGods has dominated the Solana NFT space, racking up more trading volume in SOL than any other project. It now plans to move over to Ethereum, and the project appears to have already caught the eye of at least one big investor in the space.\n\nA pseudonymous NFT trader known as \"Pokeee\" spent nearly $1 million to sweep 69 DeGods NFTs on Monday. Pokeee made the buy through the Magic Eden marketplace, using its tool that lets buyers \u201csweep the floor\u201d or buy up a desired amount of NFTs from a project. Traders sometimes purchase numerous lowest-priced NFTs in a project as a bet on the future success of the collection, rather than individually selecting more valuable assets.\n\nPokeee previously promised to do so if his tweet from January 13 received 1,000 likes on Twitter. He wrote that he would buy 69 of the NFTs \u201cin support of\u201d the project\u2019s impending move to Ethereum, and the tweet ultimately racked up nearly 3,000 likes. Three days later, the approximately $900,000 purchase was completed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMagic Eden previously only allowed up to 50 NFTs to be purchased at a time through its bulk buying feature. But when prompted by the prospective buyer, who claimed that the proposed change was \u201cof ultimate inconvenience\u201d late on Sunday, the marketplace upgraded the functionality and enabled the larger mass purchase.\n\nPokeee (on Twitter) claims to be the same owner behind the Pokeee.eth Ethereum wallet, which holds three valuable Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs as well as the titular Ethereum Name Service (ENS) name and other NFT collectibles.\n\nIn a text interview that Magic Eden posted today via the marketplace's website, Pokeee claimed that he runs a private crypto fund, and said that he made this sizable DeGods play due to the project\u2019s planned move to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cMy purpose of this investment is actually to have them bridged to ETH,\u201d he said. \u201cDue to on-chain risks, I wasn\u2019t able to deploy larger portions of my portfolio into Solana. I was having fun in Solana on smaller NFTs and mints back then.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDeGods has racked up some $135 million worth of trading volume to date, per data from CryptoSlam. While it\u2019s beaten in total USD trading value by projects like Solana Monkey Business and Degenerate Ape Academy that were popular when SOL was much more valuable, DeGods tops all projects on a SOL basis with 3.7 million SOL worth of trading to date.\n\nThe project launched in late 2021 but rose significantly in value and prominence last year, as developer DeLabs\u2014led by the pseudonymous Frank, who recently revealed his real name as Rohun Vora\u2014debuted a reward token, rolled out new artwork, purchased the rights to a BIG3 basketball league team, and launched a follow-up project called y00ts.\n\nIn late December, DeLabs announced that DeGods will be bridged to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet while y00ts will bridge over to Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain. The studio plans to complete both moves by the end of this quarter, and disclosed that it received a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs to move y00ts to the Polygon chain."

        "content": "New Offerings\n\nBinance introduces cold storage for institutional investors' collateralised crypto in leveraged trading\n\n\n\nBinance, one of the largest crypto exchanges, is now enabling institutional investors to hold their collateralized digital assets used for leveraged positions outside the platform. It will now allow investors to deposit their collateral with Binance Custody, which will safeguard the assets offline in cold storage wallets.\n\nOnce the trades are completed, the assets will then be made accessible to the user again. This feature is expected to be a significant benefit for investors who trade in the leveraged crypto markets, as it enables them to keep their collateral in secure offline storage, rather than having to keep it on the exchange. This way, users can continue to trade crypto during volatile market conditions without experiencing large outflows on the exchange. Read more here\n\n"

Don\u2019t hand over money or sign anything until you\u2019ve checked someone\u2019s credentials and their company\u2019s. Never send money to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, whether in the UK or abroad, or use methods of payment you\u2019re not comfortable with. Never give banking or personal details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust -this information is valuable so make sure you protect it. Always log on to a website directly rather than clicking on links in an email. Don\u2019t just rely on glowing testimonials. Find solid, independent evidence of a company\u2019s success. Always get independent or legal advice if an offer involves money, time or commitment. If you spot a scam or have been scammed, report it and get help. Don\u2019t be embarrassed about reporting a scam - by reporting it, you'll make it more difficult for them to deceive others."

And what that pain would look like could be a potential pullback before the bullish rally continues.\n\nWhat that could look like is the image below where we see the Ethereum price sell-off back down to the $1,176 key support level in the 4-hour timeframe before finding support and rallying higher.\n\n2 Possible Scenarios You Should Watch Out For On Ethereum.

        "content": "L2 scaling network Arbitrum\u2019s and Optimism\u2019s combined daily transactions beat Ethereum\u2019s daily transactions.\n\nEthereum manages 1.10 million while they manage 1.32 million combined.\n\nSince the Merge, there has been a considerable increase.\n\nTransaction volume plays a very important role, especially in the crypto industry; 2022 saw a drought in this aspect. Post-Ethereum merge, on-chain fees are lowered, and the combined transaction volume on Layer 2 (L2) chains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, surpassed Ethereum\u2019s on-chain transaction output.\n\nJanuary 14, 2023, Ethereum processed 1.10 million on-chain transactions; at the same time, Arbitrum and Optimism managed to get 1.32 million.\n\nThe on-chain transaction fees have been at the lower end of the spectrum since August 2022 and dropped further after the major shift towards Proof-of-Stake (PoS) from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus on September 15, 2022.\n\nThe data from etherscan.io\u2019s gas tracker shows the highest priority on-chain ether transaction cost only about $0.75 or just 23 gwei at 5:00 PM EST on Sunday.\n\nAs per data obtained on January 15, 2023, it cost around $0.101 per transfer for the average Arbitrum transaction and $0.1410 for the Optimism transaction. L2 scaling solutions with features they provide are increasingly gaining popularity from 2020, joining the bandwagon with Arbitrum and Optimism; the list includes Polygon Hermez, Zksync, Boba and Starknet.\n\nL2 allows faster and cheaper transactions by considerably reducing the computational workload on L1, or the main blockchain network, Ethereum. Transactions of Arbitrum and Optimism are \u201crolled up\u201d periodically, to be recorded on Ethereum using an optimistic virtual machine or optimistic rollup. Further analysis of data shows that there has been a significant increase in Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nOptimism recorded 737,191 transactions, and Arbitrum did 56,745 on January 14, 2023. Looking at the data from January 10, 2023, the combined transactions from Arbitrum and Optimism managed to beat the number of direct Ethereum on-chain transfers.\n\nOn January 10, 2023, Ethereum processed 1.06 million on-chain transfers, while the combined transactions of both L2 scaling networks managed 1.12 million.\n\nAs per the data from Dune Analytics from January 14, 2023, both L2 networks managed 1.32 million transactions, but Ethereum only managed 1.10 million. Although when compared with other Ethereum, it still processes more daily transactions. XRP and Polygon managed to settle more transactions than Ethereum.\n\nPolygon managed 3.10 million, while XRP did 1.25 million transactions settled on January 14, 2023. Even if these L2 chains could not surpass Ethereum alone, Polygon\u2019s and XRP\u2019s daily transactions count have increased considerably for the past 12 months.\n\nOn January 15, 2022, Ethereum managed 1.17 million transactions, Arbitrum processed 21,734 transfers, and Optimism managed 30,430 per day. In the last 12 months, Arbitrum saw a 2,599% increase and Optimism\u2019s 2,322% increase in daily transactions."
