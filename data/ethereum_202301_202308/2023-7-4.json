        "title": "Upcoming Ethereum update stimulates liquid staking token growth - Blockworks",
        "content": "Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have begun to pick up momentum this month as the second half of the year edges closer toward a highly anticipated Ethereum upgrade.\n\nDubbed Cancun-Deneb (or \u201cDencun\u201d for short), the upgrade \u2014 expected sometime in the fourth quarter of this year \u2014 will see the introduction of a mechanism known as \u201cblob-carrying transactions.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking providers, especially Lido, have gained significant traction, underlining users\u2019 preference for greater liquidity and flexibility in their staking activities, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode wrote in a research note on Monday.\n\nAs such, protocols and assets linked with staked ETH are delivering outsized gains when compared to other major digital assets in the market on the week.\n\nAs of 5 am ET, the governance token for liquid staking solution Lido DAO (LDO), has jumped about 11% and 24% on 1-week and 2-week timeframes respectively.\n\nFrax Share (FXS) \u2014 the governance token of the Frax ecosystem responsible for frxETH \u2014 and the staking pool known as Rocket Pool (RPL) have also risen by 11% and 2.4% over the past week.\n\nTo date, LST platforms and protocols have so far accrued $20 billion in total value locked, representing some 10.3 million ETH, data from DeFiLlama shows.\n\nLido has garnered a significant portion of the market, boasting roughly 7.5 million ETH staked on its platform, as per data from Nansen. That figure accounts for approximately 77% of the total market, data shows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), on the other hand, were up approximately 1.9% and 3.9% over seven days \u2014 even as renewed investor interest comes via Blackrock\u2019s spot ETF application last month. The pair of major blue-chip digital assets retain roughly 51% and 20% of the total market share, respectively.\n\nCancun upgrade could fuel further growth\n\nThe next update to Ethereum focuses on EIP-4844 (also known as proto-dank sharding), which would effectively allow for larger \u201cblobs\u201d of data to be transmitted to Ethereum nodes for a limited duration, as opposed to hosting that data permanently on the layer-1 chain.\n\nThe data is stored long enough for nodes to demonstrate that provers from layer-2 rollups, which make sure the transactions from the L2 chain are correct, have done their job.\n\n\u201cWith the upcoming Cancun upgrade, L2 sequencers can anticipate considerably higher profit margins as L1 data costs are set to decrease substantially,\u201d Delphi analyst Joo Kian wrote in a blog post late last month.\n\nSequencers, whose role is to receive and order transactions in a way that reduces the load on the main Ethereum blockchain, would effectively be allowed to \u201coperate more efficiently and profitably,\u201d Kian added.\n\nIn the wake of the Shanghai hard fork, Ethereum\u2019s staking landscape has seen a significant transformation. The upgrade, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH, has catalyzed a surge in staking deposits, while demand for withdrawals has been scant.\n\nNotably, the volume of ETH staked surpassing or equalling exchange inflows post-upgrade, Glassnode wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe crypto space witnessed abnormal activity today, as major investors, often referred to as \"whales,\" made substantial investments in options contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), as reported by Greeks Live portal. This surge in activity has sparked optimism within the market, pointing toward potential positive developments in the second half of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn particular, a considerable number of block calls, primarily involving Buy-DEC-2200C/2400C and Sell-DEC-3000C Ethereum contracts known as bull spreads, dominated the trading floor. These bullish strategies suggest that traders anticipate favorable price movements for ETH. Impressively, over 12,500 sets of these options contracts were traded, with a total notional value exceeding $50 million, indicating a significant response from the market.\n\nBTC and ETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAdditionally, there was notable buying activity in out-of-the-money (OTM) JUL calls for Ethereum. This suggests that buyers initiated transactions for options contracts with strike prices above the current market value of ETH. Such buyer interest implies a belief among investors that Ethereum's price may experience further appreciation in the coming months.\n\nWhile Bitcoin did not witness the same level of activity as Ethereum, signs of active buying were still evident, reaffirming the cryptocurrency's appeal to traders and investors.\n\nThese events are surprising, particularly given the usual decrease in market activity after quarterly expiration. The confidence displayed by major investors has challenged this convention, prompting speculation among analysts and enthusiasts regarding the market's prospects for the second half of the year."

        "title": "Will ERC 6551 transform Ethereum metaverses with NFT-owned wallets? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The proposed ERC 6551 token standard for NFTs is generating interest among crypto enthusiasts, as it would enable digital assets to own other tokens, a development that could significantly transform the NFT and metaverse landscape.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Shin on a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Benny Giang and Jayden Windle, two of the authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for ERC 6551, stated this new standard allows NFTs to own other tokens, essentially equipping them with their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nWhat is ERC 6551?\n\nThe token standard proposal, introduced in February, focuses on creating a system that assigns every ERC-721 (non-fungible token) a smart contract account. This will allow these tokens to own assets and interact with applications without changing existing ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure.\n\nThis system comprises two main components: a permissionless registry for deploying token-bound accounts and a standard implementation interface.\n\nThe registry will deploy a unique smart contract account for each ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token-bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\n\nThe proposal seeks to be maximally backward compatible with existing non-fungible token contracts. It also uses EIP-155 chain IDs to uniquely identify ERC-721 tokens, allowing for optional support of multi-chain token-bound accounts.\n\nDeveloper reaction\n\nThe initial developer discussion for the proposal centered on potential security implications, such as the risk of duplicating registries and the need for trust verification. Suggestions included creating a registry for broad registration of account Implementations and making the proposal\u2019s registry canonical due to its permissionless nature.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s potential implications for reducing airdrop costs were also highlighted, along with a discussion that also raised security worries about adding metadata to the NFT registry.\n\nMore recently, with over 160 comments from Ethereum developers, concerns were raised about the proposal still being in the \u2018Draft\u2019 status, potentially subjecting it to significant changes. Finally, there were discussions about finalizing the naming of functions and the potential impacts on those implementing the EIP.\n\nBenefits of ERC 6551\n\nAs Giang explained on the Unchained Podcast, ERC 6551 was sparked by a simple query \u2013\n\n\u201cWhat if we had a project that was an NFT project that had a character, and sometimes we call this a PFP (Profile Picture) project, right? Our main question was like, why can\u2019t you change the clothing or the aesthetic of this PFP character?\u201d\n\nThis question led to the inception of the ERC 6551 standard, allowing NFTs to own other tokens, essentially giving them their own \u2018wallets.\u2019\n\nGiang further added,\n\n\u201cDo you pursue the off-chain way where you build a database, and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the NFT? Or you go the on-chain way, which is like every item an NFT can be applicable on-chain as a transaction. So through this kind of journey, as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months, we realized that there was a potential solution.\u201d\n\nGiang and Windle also discussed the pros and cons of pursuing the on-chain or off-chain method for applying every item an NFT could own as a transaction.\n\nThey concluded that the ERC 6551 standard was a potential solution to the limitations presented by previous attempts to standardize NFTs owning assets, such as the necessity for custom logic in their smart contract. The ERC 6551 standard overcomes these restrictions, granting NFTs the same rights as Ethereum users, allowing them to own assets and take action.\n\nThe podcast guests also highlighted that while ERC 721, ERC 1155, and soul-bound tokens exist as ways to own items on Ethereum, ERC 6551 is not a token standard in the traditional sense because it gives every existing ERC 721 its own wallet, thus unlocking a new layer of compatibility for NFTs.\n\nUse cases of ERC 6551\n\nThe implementation of ERC 6551 has created exciting prospects across various industries, according to the EIP authors. It allows NFTs to own assets and perform actions autonomously, potentially beneficial in gaming, DAOs, infrastructure and tooling, and social networks.\n\nGiang mentioned several projects like \u2018Sapiens,\u2019 \u2018Fuel Worlds,\u2019 and \u2018Parallel Trading Card Game,\u2019 leveraging the standard for gamification. Giang commented, \u201cIt makes a lot of sense for a decentralized game inventory.\u201d Such games, thus, allow characters to have their own wallets and act independently in the game.\n\nAccording to Giang, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, such as \u2018Station\u2019 and \u2018Dow House,\u2019 are also exploring this standard to monitor engagement within their communities. Further, the infrastructure and tooling industry, represented by \u2018Manifold,\u2019 \u2018Nosis Guild,\u2019 and \u2018Rabbit Hole,\u2019 are reportedly working on modules around the standard.\n\nGiang suggested a future in which NFTs could become Network Playable Characters (NPCs), digital entities that can perform on-chain actions controlled by either a human or an AI model. This could potentially resolve the \u201cempty world problem\u201d observed in many digital worlds.\n\nThe ERC-6551 proposal, as explained by Jayden Windle, is simple.\n\n\u201cA token-bound account, under this standard, is its own type of wallet. Thus, an NFT can have a unique wallet address that can own any assets \u2014 a concept that Windle describes \u2018gets pretty fractal pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nUnder this standard, a token-bound account is its own type of wallet. Therefore, an NFT can have a unique wallet address to own assets. However, it is important to note that while any Ethereum wallet can control an NFT\u2019s wallet, the ownership of the token-bound account will always be owned by the NFT.\n\nIf approved, the advent and application of the ERC 6551 standard could mark a significant development, expanding the functionality of NFTs and enhancing their utility.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, is preparing to launch an upgrade this month to boost its capacity for transactions per second.\n\nScheduled for launch around July 12, the \"Quantum Leap\" upgrade aims to elevate the network's throughput to over hundred transactions per second. This would mark a significant upswing from current levels, according to the team at StarkWare, a key network contributor.\n\nCurrently undergoing testing, Starknet version 12.0 awaits approval from the Starknet community through an ongoing vote. If it passes the community validation, the upgrade will be deployed to the mainnet. After a dedicated period of engineering by StarkWare, LambdaClass, and other participants within the Starknet ecosystem, the upgrade was first released on the Goerli testnet on July 3.\n\n\u201cStarknet\u2019s new version, Quantum Leap, is exactly what the name suggests \u2013 a leap in TPS, the likes of which nobody has yet achieved in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of StarkWare.\n\nStarknet, a decentralized Layer 2 network, utilizes a solution classified as a Zero Knowledge roll-up, which condenses multiple transactions on an off-chain layer and publishes them together on the Ethereum network. StarkWare was the original architect of Starknet, employing the Stark cryptographic proofs mechanism invented by the team. Today, StarkWare is among a collaborative group of contributors shaping Starknet\u2019s evolution, with the network\u2019s operations and roadmap now under the purview of the Starknet Foundation.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nEnhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability with Starknet\n\nWhile the upgrade is expected to position Starknet at the top of the TPS leaderboards for Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions, it will also improve latency, with an expected time-to-inclusion of under 15 seconds under normal conditions. According to StarkWare, this is expected to help scale DeFi applications and the gaming niche by facilitating faster transactions and greater throughput for users.\n\nThe Starknet roadmap includes plans for version 13.0 later this year that aims to cut down transaction costs. Version 14, meanwhile, will introduce a system where developers can pay extra to prioritize transactions, thereby creating a marketplace for block space on the Layer 2 network.\n\nBen-Sasson added that a major focus for the Starknet network in the future will also be leveraging the account abstraction feature. The mechanism could enable innovative integrations within crypto apps, such as the use of two-factor authentication for signing crypto transactions and wallet recovery."

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) a security under US law? - CoinGeek",
        "content": "To read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nA court would likely agree with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Ethereum 2.0 amounts to an unregistered security, a comprehensive internal legal memo has warned.\n\nBuffone Law Group issued the memo to venture capital firm Ayre Ventures, and warned that both Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake and the Ethereum 2.0 staking programs offered by exchanges both amount to illegal securities offerings under the Howey test.\n\nEthereum is often held up as a kind of gold standard for digital assets that are not considered securities under the law. This is thanks to comments made by a former SEC director in 2018, which indicated his view that ETH was a commodity rather than a security. Though the speech was explicitly caveated as not being representative of the SEC\u2019s official position, ETH holders have clung to his words ever since.\n\nBut a lot has changed since 2018\u2014not least of all, regulators\u2019 understanding of the digital asset industry. Look no further than the sweeping charges levied by the SEC against the two biggest digital asset exchanges for illegally listing securities in June or Gensler\u2019s on-record comments that \u2018only a few\u2019 of the coins listed on exchanges were not securities.\n\nThis means Ethereum is also due for a revaluation\u2014especially with this year\u2019s move to proof-of-stake under Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\u201cAyre Ventures commissioned the report so that it can continue to steer clear of illegal securities business,\u201d said Calvin Ayre, founder of Ayre Group.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence is the only platform that is certain to not be a security is BSV.\u201d\n\nRecapping Howey\n\nThe memo, issued by Buffone Law Group, includes a summary of the Howey test for determining whether an asset offering is an investment contract and, therefore, a security. Under Howey, an investment contract exists if there is:\n\nAn investment of money; In a common enterprise; With a reasonable expectation of profits; That expectation is based upon the efforts of others\n\nThe key element of the Howey test, as it applies in a digital assets context, is whether there was an investment of profits derived from the efforts of others. This test will be met when the development of a given digital asset project is centralized (meaning there are identifiable individuals with the power to govern the network).\n\nIt also canvases several cases (on top of the Binance and Coinbase [NASDAQ: COIN] charges) where the courts have examined Howey\u2019s application in a digital assets context, showing that courts have been able to fit digital assets within Howey in a variety of contexts:\n\nSEC v Telegram: an enforcement case brought by the SEC over the issuance of Telegram\u2019s Gram tokens, the court found that the offering amounted to an investment contract under Howey. In particular, the court said that Telegram\u2019s execs \u201cwill be the guiding force behind the TON Blockchain [supporting the Gram token] for the immediate post-launch period while the [initial] purchasers unload their Grams into the secondary market\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe initial 175 purchasers possess a reasonable expectation of profit based solely upon the efforts of Telegram because these purchasers expect to reap whopping gains from the resale of the Grams in the immediate post-launch period.\u201d\n\nSEC v Kik Interactive: this case concerned presales of Kik\u2019s Kin token to private investors. The court held that this amounted to a securities offering, saying that the \u2018common enterprise\u2019 element of Howey could be established by showing \u201cthe tying of each individual investor\u2019s fortunes to the fortunes of the other investors by the pooling of assets, usually combined with the pro rata distribution of profits.\u201d It also clarified that under the \u2018expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others\u2019 limb, the expectation of profits need not derive solely from the efforts of others. The fact that the token was eventually intended to be used consumptively also did not save Kik, as the court held that such consumptive uses would only arise from the efforts of its managerial staff in the first place.\n\nEthereum 2.0\n\nThe memo says that Ethereum 2.0 represents illegally unregistered securities offering on two fronts:\n\nFirst, with the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 itself; and\n\nSecond, with regard to exchanges offering Ethereum 2.0 staking services\n\nTo begin, the memo sketches out the circumstances behind Ethereum\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 (a term that has apparently been \u2018phased out\u2019 by the Ethereum Foundation). Additionally and most pertinently to the securities analysis, the memo also examines how this upgrade was designed and implemented.\n\nEthereum 2.0 went through four distinct development stages, all of which were managed by Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum Foundation. This included:\n\nThe rollout of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s proof-of-stake algorithm via the Paris upgrade\n\nThe creation of shard chains for network \u201cscalability\u201d\n\nThe activation of smart contract execution\n\nThe implementation of miscellaneous features for 2.0, such as the April 2023 Capella upgrade to allow staking withdrawals\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation said these changes were \u2018necessary to unlock Ethereum\u2019s full potential.\u2019\n\nIf Ethereum 2.0 is not a security, then these changes should have all been democratically designed, chosen, and implemented. Further, there would be no expectation of further changes to the network. This didn\u2019t happen in the case of Ethereum, which is at all times exclusively managed by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAs the memo says:\n\n\u201cUnder this arrangement, presumably the Ethereum Foundation developers will continue to administer improvements to the network and distribution of validator rewards post-launch, and will be responsible for the success or failure of Ethereum post-merge.\u201d\n\nIt points out that the GitHub page for Ethereum 2.0 contributors shows that there are only five individuals with a \u2018significant concentration\u2019 of additions or commits\u2014all of whom are employees of the Ethereum Foundation. These are:\n\nDanny Ryan (aka \u201cdjrtwo\u201d)\n\nHsiao-Wei Wang (aka \u201chwwhww\u201d)\n\nDiederik Loerakker (aka \u201cprotolambda\u201d)\n\nJustin Drake (aka \u201cJustinDrake\u201d)\n\nApplying Howey to the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades\n\nWas there an investment of money?\n\nThe memo advises that the courts have found that the investment of digital assets, as opposed to fiat currency, still amounts to an investment of money under Howey (BitConnect). It was a true investment, because the users staking their ETH were running the risk that the entire amount staked could be lost in the process, and users could not unstake or otherwise redeem their staked ETH until the Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade was completed in April of this year. Additionally, there was never any guarantee that the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade would be successfully completed.\n\nWas there a common enterprise?\n\nAccording to the memo, \u201cthe $325 million of ETH staked to launch Ethereum 2.0 would likely be considered a pooling of funds that would give rise to horizontal commonality.\u201d\n\nIt cites the court\u2019s decision in Kik, which held that the key feature of a common enterprise \u201cis not that investors must reap their profits\u201d in a specific form or at the same time, but that the \u201cinvestors\u2019 profits at any given time are tied to the success of the enterprise.\u201d Further, \u201cthe nature of a common enterprise [is] to pool invested proceeds to increase the range of goods and services from which income and profits could be earned or, to increase the range of goods and services that holders of [the digital asset] would find beneficial to buy and sell with [that digital asset].\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum 2.0, there are two factors that suggest a common enterprise exists:\n\nOver 16,000 validators collectively staked $325 million, which was the threshold required for the launch of Ethereum 2.0 to take place. The ETH created on the 2.0 network count not be sent back to the original Ethereum blockchain and could not be used on the 2.0 network until the Paris update and network merge. If the merge did not take place, the ETH held on the Ethereum 2.0 network had no consumptive use or value.\n\n\u201cThus,\u201d reads the memo, \u201cthese features lead naturally to the conclusion that the $325 million of staked ETH constitutes the pooling of funds to not just increase, but create, the goods and services that holders of the ETH on the Ethereum 2.0 network can use this asset for.\u201d\n\nWas there a reasonable expectation of profits?\n\nThis limb of the test is straightforward. The validators who staked their 32 ETH to the network begin earning rewards on their ETH in the form of annualized interest, which can reach more than 20% and is distributed around every 6 minutes (the time it takes to create a new block).\n\nEarlier investors also stand to earn higher interest on their investment than later investors because the percentage interest earned over time decreases in proportion to the total number of validators.\n\nWas that based on the efforts of others?\n\nThe memo identifies four facts relevant to the final and most frequently challenged limb of the test as it applies to digital assets.\n\nETH earned on the Ethereum 2.0 network was locked on this network until the merger with the Ethereum mainnet. Before that merge, the ETH could not be sent to the Ethereum mainnet. No consumptive transactions or smart contracts could occur on Ethereum 2.0 until the merge took place. The Ethereum 2.0 network did not have an existing marketplace where ETH tokens were accepted for consumptive use until the merge.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the value of the Ethereum tokens earned as interest payments was entirely speculative, and the future value turned entirely on the Ethereum Foundation successfully executing on its four-phase plan leading to the merging of the Ethereum 2.0 network with the Ethereum mainnet.\u201d\n\nNow that the merger has taken place, those ETH tokens have increased in value thanks to the additional capabilities offered by the merged network, such as vastly increased scalability. If the merger hadn\u2019t gone ahead, those tokens would be worthless.\n\nThat the upgrades were to increase the value of the network can be seen from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s promotional materials describing the merge. They said that the upgrades would \u201cmake Ethereum more scalable, more secure and more sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum developers presumably continue to build out, improve, and administer updates to the network and distribution of ETH post-launch, a court is likely to find that Ethereum 2.0 validators are heavily reliant on the efforts of the Ethereum Foundation for their ETH token holdings on the Ethereum 2.0 network to have any value, let alone appreciate in value.\u201d\n\nThe memo warns that there are \u2018several\u2019 aspects of the Ethereum 2.0 rollout that would likely cause the SEC or a court to find that it falls within the Howey test and thus amounts to an unregistered securities offering.\n\nUsers that want to earn rewards for securing the network and processing transactions must deposit 32 ETH into a smart contract on the original Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAn equal amount of that ETH is created on the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which can be put up as collateral by the user in order to become a validator.\n\nThe validators only received their 32 ETH existing on the 2.0 chain because the threshold of 16,000 validators was reached, which allowed for the Ethereum 2.0 network to launch.\n\nETH could not be sent back to the original Ethereum chain.\n\nThere was a risk that the 32 staked ETH could be lost to the user under the provision of the smart contract. Validators immediately began earning interest as high as 20% on their initial 32 ETH investment.\n\nExchange-facilitated Ethereum staking programs\n\nThe analysis also covers another significant implication of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s status under Howey: the legality of exchange-offered ETH staking programs. These are programs facilitated by exchanges, which allow users to stake their held ETH (usually in amounts smaller than the 32 ETH threshold) in exchange for the payment of interest. The exchanges then pool those assets together and are responsible for staking them in 32 ETH increments to the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. Validator rewards are then distributed back to the original users in proportion to the amount initially staked.\n\nThis is a particularly relevant topic given the SEC charges against Coinbase and Binance, both of which highlighted the digital asset staking programs offered by the exchanges as examples of unregistered securities. The SEC has also pursued other exchanges for similar arrangements, including the Gemini Earn lending program.\n\nIn the case of staking ETH to the Ethereum 2.0 network via exchanges, the memo warns that this, too, meets the Howey test for an investment contract.\n\nAs discussed above, users are making an investment of money through the platforms.\n\nThere is a common enterprise, as when users stake less than 32 ETH via the exchange, the exchange is pooling the funds to stake 32 ETH lots of assets to the network. The court\u2019s ruling in the Kik case is instructive, as it said that \u201cthe nature of a common enterprise [is] top pool invested proceeds to increase the range of goods and services from which income and profits could be earned or\u2026 the increase the range of goods and services that holders of [the digital asset] would find beneficial to buy and sell with [that digital asset].\u201d\n\nSeveral factors support a reasonable expectation of profits: exchanges offer rates of between 5 and 20 percent per year, with validator rewards being paid out to users proportional to the amount staked.\n\nThe expectation of profits is derived from the efforts of others: the exchanges are providing the resources necessary to run a validator node, such as hardware and the finances to run it. The rewards ultimately received by the users depend heavily on the efforts of these exchanges to 1) provide the resources and hardware required to run the node, and 2) ensure that the validator does not stop validating or behave in a way that would lead to the forfeiture of the staked ETH.\n\nThe analysis of staking programs is interesting because it illustrates that a court finds that a given digital asset offering amounts to a security will have significant implications for all parties connected with the asset. This can be seen in the slew of charges now faced by Coinbase and Binance merely for listing digital asset securities (their liability arises from failing to register as securities dealers), and will be seen in the way other products based on securities (such as Ethereum staking services) will also be rendered illegal by the circumstances of the initial offering.\n\nDoes this analysis apply elsewhere?\n\nPerhaps most alarming (to some) about this analysis is that it can be applied to a huge proportion of the digital asset market.\n\nThere is always going to be an investment of money. Any hope of escaping liability under this heading vanished with the confirmation that digital assets are considered money under this test.\n\nThere is practically always going to be a common enterprise. As the court said in Telegram, the key feature is not that the investors actually reap their profits in a specific form or at the same time; all that is required is that the profits\u2014at any given time\u2014are tied to the success of the enterprise.\n\nThere is an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others: this is both the most obfuscated element of the test and the easiest to apply. It comes down to centralization: is the investors\u2019 expectation of profits arising from the efforts of some management or entrepreneurial efforts of others? Crucial to this element is that the expectation does not need to derive solely from the efforts of others, so the fact that some of the profits can be accounted for by an increase in value arising solely from speculation is no argument against a finding under this heading.\n\nLike ETH, BTC has often been held up as an example of digital assets which do not amount to commodities. As seen from the analysis above, the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 looks a lot like an illegally unregistered securities offering, as do exchange-facilitated ETH staking programs.\n\nBTC has also undergone significant changes designed and implemented by a core group of individuals with the power to affect the network. In 2017, the SegWit update drastically changed the way Bitcoin transactions are recorded: whereas the Bitcoin white paper made it clear both that signatures are an inextricable part of the system and that the network is scalable on-chain, SegWit removed digital signatures and broke them out into a separate data structure in order to (allegedly) help the network\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nSuch a change has significant consequences. Not only is it a demonstration of power by the BTC Core developers (just as it was with the Ethereum Foundation employees shepherding in Ethereum 2.0) in demonstration of reliance on the efforts of others, each departure from the original Bitcoin protocol is a \u2018fork\u2019 of the network. This creates new coin issuances based on the new protocol whereby the new coins are \u2018airdropped\u2019 to the holders of the original.\n\nZeMing Gao describes the consequences of this in a securities context in his article, \u201cEven BTC is a security according to the Howey test\u201d:\n\n\u201cEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally offered by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin offered under a new contract. Further, the continuous issuance of new tokens to miners is also under a new mining contract different from the original unilateral contract offered to miners by Satoshi. This makes the reissued tokens and new tokens both a security, collectively or separately, even though the original bitcoin was a nonsecurity. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case they were fed deceptive information.\u201d\n\nHowey can sound like a confusing and difficult-to-apply test, especially in a digital assets context. However, when you strip away the fluff, the core question is as simple as whether or not the underlying protocol is fixed and set in stone. If not, then centralized power exists somewhere in the system, usually resting with a few key individuals. Once that\u2019s established, the conclusion that there is an expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of others\u2014and is thus a security\u2014is staring you in the face.\n\nAs it is with Ethereum 2.0, so it is with BTC.\n\nTo read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It introduced a new programming language called Solidity, which allows for the creation of custom tokens and assets on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum assets can represent various types of digital and physical assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. These assets are implemented using Ethereum\u2019s native token standard called the ERC-20 standard, although other token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are also used for specific purposes.\n\nERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning they can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. They follow a set of rules and specifications defined in the ERC-20 standard, which ensures interoperability and compatibility between different Ethereum assets. These tokens can be traded, transferred, and stored just like any other cryptocurrency on Ethereum-compatible wallets and exchanges.\n\nUtility tokens are one of the most common types of Ethereum assets. They represent digital assets that provide access to specific products, services, or platforms. For example, utility tokens can grant access to DApps, allow users to purchase goods or services, or offer special privileges within a particular ecosystem.\n\nSecurity tokens, on the other hand, are a type of Ethereum asset that represents ownership in an underlying asset or company. They are designed to comply with relevant securities regulations, providing legal and regulatory compliance in the issuance and trading of tokenized securities. Security tokens can represent shares of a company, ownership in real estate, investment funds, or other traditional financial instruments.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are indivisible and distinguishable from each other. They can represent digital collectibles, artwork, virtual real estate, in-game items, and more. NFTs have gained significant attention and popularity due to their ability to provide verifiable ownership and scarcity in the digital world.\n\nEthereum assets have gained prominence due to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s robustness, security, and the large developer community that supports the platform. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality allows for the creation of sophisticated decentralized applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and various innovative use cases.\n\nEthereum assets can be created and issued through smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. They automatically enforce the terms of an agreement and facilitate the issuance, distribution, and management of Ethereum assets.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while Ethereum assets offer exciting possibilities, investors and users should exercise caution and perform due diligence when dealing with them. As with any investment or digital asset, there are risks involved, such as price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, security vulnerabilities, and the potential for scams or fraudulent projects. It is advisable to research and understand the project, its team, and the underlying technology before engaging with Ethereum assets.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum 2.0 The Evolution of a Blockchain Giant: Scalability And Sustainability\n\nImportance of Ethereum Assets for the Economy\n\nEthereum assets play a significant role in the economy by facilitating a wide range of financial activities, enabling new business models, and fostering innovation. Here are some key points highlighting the importance of Ethereum assets for the economy:\n\n1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum assets have been instrumental in the growth of DeFi. DeFi refers to a set of financial applications and protocols built on blockchain networks that aim to provide open, transparent, and decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems. Ethereum assets power various DeFi applications such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, stablecoins, yield farming, and more. DeFi has the potential to increase financial inclusion, reduce intermediaries, and offer new investment opportunities.\n\n2. Tokenization of Assets: Ethereum assets enable the tokenization of real-world assets, including traditional financial instruments, real estate, art, intellectual property, and more. Tokenization represents the process of converting these physical assets into digital tokens that can be easily traded, divided, and accessed by a global audience. Tokenization has the potential to enhance liquidity, fractionalize ownership, streamline transactions, and enable new investment avenues.\n\n3. Crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Ethereum assets have facilitated the emergence of new fundraising models. Through ICOs, projects can raise capital by issuing and selling their tokens directly to the public. This has democratized access to funding, allowing individuals worldwide to participate in early-stage investment opportunities. Ethereum\u2019s programmable smart contracts enable transparent and auditable distribution of tokens and funds, providing greater accountability and trust.\n\n4. Innovation and DApp Development: Ethereum assets have fueled the growth of decentralized applications (DApps) and spurred innovation in various sectors. Developers can create DApps that utilize Ethereum assets to offer new services, products, and experiences. This includes areas such as gaming, digital collectibles, supply chain management, identity verification, decentralized social networks, and more. Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature and extensive developer community contribute to a vibrant ecosystem that fosters continuous innovation.\n\n5. Interoperability and Standards: Ethereum assets adhere to token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, which provide interoperability across different projects and platforms. These standards ensure that Ethereum assets can be easily integrated into wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain-based services. This interoperability enhances liquidity, ease of use, and the overall ecosystem\u2019s efficiency.\n\n6. Global Accessibility: Ethereum assets are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their geographic location or financial background. This opens up economic opportunities for individuals in underserved regions, enables cross-border transactions without traditional intermediaries, and promotes financial inclusion. Ethereum assets can be transferred quickly and securely, reducing friction in global financial transactions.\n\n7. Programmability and Automation: Ethereum assets are programmable through smart contracts, allowing for the automation of financial processes and agreements. This programmability enhances efficiency, reduces the need for intermediaries, and enables the creation of complex financial instruments and protocols. Smart contracts facilitate self-executing agreements and ensure that transactions occur only when predefined conditions are met, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing trust.\n\nOverall, Ethereum assets have transformed the economic landscape by introducing decentralized financial systems, enabling new fundraising models, promoting innovation, and expanding access to financial services. They provide individuals and businesses with new opportunities for investment, collaboration, and value creation, paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient global economy.\n\nAlso read: How Does Ethereum In Casino Work?\n\nTop 10 Types of Ethereum Assets\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).

Tokenized assets: Tokenized assets are assets that have been digitized and represented as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows them to be traded and managed more easily. These are just a few of the many different types of Ethereum assets that exist. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, we can expect to see even more types of assets being created on the platform.\n\nRisks associated with Ethereum Assets\n\nWhile Ethereum assets offer numerous opportunities, it\u2019s important to be aware of the risks involved. Here are some key risks associated with Ethereum assets:\n\n1. Price Volatility: Ethereum assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, are known for their price volatility. Their values can fluctuate significantly in short periods due to market speculation, investor sentiment, regulatory announcements, technological developments, or macroeconomic factors. This volatility can lead to substantial gains or losses for investors.\n\n2. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding Ethereum assets is still evolving. Different jurisdictions have varying views and regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, security tokens, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and other forms of digital assets. Regulatory changes or crackdowns can impact the legality, trading, and usage of Ethereum assets, leading to compliance challenges and potential loss of value.\n\n3. Security Vulnerabilities: Ethereum assets are exposed to security risks inherent in blockchain technology. Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum are not immune to vulnerabilities or coding errors. Exploits, hacks, or bugs can result in the loss or theft of assets, unauthorized access, or manipulation of transactions. Users must exercise caution and perform due diligence when interacting with Ethereum assets and platforms.\n\n4. Scams and Fraudulent Projects: The decentralized nature of Ethereum and the absence of strict regulations make it easier for fraudulent projects and scams to emerge. Investors may encounter fraudulent ICOs, fake projects, Ponzi schemes, or phishing attempts that aim to deceive users and steal their assets. It is crucial to research projects thoroughly, verify the credibility of the teams, and exercise caution when investing or participating in token sales.\n\n5. Network Congestion and Scalability: Ethereum\u2019s network has faced challenges with scalability, leading to network congestion and increased transaction fees during periods of high demand. This congestion can result in delays or increased costs for users when transacting with Ethereum assets. Additionally, as Ethereum continues to upgrade its infrastructure (e.g., Ethereum 2.0), there may be uncertainties and potential disruptions during the transition.\n\n6. Lack of Regulation and Investor Protection: The decentralized and global nature of Ethereum assets means that they operate outside traditional financial systems and lack the same level of investor protection and recourse mechanisms. Unlike traditional securities or financial instruments, Ethereum assets may not have the same legal frameworks, investor rights, or avenues for dispute resolution. Investors must understand the risks associated with investing in unregulated assets.\n\n7. Market Manipulation and Insider Trading: Cryptocurrency markets, including Ethereum assets, can be susceptible to market manipulation and insider trading. Illiquid markets, lack of transparency, and the presence of whales (entities holding large amounts of assets) can contribute to price manipulation, pump-and-dump schemes, and insider trading activities. Investors should exercise caution and be mindful of the potential for market manipulation.\n\n8. Technical Complexity and User Error: Interacting with Ethereum assets requires technical knowledge, proper security practices, and understanding of blockchain technology. Users may face challenges in setting up wallets, managing private keys, or executing transactions correctly. Mistakes, such as sending assets to the wrong addresses or mismanaging private keys, can result in irreversible loss of funds.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial for individuals interested in Ethereum assets to conduct thorough research, understand the associated risks, and exercise caution. It is advisable to consult with financial advisors, educate oneself on the underlying technology, and carefully assess the credibility and legitimacy of projects and platforms before engaging with Ethereum assets.\n\nAlso read: How To Secure Ethereum Assets- Top 10 Ways To Avoid Scams And Hacks\n\nFuture of Ethereum Assets\n\nThe future of Ethereum assets appears promising, as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and mature. Here are some key aspects that indicate the potential growth and development of Ethereum assets:\n\n1. Ethereum 2.0 and Scalability: Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. This upgrade aims to address scalability issues by transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. With Ethereum 2.0, the network\u2019s capacity to process transactions is expected to increase significantly, leading to improved scalability and reduced transaction fees. This upgrade will enable more efficient and cost-effective transactions for Ethereum assets.\n\n2. Improved Interoperability: Interoperability is a crucial factor for the future of Ethereum assets. Efforts are underway to enhance cross-chain compatibility and interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Protocols like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink are working towards creating bridges and interoperable solutions, allowing Ethereum assets to interact with assets on different blockchains. This expanded interoperability will increase liquidity, enhance functionality, and enable seamless movement of assets across multiple networks.\n\n3. Enhanced Privacy and Security: The Ethereum community recognizes the importance of privacy and security for its assets and users. Initiatives such as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and the development of privacy-focused technologies like zk-SNARKs and zero-knowledge proofs are being explored to enhance privacy and security in Ethereum transactions. These advancements will provide users with greater control over their data and assets while maintaining transparency and auditability.\n\n4. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: DeFi has experienced tremendous growth on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is likely to continue expanding. DeFi protocols offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges, and more. As DeFi matures, Ethereum assets will play a crucial role in supporting these protocols and enabling the decentralized and permissionless financial ecosystem. The integration of real-world assets through tokenization will further enhance the scope and utility of Ethereum assets within the DeFi space.\n\n5. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained significant attention and popularity, and Ethereum has been at the forefront of the NFT boom. NFTs represent unique digital assets, such as artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. The future of Ethereum assets includes continued innovation in the NFT space, with new applications, marketplaces, and use cases. NFTs have the potential to revolutionize areas like art ownership, gaming, virtual experiences, and intellectual property rights.\n\n6. Institutional Adoption: Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has been growing steadily. As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer and institutional frameworks and custodial services improve, more traditional financial institutions and corporations may embrace Ethereum assets. Institutional adoption can bring liquidity, stability, and further validation to the Ethereum ecosystem, attracting more users and investors.\n\n7. Layer 2 Solutions: Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions aim to address scalability and transaction speed challenges by offloading some transactional activities to secondary networks. Layer 2 solutions, such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups, can significantly increase the transaction capacity and efficiency of the Ethereum network. These solutions will enable faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum assets, making them more practical for everyday use and mass adoption.\n\n8.

        "title": "The crypto scam that wasn\u2019t: 2 teens reportedly stole $4.2 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Police say it never happened - Fortune",
        "content": "It seemed like a perfectly believable story: Two teenagers in Canada posed as members of Coinbase\u2019s support team and scammed an American man out of $4.2 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing an email with a news release about the supposed arrest of the teenagers, a reporter from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC), one of Canada\u2019s leading news outlets, ran the since-deleted story, according to a member of the Hamilton Police Service familiar with the matter. (However, whether that email was the ultimate source for the story has yet to be determined.) The police in Hamilton, a city near the border of New York, reportedly teamed up with the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to pin down the two 17-year-olds, who went by the aliases \u201cFelon\u201d and \u201cGaze.\u201d\n\nNews of the arrest of the teenagers, who, according to reports, used some of their $4.2 million in stolen crypto to buy coveted username @zombie on Instagram, then spread across a number of crypto publications. However, the entire story\u2014from the teenagers\u2019 alleged heist to their arrest\u2014is a sham, according to the Hamilton Police Service.\n\n\u201c[We] can confirm this investigation did not occur and the email did not originate from the Hamilton Police Service,\u201d the police said in an official statement. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CBC has since removed its original story, and its URL now redirects to a new piece describing how its reporter received a hoax email.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has extensive security resources dedicated to educating customers about preventing phishing attacks and scams,\u201d a spokesperson for the exchange said in a statement. \u201cWe work with international law enforcement to ensure that anyone scamming Coinbase customers is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nWhile several publications were duped into running a lurid story of yet another crypto arrest, the theft as described would not have been the first of its kind.\n\nIn January 2018, in the village of Irvington, N.Y., 15-year-old Ellis Pinsky, nicknamed \u201cBaby Al Capone,\u201d allegedly stole almost $24 million from crypto millionaire Michael Terpin. Pinsky agreed to pay back Terpin without admitting any guilt.\n\nAnd the Hamilton Police Service itself has investigated and arrested a teenager for stealing almost $35 million in crypto through a SIM swap attack, or when scammers port a victim\u2019s phone number over to their devices to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nThe investigation and arrest, which happened in 2021, echoes the spoofed news release, including the Hamilton police partnership with the FBI and U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force as well as the stolen crypto being spent on a rare online username.\n\nUpdate, July 5, 2023: This article has been updated with an official comment from the Hamilton police as well as more information about the CBC."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOften coined \"the art blockchain,\" Tezos has earned this reputation thanks to at least one key platform.\n\nNow, though, fxhash is set to also join the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nFxhash lets users create new iterations of generative artwork, with artists limiting the number of mints for their work. Collectors discover the specific iteration they've acquired at the reveal, adding a unique aspect to the process of collecting generative art.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision to expand fxhash to the Ethereum blockchain marks a significant step in the platform's evolution. Initially, fxhash chose the Tezos blockchain for its appealing proof-of-stake consensus, especially when Ethereum was still using proof-of-work.\n\nThe work of digital artist Zancan. Image: fxhash.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming launch of fxhash 2.0, the platform is set to become multichain, a move influenced by requests from its partners for expansion beyond Tezos.\n\nThe implementation of fxhash 2.0 aims to break down the barriers that currently exist between chains. At present, artists can often sell their artworks at significantly higher prices on Ethereum, which also offers greater visibility for artists.\n\n\"By bringing communities together and showing artworks side by side, regardless of the chain they were minted on, we aim to elevate generative art,\" Charlie Middleton, the creative director at fxhash, told Decrypt. \u201cThe chain doesn't matter. It's the art that matters.\"\n\nThe platform was initially started by the artist Ciphrd. As a generative artist, he felt difficult to find a platform that could properly showcase his work. This struggle led him to create fxhash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince then, it has been highly community-focused.\n\nThis plays a significant role in decision-making processes, too, particularly with the upcoming fxhash 2.0.\n\n\"fxhash is the largest live repository of Generative Art, as such we can never stand still, but need to provide Artists with a wide variety of tools that we are continuously adding to in close communication with our community,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cfxhash 2.0 is a natural consequence of that, and something our team, our partners, the community, and most importantly artists are incredibly excited about.\"\n\n2 million pieces of art on fxhash\n\nThe platform boasts a diverse array of talented artists, including Zancan, William Mapan, Iskra Velitchkova, Melissa Wiederrecht, Andreas Rau, and Kim Asendorf.\n\nSome have gained significant popularity, with Zancan's \"Garden, Monoliths\" collection, for instance, racking up over 1.2 million XTZ in secondary market sales.\n\nAs of now, fxhash hosts around 8,000 artists or users who have minted at least one token, and it showcases two million pieces of generative art. The platform has facilitated the movement of approximately $40 million to $45 million, with the lion's share of this amount going to the artists.\n\nThe team at fxhash is currently hard at work on the Ethereum integration, with the launch of fxhash 2.0 slated for after the summer.\n\nThis will likely come with a UI and UX overhaul, too, and there are plans for events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Right now we've got our sights focused on an event happening in Berlin, which is related to the hackathon we've just started,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cAs we get closer to the launch, we'll have a clearer idea of what we can plan.\"\n\nIn a world where the chain often matters more than the art, fxhash is striving to shift the focus back to where it belongs: on the artists and their creations.\n\n\"Our goal was always to build tools allowing artists and collectors to live out their passion for generative art,\u201d fxhash COO Paul Viktor Schmidt told Decrypt. \u201cWe have always prioritized pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and will continue to do so.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Set to Surpass $2,000: Staking on The Rise - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Contrary to expectations, the Shanghai upgrade has not triggered an exodus of users, but rather a surge in staking deposits on Ethereum. In fact, it looks like ETH may be ready to take on the $2,000 mark, at least in the short term.\n\nStaking Activity On The Rise\n\nAccording to recent data from blockchain firm Glassnode, Ethereum staking has been soaring in recent months. Following the Shanghai upgrade, daily staking deposits skyrocketed from 460 to an impressive 8,108.\n\nThis surge in activity was especially noticeable on June 2, when a staggering 13,595 deposits were recorded. These figures indicate a growing trend of investors opting to stake their Ethereum, showing increased confidence in the network\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nOne notable player in the Ethereum staking landscape is Lido Finance. Lido Finance offers liquid staking services, where users deposit Ethereum into a protocol that pools it with other users\u2019 deposits and stakes it on their behalf. In return, users receive stETH, a token representing their staked position.\n\nLido has garnered attention due to its significant footprint in the network\u2019s staking pools. However, concerns about centralization have been raised as Lido\u2019s pools expand.\n\nLido is Hot\n\nDespite calls for action, Lido\u2019s dominance remains intact. Its supply of Staked Ethereum (stETH) recently reached a new all-time high of 7.49 million stETH, surpassing other pools.\n\nGlassnode highlights that Lido\u2019s supply is approximately 16 times larger than RocketPool (461,000 stETH); however, it has not observed a significant increase in new users.\n\nAdditionally, there have been interesting shifts in stETH\u2019s presence within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. stETH\u2019s collateral usage in lending protocols has seen an uptick, suggesting that investors are strategically maximizing their staking yields.\n\nOn the other hand, stETH\u2019s liquidity in certain DEX pools has decreased, with a 39% drop in the largest stETH-ETH Curve Pool.\n\nSpike in Whale Activity\n\nAs the price of ETH increased over the last week, there has been a noticeable rise in whale transactions. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that ETH whales doubled their transaction counts over a few days, with the total number of transactions increasing from 2,120 to 3,230 in just 48 hours. Within 7 days, approximately $20 billion has been moved by ETH whales.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s whale wallets account for 42% of its total wallets, whereas Bitcoin\u2019s whale holders make up only 11% of its total holder base.\n\nWhile the high number of whale transactions can potentially affect the price of Ethereum, the recent data shows the opposite. The price of ETH has remained relatively stable and maintained its support at around $1,900. It suggests these whales may be moving their coins without immediate selling intentions.\n\nDespite the increased whale activity, Ethereum\u2019s trading activities have decreased significantly. Trading volume was down 27% on Monday.\n\nDencun Upgrade: Ethereum\u2019s Next Milestone\n\nEthereum is eyeing the upcoming Dencun upgrade, set to be implemented within the year. This upgrade combines the consensus upgrade (Deneb) and the execution upgrade (Cancun) with a primary focus on EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding.\n\nEIP-4844 aims to minimize gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem by breaking down transaction data into smaller parts called \u201cblobs.\u201d This reduction in gas fees is particularly beneficial when using Rollup solutions.\n\nOptimistic Rollup solutions are estimated to cost 3-8 times less than Layer-1 transactions, while ZK-Rollup solutions achieve even greater efficiency with gas levels 40-100 times lower than Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1.\n\nThe adoption of the blob model not only reduces gas fees but also helps optimize the Data Availability problem faced by rollups. Successfully implementing this approach is a significant step towards Ethereum\u2019s future Sharding ambitions.\n\nThe Dencun rollout has the potential to fuel further growth within the Ethereum ecosystem. The upgrade is expected to bring improvements and optimizations that can enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness."

        "content": "Liquid staking. It\u2019s one of the few hot spaces in crypto right now, Mike Ippolito says.\n\nThe freedom to tap into DeFi with wrapped tokens made available in exchange for staking ETH is a relatively novel concept that, although highly popular in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, did not originate there.\n\nFirst conceived in the Cosmos app chain ecosystem, the innovation took off in Ethereum\u2019s community \u2014 at least partly out of fear that centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance would hold too much staking power in a few massive pools.\n\n\u201cOne of the early core propositions when Ethereum was switching from proof-of-work chain to a proof-of-stake chain was they wanted to make sure that it didn\u2019t get concentrated,\u201d explains Ippolito, the host of the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple).\n\n\u201cSo what they wanted to do was make sure that didn\u2019t happen by not selecting a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism\u201d whereby only a few entities would control the network.\n\nDominant liquid staking protocols such as Lido have \u201coverruled that design decision,\u201d he says. Now, a form of delegated proof-of-staking is effectively provided through the Lido protocol, rather than via an Ethereum-intrinsic mechanism, according to Ippolito.\n\nAssociate at the advisory and investment firm Reverie Myles O\u2019Neil explains, \u201cEthereum looked at Cosmos and did not want a validator set of 100, 150 or 200. Ethereum wanted hundreds of thousands of validators and they wanted them to be individuals.\u201d\n\nBut because of the barriers and technical challenges of becoming validators, staking via centralized exchange services became an attractive solution to holders, he says.\n\n\u201cYou no longer had this 32 ETH minimum. You no longer had to set up your own hardware. You could actually have liquidity,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could actually sell your ETH on the centralized exchange while getting staking rewards.\u201d\n\nA handful of exchanges could then \u201ccapture the majority of the network through retail delegating,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that would be an even worse outcome than having 100 or 200 validators.\u201d\n\nLido to the rescue?\n\nWhen Cosmos developers were first looking at the possibilities of liquid staking, Ethereum was already enjoying the beginnings of a vibrant DeFi scene.\n\n\u201cBut they had this existential risk,\u201d O\u2019Neil explains, \u201cthat before the beacon chain even launched officially, it would be controlled by a handful of centralized exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why the idea took off on Ethereum when it actually originated in Cosmos.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers were trying to design a system \u201cthat couldn\u2019t be captured by a couple of large, deep-pocketed actors,\u201d Ippolito explains, but instead would be secured by \u201cgeographically-spread individual solo-stakers.\u201d\n\nLido, it seemed, was the solution to the centralization risk.\n\nBut the remedy has become too successful, it seems. Lido now dominates the liquid staking market. Ippolito says the centralized control that Lido could now potentially exert is equally concerning in the popular consciousness of Ethereum natives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a very core function of Ethereum \u2014 which is how it secures itself through staking \u2014 and made it subject to a different set of security properties and governance sets.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompounding network effects lead to what is likely going to be a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market structure,\u201d O\u2019Neil says.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve already started to see that on Ethereum in particular.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Shards and Layer-2s: Unpacking NEAR and Ethereum's contrasting approaches to blockchain scalability - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The landscape of blockchain scalability has evolved significantly in recent years, with Layer-2s (L2s) and sharding emerging as the two dominant approaches.\n\nEthereum, a key player in the crypto industry, has adopted rollup-centric L2s to scale its network, while NEAR protocol has taken a different path, choosing to scale via sharding. Both strategies offer unique solutions to blockchain scalability, but they also present their distinctive challenges.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2s: A Rollup-Centric Approach\n\nNEARWEEK, a NEAR protocol publication, commended Ethereum for garnering considerable attention for its innovative rollup-centric scaling strategy. An L2 protocol is built atop an existing blockchain to enhance scalability, throughput, and privacy. This is achieved by executing state transitions off-chain from the Layer-1 (L1) they\u2019re built upon and committing state roots and transactional data to the underlying L1.\n\nNEAR sees the driving philosophy behind rollups as the belief that a rollup can outperform the underlying L1 in terms of throughput due to decreased consensus overhead. However, in practice, NEAR believes the overall scaling achieved by rollups collectively has been somewhat disappointing, barely surpassing what a single rollup can offer.\n\nHowever, data from L2 analysis platform L2Beat offers a contrasting view due to increased L2 activity over the past year, as shown in the chart below.\n\nFurther, reviewing the top 10 Ethereum L2s shows Arbitrum One and zkSync Era closing in on Ethereum\u2019s monthly transaction count. Additionally, Immutable X and Arbitrum Nova have surpassed Ethereum\u2019s growth in average transactions per second (TPS) over seven days. Notably, Ethereum had a higher active TPS than any L2 scaling solution on the network on July 3.\n\n# Name Past Day TPS 7D Change Max Daily TPS 30D Count Data Source 1 Ethereum 12.29 6.48% 22.37 (2022 Dec 09) 31.45 M Blockchain RPC 2 Arbitrum One 9.69 -4.17% 31.64 (2023 Mar 23) 24.81 M Blockchain RPC 3 zkSync Era 8.63 -14.74% 12.00 (2023 May 16) 22.27 M Blockchain RPC 4 OP Mainnet 6.00 -12.97% 9.26 (2023 Jan 12) 14.82 M Blockchain RPC 5 dYdX 3.09 -38.54% 11.45 (2022 Feb 15) 9.42 M Closed API 6 Immutable X 2.01 7.47% 39.35 (2022 Mar 11) 5.67 M Closed API 7 Starknet 1.79 -9.17% 3.05 (2023 May 16) 4.61 M Explorer API 8 Arbitrum Nova 1.34 18.15% 10.93 (2023 Apr 27) 2.99 M Blockchain RPC 9 ApeX 0.95 2.27% 1.38 (2023 Apr 13) 2.68 M Closed API 10 zkSync Lite 0.89 -27.20% 3.29 (2023 Mar 21) 2.52 M Explorer API 11 Polygon zkEVM 0.64 -5.13% 0.82 (2023 Jun 13) 1.34 M Blockchain RPC\n\nData from L2Beat.com\n\nHowever, the primary cause of NEAR\u2019s suggested lackluster performance is attributed to the fact that popular Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) operate on nearly all rollups, resulting in similar transactions being \u2018duplicated\u2019 across different rollups.\n\nNEAR\u2019s Shard-Centric Approach\n\nNEAR Protocol has, conversely, opted to tackle scalability through sharding, which partitions the network into distinct segments built directly into the protocol. According to NEARWEEK, each shard in NEAR\u2019s architecture can be likened to an optimistic rollup in Ethereum\u2019s approach.\n\nThe key advantage of NEAR\u2019s sharding approach lies in its composability, which allows applications on one shard to interact with applications on another shard natively. This homogeneous sharding model allows applications to interact in the same way regardless if they\u2019re deployed on the same shard, relieving developers from deciding which shard to deploy their applications.\n\nAdditionally, NEAR\u2019s sharding model offers faster transaction finality, typically within two to three seconds, outperforming the extended finality times in the rollup universe.\n\nWhile NEAR Protocol does not list its real-time TPS on the block explorer, it can be calculated based on data from the most recent blocks. A CryptoSlate analysis of transactions from the NEAR block explorer showed an average TPS of roughly 5.7 transactions per second on July 4. This snapshot of NEAR\u2019s TPS aligns with the top five L2s on the Ethereum network. The NEAR community foresees the protocol\u2019s potential through sharding will reach 100,000 TPS in the future.\n\nContrasting Design Philosophies\n\nThe different scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and NEAR highlight their contrasting design philosophies. While Ethereum prioritizes resilience, maintaining a simple L1 protocol design, NEARWEEK stated NEAR Protocol leans towards a simplified user experience, taking on additional protocol complexity to ensure a superior UX.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to note that NEAR is not aiming to be \u201cjust an L1\u201d as it seeks to function as a Blockchain Operating System (BOS), providing a universal layer for navigating and discovering open web experiences. Through the BOS, NEAR aims to\n\n\u201cempower developers and users from various blockchains, including Ethereum Layer 2s, to construct and utilise applications across a multitude of blockchain ecosystems.\u201d\n\nMore details on NEAR\u2019s BOS vision can be found on its Medium account.\n\nBlockchain scalability remains a complex and crucial issue in the crypto world. As Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric L2s and NEAR\u2019s sharding evolve, it will be intriguing to see which approach proves most effective in the long run.\n\nMentioned in this article"

There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $1,945 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,975 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,000 level. A close above the $2,000 zone could start a fresh surge. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which the price could accelerate higher toward the $2,120 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,200 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,975 resistance or $2,000, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,950 level and the trend line zone.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,930 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,889 swing low to the $1,974 high and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a move below $1,930, the price could drop toward $1,900. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,880 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,930\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,000\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He calls the plan \u201cEuropeum.\u201d\n\nSix countries signed on: Slovenia, Portugal, Croatia, Italy, Poland, and Belgium, with Brussels as its headquarters.\n\nImportant for citizens is privacy, transparency and \u201cthe way we work with your data.\u201d\n\nBelgium is betting that a transnational blockchain infrastructure will soon be adopted by the 27 member states of the European Union.\n\nThe small and often overlooked nation will lead a push for an EU-wide network where public services would be integrated with a distributed ledger.\n\nGame Changer\n\nMathieu Michel, Belgium\u2019s state secretary for digitalisation, is confident that blockchain will not only benefit consumers and companies, but also bolster the bloc\u2019s global competitiveness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real game-changer, what we\u2019re building right now,\u201d Michel told DL News in his Brussels office.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNOW READ: Kraken\u2019s order to give IRS user info could have been much worse: \u2018It would expose clients\u2019\n\nFor all the challenges about adoption of blockchain on a mass market level, the state secretary said he believes the technology can change the way European citizens and companies control their data.\n\nTaking the lead\n\nThe European Union recently announced that it would transform the five-year-old European Blockchain Services Infrastructure project into a political endeavour led by member states.\n\nBelgium raised its hand to take the lead, and Michel signed the application to the European Commission.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Europeum is built for our digital sovereignty, but also for our autonomous strategy\u2019 \u2014 Mathieu Michel\n\nEssentially, Michel hopes to replicate the Ethereum network, with code that\u2019s open to view. This version, however, would be a version that is not permissionless but \u201cmanaged, developed and regulated by governments.\u201d He calls the plan \u201cEuropeum.\u201d\n\nA political project\n\nSix countries have signed on to Europe\u2019s blockchain consortium: Slovenia, Portugal, Croatia, Italy, Poland, with Brussels, the EU\u2019s capital, as its headquarters.\n\nIn January, Belgium is scheduled to take over the European Council\u2019s six-month rotating presidency. Blockchain is high on the agenda for the state secretary.\n\n\u201cI think that even before the end of the year, we will have other countries joining, probably even before the end of the summer,\u201d Michel said. \u201cEurope could go further if everybody looked in the same direction.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: \u2018This is not a Big Brother project\u2019: EU proposal for digital euro faces privacy and sovereignty fears\n\nThis year, each country is to invest \u20ac50,000 in the blockchain project. Next year, that sum will double. All together, the bare-bone budget adds up to just under \u20ac1 million for the coming year and a half.\n\nFor Michel, one million is not enough, but it\u2019s a start. He is hopeful seeing as Belgium, he says, has a \u20ac1 billion yearly budget for digitalising its economy and administration. Blockchain could help streamline the digitalisation process, he said.\n\nCredibility\n\nBelgium ranked at the bottom of the European Commission\u2019s annual Digital Economy and Society Index report in 2022, which Michel deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to restore our credibility and boost our foreign investments, we must react quickly,\u201d Michel previously responded to the news.\n\nNOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in\n\nMichel hopes that by the end of next year, every European Union member state will be working on the blockchain infrastructure project.\n\nIn full capacity, legal administration for companies would be simplified into smart contracts where data can be seamlessly transferred between states.\n\nVerified profiles\n\nProperty titles and driving licences would be verified on the blockchain. So would national identities which could then be used to easily verify your profile on social media.\n\n\u201cA country like Belgium is too weak if we want to be more ambitious at a global level,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking together at a European level is the least that we can do to build our ambition. Europeum is built for our digital sovereignty, but also for our autonomous strategy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Cryptocurrency is not currency. It\u2019s like Pok\u00e9mon\u2019 \u2014 Mathieu Michel\n\nBelgium has already figured out part of their logistics for EBSI. Belnet, the national internet provider for government services and educational institutions, will operate the node on the network. Howest University of Applied Sciences is also a key player developing solutions for the project.\n\nBlockchain, not crypto\n\nAs he took office in 2021, Michel experimented with crypto and NFTs to figure out what the hype was all about. While he was enchanted with the possibilities blockchain offers, he was not impressed with crypto as an industry.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is not currency. All those scandals are probably linked to the fact that people think that it\u2019s currency,\u201d Michel said. \u201cBut no, it\u2019s like Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d\n\nCrypto\u2019s reputation makes it difficult to convince some colleagues that Europe should bet big on blockchain.\n\nNOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in\n\n\u201cIf I mention blockchain to some of my political colleagues in parliament or in the government, they will say: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s the devil.\u2019 Because for some people, blockchain and cryptocurrency are the same.\u201d\n\nFor him, the main challenge is to level up \u201cthe maturity, the comprehension about blockchain.\u201d\n\nData ownership\n\nImportant for citizens is privacy, transparency, and \u201cthe way we work with your data,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Michel, the decentralised technology can be a tool to tilt data ownership into the hands of citizens rather than companies or institutions.\u201dToday, nearly nobody can say what happens with their data,\u201d he added.\n\nAcross the bloc\n\nCompanies could also be relieved from the EU\u2019s administrative machinery as they operate across the bloc.\n\n\u201cA law can become a smart contract, so you can automatically adapt the smart contract to the country,\u201d Michel said, which would allow SMEs to automate transitions between jurisdictions. They can simply \u201cidentify themselves as European.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Transactions Jump Over 50% As ETH Eyes $2,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum whales have been ramping up their activities on the blockchain as it eyes an important level. This time around, their recent spike in activity has been in the form of transactions. These whale transactions which are carrying at least $100,000, making it so only large holders could be behind the transactions, have been on the rise.\n\nMostly, the Ethereum whales ramped up their activities following ETH\u2019s price increase over the last week. The first spike was noticed after the crypto broke above $1,900 and as it has continued to maintain this level, there has been more consistency among the whales.\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that ETH whales have doubled their transaction counts over a few days. This increase saw their total transactions go from 2,120 to 3,230 in two days. This jump in number of transactions translates to an over 54% increase in just 48 hours \u2013 from July 2 to July 4. In a 7-day period, almost $20 billion has been moved by ETH whales.\n\nETH whale transactions cross 3,000 in two days | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nHowever, while this jump is significant in its own right, it is not unusual for Ethereum to see such a high number of large transactions. For example, toward the end of June, the total whale transactions had also spiked above the $3,000 level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s holder base is made up of a high number of whales when compared to its largest competitor Bitcoin. While the latter\u2019s whale holders only make up 11% of the total holder base, Ethereum whale wallets account for 42% of its total wallets, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Hence, a high volume of large transactions happening in a short period is not out of place.\n\nHow The Ethereum Whales Can Affect Price\n\nA high number of whale transactions can have significant impacts on the price of coins like Ethereum depending on what the holders of these coins intend to do with them. If these transactions carrying at least $100,000 worth of coins are for selling, then the price of ETH would see a downtrend.\n\nHowever, since the price of ETH has remained relatively stable and maintained its hold on the $1,900 support, then it is likely that these whales are just moving their coins around without selling. Additionally, these on-chain transactions do not point toward a good volume of ETH flowing toward centralized exchanges, further giving credence to the fact that these whales are not moving their coins for selling purposes.\n\nEthereum, on its own, has not had the best of days though as its trading volume is down significantly from Monday. It is currently sitting at $6 billion, a 27% decline from Monday\u2019s figures. Nevertheless, its price is holding steady with meager gains of 0.1% as the coin trades at a price of $1,963.\n\nETH price trending at $1,962 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\n\u2018Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees!\u2019 You couldn\u2019t have reached your twenties without listening to this phrase at least once! It is still used as a cautionary reminder to instill some financial responsibility in young people. However, it\u2019s time to debunk this notion!\n\nWhile there may not be a literal \u201cmoney plant,\u201d there are indeed ways to cultivate wealth. All it takes is choosing the right path. In this article, we will assist you in making that choice by explaining how to generate $100 per day through crypto passive income using Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Caged Beasts (BEASTS).\n\nBuild Your Wealth with Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) requires no introduction in the world of cryptocurrencies, as it holds the position of the second-largest crypto with a market capitalization of $225 billion. What do you think has contributed to Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth in value? The answer is simple: it\u2019s potential to generate high returns on investment and provide various avenues for passive income. Among the most profitable methods is staking ETH tokens.\n\nETH tokens hold significant value in the crypto market, making staking them a highly rewarding endeavour. It offers an impressive annual percentage yield of approximately 6.3% \u2013 7.31%. By selecting a reputable and credible crypto platform for staking your Ethereum tokens, you can even earn an additional 1 or 2% yield.\n\nAlways remember that staking cryptocurrencies yields greater returns compared to depositing money in traditional banks. Furthermore, the yield for staking increases based on the market value of ETH tokens, providing you with an opportunity to earn significantly more through saving rather than solely relying on trading!\n\nEasy Way to Earn More with Solana\n\nIf you think that Ethereum tokens are beyond your financial reach, don\u2019t worry! There are numerous alternatives available in the crypto realm, and one of them is Solana (SOL)\u2014a blockchain platform with a focus on web3 infrastructure.\n\nThe current valuation of the Web3 blockchain market stands at $2.86 billion and is projected to reach $116 billion in the next 10 years. Therefore, owning Solana tokens would be a wise decision, at least for the next decade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore how to earn passive income using Solana. Once again, staking takes a prominent position. A year ago, the renowned crypto exchange platform Binance offered a 9-13% annual percentage yield (APY) for SOL staking, while Phantom offered a slightly lower range of 6-7%. Additionally, SOL lending yielded a 3.6% return.\n\nAlthough the yield values have decreased slightly over the past year, as Web3 technology continues to grow, the value of SOL tokens will also increase, multiplying the yield value for staking SOL.\n\nLet the Beasts Make Money for You\n\nCaged Beasts is an innovative crypto project that is about to launch its presale very soon. This exciting new meme coin has been making a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its captivating storyline, community-driven approach, and generous referral program.\n\nThe Caged Beasts team is dedicating their time and effort to creating engaging competitions, events, and special offers that will attract more customers to join their brand-new community.\n\nAs a first step in this direction, the Caged Beasts team has introduced a referral program that grants a 20% bonus to both the user and their referral. Let\u2019s say your referral invests $500, you will receive a $100 commission, and your referral will also earn bonus tokens worth $100. This means both of you will benefit and potentially become wealthier at the same time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEarning $100 per day in crypto passive income is achievable, but it does require a significant investment. However, if you\u2019re unable to invest a substantial amount, you can still invest in Ethereum, Solana, Caged Beasts, or all of them gradually, earning small amounts without exerting excessive effort. Over time, your investment will grow to the point where it can generate more than $100 per day.\n\nFind out more about Caged Beasts (BEASTS):\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "content": "With the increasing global interest in cryptocurrencies and the appealing opportunity to achieve millionaire status through smart investments, Ethereum (ETH) has gained popularity as a favored option, attracting significant attention for its potential to generate substantial profits. So, how many Ethereum do you need to buy to become a millionaire?\n\nEthereum Price: What has happened to ETH?\n\nAt the present time, the current price of ETH stands at $1,960. This means that each ETH coin would cost an investor $1,960. It is important to note that the price of ETH, similar to other cryptocurrencies, is subject to market fluctuations and can rapidly change. Therefore, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest information when making investment decisions.\n\nETH prices have recently shown a slight upward trend, recovering from support levels near its recent lows.\n\nEthereum ATH Price: Highest ETH Price\n\nETH has witnessed significant price volatility throughout its history. The all-time high (ATH) price signifies the highest price level that ETH has ever reached. According to the most recent available data, the ATH price of ETH is approximately $4,880, representing the highest value ETH has attained in the past.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Do You Need to BUY to Become a Millionaire?\n\nTo determine the amount of ETH coins required to attain millionaire status, it is necessary to consider the difference between the current price and the ATH price.\n\nThe price difference between the ATH and the current price of ETH is $4,880 \u2013 $1,960 = $2,920.\n\nTo calculate the quantity of ETH coins needed, we divide $1,000,000 by the price difference: $1,000,000 / $2,920 = 342.47 ETH (approximately).\n\nTherefore, at the present ETH price of $1,960, an investor would need to purchase approximately 342.47 ETH coins today to potentially achieve millionaire status if the price were to reach its ATH once again. This would require an investment of approximately $671,959.\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the above calculation assumes that the ETH price will reach its ATH once again. However, predicting the future price movements of any cryptocurrency is highly speculative and depends on various factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and regulatory changes, such as legal actions taken by regulatory authorities like the SEC.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Account abstraction, also known as \u201csmart accounts,\u201d could eventually onboard a billion users from Asia to Web3, according to an executive at Ethereum software solutions provider ConsenSys.\n\nLaura Shi, the director of strategic initiatives at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph that the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem had seen a strong expansion in Asia this year.\n\n\u201cMore DApps are improving [user experience] UX for the Asian market, including introducing Asian language support,\u201d she said.\n\nShi added this expansion is primarily being driven by the introduction of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) rollups and the mass adoption of Optimistic Rollups.\n\nThe two rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions with the zkEVM offering developers security, scaling and direct compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nShi believes the development of account abstraction, which offers greater programmable functionality and more \u201cbank-like\u201d features than a regular crypto wallet, would increase adoption in the region.\n\n\u201cThe development of account abstraction will facilitate the onboarding of the billion-level users in APAC to Web3.\u201d\n\nAccount abstraction was proposed in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers in EIP-4337 to \u201ccompletely avoid consensus-layer protocol changes, instead relying on higher-layer infrastructure.\u201d However, the concept goes much further back in Ethereum\u2019s timeline.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, the top two crypto-adopting countries in the world were in Asia: Vietnam and the Philippines. Thailand, China and India were in the top 10 despite anti-crypto sentiments from their respective governments.\n\nShi believes mass adoption in Asia is also driven by social and Web3 gaming, citing South Korea and China as examples.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea's gaming publishers are continuously focusing on Web3 RPG game publishing, attempting to optimize the sustainability of the on-chain economic model,\u201d said Shi.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Chinese-speaking developer ecosystem is focusing on onboarding Web2 users to Web3 gaming through adopting account abstraction solutions.\u201d\n\nBoth use cases will rely heavily on zkEVM rollups and account abstraction development, she added.\n\n\u201cFrom the use case perspective, we see Web3 social and gaming content has the largest potential in the coming years. It is powered by [a] zkEVM rollup solution and [an] account abstraction solution that enables gas fee subsidy and social recovery.\u201d\n\nRelated: Asia\u2019s current gaming domination \u2018crucial\u2019 for Web3 games\n\nAsked whether the current United States industry crackdown could be driving Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem growth in Asia, Shi said she didn\u2019t see any correlation.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have not observed any direct correlation between these and the regulatory dynamics in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe pivot to Asia has been a hot topic recently as U.S. crypto and Web3 companies seek friendlier jurisdictions in the Far East.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum ecosystem in Asia appears to be doing fine on its own without the catalyst of Uncle Sam\u2019s war on crypto.\n\nMagazine: Crypto City: Guide to Osaka, Japan\u2019s second-biggest city"

        "content": "Recent data from Crypto Quant reveals a decline in sell-side liquidity across various digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum with an even sharper drop in buy-side liquidity. The repercussions of these liquidity changes have prompted discussions about their interpretation, especially in light of Bitcoin\u2019s price going up due to increased institutional interest.\n\nLiquidity Plummets In Crypto Market\n\nAccording to statistics, Bitcoin\u2019s exchange reserve has dwindled by 20% over the past year, amounting to 2.092 million. This reduction in available Bitcoin holdings on exchanges suggests a decreased willingness among investors to sell or trade their Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a similar vein, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserves have experienced an even steeper decline, plummeting by 40% to reach 16 million.\n\nAnother key aspect affected by this liquidity shift is the stablecoin market. Stablecoins, which aim to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a fiat currency, have encountered a sharp decline in reserves. The collective reserves of stablecoins have shrunk by 52%, amounting to 16.93 billion. Read More about top stablecoins\u2026\n\nBTC-ETH Price Action\n\nKi Young Ju, CEO of Crypto Quant, highlights that even though stablecoin reserves have diminished, there has been a recent uptick in buy-side liquidity. He suggests that when the ratio of stablecoin market capitalization or exchange holdings is high, there is a relatively high probability of market bottoming out.\n\nJu further notes that the current market capitalization of stablecoins, in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum, remains relatively low. Another Twitter user said- stablecoin transition period due to $BUSD, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily link to the buy-side liquidity declining. For instance, $USDT exchange reserve is increasing, as reported by Head of Research, Crypto Quant.\n\nBitcoin, the leading digital asset, kicked off the Tuesday business day in Asia with a strong surge past the $31,000 mark. Starting at $31,153, Bitcoin\u2019s rally follows a wave of optimism fueled by several prospective issuers re-filing their applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged to $31,045.69, at the press time, marking a 1.25% increase, while Ethereum has reached $1,959.29.\n\nAlso Read: DeFi Rockets, NFTs Plummet as Ethereum Bulls Set Sight on $2,000"

        "content": "Often coined \"the art blockchain,\" Tezos has earned this reputation thanks to at least one key platform.\n\nNow, though, fxhash is set to also join the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nFxhash lets users create new iterations of generative artwork, with artists limiting the number of mints for their work. Collectors discover the specific iteration they've acquired at the reveal, adding a unique aspect to the process of collecting generative art.\n\nThe decision to expand fxhash to the Ethereum blockchain marks a significant step in the platform's evolution. Initially, fxhash chose the Tezos blockchain for its appealing proof-of-stake consensus, especially when Ethereum was still using proof-of-work.\n\nThe work of digital artist Zancan. Image: fxhash.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming launch of fxhash 2.0, the platform is set to become multichain, a move influenced by requests from its partners for expansion beyond Tezos.\n\nThe implementation of fxhash 2.0 aims to break down the barriers that currently exist between chains. At present, artists can often sell their artworks at significantly higher prices on Ethereum, which also offers greater visibility for artists.\n\n\"By bringing communities together and showing artworks side by side, regardless of the chain they were minted on, we aim to elevate generative art,\" Charlie Middleton, the creative director at fxhash, told Decrypt. \u201cThe chain doesn't matter. It's the art that matters.\"\n\nLinda Dounia's IN/Visible NFT Exhibition Highlights Black Artists, AI's \u2018Skewed\u2019 Lens\n\nThe platform was initially started by the artist Ciphrd. As a generative artist, he felt difficult to find a platform that could properly showcase his work. This struggle led him to create fxhash.\n\nSince then, it has been highly community-focused.\n\nThis plays a significant role in decision-making processes, too, particularly with the upcoming fxhash 2.0.\n\n\"fxhash is the largest live repository of Generative Art, as such we can never stand still, but need to provide Artists with a wide variety of tools that we are continuously adding to in close communication with our community,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cfxhash 2.0 is a natural consequence of that, and something our team, our partners, the community, and most importantly artists are incredibly excited about.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n2 million pieces of art on fxhash\n\nThe platform boasts a diverse array of talented artists, including Zancan, William Mapan, Iskra Velitchkova, Melissa Wiederrecht, Andreas Rau, and Kim Asendorf.\n\nSome have gained significant popularity, with Zancan's \"Garden, Monoliths\" collection, for instance, racking up over 1.2 million XTZ in secondary market sales.\n\nAs of now, fxhash hosts around 8,000 artists or users who have minted at least one token, and it showcases two million pieces of generative art. The platform has facilitated the movement of approximately $40 million to $45 million, with the lion's share of this amount going to the artists.\n\nThe team at fxhash is currently hard at work on the Ethereum integration, with the launch of fxhash 2.0 slated for after the summer.\n\nThis will likely come with a UI and UX overhaul, too, and there are plans for events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the launch.\n\n\"Right now we've got our sights focused on an event happening in Berlin, which is related to the hackathon we've just started,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cAs we get closer to the launch, we'll have a clearer idea of what we can plan.\"\n\nIn a world where the chain often matters more than the art, fxhash is striving to shift the focus back to where it belongs: on the artists and their creations.\n\n\"Our goal was always to build tools allowing artists and collectors to live out their passion for generative art,\u201d fxhash COO Paul Viktor Schmidt told Decrypt. \u201cWe have always prioritized pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and will continue to do so.\u201d"

If the price successfully surpasses this level, it could potentially lead the asset towards next resistance at $2,025.\n\n\n\nIts RSI is rising which indicates that the underlying buying pressure for Ethereum price is increasing. This bullish divergence increases the possibility of a rally towards the trendline.

Source: L2Beat\n\nBut to put those TPS figures in perspective, it\u2019s still a lot less than Solana\u2019s 4,127 TPS or Visa\u2019s 1,700 TPS.\n\n\u201cScaling has been the primary challenge that this ecosystem has been fighting with over the past several years,\u201d Kolodny said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that version 12 brings with it this Quantum Leap \u2014 in fact, there are a whole series of leaps that will roll out through the summer we\u2019ll go through. But we are already in the triple digits for transactions per second.\u201d\n\nCapacity is very different to usage, however; and even after the upgrade, if there are not enough users on Starknet that actually make 100 transactions per second, then the protocol will not run at 100 TPS.\n\nKolodny added that raw TPS is not the best metric of performance, given that complicated transactions are harder to perform than simple ones. But he said the upgrade also enables complicated transactions to make multiple calls, \u201ceach performing separate logic from a separate contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of Cairo steps per second, we\u2019re observing an increase of at least something on the order of 50x compared to what we have today.\u201d\n\nRelated: Zero Barriers podcast series: Crypto adoption fueled by ZK-rollups\n\nThe Quantum Leap upgrade does not solve the data availability problem faced by all zk-Rollups. The issue is that there is not enough room on Ethereum to write back all of the required data for the transactions on L2s, which pushes up costs.\n\nAs of now, 90% of costs on Starknet are associated with Data availability cost to L1.\n\n\n\nAckktually, Starknet will be the first L2 to offer Volition, and reduce fees by up to 85% post its launch later this year.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the implementation of EIP4844 on L1 will further lower it. \u2014 Starknet (@Starknet) June 7, 2023\n\nKolodny said this would be addressed by the version 13 Volition upgrade, which is due before the end of this quarter. It will give users granular control that enables them to store crucial or high-value data on Ethereum, and less important data elsewhere. This is projected to cut fees by 85% and could pave the way for low-fee micropayments or a boom in affordable, fast blockchain gaming.\n\nOne of the key components of the upgrade is Cairo-rs from venture studio LambdaClass, which is a faster implementation of the Cairo virtual machine using Rust instead of Python.\n\nFounder Federico Carrone said Quantum Leap was a \u201chistoric moment\u201d for blockchains in general.\n\n\u201cThis release shows that it\u2019s possible to scale blockchains in a safe way thanks to STARKs and enables the creation of new applications that were impossible to think of a few years ago on top of a blockchain.\u201d\n\nStarkWare previously announced on June 29 that its validity-proof ZK scaling technology had now facilitated more than $1 trillion in transactions.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Holds Firm, Can it Break $2,000? InQubeta On Track To 100X Its Price in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The InQubeta (QUBE) presale has emerged as one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world and the attention it received from global investors seems to be carrying over to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain which its platform is built on.\n\nEthereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency based on market capitalization, but it\u2019s seen more price growth in 2023 than Bitcoin, the most popular crypto. Ethereum went on a massive bull run in early 2023, with prices increasing by almost 60%, and it seems to be preparing for another bull run, with prices growing steadily in the past week. Ethereum has been picked as the most likely altcoin to ever replace Bitcoin\u2019s status as the top cryptocurrency since its platform is more flexible and capable.\n\nPlatforms like InQubeta are proof of Ethereum\u2019s greater utility compared to Bitcoin as its blockchain can be used to host other cryptocurrency projects and allows for the creation of smart contracts.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is on track to surpass 100x growth in 2023\n\nInQubeta investors can expect to increase the value of their investment by 400% by the time its presale is over. They can thank the incremental price changes that occur at each of the presale\u2019s ten stages for that.\n\nThe real fun starts after the project is officially launched later in the year, with some projections expecting InQubeta\u2019s value to increase by up to 100x before the year is over. These might seem like overly optimistic projections, but they\u2019re more on the conservative side given how undervalued InQubeta tokens are.\n\nThe InQubeta ecosystem is run by its native $QUBE tokens, which have a limited total token supply of 1.5 billion. $QUBE also has deflationary systems like a 2% burn tax. Tokens collected through the tax are sent to burn wallets to be removed from the total token supply.\n\nStartups raise capital on the InQubeta network by making equity-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are divisible so investors can invest as little or as much as they wish. These NFTs are reviewed by the operations team before being listed on the marketplace where investors can purchase them.\n\nInvestors receive the NFTs once sales are finalized, while startups get more $QUBE tokens they can convert to fiat to innovate with. Smart contracts guarantee investors get any bonuses promised on their NFTs.\n\nInQubeta solves the problem of mainstream investment firms being inaccessible for many by creating barrier-free investment opportunities for anyone who wants to tether themselves to the artificial intelligence revolution to secure equity in companies that might end up causing major disruptions in industries worldwide.\n\nTechnological breakthroughs are always highly anticipated events for savvy investors who recognize how rare the opportunities such events bring are. Investors who backed Internet-based businesses like Netflix in the early 2000s have made exponential returns on their investments and those who back AI startups that end up transforming industries can expect similar returns.\n\nInQubeta has emerged as one of the surest bets in the crypto space as platforms that help to push AI receive a massive inflow of capital. Investments in AI have increased by over $100 billion since 2015 and they\u2019re projected to surpass $1.5 trillion by 2030. Ethereum (ETH) poised to break the $2,000 barrier\n\nEthereum is already having an excellent 2023 and it appears to be poised for more growth as platforms built on its blockchain like Polygon (MATIC) and InQubeta generate lots of buzz in mainstream and crypto investment spaces. Polygon was recently featured in TIME as one of the most influential companies, while InQubeta\u2019s getting attention for making investments in AI accessible for all.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta and Ethereum are two cryptocurrencies many savvy investors already have in their portfolios. Ethereum will likely continue to see price increases for the rest of the year, but its odds of keeping up with InQubeta are low. At best, Ethereum might increase by up to 3x, while InQubeta beats that during its presale alone.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains promising into the new week, toned by a modest foray above $31,000.\n\nEthereum price eyes the zone above $2,000 as correlation with the flagship crypto continues.\n\nRipple price eyes a deepening correction unless buyer momentum raises XRP above $0.491.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price saw a spurt in buying pressure on July 3, which pushed it to $31,395, but the lack of momentum caused a retracement of the move. As a result, altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have remained lull. Additionally, the lack of a proper catalyst has sapped crypto traders' optimism.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin price face negative effects from Federal Reserve\u2019s two rate hikes?\n\nBitcoin price makes a modest foray above $31,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, up almost 5% since the new week started. The king of crypto has taken a subtle step above the $31,000 level, pointing to a growing buying activity after the start of the third quarter. The price action since June 15 has led to the appearance of a bullish flag pattern.\n\nThe pattern is resolved considering that Bitcoin price broke out of the flag formation in the direction of the prevailing trend, which is bullish. A decisive break above the June 23 high of $31,458, however, would provide cast-iron confirmation of the pattern\u2019s activation. Decisive would mean a long green candle breaking above the confirmation level and then closing near its high or a break by three green candles in a row.\n\nThe target of the flag is estimated by measuring the length of the pole and extending it in the direction of the breakout. A common stop level is just outside the flag on the opposite side of the breakout.\n\nBased on this estimation, Bitcoin price could rally 24% in the long term toward the $40,000 level. Meanwhile, experts anticipate a strong upward trend, with conservative investors speculating a breach of the $35,000 area. Another possible target lies at $33,650, the 61.8% extrapolation of the flagpole higher.\n\nsilver cross + CME gap - Maio 2022 entre $ 35K / $36 K. pic.twitter.com/AgED04X9Hh \u2014 6.25BTC \u26a1\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@3_125BTC) July 3, 2023\n\nOptimism is bolstered by a positive assessment of the probabilities that the major financial institutions seeking regulatory approval for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nwill be successful, according to $650 billion asset manager Bernstein, who said the US SEC will likely approve a spot Bitcoin, in a recent note.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, early profit-taking could cut the rally short, sending Bitcoin price back into the fold of the flag pattern. In a dire case, BTC could lose the support offered by the lower boundary of the flag at $29,578 before a possible trend reversal.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin options strategy: How to trade July\u2019s Q2 earnings\n\nEthereum price eyes $2,000 amid positive correlation with BTC\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is on a course north, joyriding the Bitcoin rally. A sustained uptrend could see the largest altcoin by market capitalization cross into the $2,000 zone. The PoS token is up almost 10% from the June 29 correction, with signs of a continued ascent as technical indicators communicate optimism.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) faces north, suggesting rising momentum. Similarly, the Awesome Oscillators (AO) are above the midline with deep green histograms, further adding credence to the upside.\n\nAn increase in buying pressure from the current level could see the Ethereum price rise around 2%, crossing into the $2,000 zone. In a highly bullish case, ETH could reprint the mid-April highs around $2,120, denoting a 7.95% ascent from the current price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from the $2,000 level could send Ethereum price back to the 50- and 100-day EMA at $1,842 or $1,809, respectively. In the dire case, ETH could tag the 200-day EMA at $1,747, constituting a 10% downswing.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum eyes $2,000 target as institutional investors pour capital into ETH funds\n\nRipple price could breach $0.491 unless buying momentum wanes\n\nRipple (XRP) price has regained momentum after a successful flip above the 50-day EMA at $0.485. The remittance token is up around 5% since the beginning of the new month as bulls push to breach the $0.491 resistance level.\n\nAn increase in buying pressure could facilitate the 0.61% climb, clearing the hurdle for the remittance token\u2019s foray above $0.500. A sustained bullish momentum could propel XRP up 10% from the current level to tag the $0.542 hurdle.\n\nThis optimistic outlook draws support from the up-moving RSI and green-flashing AO histograms, suggesting increasing buying activity among XRP bulls.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, day traders looking to make a quick profit could interrupt the rally by selling XRP at its current market value. The ensuing selling pressure could send Ripple price back under the foothold of the 100-day EMA at $0.472 or lower, below the 200-day EMA at $0.456.\n\nFailure by the bulls to leverage these buyer congestion zones could see Ripple price head lower, breaking below $0.450 and approaching the $0.420 support level.\n\nNotice that the AO is still negative while the RSI is under 50, suggesting bears still have a grip on XRP.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton says SEC Chairman Gary Gensler could resign"

In an announcement last week, the exchange notified users that it would be removing most USD trading pairs by June 26, urging users to withdraw their fiat currency or convert it into stablecoins on the platform.\n\nKaiko analysts noted that while there were occasional discounts for certain trading pairs after the lawsuit was announced, these discounts became more prominent after the Binance.US announcement last week.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the exchange still lists ten USD-denominated pairs. However, liquidity has deteriorated significantly, resulting in average daily trading volumes plummeting from $450mn to $20mn,\u201d stated Kaiko analysts in the report.\n\nCoinbase's market share is up in June, reaching its highest level since Jan 2023. Meanwhile, https://t.co/pup2WYms9R market share hit a new all-time low, dropping below 1%. pic.twitter.com/nRBAqWtYgB \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) July 4, 2023\n\nThe exchange also saw its market share in the U.S. become increasingly depleted through June, reaching its lowest point to date. Meanwhile, Coinbase\u2019s market share jumped to the highest level since January."

A spoofed Jeff Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, took the cake, luring in one victim to the tune of nearly $200,000.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also playing a key role in crypto scams.

        "content": "Wed 05 Jul 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nFollowing on from The Merge and Shanghai, Ethereum is planning further upgrades to make the blockchain more powerful. While waiting for the promised major changes, Solana offers a \u201cplausible\u201d possibility to the Ethereum team. Find out what Anatoly Yakovenko, cofounder of Solana Labs, has to say.\n\nEthereum mutated into Solana\u2019s layer 2 solution?\n\nVitalik Buterin has been stirring up trouble in the crypto-sphere of late, announcing that he will stake only a tiny fraction of his ETH. The reason is that the security of Ethereum wallets remains problematic at the moment. Hence the inclusion of this point in the new roadmap for the future development of this blockchain.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, aka Toly, recently tweeted this:\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023 Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s proposal\n\nWhat conditions must be met?\n\nSolana\u2019s co-founder laid out three very distinct conditions in the same tweet:\n\nsubmission of all ethereum transactions to Solana;\n\nsubmission of an SPV root for the corresponding state;\n\nthe establishment of a bridge timeout to prove the existence of a fault.\n\nOf course, this comes with its drawbacks. And he cited three of them: basic SPV conflicts, invalid base computation (which could be corrected by Neon Labs Org\u2019s EVM) and censoring.\n\nIn other words, Solana, with its high throughput and low transaction costs, is in a position to help Ethereum solve its problems of congestion and astronomical gas charges. At peak times, the network can\u2019t keep up. Vitalik Buterin really fears for the future of his blockchain.\n\nCase study\n\nDecrypt uses the Solana-based Ethereum loan of USDC stablecoins as an illustration. In the event that the borrower decides to withdraw his real USDCs on the Solana network, the lender will be given a \u201cjunk token\u201d on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cit would be safe to hold Solana assets on Ethereum, it would not be safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is due to the risk that an Ethereum fault could separate the Ethereum state on Solana from the Ethereum social consensus fork\u201d Yakovenko points out.\n\nThis will lead to problems of inefficiency, as well as constraints on liquidity provision and trading. Coming from a blockchain driven by the ambition to rival Apple, this outstretched hand must be studied closely by Vitalik Buterin\u2019s team.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Among the triggers were BlackRock's high-profile Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application and the launch of EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange.\n\nSince June 30, bitcoin has held firmly above $30,000 per coin aside for a brief dip below that mark. However, the price is now comfortably above $31,000 once again.\n\nCoinShares reported on July 3 that institutional investors continue to invest in digital asset products, with USD 125 million worth of inflows over the past week. The majority of that money is focused on Bitcoin, the report said."

Source: TradingView\n\nTransaction fees returning to normal\n\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, another key development in June was that transaction fees finally returned to normal levels after the network congestion witnessed in May.\n\nAs a result, both Bitcoin and Ether experienced a rebound in monthly address activity, with a 15.5% increase for Bitcoin and a notable 37.5% surge for Ether.\n\nGoldman Sachs also observed a significant decline in average daily ether burnt, which fell by 65.1%, and average daily fees, which dropped by 63.3% on a month-on-month basis.\n\nIncreased on-chain activity\n\nLastly, the report highlighted an increase in new on-chain activity.\n\nThe daily average count of new addresses for both Bitcoin and Ether rose by 9.8% and 48.2%, respectively, compared to the previous month.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nBased on these developments, it seems that the decline in Bitcoin and Ether supply on exchanges, coupled with increased on-chain activity, may suggest the return of a bullish market."

        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC) finally surpassed the $31,000 price level, the cryptocurrency market seems to be moving in a more positive direction, including Ethereum (ETH), for which machine learning algorithms and important technology trends suggest more success in the next couple of years.\n\nAs it happens, the self-learning machine algorithm on the crypto tracking platform CoinCodex has suggested that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization would grow its price by 11.22% by the end of the year and trade at $2,173.70 on December 31, 2023, as per data on July 4.\n\nEthereum 6-month price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nMoreover, should it follow the same growth pattern as that of the internet, the platform indicates that the price of Ethereum by the end of 2024 could reach $2,783.73, a 42.43% gain from its price at press time. Imitating the growth of mobile tech could lead it to $2,736.92, an increase of 40.04%.\n\nAt the same time, if the digital asset follows the path of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), it could increase its price by 108.18% and end up at $4,068.82. Mimicking Facebook\u2019s (NASDAQ: META) expansion could see Ethereum reach a price of $8,218.92 by the year\u2019s end, gaining 320.52%.\n\nMeanwhile, by the same logic, ETH could imitate the internet and reach the price of $ 3,593.79 by the end of 2025, increasing by 83.88% from press time, or $3,503.53 (+79.26%) if it followed the behavior and the expansion process of mobile technologies.\n\nFurthermore, keeping the same movements as Google, Ethereum is looking at $6,350.62 or +224.93% by the end of 2025, whereas following the trend of Facebook could lead it to a whopping $18,232, or a price increase of 832.84% during the same period.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024 and 2025. Source: CoinCodex\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently changing hands at the price of $1,954.46, which represents a slight loss of 0.41% in the last 24 hours but still indicates an advance of 4.70% across the previous seven days, as well as growing 2.88% over the month, as the latest charts suggest.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, whether Ethereum is truly capable of reaching any of the prices projected by the machine learning algorithm and important tech trends will depend on the further developments around the token, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade, as well as the overall atmosphere in the crypto sector.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "After the massive initial success of InQubeta\u2019s beta presale, crypto analysts are anticipating it will surpass Ethereum in price by 2025.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as the biggest trend in the AI industry, creating headlines and attracting the attention of crypto lovers and expert investors. This has generated buzz among enthusiasts, with many hedging their bets that it could succeed similar to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the leading altcoin and largest smart contract network, pioneering several trends like decentralized finance, NFTs, and Gamefi. However, InQubeta distinguishes itself from competitors by focusing on a unique industry.\n\nCan InQubeta surpass Ethereum to begin the top altcoin by 2025 as it gathers momentum and builds on the hype of its ongoing presale? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nInQubeta : A Trailblazer For AI Crowdfunding\n\nInQubeta is regarded as an outlier from the tokens in the market and stands out from others due to its growth potential in artificial intelligence. AI technology has captured the world\u2019s attention with the success of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing.\n\nThis makes it the next big thing, and many companies have committed huge capital toward expanding this growing industry. InQubeta intends to provide an ecosystem for AI startups struggling to get capital to tap into a crowdfunding system where anyone can invest in their idea in exchange for a part of the company using blockchain technology.\n\nInQubeta achieves this by utilizing fractionalized NFTs whereby AI startups are listed on their NFT marketplace, and interested investors fund the projects and receive NFTs providing ownership of their stake in the project.\n\nThese NFTs can be traded on a secondary market, while long-term holders benefit from rewards when the project profits. This solves the problems of funding for startups, provides liquidity for projects, and enables anyone to invest in the success of projects without breaking the bank.\n\nTo ensure that only the best projects make their way to the NFT marketplace, InQubeta uses a team of experts that vet the projects and provide users with relevant statistics and data to make informed investing decisions.\n\nFurthermore, InQubeta has a native token QUBE which serves as utility, and holders can purchase these NFTs with the tokens and become a part of the startup ecosystem. Beyond this, holders can also get rewards from staking and benefit from the deflationary system, which increases scarcity, thereby driving demand and value.\n\nInQubeta has also taken the step to ensure that security breaches are mitigated by auditing their smart contracts with Block Audit and Hacken. These platforms are two of the top smart contract security firms, and users can rest assured that their funds are safe.\n\nQUBE also acts as a governance token, and holders can participate in decision-making processes that shape the project\u2019s future. They can also make proposals and choose to vote for upgrades and changes to tokenomics or its blockchain infrastructure.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Biggest Presale In Crypto\n\nInQubeta is still in its early phases, and anyone can join the community by participating in the ongoing presale. The presale has raised over $550,000 in a few weeks, and there\u2019s massive buzz and interest in the project.\n\nFurthermore, the presale has a minimum quota of $50, making it accessible to a wide range of investors looking to diversify. Users also have diverse payment options, including Bitcoin, USDT, Ether, and Binance Coin.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nInQubeta has massive potential to scale and become a top leader in the AI industry. A significant user-base is attracted to its crowdfunding approach and reward system based on its native token QUBE. The current presale numbers have also exceeded expectations making QUBE an ideal token for investors to buy.\n\nWe expect that QUBE could be worth $1,900 before 2025 making it a higher value than the current price of Ethereum. The InQubeta team is prepared to challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance and will continue to release new products after the presale phase.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "Ethereum Implements New Token Standard, ERC-223, Enhancing Security and Functionality - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In an exciting development for the Ethereum blockchain, a new token standard called ERC-223 has been added to the Ethereum documentation. This standard aims to address the flaws of its predecessor, ERC-20, and introduce enhanced security and functionality to the Ethereum network. With the launch of ERC-223, ETH demonstrates its ability to evolve and overcome challenges, dealing a blow to alternative protocols often referred to as \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding ERC-223 Standard and Its Implications\n\nThe ERC-223 standard, initially proposed in March of this year, offers several improvements over ERC-20. One significant flaw of the ERC-20 standard was the potential loss of tokens in contracts that lacked compatibility with sent tokens. ERC-223 seeks to rectify this issue by acting as a subset of ERC-20 and introducing additional security measures. As the Callisto Network describes it, ERC-223 is a step forward towards economic abstraction, enabling the use of tokens as first-class value transfer assets in smart contract development.\n\nUnlike ERC-20, ERC-223 implements a more secure standard by preventing token transfers to contracts that do not explicitly support token reception. This improvement ensures that tokens are not inadvertently lost during transactions, enhancing the overall security of the Ethereum network. Furthermore, ERC-223 maintains compatibility with ERC-20, allowing for a seamless transition and ensuring tokens bridged from other protocols will work effortlessly on the Ethereum blockchain without requiring modifications. Consequently, the supply of Ethereum will not be adversely impacted by the introduction of this new standard.\n\nPromoting Universal Acceptance and Enabling New Functionalities\n\nThe adoption of the ERC-223 standard is expected to promote universal acceptance and facilitate the introduction of new functionalities on the Ethereum blockchain. With this improved token standard, developers will have greater flexibility to create innovative smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The enhanced security measures implemented by ERC-223 will inspire confidence among users, encouraging wider adoption of tokens built on the Ethereum network.\n\nAdditionally, the compatibility of ERC-223 with its predecessor ensures a seamless experience for tokens transitioning from other protocols to Ethereum. This interoperability eliminates the need for extensive modifications, streamlining the integration process. As a result, Ethereum becomes a more attractive platform for developers and projects seeking to leverage its robust ecosystem, bolstering its position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nDealing a Blow to Ethereum Killers\n\nThe introduction of ERC-223 serves as a significant blow to alternative blockchain protocols often referred to as \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d These protocols aim to capitalize on perceived weaknesses within the Ethereum network, such as scalability and energy efficiency concerns. However, Ethereum has been steadily addressing these challenges by transitioning from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism through the highly anticipated event known as The Merge, which went live last year.\n\nThe transition to PoS is not only driven by energy conservation objectives but also seeks to enhance scalability, security, and overall flexibility for developers. Ethereum\u2019s ability to evolve and overcome its core challenges showcases its resilience and demystifies the claims made by Ethereum\u2019s competitors. With the introduction of ERC-223, Ethereum further solidifies its position as a leading blockchain platform, offering improved security, interoperability, and innovation potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe implementation of the ERC-223 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain marks an important milestone in the platform\u2019s evolution. This new standard addresses the flaws of ERC-20, introducing enhanced security measures and promoting universal acceptance. By maintaining compatibility with ERC-20, Ethereum ensures a seamless transition for tokens from other protocols. The launch of ERC-223 deals a significant blow to Ethereum competitors, showcasing Ethereum\u2019s ability to overcome challenges and solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform."

When the market drops sharply, it kicks in and stops the robots from spending any more money. It keeps you from losing money. Then, we chose the best coin pairs for our first trades in the real world. It was our job to do this, and we picked trade pairs based on what was going on in the market at the time. The fact that Ethereum Code has trade pairs like BTC/USD, XRP/USD, LTC/USD, and ETH/USD is another great thing that lets users make more money. We were pleased, so we sat back and watched the robots trade for us using the money in our account during the live trading session, which ran for many hours. When our trade time was over and Ethereum Code made us money, we were so happy."

        "title": "Dencun, the Ethereum Upgrade Poised to Revive Liquid Staking - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade is the EIP-4844 Cancun-Deneb, aka Dencun, which will aim to stimulate liquid staking, and it is expected to arrive in Q4 2023. The upgrade would stimulate proto-dansharding and blobbing and will be the next major upgrade after the Shapella Upgrade which had arrived on April 12, 2023, and enabled unstaking of staked ETH.\n\nUpcoming Ethereum Upgrade and Liquid Staking\n\nAfter the Shapella Upgrade took effect on April 12, 2023, the consensus during a bi-weekly all-core developer call decided on the new upgrade. Dencun would focus on an important feature essential for the success of the network\u2019s roll-up-centric roadmap. Initially, the nickname for the upgrade EIP-4844 was proto-danksharding, and it was later named Dencun.\n\nDencun or proto-danksharding introduces a newer type of transaction, the \u201cblob-carrying transaction.\u201d This would present a temporary data storage mechanism and is expected to drastically reduce the transaction costs for layer-2 users.\n\nThe team lead of the Ethereum Foundation, Peter Szilagyi, suggested making EIP-4844 a priority in January 2023 when his peers subdued his voice to focus on the withdrawal of staked ETH, a feature that would be introduced by the Shapella Upgrade.\n\nCancun is the execution layer part of the upgrade, while proto-danksharding would be front and center. The upgrade would allow large \u201cblobs\u201d of data to be transmitted to nodes on the Ethereum network in a limited time. It is ironic that the data is permanently hosted on the layer-1 chain.\n\nThe data in EIP-4844 is stored there for a significant period for nodes to demonstrate and carry layer-2 roll-ups. This would allow for making effective transactions on layer 2. Sequencers have the role of receiving and keeping the transactions in order and would face a reduced load on the blockchain.\n\nDencun is an attempt to get rid of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to make way for statelessness. Here, state refers to every piece of crucial information available at the given time for the blockchain, including all the accounts, individual balances, all deployed smart contracts, and the storage requirements for all this data.\n\nThe upgrade would shift the responsibility of storing the complete information of the blockchain\u2019s state to a specialized \u201carchival node.\u201d This would facilitate storing a more extensive set of full nodes in order to store less data. Moreover, this makes running the node much easier and paves the way for network decentralization.\n\nCall moderator and project coordinator Tim Beiko said that \u201cclearly the self-destruct [proposal] is the second most mentioned EIP beyond 4844.\u201d He also pointed out that an external auditor is hired to determine if with the usage of on-chain data can, the currently deployed smart contracts be broken down or changed. The results of the exercise are expected in August 2023.\n\nVilatik Buterin\u2019s Road Map for Development\n\nIn November 2022, Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap diagram for the blockchain ecosystem, explaining what should be done to beat Bitcoin blockchain. After the upcoming Dencun upgrade, there are plans for upgradation that should take the blockchain to a whole new level.\n\nThe next upgrade would be Verge, which shall include Verkle trees. It is supposed to increase scalability by allowing developers to store vast amounts of data. The users can access this massive information via a short proof-of-data verification dubbed as the root of that tree. This would make data proofs on the blockchain more efficient.\n\nThe purge would follow Verge, which would remove historical data from the network. This step will help reduce congestion and significantly increase the transaction speed. Buterin argues that once the upgrade is executed, the network can process 100,000 Transactions per Second (TPS). The current rate is around 29 TPS."

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson is an American entrepreneur who studied analytic number theory before moving into cryptography. Hoskinson quit a consulting job in 2013 to begin a project called the Bitcoin Education Project, believing the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it a digital form of gold.\n\nHe joined Ethereum in 2013 as one of the five founders, but he served till 2014, when Buterin and team Ethereum removed him due to some project dispute. The dispute was whether to make the project commercial or a non-profit. Hoskinson\u2019s view supported the commercial idea, while Buterin wished to make the project non-profitable.\n\nBesides Cardano, Other Investments Includes IOHK\n\nIn late 2014, Charles and former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood formed IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong). IOHK is an engineering and research company to build cryptocurrencies, and its key project is Cardano.\n\nHoskinson does not look for venture capital because he thinks that it might lead to the outside control of a project. In 2020, Hoskinson spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, expressing his views on how blockchain may eventually cause social change.\n\nThe development of Cardano began in 2015 and it was launched in 2017. It was launched with the goal of improving the functionality that Ethereum lacks. It is a proof-of-stake based platform, providing unmatched security and sustainability to decentralized apps and systems. One can send and receive funds instantly with minimal transaction fees.\n\nCardano (ADA) is the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform as it uses energy saving proof of stake mechanisms, opposed to proof of work mechanisms utilized by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is a public blockchain platform, providing peer to peer transactions with internal cryptocurrency ADA. It is a smart contract platform that hosts the ADA cryptocurrency, and is looking to create a decentralized application (dApp) development platform.\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake blockchain platform and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe popular feature of Cardano is proof of stake consensus protocol which is designed to minimize the energy expenditure.\n\nThe token holders can send and receive ADA instantaneously with minimal transaction fees. The Cardano Computational Layer contains the proof of stake, Ouroboros consensus protocol. The protocol helps to run smart contracts and guarantee security.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s Future Plans and Vision Regarding Cardano\n\nHoskinson has a wide range of plans regarding Cardano, including the improvement in its functionality. He wishes to establish it as a safer and long lasting blockchain platform. He also focuses on regulatory clarity and building an environment to promote the ADA to be adopted more widely.\n\nHoskinson has emphasized the importance of academic collaboration and how this sets Cardano apart, prioritizing scientific research and peer review development practices. The system is open to review by its peers, giving Cardano reliability that most other coins don\u2019t have. Comparatively, the transactions are cost effective.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s projects focus on educating people about cryptocurrency, making cryptographic tools easier. This includes Cardano, a third generation cryptocurrency. Its layer two scaling solution known as Hydra will theoretically be able to process 1 Million transactions per second, which is higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 7 TPS and Ethereum\u2019s 12 TPS.\n\nHe said the improvements might help the blockchain\u2019s native token, ADA, outperform Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRecent Statistics of Cardano\n\nThe market cap of Cardano is $10B. Its volume in 24h is $207M and its circulating supply is 34,955,928,582 ADA. Looking at the 7-day chart, the price of the coin is $0.2826 and volume is $202.43M on 27th June, 2023. This has changed to price $0.2996 and volume of $200.74M on July 4th, 2023.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nCardano, the open source project is determined to create secure, transparent, and fair transactions. Its proof of stake mechanisms, which is an energy saver, adds unique quality in the coin."

        "title": "Ethereum Revolutionizes Token Standards with ERC-223, Enhancing Security and Potential for Growth - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "Ethereum, one of the most renowned and widely used blockchain platforms, is poised for a significant transformation in its token standards with the upcoming introduction of ERC-223. This new token standard aims to rectify the flaws that plagued its predecessor, ERC-20, while also bolstering security measures. As an investor, it is crucial to understand the implications of this development and the potential impact it may have on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThe ERC-223 standard comes into the picture following the submission of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 223 protocol proposal in March of this year. One of the critical issues with the ERC-20 standard was the inadvertent loss of tokens in contracts that were not specifically designed to interact with the tokens they received. ERC-223 aims to address this problem by implementing measures that prevent token transfers to contracts that do not explicitly support token reception. This enhanced security measure makes ERC-223 a more dependable and robust token standard when compared to its predecessor.\n\nOne of the key advantages of ERC-223 is its compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem, as it has been designed as a subset of ERC-20. This compatibility ensures that tokens bridged from other protocols can seamlessly integrate with the Ethereum blockchain without requiring any modifications. Therefore, the overall supply of Ethereum will remain unaffected by the implementation of the ERC-223 standard. This compatibility is a significant advantage as it allows for a smooth transition and adoption of the new standard without disrupting existing token functionalities.\n\nAn important implication of this development is the potential blow it deals to the so-called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d \u2013 alternative blockchain protocols that have sought to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s limitations in various aspects of blockchain operations. These competitors have often touted their superior features and scalability as reasons to consider them as alternatives to Ethereum. However, with the introduction of ERC-223, Ethereum showcases its ability to evolve and improve, dispelling the notion that it can be easily replaced. By addressing the flaws of ERC-20 and enhancing security measures, Ethereum demonstrates its commitment to continuous development and innovation, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nDexaran, the co-founder of the Callisto network and the creator of ERC-223, has confirmed the official inclusion of the new token standard in Ethereum\u2019s documentation and token standards. ERC-223 now joins the ranks of ERC-20 and ERC-777 as an essential token standard for Ethereum. While ERC-20 remains the current industry standard, ERC-223 addresses its known issues and provides a more secure and reliable alternative.\n\nFor investors, closely monitoring the developments surrounding Ethereum\u2019s token standards is essential, as they can significantly impact the price of ETH. The introduction of ERC-223 is a reflection of Ethereum\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement and its determination to provide a robust and secure platform for decentralized applications and digital assets. By strengthening its position as a leading blockchain platform and attracting more users, Ethereum has the potential to bolster investor confidence, leading to positive price movement for ETH.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve and overcome its core challenges, the possibility of ETH\u2019s price reaching $3,000 becomes an intriguing consideration for investors. Ethereum has already proven its resilience and ability to adapt to changing market demands. With the introduction of ERC-223 and its ongoing development efforts, Ethereum aims to solidify its position as a dominant force in the blockchain industry. As an investor, it is crucial to stay informed about these developments and their potential impact on the price of ETH, as it can help inform investment decisions and capture potential opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of the ERC-223 token standard signifies a significant milestone for Ethereum. By addressing the flaws of ERC-20 and enhancing security measures, Ethereum is poised to attract more users and maintain its position as a dominant blockchain platform. The compatibility with the existing ecosystem, the potential blow to Ethereum\u2019s competitors, and the continuous evolution of the network all contribute to the positive outlook for Ethereum and its native cryptocurrency, ETH. As an investor, staying updated on the developments and progress surrounding Ethereum\u2019s token standards is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market."
