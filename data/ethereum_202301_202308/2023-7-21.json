        "title": "Ethereum (ETH): You Don't Want to Miss This Pattern - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Ethereum has entered the ascending price channel, a pattern typically associated with an ongoing bullish trend. An ascending channel is characterized by two parallel trend lines, both slanting upward at the same angle, with the price oscillating between the upper and lower bounds.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is situated at the lower border of this channel. In previous instances, a touch at the lower trend line within this pattern often precedes a rally toward the upper boundary. If Ethereum follows this pattern, we could expect a bullish move in the near future.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum recently experienced a breakdown from the $2,000 level, a psychological barrier for many traders. This could apply some downward pressure on ETH. Yet, the current position on the ascending channel's lower border may provide enough support to counteract this bearish factor.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) - a popular momentum indicator - is presently hovering around the neutral 50 mark for Ethereum. This level often serves as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish market conditions. Notably, the RSI is maintaining its level above 50, implying that the prevailing uptrend could still have some steam.\n\nLastly, Ethereum's recent volatility appears to be lower than usual. In the world of cryptocurrencies, a decrease in volatility can often be a precursor to a significant price movement. A sudden surge in volatility could therefore potentially trigger a strong price swing for Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu is asleep\n\nIn the world of meme cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has held a significant place, with a community that is known for its zeal and resilience. However, recent market trends suggest dampening energy surrounding this token, with volatility significantly waning, putting SHIB in an anemic state.\n\nSHIB recently encountered a critical resistance level, which typically represents a price point that an asset struggles to break above due to heightened selling pressure. Unfortunately, as it stands, the token is experiencing a rapid reduction in volatility.\n\nAn asset without volatility may become less attractive for traders looking to capitalize on price swings. Therefore, the diminishing volatility of SHIB could lead to a potential increase in selling pressure, which is the last thing SHIB needs at this crucial juncture.\n\nThe current status of SHIB paints a picture of a token that is losing momentum. Unless the scenario changes - with an influx of positive news or an increase in its adoption - the current anemic state could continue.\n\nPEPE's bounce is possible\n\nThe meme-based cryptocurrency market has often showcased its unpredictable nature, with sudden price movements keeping investors and traders on their toes. One such crypto asset, Pepe (PEPE), a popular meme token, has been showing signs of a potential upward price trajectory. PEPE has once again touched its local low at approximately $0.0000015, an event that has historically led to price reversals.\n\nThis local low coincides with a 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level, as well as a support line on the token's local trend. The Exponential Moving Average is a type of weighted moving average that gives more weight to the latest data. In PEPE's case, the token's price has come to rest on this 50 EMA line, suggesting that it could potentially be in for a price boost.\n\nMoreover, this is not the first time such a price pattern has been noticed for PEPE. In the past, similar falls to this threshold have led to relatively swift price reversals. If the past is any indicator, and if the pattern continues to hold true, PEPE may be poised for a 10% run upward from its current position.\n\nOf course, any such prediction is contingent on a number of factors, including overall market sentiment, investor interest and the general performance of meme-based cryptocurrencies. With that said, the recent trend and historical data for PEPE give investors some cause for optimism."

        "content": "Interoperability protocol Rarimo is making Polygon ID, a verifiable credential infrastructure, available across multiple blockchains.\n\nRarimo announced the collaboration on Thursday, and now, users will be able to seamlessly use their credentials on the Ethereum network. Before the collaboration, a person\u2019s Polygon ID could only be used on the chain on which it was issued.\n\n\u201cThis meant that if you issued your credential on Polygon, you would not be able to use it on Ethereum. Instead, you would have to issue a new, Ethereum-native credential,\u201d Rarimo explained in a statement.\n\nNow that Ethereum has been included, credentials issued on Polygon will become available on BNB Chain and Avalanche in the coming weeks, according to Rarimo.\n\n\u201cAs the number of networks that Rarimo can scale to is limitless, a range of additional chains will be added with time,\u201d Rarimo added.\n\nPolygon ID was announced in March 2022 and the infrastructure stack was made open source in March of this year. The solution uses zero-knowledge proofs, which allow users to prove they are who they claim to be without needing to reveal their private information to outside parties. This ensures a high level of privacy and security during identity verification processes.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are a crucial component in the movement toward decentralized identity, the global market for which is expected to grow to $6.8 billion by 2027, according to MarketsandMarkets.\n\nOn Web2, the way individuals express their identity is dictated by giant companies like Meta and Google. The goal of decentralized identity is to flip the script. Whereas now, companies control when and where you share your data, the aim is to have companies request permission to verify your credentials.\n\nPolygon is just one player invested in ushering in this new way of thinking about identity. Disco, SpruceID, Iden3, Ceramic and the Ethereum Foundation are also exploring solutions on this front.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The second quarter of 2023 brought significant challenges for the Ethereum network as its revenue experienced a sharp decline. Ethereum network revenue plummeted from $1.27 billion to $847 million during Q2, representing a staggering 33.3% drop.\n\nThe network revenue for Ethereum encompasses all transaction fees paid by users to Ether validators, as well as the portion of charges that are removed from circulation through burning.\n\nGiven this, the decline in revenue reflects the decrease in overall activity on the platform, especially in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, where developments have been far from welcoming.\n\nDuring Q2 2023, the DeFi market faced a lean period, characterized by a lack of significant growth and unfavorable events. Notably, hack incidents in the DeFi sector increased by a staggering 63% during the quarter, resulting in losses of $228 million across 79 hacks. This was confirmed by Arltduv, a Crypto Directory in a Twitter Post on July 20, 2023.\n\nThese incidents have had a negative impact on user confidence and contributed to the decline in the overall value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, with Ether-based protocols accounting for more than 90% of the total TVL.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Daily Active Addresses Decline\n\nIn addition to the revenue decline, Ethereum\u2019s daily active addresses experienced a notable drop of 6% during Q2 2023. The metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses that have conducted transactions on the Ether blockchain per day during the quarter. Despite the ongoing bear market, the decline in daily active addresses hasn\u2019t worsened significantly, indicating a level of resilience in user activity.\n\nETH price resting at $1,891 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance during the second quarter suggests that while it faced challenges in network revenue and daily user engagement, the platform remains a key player in the DeFi space. The continuous efforts to improve the network\u2019s usability and scalability are crucial in attracting a broader user base, as demonstrated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent proposal.\n\nETH Still King Of DeFi\n\nDespite the decline in daily users and network revenue, Ethereum has managed to maintain its spot as the leading blockchain when it comes to DeFi activity. The network currently accounts for more than 50% of Total Value Locked (TVL) across all blockchains, establishing it as the leader in this regard.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Polyon built atop the Ethereum network are also doing incredibly well. Arbitrum is currently sitting at $2.649 billion in TVL, with Polygon trailing behind at $1.044 billion in TVL.\n\nIn terms of price, ETH is still closely following the performance of Bitcoin. The altcoin is trading at $1,892 at the time of this writing, with meager gains of 0.07% in the last day.\n\nFeatured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Address outflows from whales contributed heavily to ETH\u2019s latest sell pressure.\n\nSome whales are re-accumulating, but it may not be enough to turn the ship around.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been on an overall bearish trajectory for the last seven days \u2013 an outcome that saw it shed last month\u2019s gains. But what has been driving this bearish retracement?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nOutflows from whale addresses may have largely contributed to ETH\u2019s downside. A recent Glassnode alert offered some confirmation. It revealed that the number of addresses holding 100 or more ETH recently fell to their lowest level in the last eight years.\n\nThe Glassnode alert warrants a look at whether other whale categories have been contributing to sell pressure. We found that addresses holding at least 1,000 ETH and those above the 10,000 ETH (Denoted by blue and black respectively) have been trimming their balances.\n\nIn other words, they have been contributing to the downside.\n\nWe also found something interesting. Retail buyers (smaller accounts) holding at least 0.01 ETH have increased their balances overall. This is during the same period that whales have been selling off some of their ETH.\n\nIn other words, ETH\u2019s price action in the last few weeks has been significantly influenced by whale games.\n\nOne in the chamber?\n\nWe looked into the supply distribution which collaborates with the Glassnode address activity analysis above. However, we observed that addresses holding over 10 million ETH have been growing during the month.\n\nIn addition, the same whale category controls the second largest share of ETH in circulating supply.\n\nIt was unclear whether the aforementioned address category represented private addresses or exchange addresses. Aside from that, addresses holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH shifted in favor of accumulation in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso, investor confidence remained favorable for the bulls, judging by the steady rise in weighted sentiment.\n\nETH\u2019s MVRV ratio has also been steadily rising during the last four months and was at its highest level during the same period. The above information coincided with the latest price action.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH\u2019s bearish assault slowed down in the last three days, but the press time momentum was not yet strong enough for a substantial bounce back.\n\nETH exchanged hands at $1894 at press time. It was, at press time, showing signs of a potential bounce back at the RSI mid-point. Moreover, the MFI has already indicated that there has been some accumulation in the last few days."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Solana (SOL) will come close to its all-time highs once Ethereum (ETH) kicks off its bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 446,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana could go up to $250, an increase of more than 870% from its current price of $25.75.\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst, Solana\u2019s rise will likely be triggered by Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade, which is expected to further elevate the leading smart contract platform\u2019s scalability. The InvestAnswers host mentions a prediction made by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm that sees Ethereum rising to $9,700 following the update.\n\n\u201cPer Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case\u2026\n\nThe next question is always, \u2018Well if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what\u2019s the price of Solana?\u2019 I calculated it for you. It\u2019s going to be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700.\n\nRemember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x and of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time.\u201d\n\nWhile the InvestAnswers host believes that Ethereum could rally to $9,700, he doesn\u2019t see the surge happening in the coming months.\n\n\u201cGreat to see $9,700 ETH. Maybe we\u2019ll see in the bull run. I doubt we\u2019ll see it in the first quarter of 2024, but perhaps early 2025.\u201d\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the anonymous analyst reiterates his prediction that the flagship crypto asset will soar by over 40% from current levels by early next year.\n\n\u201cI did say many times a few months ago, I would not be surprised if we had a $42,000 Bitcoin target by somewhere between January and April of 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $29,804 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Your Ultimate Guide To Ethereum RPC Nodes - Blockchain Magazine",

But you should highlight the important tools that are needed to make dApps, like Ethereum RPC nodes that run on Remote\n\nBlockchain and web3 have made it possible for decentralised apps to be used in different situations. Because of the benefits of dApps, many businesses are looking for good ways to make their own dApps. But you should highlight the important tools that are needed to make dApps, like Ethereum RPC nodes that run on Remote Procedure Call protocols. Why do RPC nodes exist in Ethereum? The answer is clear from how a decentralised application is put together. Decentralized apps are like regular apps but can talk to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor decentralised apps to read data from the Ethereum blockchain or send requests for transactions to the network, they need to talk to the blockchain. RPC nodes come into play at this point. In the next post, you\u2019ll learn about the basics of ETH RPC nodes and how they work. You can run your own configuration or use a platform like Alchemy to learn how to run RPC nodes on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow important RPC is\n\nBefore you read a guide to Ethereum RPC nodes, you need to know what RPC is and why it\u2019s important. Decentralized apps always need information from the blockchain to do things like send transactions, check the state of the blockchain, and get block data. Nodes could use Remote Procedure Calls, or RPC, to connect dApps to the blockchain and do these things. RPC nodes help web3 apps talk to blockchain networks and make it easier for users to get to their data.\n\nRPC, which stands for \u201cRemote Procedure Call,\u201d is a light software communication protocol that lets a client or dApp talk to a remote programme or server. The server could be hosted on a different network, and the client could connect to the server through RPC without knowing the details of the server network. When the use of RPC Nodes in Ethereum is fully explained, examples would be given of how RPC can be used from a local computer to ask for resources from a remote server system.\n\nAfter the client makes a request, the request tells the server to run the procedure through a subroutine. When it comes to blockchain networks, a decentralised app (dApp) needs data from the blockchain network to work right. In RPC client-server mode, the client is the dApp, and the server is the RPC node.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum RPC Node Mean?\n\nIf you were talking about RPC nodes, the most obvious thing to bring up would be what they are. What is an Ethereum RPC node? The answers would show that RPC nodes are computers with blockchain client software on them. An RPC node could, for example, point to servers that run Ethereum\u2019s Consensus Layer and Execution Layer infrastructure.\n\n$STRONG Q: *All StrongBlock Ethereum 1.0 nodes were resynced as of 10/11/2021. You may once again use your node\u2019s RPC endpoint for your wallet and other node activities. Thanks for your patience. What does it mean ? \u2014 BaconEsq (@baconesq) October 16, 2021\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has different kinds of nodes, such as light nodes, archival nodes, and full nodes. Solana blockchain, on the other hand, has a validator and RPC nodes. The validator nodes are the ones that run the Solana consensus protocol and get paid for validating blocks. Solana\u2019s RPC nodes let dApps connect to the blockchain and get the information they need.\n\nYou could also learn about the importance of RPC endpoints by talking about any RPC Nodes Ethereum example. RPC endpoints are the places on the network to which a dApp sends RPC requests to get to server data. After dApps and RPC endpoints are linked, users can do things requiring real-time blockchain data access.\n\nRPC requests could be handled by any node that had the right software installed. RPC endpoints that run on a node usually have a service that helps dApps get information from users about the blockchain. Because of this, all RPC endpoints work with RPC nodes, and all RPC nodes have RPC endpoints.\n\nDifferent kinds of Ethereum RPC Endpoints\n\nBeginners would also learn about the different kinds of RPC endpoints when they were introduced to RPC nodes in Ethereum. On the Ethereum network, there are two main types of node RPC endpoints: those that are public and those that are private. Also, both public and private RPC endpoints can work with the help of alternative RPC endpoints. The alternative endpoints can help applications keep backups of RPC endpoints and deal with problems when they happen. Let\u2019s take a look at how the different kinds of RPC endpoints work.\n\nEndpoint for public RPC\n\nIn the outline of answers to the question \u201cWhat is an RPC node in Ethereum?\u201d public RPC endpoints are given. Public RPC endpoints are shared resources that run on RPC nodes and allow anyone to send requests. But public RPC endpoints don\u2019t work with production-ready apps and don\u2019t have ways to help customers. At the same time, public RPC endpoints don\u2019t have developer infrastructure or the ability to grow or shrink depending on how many dApps are running. The public RPC endpoints can only be used to let anyone get information from the blockchain network.\n\nPrivate Endpoint for RPC\n\nA guide on ETH RPC Nodes talks about private RPC endpoints as the next type of RPC endpoint. Such endpoints work to meet the needs of a single decentralised app and ignore requests from other apps. So, private RPC endpoints might be faster and more reliable with RPC nodes. Private RPC nodes could work if users asked them to. Also, the private RPC endpoints make it easier to keep explicit service-level agreements, or SLAs, which ensure better performance.\n\nA Different RPC Endpoint\n\nBecause of how they work, the alternative RPC endpoints are an important part of the guide to Ethereum RPC nodes. Alternative RPC endpoints help keep your system from going down because they act as backup endpoints. The alternative RPC endpoints are a key part of making sure your dApps run smoothly for your users. One of the best ways to keep dApps from having a single point of failure is to build them with more than one RPC endpoint.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ethereum and NFTs: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nHow Ethereum RPC Nodes Work\n\nThe next most important thing to talk about when explaining RPC Nodes Ethereum for beginners is how they work. The definition of RPC nodes gives a general idea of how they work by linking dApps to data on the blockchain. When a dApp starts a subroutine or asks for data from the Ethereum blockchain, RPC nodes get to work. Then, the RPC node can get the required requests from the blockchain and send the required payload to the dApps.\n\nJSON-RPC Protocol\n\nIn an Ethereum guide to how RPC nodes work, the JSON-RPC protocol would be the most important thing to talk about. It is a lightweight RPC protocol that doesn\u2019t keep track of state and can define different data structures and the rules for how they should be processed. The way data is transferred doesn\u2019t matter for the JSON-RPC protocol because the same process works with HTTP and sockets as well as JSON-RPC. The JSON (RFC 4627) data format is used by JSON-RPC. The JSON-RPC protocol has also become popular because it can receive and process data requests more quickly.\n\nBy using the client-server model as an example, you can better understand how the JSON-RPC protocol works. From the perspective of traditional client-server models, the dApp is the client, and the RPC endpoint is the server. In this case, the Ethereum RPC nodes would use JSON-RPC to define specific methods for requesting services from the node. Users can use the methods defined in the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s JSON-RPC API to request blockchain data for dApps.\n\nThe next important part of the JSON-RPC protocol description focuses on core methods. Ethereum has a number of core methods that use JSON-RPC to get information from the blockchain network. There are chatter methods, history methods, and state methods among the JSON-RPC methods.\n\nWhen the RPC node\u2019s Ethereum example is looked at, it would show how each method works. For example, gossip methods can be used to find the head of the blockchain and the blocks that are important. On the other hand, state methods return reports about how the data on the whole blockchain is currently set up. History methods, as their name suggests, work to get the history of any block on the chain.\n\nWhen a user action needs data from the blockchain, the client or the dApp will use JSON-RPC to start requests or subroutines. The dApp would make the requests through RPC nodes, and the node would send back the information that the dApp needs.\n\nThe best way to use RPC nodes\n\nThe \u201cWhat is an RPC node in Ethereum?\u201d guides also talk about the best ways to use RPC nodes. How could a developer of decentralised applications use RPC nodes in their apps? When such questions are asked, the answers point to three different ways of doing things: using private RPC endpoints, running self-hosted nodes, or sending traffic through public RPC nodes. Let\u2019s go over the details of how to use RPC nodes with different methods in the best way.\n\nRPC Node Providers\n\nUsing a private RPC endpoint from an RPC node provider is the first step to using Ethereum RPC nodes. One of the first benefits of using RPC node providers is that they take care of setting up, managing, and maintaining nodes for your decentralised applications (dApps). RPC node providers work to make sure that dApps run smoothly, and most web3 developers choose node providers.\n\nThe best blockchain node providers have features built in for setting up and maintaining nodes. So, they can help developers save time, money, and effort while making new solutions for end users. Alchemy, which can offer Ethereum RPC node endpoints, would be a good example of a well-known RPC node in an Ethereum example. Here are some of the steps you need to take to use Alchemy\u2019s RPC node infrastructure.\n\nStart by making an account on Alchemy.\n\nUse the \u201cCreate App\u201d button on the dashboard to make your dApp.\n\nGive your dApp a name and pick the blockchain and network you want to use.\n\nTo start sending RPC requests to the new node, click the \u201cView Key\u201d button on the dashboard and copy the URL.\n\nThe simple steps show how easy it is to start working with an Ethereum blockchain RPC node provider.\n\nHaving a self-hosted RPC node running\n\nIn a guide to Ethereum RPC nodes, the main reason to have a self-hosted RPC node would be to have more control. If you run your own node, there may be some costs and benefits. Self-hosted nodes, on the other hand, could help web3 developers and technical teams have complete control over how nodes are set up. Here is a high-level look at some of the most important steps for setting up your own ETH RPC nodes.\n\nWhen setting up a self-hosted node, the first thing you need to do is define the RPC node configuration. For the execution layer and the consensus layer, you must describe the client implementation or the node client software. The hardware and system environments, as well as the client settings, must be set in the RPC node configuration.\n\nIn the second step of setting up your RPC nodes, Ethereum said you must choose a guided setup service or install the node manually through a Command Line Interface or CLI.\n\nLastly, self-hosted nodes also put a lot of emphasis on keeping your RPC node in good shape.\n\nUsing public RPC endpoints to send traffic\n\nSending traffic through public RPC endpoints would be the next popular best practice for using RPC nodes. Depending on the blockchain network, you could send requests to find public RPC endpoint offerings by referring to the blockchain documentation. After that, you can route traffic through the public RPC endpoints using the URL. But the rate limits on public endpoints make it hard for developers to make dApps.\n\nLast Words\n\nRPC Nodes and how they work The Ethereum example shows how Remote Procedure Calls can be used in dApp development in a useful way. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see that RPC nodes are an important part of the future of web3 development. At the same time, the ways that public, private, and alternative RPC endpoints work show how useful they are for making dApps. With node providers, developers could be helped by not having to worry about setting up or maintaining nodes.\n\nOn the other hand, knowing the best ways to set up RPC nodes is also important. Depending on the use cases, some methods have pros and cons that make them better or worse. So, to learn more about how well it works, you should read the Ethereum RPC node documentation."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction; BTC and ETH Slip Nearly 5%: Potential Weekend Bounce?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, have experienced a significant slip, with BTC currently trading at $29,780 and ETH at $1,889.\n\nAs investors closely monitor these developments, delving into the technical outlook becomes essential to determine the potential price action in the coming days.\n\nThis Bitcoin and Ethereum price prediction aims to analyze the recent price movements and explore the possibility of a bounce-off before the weekend for both BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bitcoin trades slightly above a significant support level of $29,500.\n\nThis support level is further validated by the presence of a triple bottom pattern observed in the four-hour timeframe.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators both indicate a bearish sentiment, with the RSI at 42 and the MACD hovering below 0.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average acts as a resistance level at $29,995, just below the psychological level of $30,000.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood of Bitcoin maintaining a bearish stance below $30,000 is significant.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nThe cryptocurrency may encounter further downward pressure if it breaches the $29,500 support level, potentially reaching the next support at $28,900.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to break below $29,500 could trigger a bullish rebound, initially pushing the price toward $30,000 and possibly surpassing $30,500 in a bullish crossover.\n\nNotably, a surge in demand for Bitcoin leading to a breakthrough above $30,450 could drive the price toward the next resistance level at $31,200.\n\nAs a result, closely monitoring the $29,500 level becomes crucial, as a move above this point could present a buying opportunity, while a break below it may prompt selling positions.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nLooking at Ethereum from a technical standpoint, the cryptocurrency currently trades within a narrow range, with $1,920 serving as resistance and $1,880 as support.\n\nDoji and spinning top candlestick patterns in this range indicate that investors are uncertain and eagerly awaiting significant developments that could trigger a breakout in either direction.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators both suggest a neutral stance.\n\nThe RSI hovers around the 50 level, signaling a lack of clear market trends. However, the MACD histogram oscillates below the zero line, implying a slight bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average aligns around $1,920, with Ethereum\u2019s price moving above and below this level, reflecting investor indecisiveness.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nShould Ethereum surpass the $1,920 level, it holds the potential to target resistance at $1,945 or $1,975, indicating a continuation of the upward trend.\n\nConversely, a bearish breakdown below $1,900 could lead to a price decline towards $1,880 or even lower to $1,845.\n\nIn conclusion, closely monitoring the $1,900 level is essential, as a decisive move above or below this point could signal a shift in the market trend.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay informed about the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring our carefully selected collection of the top 15 digital assets to watch in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring that you receive professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the game and discover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the ever-changing world of digital assets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

Discover SCENE\n\nHackers have hit decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Conic Finance with an attack and drained 1,700 Ethereum\u2014worth over $3.2 million at current prices.\n\nIn a Friday tweet, the protocol said it was \u201ccontinuing to investigate the root cause of the exploit and are consulting with relevant parties.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the DeFi protocol later said the root cause was a \"re-entrancy attack,\" adding that \"a fix to the affected contract is being deployed.\" In a follow-up, the team claimed that withdrawals were safe and said that a more detailed post mortem was forthcoming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stolen crypto was all sent to one address, blockchain security company Beosin said in a tweet, linking to the transaction.\n\nSeems @ConicFinance was exploited for $3.26M in tx: https://t.co/K0VjnFprAE The stolen funds were sent to 0x3d32C5a2E592c7B17e16bdDc87EAb75f33ae3010 pic.twitter.com/mZr4MOkMQF \u2014 Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) July 21, 2023\n\nConic Finance is a new app which lets users deposit tokens into its \u201comnipools,\u201d allowing them to earn rewards. The idea is that users can diversify funds across the Curve decentralized exchange using Conic\u2019s liquidity pools.\n\nHackers targeted the Ethereum omnipool. Conic Finance has since said deposits have now been disabled to that pool.\n\nExploits like this one are very common in the DeFi space\u2014the crypto sphere which aims to replace traditional financial services like borrowing and lending via blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: - We are continuing to investigate the root cause of the exploit and are consulting with relevant parties. - We have disabled ETH Omnipool deposits on the Conic front end. https://t.co/Oln0zh2nCs \u2014 Conic Finance (@ConicFinance) July 21, 2023\n\nSuch apps are new and experimental and therefore sometimes have systems which hackers can take advantage of. Last year was the \u201cthe biggest year ever for hacking\u201d in the crypto space according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis.\n\nMost of those attacks happen in the DeFi space. DeFi traders lost $228 million in just three months of Q2 this year alone, a 63% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nAccording to Immunefi, most of the crypto losses originated from two specific incidents\u2014the June 3 hack of Atomic Wallet and the May 23 exit scam by the now-defunct Fintoch platform.\n\nThe company also found that some chains were targeted more than others. It found that attacks on BNB Chain and Ethereum made up 77% of all losses in the last quarter, followed by Arbitrum at 12%. They said that attacks on Arbitrum were notable, given that it experienced no incidents at all in the same period last year."

        "content": "Ethereum buyers have been struggling to push the price above the significant resistance region of $2K. Nevertheless, the price is currently navigating a crucial range bounded by that level and the dynamic support provided by the 100-day moving average.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn June 21st, Ethereum managed to surpass the 100-day moving average and continued its prevailing uptrend after a pullback, eventually reaching the critical resistance area at $2K. Yet, the bullish momentum faded due to increased selling pressure around this level, resulting in minor rejections.\n\nNevertheless, the price finds support at the 100-day MA, currently situated at $1,867, which has prevented further declines over the past few weeks. A breakout from this significant price range will likely play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum\u2019s overall prospects in the mid-term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nUpon analyzing the 4-hour timeframe, a bearish trend for Ethereum becomes evident as the price broke below its multi-week upward trendline after facing rejection at the $2K resistance zone. A subsequent pullback confirmed the breakout.\n\nAt present, ETH remains confined between two critical price levels: the static resistance at $2K and the critical support at $1,850. This suggests the potential for a range-bound market stage characterized by consolidation candles and the absence of a strong trend.\n\nThe price is expected to remain within this range until a breakout occurs, revealing the upcoming direction for Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe provided chart displays the Estimated Leverage Ratio in correlation with ETH\u2019s price. This metric gauges the average leverage employed by participants in the futures market. Generally, higher values indicate more investors are taking on greater leverage and risk in the derivatives market.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Estimated Leverage Ratio has seen a slight increase, suggesting that the futures market may be getting overheated due to the recent bullish price trends. However, it hasn\u2019t reached concerning levels yet. Nonetheless, if the metric continues to surge, caution is advised as it could lead to a short or long-squeeze event.\n\nIn such a scenario, Ethereum\u2019s price could experience a sudden and significant movement."

The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus was used by Ethereum for the first seven years of its life, much like Bitcoin.\n\nThe network's security was then derived from the enormous quantities of energy needed to solve mathematical puzzles, as any attacker would have to obtain 51% of the chain's energy usage, which is a nearly impossible feat.\n\nEthereum is now secured by stakers rather than miners. To be a validator, which is in charge of ensuring the validity of new blocks, stakers must stake 32 ETH.\n\nConsensus mechanisms, which allow a decentralized network to confidently decide which blocks to add to the chain, are the most important aspect of any blockchain's security. If the consensus mechanism is exploited, as might happen in a 51% attack, the chain could suffer irreparable harm.\n\nEthereum Deneb/Cancun testing efforts progress\n\nChristine Kim summarizes the Ethereum ACDE call, a twice-weekly conference call where Ethereum client teams debate and plan updates to the Ethereum execution layer (EL).\n\nThis week, developers talked about DevNet 8 planning and some adjustments to Deneb/Cancun EIPs. Various teams are working on new software releases in advance of DevNet 8.\n\nDevelopers will move on with the launch of the following test network once all client releases have passed the pertinent Hive tests for DevNet 8, which is scheduled to debut sometime in the first week of August, according to developers.\n\nA shadow fork of Sepolia has already been finished by developers with a small number of clients, and this helped to find a few flaws in the client code."

        "content": "Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) registered the highest inflows into centralized exchanges (CEX) in the past two months. These significant asset movements have suggested a potential price dip for ETH.\n\nCoinGecko data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing a slight price decline, losing 2.5% of its value in the past week. As of this writing, the Ether token changes hand at $1,892.65, with a negligible 0.2% gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Registers $383 Million Worth Of ETH In CEX Inflows\n\nAccording to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum witnessed the largest inflows into centralized exchanges in the past two months. The data analytics platform found that at least $383 million worth of ETH was deposited into these exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also revealed that a significant percentage of the CEX inflows came from a single address and in a single transaction. This deposit came from an old wallet that accumulated 61,216 ETH during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nThis pre-mine wallet had been dormant for eight years, with its constituent ETH worth more than $116 million untouched. On Wednesday, July 19, this address became activated, and its stash of Ether tokens was abruptly moved to another address associated with the Kraken exchange.\n\nData from Whale Alert shows that a significant amount of Ether tokens has been transferred to crypto exchanges by several whales over the past week. Notably, more than 200,000 Ether tokens have been transferred to Coinbase in separate transactions within this period.\n\nIndeed, the movement of massive amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges can signal impending selling pressure, which can drive the asset\u2019s price down. However, not all large transfers to an exchange precipitate a downward price movement, as the whales might not intend to sell immediately or all at once.\n\nTotal ETH Staked Reaches All-Time High\n\nThe Ethereum network has been experiencing a steady increase in the total amount of ETH staked on the blockchain. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this figure has reached $52.3 billion, representing its highest value ever.\n\nThe data analytics company also noted that with an increasing amount of staked ETH, the Ethereum blockchain is bound to become even more secure, as there will be a corresponding decrease in the risk of the network being taken over by a single entity.\n\nIt is worth noting that this surge in staking activity can be linked to the successful launch of the Shapella upgrade. The Shapella upgrade offered a new dimension to ETH staking, as investors can now lock and unlock their assets at will.\n\nThis increased flexibility eliminated a substantial portion of risk that has been attributed to ETH staking in the past.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,886.82 | Source: ETHUSD daily chart from TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Getty, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on top of the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) has been hacked to the tune of about $3.2 million.\n\nNew data reveals that Conic Finance (CNC), which provides omnipools, or liquidity pools that allow all trades on a network to occur in a single transaction, to Curve Finance (CRV) has been exploited for $3.26 million, according to crypto security firm Beosin.\n\nIn response to the attack, which only affected the protocol\u2019s Ethereum omnipool, Conic Finance disabled deposits into it.\n\nHowever, about an hour later, Conic provided an update saying that the exploit has been fixed in a way that it could never happen again.\n\n\u201cThe root cause was a re-entrancy attack that was able to be performed because of a wrong assumption as to what address is returned by the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools. A fix to the affected contract is being deployed.\n\nThe exploit cannot be done again for the ETH Omnipool. Withdrawals are safe. No other Conic omnipools are affected by this issue. A more detailed post-mortem will be published soon.\u201d\n\nConic says they have reached out to the bad actor via the transaction and warns that anyone else contacting users to recover funds is attempting to scam them.\n\n\u201cConic has reached out to the exploiter via a [transaction] sent from the official Conic Multisig address. Other [transactions] claiming to recover funds on behalf of Conic are a scam.\u201d\n\nThe debacle had a significant impact on the price of CNC. The digital asset fell a staggering 77.16% on the day, free falling from $5.92 all the way down to $1.34. It has since recovered and is trading for $2.90 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto die-hards like to say \u201cwe\u2019re early\u201d amid the peaks and valleys of the market, but what really feels early much of the time is the tooling.\n\nCymbal, which bills itself as the first \u201chuman readable\u201d Ethereum block explorer, aims to move that forward, launching in beta today.\n\nBlockchain explorers like Etherscan are essential tools for builders and traders alike, but they\u2019re densely packed with data and very difficult for the average user to navigate, let alone understand. That's where Cymbal sees an opening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt takes the same kind of public blockchain data that\u2019s flowing through standard explorers and turns it into a feed that\u2019s not only visual and easily understandable at a glance, but also social.\n\n\u201cToday, tools like Etherscan are the best in class for looking at the blockchain\u2014but they resemble command line interfaces. We want to get to the GUI,\u201d Cymbal CEO and co-founder Eric Feng told Decrypt, alluding to the past computing shift from text-based navigation to graphical user interfaces.\n\nCymbal looks more like a social network than a pure data resource, serving up dashboards that take transaction details and wrap them up with NFT artwork\u2014from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other top collections\u2014along with data trends, public information on known wallet owners, relevant news stories from media outlets, and more.\n\nIt also runs that data through an AI tool to generate a conversational summary of transactions and trends, to make things even more understandable for the average user. Feng said that Cymbal is running the tool through OpenAI\u2019s GPT large language model.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCymbal is launching with a focus on NFTs, but Feng said that richer data regarding cryptocurrency and token transactions will be added in time, as his team works to \u201cbuild out a full Etherscan replacement.\u201d Support for the Solana blockchain is coming in a matter of weeks, he added, with Ethereum scaling network Polygon not far behind.\n\nFeng said that Cymbal started with NFTs for a couple of reasons. The tokens are often tied to artwork, which makes them visual in nature\u2014ideal for this kind of platform. NFTs are also often the first way that people are onboarded into the crypto space these days, he added, and that accessibility layer also played a role in Cymbal\u2019s decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe consider NFTs to be the gateway to Web3,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nA screenshot of the Cymbal interface. Image: Cymbal\n\nCymbal looks like a social network, and it can be used like one too. Users can follow wallets and projects, plus wallet owners can claim their own page and then personalize it to become a \u201cWeb3 profile\u201d of sorts, Feng said. He suggested potential messaging, content publishing, and other social features to come in time.\n\nThe startup has raised a total of $18.5 million to date with notable investors in the mix, including Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, CAA Connect Ventures, UTA Ventures, Shima Capital, and Google Ventures (GV). Notable angel investors include Kleiner Perkins\u2019 John Doerr, Dapper Labs co-founder Roham Gharegozlou, and outgoing Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt.\n\nFeng\u2014a former CTO at Hulu and veteran of Meta and Microsoft\u2014said that Cymbal sees revenue-generating opportunities with targeted advertising based on wallet data, along with selling its curated data to app builders via API access. He said it\u2019s akin to business models used by other block explorers, as well as crypto price trackers.\n\nCymbal is positioned as a way to not only help the average NFT and crypto user better understand the blockchain space, but also help expand the industry as more accessible tools come online.\n\n\u201cThere is a subset of hardcore crypto people that can read Etherscan, just like there's people in \u2018The Matrix\u2019 that could look at the green squiggly lines and understand what's going on,\u201d Feng told Decrypt. \u201cGreat. This is not for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt's for the masses,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's not the tens of thousands of hardcore crypto people right now. It's for the tens of millions of people that hopefully will come into the ecosystem if we can create better tooling for them.\u201d"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLast week\u2019s blistering altcoin rally tapered off this week as Chainlink, XRP, XLM, Stellar and TRX were the only coins to post any notable gains over the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered the weekend slightly lower than they did this time last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.5% to its current price of $29,869, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the world\u2019s second favorite coin, ETH, dropped 2.5% to trade at $1,888 at the time of writing.\n\nThe steepest pullbacks among leading currencies this week were from Solana (SOL), which dropped 9.8% to $25.68, and Avalanche (AVAX), which shed 8.1% to $13.77.\n\nSeveral altcoins appreciated; notably, Toncoin (TON) grew 8.3% to $1.46, Stellar (XLM) blew up 23% to $0.163126, and Chainlink (LINK) rallied 15% to $7.98.\n\nChainlink began its rally on Monday with the launch of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on its mainnet. The protocol currently supports Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon networks. It is also integrated with DeFi lending protocols Aave and Synthetix. Chainlink says it is as an onramp for TradFi institutions to get into tokenized digital assets.\n\nThe week\u2019s news\n\nOn Monday, G20 watchdog the Financial Stability Board issued nine top-level recommendations for regulators on overseeing crypto companies and markets. It also issued revised recommendations on the oversight of stablecoins.\n\nThe recommendations are designed to prevent crypto crashes on the scale of FTX and Terra incorporate feedback from the FSB\u2019s public consultation on the topic, including calls for cross-border cooperation between regulators, governance requirements for crypto issuers, and mandatory disclosures for the industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe following day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accepted Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Spot ETF proposal for official review. This is the second spot ETF application that has moved to the next round, following asset manager titan BlackRock\u2019s on July 13.\n\nExchange operator Nasdaq on Wednesday said it was delaying plans to launch a digital assets custodian service. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said, \u201cConsidering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the U.S., we\u2019ve made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license.\u201d\n\nShe added the company would \u201cremain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThat day, a bipartisan group of Senators introduced a bill that would require decentralized finance (DeFi) services to abide by the same compliance rules as financial firms like banks and centralized crypto exchanges, in a bid to reign in \u201ccriminals, drug traffickers, and hostile state actors such as North Korea.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the UK Treasury rejected a House of Commons Treasury Committee recommendation to classify crypto trading as gambling, stating that it \"firmly disagrees\" with it.\n\nFinally, on Friday, Republican lawmakers in Washington introduced a 212-page bill entitled the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The bill aims to bring clarity and a \u201cmuch-needed regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nThe act includes a pathway for blockchains to be certified as decentralized. The SEC would have an opportunity to push back against assertions made by token issuers that their projects meet the standard outlined in the act. It also seeks to establish a disclosure regime for the transparency and compliance of digital asset issuers."

The digital asset market is waiting for economic data and key events to make a decisive direction.\n\nBitcoin extended its drop for another day but the largest crypto token was marginally lower to remain below $30,000-mark. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading slightly higher but could not race past $1,900-level. Price in the action altcoins was mixed during the early day.\n\nThe crypto market has continued to perform in a tight trading range. The crypto fear and greed index has swung back into the neutral zone after shedding 6 points; the current score is at 50/100. Bitcoin, for another day, traded flat while altcoins registered some significant developments, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\"Polygon continues to strengthen further. On the TradFi front, the US Federal Reserve has launched a long-awaited FedNow service which will be similar to India\u2019s UPI. The Fed has also confirmed after releasing this service that it is not related to a \"digital currency,\" he added.\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Friday, with a positive bias. Among the gainers, Polkadot surged about 8 per cent, while Toncoin gained about 4 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon were down 2 per cent each. On the downside, XRP plunged 5 per cent, followed by a 4 per cent fall in Solana and Cardano each.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading flat and it continued to hold at $1.21 trillion-mark as it declined marginally, less than a per cent, in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped more than 6 per cent to $30.87 billion.\n\nBitcoin's dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum (ETH) is in a adescending trend and bearish momentum with the asset trading above its 50-day exponential moving average. ETH is consolidating between the range of $1,880 and $1,950, where it faces immediate resistance. If the price successfully surpasses this, it could lead the asset towards next resistance at $2,000.\n\nAlso, the 14-day RSI (at 51) indicates a neutral sentiment. These values suggest that the consolidation may continue in the near term if ETH holds the $1,875 support level. On the down side, if ETH fails to hold the $1,850 support level, it could encounter renewed selling pressure.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,875, $1,850\n\nResistance: $1,950, $2,000"

        "content": "How Anoma and Namada Plan to Enable Intents on Ethereum: EthCC Highlights\n\nAt the EthCC event in Paris, the founders of blockchain architecture protocol Anoma and its partner Namada shared a series of updates on their projects. Anoma co-founders Adrian Brink and Christopher Goes explained how their projects aim to enable multi-chain interoperability in the French capital during the three-day event.\n\nOn the main stage on the last day of EthCC, July 20, Adrian Brink presented his vision for enabling intents on the Ethereum network. As the first blockchain architecture that focuses on intents, Anoma offers unique features for applications such as end-to-end decentralization, information flow control, and fully customizable intents.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to understand that Anoma is an architecture, not a blockchain,\u201d said Brink, explaining, \u201cThis distinction allows existing applications to utilize Anoma\u2019s properties to the extent they require. For example, rollups could employ Anoma\u2019s counterparty discovery to decentralize their sequencer, or use Anoma to generate intents for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nBrink announced the launch of Anoma\u2019s first incentivized Request for Comments (RFC) program on the main stage, which aims to attract developers and researchers from Ethereum and other communities to review Anoma\u2019s architectural specifications and suggest feedback and improvements to the current design.\n\nThe RFC program will start in fall 2023, with the Anoma Foundation allocating a part of the Anoma genesis distribution to contributors.\n\nBrink, who is also the co-founder of Namada, a Proof-of-Stake Layer-1 for multi-chain privacy, revealed a new way of swapping tokens anonymously on the Cosmos exchange Osmosis. The feature, called Shielded Swaps, allows Osmosis users to swap tokens privately on a chain that does not support privacy natively.\n\nNamada uses a unique incentivization mechanism called \u2018shielded set rewards\u2019 to reward multi-chain users who help increase the privacy for all other Namada users.\n\nThe Anoma Foundation is a Swiss non-profit that funds and coordinates the development of public goods such as Anoma\u2019s intent-centric architecture and Namada, an L1 that offers the best multichain privacy to users today. By creating a new way of building blockchain infrastructure layers, Anoma aims to make it easier for web2.5 applications to become fully decentralized and provides new primitives and tools for developers to create applications that were never possible before.\n\nNamada is a Proof-of-Stake L1 for multi-chain privacy that supports any type of asset (fungible and non-fungible). Namada\u2019s innovations include shielded transfers for all assets, providing one shared shielded set to offer the best privacy protection for every individual user. Namada connects to IBC-enabled chains and to Ethereum through a custom trustless two-way bridge. Other features of Namada include \u201cprivacy as a public good,\u201d where the protocol rewards users that help increase privacy."

        "content": "Anoma Foundation plans to launch intents on Ethereum, CEO confirms at EthCC, Paris.\n\nIncentivized Request For Comments (RFC) will also launch on the architecture.\n\nAnoma\u2019s partner, Namada, launched privacy swapping on the Osmosis exchange.\n\nSwiss-based non-profit decentralized architecture protocol Anoma is set for a wave of new developments in the coming months, according to the company\u2019s founders Adrian Brink and Christopher Goes. Speaking at the EthCC conference in Paris, France, last week, the founders announced Anoma and its partner, Namada, are planning to launch several innovations set to enhance the efficiency of its platform and improve the project\u2019s muti-chain capabilities.\n\nOn the main stage of the Ethereum conference in the French capital, Adrian outlined his team\u2019s plan for bringing intents to the Ethereum network. An informal definition of intent is a signed set of declarative constraints which allow a user to outsource transaction creation to a third party without relinquishing complete control to the transacting party. Intents allow users to have a more efficient and user-friendly platform, away from the conventional transaction models.\n\nWith the launch of intents on Ethereum, developers can use Anoma\u2019s architecture to create novel applications, including end-to-end decentralization, information flow control, and fully programmable intents. Speaking on the launch of intents on Ethereum, Adrian Brink stated:\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to understand that Anoma is an architecture, not a blockchain. This distinction allows existing applications to utilize Anoma\u2019s properties to the extent they require. For example, rollups could employ Anoma\u2019s counterparty discovery to decentralize their sequencer or use Anoma to generate intents for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Brink also launched Anoma\u2019s first incentivized Request for Comments (RFC) program to welcome the community to participate in developing the platform. The program is set to launch later this fall, with contributors gaining a share of the Anoma genesis distribution as they participate in the program. This encourages developers and researchers in Ethereum and broader communities to review principal technical developments on Anoma and share feedback and EIPs to Anoma\u2019s current architectural design.\n\nFinally, Anoma\u2019s partner, Namada, a Proof-of-Stake L1 for asset-agnostic multi-chain privacy, confirmed they have introduced added privacy features to Cosmos-built, Osmosis exchange. The new privacy feature, \u201cShielded Swaps\u201d, adds a layer of privacy to transactions on platforms that do not natively support privacy. The interchain privacy model will also introduce an incentivization model for multi-chain users \u201cwho contribute to the increased privacy for all fellow Namada users,\u201d the press release concluded.\n\nThe latest additions follow the recent $25 million fundraising round in June, led by crypto-focused venture capital firm CMCC Global. Other investors in the round included Electric Capital, Delphi Digital, Dialectic, KR1, Spartan, NGC, MH Ventures, Bixin Ventures, No Limit, Plassa, Perridon Ventures, Anagram, and Factor, among others. This brings the total funds raised to $51 million after a $26 million raise in 2021.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, failed to rise above the $30,000 mark early Friday. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Solana (SOL) \u2014 saw minor dips across the board.

At one point, BTC even dropped to a one-month low of $29,500. Currently, BTC faces resistance at the $30,000 level and finds support at $29,600. Apart from Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum have also experienced value declines. On a positive note, LINK's performance has managed to avoid a downturn. Furthermore, a notable development is the United States government introducing a new bill to regulate digital assets, potentially impacting the future of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBTC, for another day, traded flat while altcoins registered some significant developments. LINK (+17.3 percent) is making a big move after launching its CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). Good moves in other prominent DeFi tokens like MKR (+8.38 percent), SNX (+5.96 percent), and COMP (+5.29 percent) underline that the current market interest is around accumulating quality DeFi protocols before Bitcoin coves out of its tight range of trading.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cThe overall market sentiment remains neutral even as prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum decreased. The macroeconomic factors and equity markets results have had little impact on user sentiment. Altcoins continue their popularity streak even amidst price volatility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently hovering slightly above the important $29,500 support level, bolstered by a triple bottom pattern on the four-hour time frame. Technical indicators such as RSI (39) and MACD (-5) indicate bearish sentiment. The 50-day exponential moving average acts as resistance around $29,995. The likelihood of Bitcoin remaining bearish below $30,000 is high, with potential support at $28,900 if it breaks below $29,500. A bullish breakout could push it to $30,000 and even $30,500. If demand increases, a break of $30,450 could lead to a rally towards further resistance at $31,200. Watching the $29,500 level is vital as it could indicate a buying opportunity above or quick selling positions if breached.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe entire volume of the cryptocurrency market increased by an amazing 19.70 percent over the past day to reach an astounding $37.46 billion. Ripple's XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, gained 6.8 percent, while native cryptocurrencies Cardano, Solana, ADA, and SOL surged over 6 percent, outpacing Bitcoin and Ether. With a value of $29,905.69, Bitcoin continues to play a significant role in this rollercoaster. These numbers demonstrate the potential of the cryptocurrency sector and its indisputable influence on the financial landscape, which presents opportunities and difficulties for both investors and enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin is holding a key support above $30,000 with a record-breaking accumulation of 5,92,000 BTCs worth $17.8 billion at the $30,200 level as per Glassnode, suggesting that investors are confident that BTC will continue to hold above this level. However, BTC dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee To Become 100x Cheaper With This New Plan | - cryptonewsbytes.com",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is the Ethereum co-founder, and his primary goal is to improve the network. Recently, Buterin discussed his new plans for the network, and they are impressive. So, this plan is about reducing high transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum developers have tried to reduce gas fees, which is paying off. But their progress is relatively slow. One of the first major steps they took was changing the Ethereum network to proof-of-stake. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, was initially operating as a proof of work. But the Ethereum Merge seems not enough to reduce transaction fees. This new plan is powerful because it could minimize gas fees by nearly 100%.\n\n\n\nButerin Shows How Ethereum Transaction Fees Will Become 100x Cheaper\n\nWikimedia\n\nVitalik Buterin shared more details about his plans to make transaction fees cheaper. The event where he spoke on this plan was the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris. According to the founder, the new Ethereum improvement proposal will solve many issues. And one of the issues is the high cost of transaction fees. Since users often complain about them, Buterin decided to take action. The overall summary of the plan is to reduce transaction fees. Another addition is to improve user experience.\n\nA huge takeaway from Buterin\u2019s plans is how straightforward it is. For instance, Buterin said there will be no changes to Ethereum\u2019s underlying protocol. So, executing this plan won\u2019t be as disruptive as the Ethereum Merge. Instead, it will only take a few steps to get it to work.\n\nFirst, how Ethereum wallets operate will change. Buterin says it will now be easier to use the wallet. For instance, initiating actions like secret phrase recovery will be easier. For this to happen, an integration of Account Abstraction will take place.\n\nSecondly, he said the Ethereum community will use programmable smart contract wallets. This type of wallet is also known as a non-custodial wallet. Using this wallet will contribute to reducing gas fees.\n\nTransaction Fees to Drastically Decrease\n\nExecuting this proposal will bring one major change. Ethereum users will receive and send tokens without high transaction fees. To do this, Buterin proposes an infusion of account abstraction with \u201cpaymasters.\u201d Paymasters allow crypto users to pay transaction fees using any token. In other words, Ethereum users won\u2019t pay the high gas fees in ETH.\n\nNote that the Ethereum improvement proposal will feature signature aggregators. Signature aggregators allow you to use multiple signers. Other benefits are more data compression, which translates to less costs. In other words, Vitalik Buterin says costs (gas fees) will reduce by nearly 100 percent.\n\nEverything indicates Vitalik Buterin\u2019s mind\u2019s made up concerning his new proposal. If it becomes a reality, many things will change. One of the changes is users enjoying lesser Ethereum gas fees.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay"

        "content": "Canadian crypto miner HIVE has disclosed to be involving Ordinals in one of its many Artificial Intelligence projects.\n\nHIVE CEO Aydin Kilic has also stated that they will use their own GPU to create generative AI art.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies, a Canadian crypto miner has disclosed that it would be using Ordinals in one of its AI initiatives. According to the report, it would involve old Ethereum mining rigs to inscribe generative art on Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to HIVE CEO Aydin Kilic, this initiative is an exercise in technical prowess, and Ordinals would enable it to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs by providing a new way.\n\nAfter a decision by Ethereum to switch to the Proof-of-Stake, it used the data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs to mine altcoins. In this case, it changed the way transactions are verified on the network and drastically reduced its energy consumption. The post-merge event forced the company to explore alternatives to Ethereum mining. Generative art pipeline using new technologies is said to be perfectly in line with its corporate strategy of maximizing profit.\n\nKilic said:\n\nWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [\u2026] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSince its inception, Ordinals has led several innovations with Bitcoin. Just as people inscribe data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, Ordinals has been a windfall for Bitcoin miners. For the past few months, Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscription have come down after the popularity of BRC-20 tokens sent it high.\n\nMore on the HIVE Initiative\n\nAccording to Kilic, the HIVE project is a very ambitious one since it taps into different areas of the HIVE business. This is said to include cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that\u2019s fully integrated. It\u2019s a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.\n\nIn addition to creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic disclosed that HIVE is closely working with its custody providers to transact uncommon sats which are found through Ordinals. These uncommon sats are the first Sat of each Bitcoin block. With this, about 272 of them are in possession of HIVE.\n\nHIVE can boast of several achievements since its inception including going public in 2017 and trading on TSX Venture Exchange in Canada using the symbol HIVE.V. Under the HIVE, it has been trading on Nasdaq since 2021. As of press time, its shares were exchanging hands at $5.66 with a market cap of $477 million.\n\nRecently, MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor mentioned that Ordinals has a huge potential in app development. He also observed that the ability to commit data to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that is not related to transactions has several potential applications.\n\nThe whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
