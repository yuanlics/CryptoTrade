        "content": "U.S. asset managers Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Volatility Shares, ProShares and Round Hill Capital have submitted new applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track Ether (ETH) futures contracts.\n\nKey Takeaways Six asset managers have sent applications to the SEC for the creation of ETH futures ETFs.\n\nAll of the proposed ETFs will allow holders of the assets to go long ETH with the exception of the ProShares offering, which is intended to enable investors to short the crypto asset.\n\nIf approved, the various ETH ETF offerings could go live as soon as October.\n\nVolatility Shares was the first one to kick off the most recent round of ETH ETF applications, as their proposal was filed on Friday. By Tuesday, five others had joined the fray. If approved, the funds would not hold any ETH directly. Instead, they would follow the price movements of the futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\n\n\nNotably, Grayscale has applied for two ETFs in their filing: one for Bitcoin-related assets and one for Ether futures contracts. The first bitcoin futures ETFs launched in October 2021. In June 2023, Volatility Shares enabled the first leveraged bitcoin ETF through its 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX).\n\n\n\nProShares has taken a different approach and filed for a short ETH strategy ETF that would profit from the losses of the S&P CME Ether Futures index. The fund would invest in daily contracts that inverse the performance of the index. This means the fund would gain as much as the index loses on a given day and vice versa. In other words, the ETF would effectively act as a mechanism to short the price of ETH.\n\n\n\nThe SEC has not yet approved any ETH ETFs in the U.S. If approved, these ETH ETFs could launch as early as October.\n\nIt should be noted that this new round of ETH ETF applications differs from the recent bitcoin ETF proposals from Blackrock and others in that those potential bitcoin ETFs are backed by spot bitcoin rather than futures contracts."

        "content": "As the recent fever surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) somewhat subdued, with the issuers and investors still eagerly awaiting the regulatory approval for this investment vehicle in the U.S., Ethereum futures ETFs have suddenly taken center stage.\n\nAt least five applications from different firms were filed within 24 hours on August 1, and another was one submitted last week.\n\nAn ETF tracking Ethereum futures would essentially invest in futures contracts of the industry\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency that are traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rather than directly holding the underlying asset.\n\nHow these efforts pan out and whether the SEC greenlights any of the current filings remains an open question, especially in the light of the regulator\u2019s recent clampdown on the crypto industry and the barely disguised attempts to classify almost every cryptocurrency\u2014except for Bitcoin\u2014as a security.\n\nVolatility Shares: Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 07/27/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/11/2023\n\nListing Exchange: CBOE BZX Exchange\n\nVolatility Shares, which manages $173.5 million across four exchange-traded funds, could become the first issuer of the ETF with the focus on Ether after outlining its plans in a July 28 filing with the SEC.\n\nThe company\u2019s proposed Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) complies with the provisions of the 1940 Act governing investment policies and capital structure and would invest up to 25% of its assets in cash-settled Ether futures contracts traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nAdditionally, the fund may invest in reverse purchase agreements and shares of other investment companies, but not directly in Ethereum, per the filing.\n\nThe fund intends to list and principally trade its shares on CBOE BZX Exchange.\n\nThe proposed ETHU application follows the introduction of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX)\u2014the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF\u2014launched by the Mt. Kisco, NY-based firm in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitwise: Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: NYSE Arca\n\nAfter withdrawing its initial filing in May, Bitwise re-applied for its Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHG) on August 1. According to the filing, ETHG intends to invest in cash-settled, front-month, i.e. with the shortest time to maturity, ETH futures contracts, without seeking direct exposure to the current spot price of Ethereum.\n\nThe fund is classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, meaning it is able to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in financial instruments with a single counterparty or a few counterparties.\n\nThe filing details that the fund will not invest in ETH futures contracts directly; instead, the investments will be channeled through a wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nFurthermore, since the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF intends to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company, the size of the fund\u2019s investment in that subsidiary will not exceed 25% of its total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nDespite such a low allocation, the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through its investment in ETH Futures Contracts, whereas the remaining 75% of assets are expected to be invested in U.S. Treasuries and other U.S. government obligations, as well as money market funds, cash and cashlike equivalents such as high quality commercial paper.\n\nRoundhill: Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nNew York-based Roundhill Investments is a SEC-registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors.\n\nThe firm currently has a total of $662 million of assets under management across eight ETF and is seeking to expand the offering with the launch of the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nAccording to the August 1 filing, the Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks capital appreciation by investing in CME-listed front-month Ether futures contracts.\n\nSimilar to Bitwise, the fund plans to invest up to 25% of its assets in a wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nVanEck: VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nVanEck, which is also among the spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls, appears to be going big on Ethereum: according to the August 1 filing, the total value of the ETH to which the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF is planning to have economic exposure is approximately 100% of its total assets.\n\nIf for any reason such as exceeded position limits or liquidity constraints, the fund is unable to achieve the target exposure, it may invest in equity securities of ETH-related companies, i.e. companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange that the fund\u2019s adviser believes provide returns that generally correspond, or are closely related, to the performance of ETH or ETH futures.\n\n\u201cFor example, the Fund may invest in U.S. listed companies offering digital asset trading platforms,\u201d reads the filing\n\nIn addition to ETH futures, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF expects to have \u201csignificant holdings\u201d of cash and fixed income investments, which are intended to provide liquidity and serve as collateral for the fund\u2019s ETH futures, as well as to engage in \u201cactive and frequent trading of portfolio holdings.\u201d\n\nProshares: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn August 1, ETF-issuer ProShares filed for two different Ethereum-focused ETFs: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nThe former seeks daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index, whereas the latter seeks to provide capital appreciation primarily through managed exposure to CME-listed Ether futures contracts, with the investment objective being \u201cnon-fundamental,\u201d meaning it may be altered by the Board of Trustees without the approval of the fund\u2019s shareholders.\n\nSimilar to the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, both Proshares\u2019 Ethereum futures ETF seek to to qualify as regulated investment companies, meaning that the size of the fund\u2019s investment in their corresponding subsidiaries, which will also be based in the Cayman Islands, will not exceed 25% of the total assets at each quarter end of the fiscal year.\n\nGrayscale Investments: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nFiled: 08/01/2023\n\nSEC Response: 10/16/2023\n\nListing Exchange: Not specified\n\nOn May 9, Grayscale Investments, best known as as the sponsor of the troubled Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the formation of Grayscale Funds Trust\u2014a Delaware statutory trust structure that encompasses three new funds: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.\n\nJust a week later, the firm submitted amendments to its SEC filing to remove mentions of the Ethereum Futures ETF though, only to re-apply for the offering on August 1.\n\nThe updated filing states that the Ethereum Futures ETF is an actively-managed fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through exposure to Ethereum futures contracts, purchased via a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary.\n\nThe fund is also planning to hold approximately 100% of its net assets in Ethere futures contracts, however, it may also have significant holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills or repurchase agreements."

        "title": "Everything You Need to Know about The Ethereum ETF - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Building upon the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency in a regulated and convenient manner.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the concept of Ethereum ETFs, their potential benefits, challenges. And the impact they may have on the broader crypto market.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s ETF?\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a company\u2019s stock. So, ETFs are designed to track the performance of an underlying asset or a basket of assets. In the case of Ethereum ETFs, the fund\u2019s objective is to mirror the price movements of Ethereum (ETH). Enabling investors to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it directly.\n\nWhether accurate or not, this signals that word on the street is that the #BTC Spot ETF is likely to be granted and these 6 applicants want to be first in line for the #ETH one. It doesn\u2019t mean @GaryGensler will agree to an #ETH ETF but the full court press will start. https://t.co/itfkXF69ZB \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 2, 2023\n\nEthereum ETFs hold significant appeal for both institutional and retail investors. Firstly, ETFs offer a regulated and secure investment vehicle. Providing an alternative to the complexities of purchasing and storing cryptocurrencies directly. As traditional financial institutions start to enter the crypto space cautiously. ETFs may serve as a bridge, attracting more conservative investors.\n\nAlso, ETFs can be bought and sold on conventional stock exchanges during regular trading hours. Making them highly liquid and convenient investment options. Investors can easily adjust their holdings, exit positions, or diversify their portfolios. With greater ease compared to traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nRegulatory Hurdles about Ethereum\u2019s ETF\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs is not without challenges, primarily concerning regulatory approval. Various regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, have scrutinized cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Their concerns mainly revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the volatility of the underlying asset.\n\nNEWS: Two sources tell Blockworks the SEC is now ready to consider ETH futures ETF applicationshttps://t.co/Nz60UfmgX3 \u2014 Blockworks (@Blockworks_) August 2, 2023\n\nWhile several countries, including Canada and Brazil, have successfully approved and launched Ethereum ETFs. The United States has yet to give the green light to any cryptocurrency ETFs. The regulatory landscape remains uncertain, and the approval process can be lengthy and arduous.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price and Adoption\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs has the potential to influence the price and adoption of the cryptocurrency. As ETFs become more prevalent, they are likely to attract a significant influx of institutional funds, increasing the demand for ETH. This influx of capital could drive Ethereum\u2019s price higher. Benefiting existing investors and further raising awareness and interest in ETH.\n\nAdditionally, ETFs could serve as an on-ramp for new investors who are more comfortable with traditional financial products. This could lead to increased adoption and usage of Ethereum as more people become exposed to the asset and its underlying technology.\n\nLittle inside baseball to part of this. The ETH ETFs from yesterday would go effective on 10/15 but that\u2019s a Sunday so it\u2019ll likely actually be the 16th. This Direxion fund would also theoretically have an effective date of 10/16/23 (if approved). So no delay for being late. pic.twitter.com/geBboZ1HOU \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 2, 2023\n\nRisks and Considerations\n\nInvesting in Ethereum ETFs carries certain risks and considerations that investors should be aware of. While ETFs aim to track the price of Ethereum, they may not perfectly mirror the cryptocurrency\u2019s price due to tracking errors, and fees. Furthermore, ETFs are subject to market volatility, and their prices can fluctuate based on demand and supply.\n\nAdditionally, some investors may prefer owning and controlling their cryptocurrencies directly. Rather than relying on a third-party fund manager. In such cases, they may choose to invest in Ethereum through traditional cryptocurrency exchanges or custody solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the crypto market. As more countries approve and launch these investment vehicles, they could provide a gateway for traditional investors to participate in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter Volatility Shares kicked off the $ETH futures ETF race on July 28, five other entities have filed applications with the @SECGov. By @amitoj.https://t.co/VzFgJQQPir \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) August 2, 2023\n\nWhile there are regulatory hurdles and risks to consider, Ethereum ETFs have the potential to drive greater adoption, liquidity, and interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately contributing to the growth and maturation of the broader crypto market. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be crucial for investors to stay informed, conduct due diligence, and assess the impact of Ethereum ETFs on their investment strategies."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe biggest altcoin, Ethereum, displayed a range-bound price action between $1849 and $1887 for almost a week. However, the recent 1.79% fall in Ethereum prices forms a bearish candle breaking the bottom support to exceed the $1849 mark.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price trades at $1833 below the 50-day EMA, with an intraday fall of 0.28%. The bearish range breakout intensifies the dark cloud over Ethereum prices, projecting a potential drop in market value to $1800.\n\nTrading View\n\nWith a closing price of $1820, Ethereum was at its lowest closing level in 36 days. This brings the biggest altcoin closer to a long-term support trendline forming since December 2022. The ascending support trendline has helped ETH prices bounce back five times since December 2022.\n\nThe RSI indicator projects a high possibility of a bullish divergence forming at the coming retracement to the trendline. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA follows a sideways track and stays close to $1800, ready to provide a cushion.\n\nIn case of a bullish reversal, the Ethereum prices can reclaim the 50-day EMA and challenge the $2000 resistance level before reaching the $2150 mark.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark."

Vann added:\n\n\u201cThis is a significant step forward for our multichain strategy, as it will enable our token to access the rich and diverse ecosystems on both chains.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum and BNB Chain cross-chain bridges will offer users of the two networks a chance to join the emerging WMT ecosystem. BNB Chain and Ethereum are two of the most used smart contract networks, with both networks having more than 200 million unique addresses, respectively.\n\nWMT eyes liquidity\n\nIn addition to its primary objective, the initiative is set to bolster WMT liquidity. Compared to its native Cardano network, Ethereum and BNB Chain currently demonstrate higher levels of liquidity.\n\nNotably, the World Mobile sidechain AyA will see seamless integration with these two prominent networks, further enhancing its potential and accessibility.\n\nWith the creation of the new bridges, WMT now has three cross-chain bridges connecting it to other networks. The third bridge connects World Mobile to Conflux (CFX) blockchain.\n\nDespite a slight drop of 0.93% in the last 24 hours, WMT\u2019s price holds steady at $0.11489, as per the data from CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The crypto industry collectively celebrated when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, applied for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (exchange-traded fund). The move led to a rally for BTC with other major assets following suit soon after. However, there are also several Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs currently awaiting approval. The race for ETH ETFs is equally contested by major financial players.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Has 50% Chance For SEC Approval?\n\nCurrently, six ETH futures ETF filings await approval. These include Ether Strategy ETF, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF. It should be noted that BlackRock has not applied for an ETH ETF as of yet.\n\nWhy are firms interested in an Ethereum futures ETF?\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nFutures ETFs provide exposure to futures contracts for ETH, unlike spot ETFs. The SEC\u2019s concerns about investor protection and market manipulation have so far prevented the approval of a spot ETF. The Ethereum network houses a lot of projects. Many of these projects deal with metaverse initiatives and web3 developments. As such, the ETH ecosystem has a lot of potential for future growth. Therefore, financial institutions may have a lot to gain, without actually holding the asset.\n\nRoundhill, which was founded in 2018, follows an innovative strategy for its investments. The firm focuses on thematic funds like Metaverse and generative AI ETFs.\n\nVolatility Shares, founded in 2019, manages about $173.6 million in funds. The firm offers four ETFs, including the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF and others tied to long and short VIX futures indices.\n\nAlso Read: HSBC Enables Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF Trading in Hong Kong\n\nEarlier, Grayscale and Bitwise withdrew their filings due to SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) concerns, but they have since re-entered the race. Grayscale had filed an amendment to remove the mention of any Ether futures ETF. Moreover, the SEC also asked the firm to reverse the Filecoin Trust application, considering its security. On the other hand, Bitwise had completely removed its ETH ETF application, however, it re-applied recently.\n\nThere is no confirmation on when these applications will be approved, if at all. However, considering that these are futures ETFs and not spot ETFs, the SEC should ideally not contest the applications."

        "content": "Ethereum price is currently still below $2,000 but this could quickly change if some things were to come to pass. Some of the most notable things that have been going on for the cryptocurrency include the multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) filings that have been made to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWhen Will An Ethereum ETF Be Approved?\n\nThe topic of Ethereum futures ETFs has become hotter especially after Bitcoin futures ETFs received multiple approvals from the SEC since 2021. However, even two years after the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved, the regulator is still yet to approve an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nDespite this, investment firms have remained undeterred as they have continued to file for Ethereum futures ETFs. As reported by NewsBTC, there are now a total of six ETH futures ETF filings with the SEC after Grayscale refiled its application with the regulator. In addition to Grayscale, VanEck, ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, and Roundhill all have pending applications with the commission.\n\nWith so many interested applications, there is now mounting pressure on the SEC to approve the first Ethereum futures ETF to trade in the country. And according to people familiar with the matter, it may not be much longer until the first ETF is approved for trading.\n\nThe reason behind this is the fact that the regulator had previously asked interested parties to halt activities regarding applying for ETH ETFs. However, with the re-filings and new filings, it signals that the SEC may finally be ready to review the applications and consider them.\n\nETH price still holding above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Happens When An ETF Gets Approved?\n\nThe anticipation around a possible approval for an Ethereum futures ETF is mostly the implications of such an occurrence. Like in 2021 when the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved in October, the price of BTC surged drastically, reaching a new all-time high price just a month later.\n\nETFs are an instrument that helps to bring more volume to an asset and if an ETH ETF gets approved, the price of ETH is expected to rally. This would be the result of a combination of the new volume and interest, as well as the euphoria that comes with it. An ETF approval would likely push the price of ETH above $2,000 and could trigger another bull rally for the coin.\n\nCurrently, all eyes are on October 16, 2023, when one new filing and four re-filings for Ethereum futures ETFs become active.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum (ETH) is another major blockchain, so investors think it is one of the most lucrative investments in the current cryptocurrency market. However, investors believe VC Spectra (SPCT) can become a strong challenger to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) and Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) dominance. VC Spectra (SPCT) already raised $2.4 million in its private sale, showing strong signs of what will come.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Has Been On A Roller Coaster\n\nTesla billionaire Elon Musk has rebranded Twitter to X. Musk favored Dogecoin over Bitcoin (BTC) as the official cryptocurrency for transactions on the social media platform. That decision hurt Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market sentiment, resulting in investors leaving Bitcoin for Dogecoin .\n\nOn that note, a lot of uncertainty is affecting the Bitcoin (BTC) market, pushing traders to look for alternative investment options that guarantee huge profits like VC Spectra (SPCT).\n\nThe current challenge to surge above the $31,100 level shows that the Bitcoin (BTC) market is facing a critical moment. If the risk sentiment in the market turns negative, Bitcoin (BTC) might see a severe selloff.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,300, up 0.34% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.5% of its value, and over 3.6% on the monthly chart. Analysts expect Bitcoin (BTC) to rise to $40,000 by the end of 2023 as the halving event approaches.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent price trajectory resembled a rollercoaster ride, soaring to $31,500 in mid-July before dropping to $29,000. Despite the recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, experts say it is a normal market adjustment. They view Bitcoin (BTC) as potentially primed for a potential price breakout since it is currently in a consolidation phase.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Investors Shifting To VC Spectra\n\nIn June, an Ethereum (ETH) whale withdrew 50,100 ETH, translating to $91.2 million, from their Binance wallet. Interestingly, the same investor withdrew another 8,500 Ethereum (ETH) on June 8 while staking another 34,560 Ethereum (ETH). All the huge Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals resulted in a major dip in the market between June 28 and July 2.\n\nDespite all these withdrawals, Ethereum (ETH) has shown signs of stability, limiting losses. While the crypto whales have always favored Ethereum (ETH), a massive surge in profits is expected from VC Spectra (SPCT). In that context, Ethereum whales are already shifting to the upcoming project. The exit by these whales is affecting the price of Ethereum (ETH) negatively.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,860.05 down 2.12% in the last week. Analysts expect it to stabilize to end the year around $1,905.55.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Attracts Crypto Whales with Its Huge Profits\n\nThe VC Spectra (SPCT) blockchain offers holders robust risk management strategies and a group of experienced capitalists dedicated to reducing investment risks. VC Spectra (SPCT) is committed to utilizing the power of AI to create viable income opportunities.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) employs a decentralized authority network, integrating active participation from its investors in important functions within the platform. This active participation by VC Spectra (SPCT) investors is fundamental to this platform\u2019s operational structure.\n\nFurthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) gives SPCT token holders exclusive voting rights, enabling them to shape their participation in the project. Interestingly, VC Spectra (SPCT) guarantees a streamlined experience for trading on its platform by removing intermediaries, making the process straightforward.\n\nOn that note, VC Spectra (SPCT) lets investors participate in the decision-making process about investment strategies. They also help in assessing the credibility of ICOs on the blockchain, which increases asset retention and offers many investment opportunities.\n\nCurrently, VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) Stage 2 public presale is ongoing for $0.011, a 37.5% rise from its Stage 1 price of $0.008. Those who purchase VC Spectra (SPCT) tokens in Stage 2 will get a 627% profit once SPCT reaches $0.08 at the end of the presale.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "Developers seize on cheap Ethereum to drive 12-fold surge in new smart contracts - DLNews",
        "content": "Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum and related blockchains have surged 12-fold over the past year.\n\nThe number of new, user-friendly crypto wallets jumped over 1,200%, or 13-fold, in July.\n\nThat development could augur a boon for user experience in crypto.\n\nCompanion blockchains that have made Ethereum cheaper to use have been a boon for crypto developers, according to a new report.\n\nSmart contracts deployed on Ethereum and a trio of related blockchains grew 1,100%, or 12-fold, year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nSmart contracts deployed Q2 2023 Ethereum layer 2 blockchains and Polygon have been driving smart contract growth over the past year. (Aleks Gilbert)\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research from Alchemy, a company that builds tools for crypto software developers.\n\nAlchemy growth analyst Blake Tandowsky attributed the boom to layer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, having dramatically reduced the cost of using the world\u2019s largest smart contract platform.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nIn addition, some of those smart contracts are enabling a more familiar user experience that proponents hope will lower the barrier to use blockchain technology.\n\nIn the same period, there were more than 29,000 active users of new, smart contract-based crypto wallets made possible by an Ethereum upgrade in March, of which 22,000 were active in June.\n\nIn July, there were almost 300,000 active users of those smart contract-based wallets, according to data compiled by pseudonymous data analyst Kofi, a contributor to DefiLlama and Alchemy.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPolygon, Arbitrum and Optimism drive boom\n\nLayer 2 blockchains allow developers to deploy smart contracts \u201cat a higher rate than ever before,\u201d Tandowsky told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing on Polygon \u2026 or Optimism and Arbitrum, who are also adopting smart contract wallet concepts.\u201d\n\nThe news comes on the back of a drop in funding, regulatory clashes, and a slow decline in the number of blockchain developers having dwindled by 22% over the past year, according to a recent report from web3-focused venture fund Electric Capital.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a drop in the number of developers, those that remain are churning out more smart contracts than ever, according to Alchemy.\n\nNOW READ: Blockchain developer ranks fall 22% amid scandals \u2014 but Sui and Aptos are bucking the trend\n\nThe boom has been made possible by Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 blockchains, which batch and compress user transactions before appending them to Ethereum, a process that allows people to use it as a decentralised settlement layer while avoiding its notoriously high transaction fees.\n\n\u2018Dream of the Ethereum developer community\u2019\n\nThat, in turn, has fuelled developers\u2019 work on a relatively new feature called account abstraction, which enables the more flexible, smart contract-based crypto wallets.\n\nAccount abstraction makes it possible to recover an account \u2014 similar to how one might regain access to a social media or email account if they\u2019ve forgotten their password \u2014 along with a host of other features.\n\nTwo years ago, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wrote that account abstraction had \u201cfor a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a nascent transformation within the industry\u2019 \u2014 Blake Tandowsky, growth analyst at Alchemy\n\nBefore the March update, users needed a passcode comprised of at least 12 randomly generated words \u2014 a seed phrase \u2014 in order to access their Ethereum wallets. Forgetting any of those words, means losing access to their crypto \u2014 forever.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s a nascent transformation within the industry, we did see compounding growth\u201d in the second quarter, Tandowsky said. \u201cDevelopers have started to build products, and there are users using these products \u2014 in a small way, but in a fast growing way.\u201d\n\nAccount abstraction also allows protocols to cover users\u2019 transaction fees, known as gas, which can fluctuate dramatically and occasionally make Ethereum prohibitively expensive to use.\n\n\u201cOne of the complaints we\u2019ve seen from application users is that it\u2019s really hard and annoying to have to go all the way through the transaction flow and pay for gas whether that be on Ethereum or other chains,\u201d Tandowsky said.\n\nCovering user\u2019s transaction fees, he added, \u201chelps to lower the friction to transacting.\u201d"

        "content": "Asset management firms are rushing to apply for Ethereum ETFs, with analysts inferring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is softening its stance toward digital assets.\n\nThe SEC has now received seven applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering exposure to Ether futures from six issuers in the past few days. Volatility Shares, the firm that launched the first 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF (BITX) in June, led the charge on Friday.\n\nNot to be left behind, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Roundhill, and Proshares quickly followed suit, with Proshares also applying for a second ETF that would let holders bet against Ether prices.\n\nSeven Major Asset Managers File Ethereum ETF Applications\n\nEric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, tweeted that he thinks the ETFs \u201chave a very good chance of getting approved\u201d following the recent launch of BITX.\n\nEther has rallied more than 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nSeven Major Asset Managers File Ethereum ETF Applications\n\nPotential SEC Softening\n\nThe new filings come after the SEC appeared to discourage applicants as recently as May.\n\nGrayscale filed for an Ethereum ETF on May 9, prompting BitWise, Direxion, and Roundhill to follow suit. However, Grayscale withdrew its application just one week later, with its rivals doing the same shortly after. A similar scenario played out in August 2021 when VanEck and ProShares withdrew applications for Ethereum futures ETFs just a couple of days after filing them.\n\nETFs track the performance of an underlying asset, allowing investors to access exposure to an asset without having to hold it directly. Shares in ETFs are listed on exchanges, meaning retail traders can purchase the shares.\n\nWith ETFs offering a way for retail users to speculate on digital assets without navigating the technical complexities of crypto, analysts have long-tipped that ETFs could bolster the sector\u2019s mainstream adoption. According to BlackRock, retail investors drove 15% of activity in US-listed ETFs during Q1 2023.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, also suggesting that the SEC\u2019s stance towards crypto may be shifting,\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts Unpack ETF Applications\n\nMarket observers are weighing in with speculation regarding the cause for the sudden flurry of ETF applications.\n\nJames Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, suggested that the SEC could be softening its stance to avoid a potential challenge from hopeful Ethereum ETF issuers.\n\n\u201cIf any of these ETH futures ETF issuers want to\u2026 battle with SEC, SEC defenses would fail to hold up in court why BTC futures ETFs are allowed but ETH futures ETFs aren't,\u201d Seyffart tweeted. \u201cWonder if SEC is now just trying to avoid losses?\u201d\n\nJohn Deaton, managing partner at Deaton Law Firm, believes the filings reflect market sentiment that following BITX, the SEC is likely to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, improving the chances of Ethereum ETFs alongside it.\n\nHowever, Lark Davis, a popular crypto influencer, disagrees that spot crypto ETFs could be around the corner and criticized the futures contracts underpinning the proposed ETFs.\n\n\u201cMore paper garbage s**t to allow Wall Street manipulation,\u201d Davis tweeted. \u201c Meanwhile, spot ETF approvals are nowhere in sight.\u201d"

        "title": "Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.\n\nEthereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned\n\nAt the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.\n\nWith ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.\n\nDeFi Activities Falling\n\nFalling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFurthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.\n\nLooking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.\n\nOn-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It\u2019s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a recent court ruling, Ethereum (ETH) was denied non-security status in a case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief on whether Ethereum and the Ethereum Network are securities. While the ruling was a procedural one and not on the merits, it confirmed that there is no protection for Ethereum as a non-security.\n\nEthereum And Other Cryptocurrencies Left In Legal Limbo\n\nAt this point in the US, only Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are large-cap tokens that have legal clarity. The court\u2019s decision highlights the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies and the need for the SEC to issue definitive guidance rather than approaching the issue in piecemeal litigation.\n\nAccording to the Law Firm Dedicated to unique issues of digital assets and cryptocurrency, Hodl Law, the court emphasized that the SEC has not investigated the plaintiff or threatened to investigate, and there is no imminent threat based on its unclear Ethereum position and enforcement-by-litigation approach.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s recent refusals to comment on Ethereum, combined with the position it was forced to take in this briefing, clearly demonstrate that it views Ethereum as a security and is waiting for the most opportune time to strike.\n\nWhile there are appellate options and constitutional grounds available, the ruling underscores the need for greater regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. Businesses and individuals operating in the crypto industry need expert legal counsel to navigate the complex legal landscape and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.\n\nETH\u2019s Fate As A Security\n\nIf the SEC were to classify Ethereum as a security, it could have significant consequences for the cryptocurrency and the broader industry.\n\nFirst and foremost, if Ethereum were classified as a security, it would be subject to the same regulations as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. This would mean that Ethereum would have to comply with securities laws and regulations, including registration requirements, disclosure requirements, and other compliance obligations.\n\nThis would likely increase the cost and complexity of operating the ETH network and could potentially stifle innovation.\n\nAdditionally, it could impact the value and liquidity of the cryptocurrency. The SEC\u2019s classification would create uncertainty and potentially undermine investor confidence in Ethereum, leading to a decline in its value and potentially reducing demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, this case could potentially lead to legal action against the platform and its developers. If the SEC were to determine that Ethereum was sold in violation of securities laws, it could result in penalties and fines for the platform\u2019s founders and developers.\n\nAs the crypto industry continues to evolve, regulators must provide clear guidance on the status and treatment of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe ongoing confusion and uncertainty surrounding the legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies pose significant challenges for businesses and investors in the space. While the court\u2019s ruling, in this case, maybe disappointing for some, it underscores the need for greater clarity and regulatory certainty in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is in the process of recovering from a significant decline experienced over the past few days. Currently, the second-largest token in the nascent industry is trading at $1,850, which represents a 0.7% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Quant Explains How These Indicators Affect Ethereum Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A quant has explained how the indicators like taker buy/sell ratio and Coinbase premium index can influence the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Relationship With Taker Buy/Sell Ratio & Coinbase Premium Index\n\nIn a new CryptoQuant quicktake post, an analyst has discussed some metrics that could hold relevance for the ETH price. The first indicator of interest here is the \u201ctaker buy/sell ratio,\u201d which tells us about the ratio between the Ethereum buy and sell orders in the market right now.\n\nWhen this metric has a value greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. Such a trend implies that the majority of the investors are bullish on the asset currently.\n\nOn the other hand, values below the threshold naturally imply the dominance of bearish sentiment, as there are currently more sell orders present on exchanges.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 50-day moving average (MA) Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio over the past few years:\n\nThe potential relationship between these indicators and the value of the cryptocurrency | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, the quant has highlighted the pattern that the Ethereum price and the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio have possibly followed during the past couple of years.\n\nIt would appear that whenever the value of the asset has rallied, the taker buy/sell ratio has gone down. This would suggest that the sell orders on the market pile up as the ETH price trends up.\n\nThe analyst notes that this is naturally because the investors become more cautious as the price continues to rise since they think a correction may be coming soon.\n\nThe sell orders continue until the cryptocurrency has topped out, and once the decline hits the asset, the buy orders start going up instead.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s visible that significant accumulation periods have generally paved the way for the price to bottom out and begin another rally.\n\nThe quant has also attached data for another metric: the Coinbase Premium Index. This indicator keeps track of the difference in the Ethereum prices listed on Coinbase and Binance.\n\nWhenever this metric has a positive value, it means that the Coinbase platform has BTC listed at a higher price than Binance currently. This implies that buying pressure has been stronger from US-based investors, who usually use the former exchange. Similarly, negative values imply just the opposite.\n\nAccording to the analyst, major fluctuations in the Ethereum price have generally come with strong changes in the Coinbase premium index, a possible sign that activity on the exchange is the driver for these price moves.\n\nCurrently, the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio is at relatively low values and is looking to turn around, although this trend shift towards buy order dominance isn\u2019t confirmed just yet.\n\nThe Coinbase Premium Index is at neutral values, implying that there hasn\u2019t been any trading activity happening on the platform that\u2019s different from Binance. Given these trends, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum may not see any big moves in the near future.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,830, up 2% in the last week.\n\nETH has erased its gains from yesterday | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The latest sign of crypto going mainstream among traditional investors is the race heating up to launch the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to Ethereum futures. In recent weeks, six companies have filed proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThe Race To Launch An Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs track the price of the digital currencies they are tied to and they are not a new thing in the crypto industry. Bitcoin futures have gained popularity in recent years and are already being offered by popular investment companies.\n\nHowever, with bitcoin futures ETFs now established, it is only natural for the next hot product to be an Ethereum futures ETF. So far, more than 10 Ethereum futures ETFs have been filed in the past, but none have been approved by the SEC.\n\nVolatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF was the first to be filed on July 28. Since then, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, and Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF have been filed and are awaiting clearance, as reported by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nNow, Grayscale Investments is also looking to join the pack with its new Ethereum Futures ETF filing. After withdrawing its filing earlier due to SEC concerns, the digital currency asset management company is now back with a better application. Bitwise, another crypto index fund manager, also withdrew its previous filing at the same time.\n\nETH price jumps to $1,839 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to the filing, the majority of the Grayscale Investments fund\u2019s assets would be placed in Ether futures contracts with \u201cfront-month\u201d maturities, which have \u201cthe shortest time to maturity.\u201d The company also intends to diversify into other Ethereum contracts in the coming future.\n\nWhy Ethereum Futures ETFs Are Gaining Traction\n\nThe buzz around crypto ETFs was recently ignited by the news of BlackRock and other investment companies filing applications with the SEC for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC is still yet to give the go-ahead, citing failure to meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards in past applications.\n\nAnalysts report that BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF could unlock $30 trillion worth of wealth. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee if or when they may get the green light.\n\nFor crypto investors and the industry, an Ethereum futures ETF would no doubt be a game changer. If approved, Ethereum futures would become available to investors 75 days after the application date. It would provide an easy, low-cost way for investors of these investment companies to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAs for ETH\u2019s spot price, it has been struggling to break above $2,000 this year. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,843.96. But if the filings are approved by the SEC, it may signal the beginning of the next Ethereum bull run.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nEthereum (ETH) has experienced frequent market corrections due to volatility in the cryptocurrency industry. Elsewhere, Uniswap (UNI) gained attention from investors due to recent price fluctuations and market instability.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has raised over $24 million in its private/seed sale, demonstrating its efficacy and 100x growth potential. Analysts predict that VC Spectra (SPCT), with a 37.5% gain from its Stage 1 public presale, is poised for greater profitability compared to Ethereum (ETH) and Uniswap (UNI).\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Yet To Surpass Its Resistance Level\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) experienced a decrease of 0.89% on July 31, 2023. The price moved from $1,884.14 to $1,857.99, in 24 hours. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) trading volume too experienced a significant decline of 72.21%, reaching a value of $5 billion.\n\nThe current Ethereum (ETH) volatility is at its lowest point in two years, prompting inquiries regarding the implications of stability on the broader cryptocurrency market. Moreover, despite numerous efforts, Ethereum (ETH) still needs to reach the significant resistance level of $2,000, suggesting a limited demand.\n\nFurthermore, amidst the ongoing recovery efforts, there has been a significant influx of ETH into centralized exchanges. This influx may lead to additional challenges for the Ethereum network. ETH inflows commenced on July 22, 2023, and have continued with subsequent occurrences, including the most recent on July 31, 2023.\n\nAnalysts predict that Ethereum (ETH) will remain resilient in the upcoming months and could reach a value of $1,981 by the conclusion of 2023.\n\nUniswap (UNI) Price Bounces Back: Will the Uptick Last?\n\nUniswap (UNI) gained attention due to its recent price movements. The price fluctuated since reaching its peak value of $44.97 on May 3, 2021. However, from June 20, 2023, Uniswap\u2019s (UNI) price has consistently increased without any signs of decline.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, Uniswap\u2019s (UNI) price was $6.50, increasing by 1.2% from its 24-hour high of $6.42. The trading volume is $144.8 million, reflecting a 24-hour increase of 21.75%.\n\nUniswap (UNI) has recently shown a bullish price action, significantly improving its social performance. However, Uniswap v3\u2019s performance declined despite the increase in Uniswap\u2019s (UNI) price. Following a peak in mid-July, Uniswap v3 volume experienced a decline in both ETH and OP.\n\nAnalysts predict that Uniswap\u2019s (UNI) price will range from $6.15 to $6.98, with an average of $6.41 for the year.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Represents a Major Milestone In Blockchain Investment\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund that utilizes advanced technology to facilitate financial growth. The platform leverages AI, advanced systematic and algorithmic trading methods, and strategic collaborations with management teams to optimize profitability and minimize risks.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) offers users various benefits, including quarterly dividends, buybacks, exclusive access to pre-ICOs, early-stage blockchain ventures, and diversified portfolios.\n\nVC Spectra native token SPCT follows the BRC-20 standard on the BTC blockchain. Furthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) token enables efficient asset management, decentralized trading, and seamless exchanges. SPCT is a deflationary token with a burn mechanism that decreases token circulation over time.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) launched Stage 2 of its public presale on July 19, 2023, with the token priced at $0.011. Investors gained 37.5% ROI from Stage 1\u2019s price of $0.008.\n\nStage 3 is expected to introduce a revised price of $0.025, representing a substantial 127% increase. Early adopters of VC Spectra (SPCT) can expect a projected return of 627% when it reaches the target price of $0.08. Investing now will also provide a 25% bonus on deposit.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "content": "As it continues to grow, liquid staking brings considerable risks to the space and needs better decentralization, according to a report published by digital asset firm HashKey Capital.\n\nAccording to the report, the overall liquid staking derivatives (LSD) market has surged to more than $22 billion in total value locked in 2023. In addition, the market capitalization of LSD projects has reached $18 billion.\n\nOverview of the liquid staking derivatives market in 2023. Source: HaskKey Capital\n\nWhile the growth of LSD protocols may be good for their respective communities and tokenholders, it also could be a double-edged sword. According to the report, it could harm the Ethereum ecosystem in various ways.\n\nAs the table above shows, many LSD protocols rely on a small number of node operators that centralize a large number of validator nodes. According to the report, the number of node operators should be a \u201cpoint of concern for centralization.\u201d\n\nRelated: Liquid staking claims top spot in DeFi: Binance report\n\nThe report notes that centralization in liquid staking can have several harmful effects on the ecosystem, such as reduced competition and increased risk of censorship. According to the report:\n\n\u201cThere is a heightened possibility of censorship with centralized staking players, as they may be subject to incentives or regulatory pressure to censor transactions. This can potentially result in a disruption of the trust within the network.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as it gets further centralized, there are risks of decreased security, as big staking players can make it easier for attackers to carry out 51% attacks. Moreover, there\u2019s also an increased risk of collusion.\n\n\u201cCentralized stakers can collude to carry out actions that go against the decentralization ethos and against the users, such as malevolent MEV extraction and frontrunning,\u201d the report reads.\n\nWhile there are centralization risks, HashKey also recognizes that most protocols are very recent and have made plans to decentralize and add distributed validator technology to their protocols for better decentralization and resiliency.\n\nMagazine: SEC reviews Ripple ruling, US bill seeks control over DeFi, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest, July 16-22"

        "content": "The crypto market started the early hours of August in red, following the significant downtrend in July. Amid this sell-off, the ETH sellers tried to take advantage by breaking below the support trendline of the megaphone pattern. However, by the day\u2019s end, the buyers stepped in and pushed the price higher evidenced by the daily candle printed on August 1st. Will this fake breakdown bolster buyers for a bullish recovery?\n\nAlso Read: After Bitcoin, Financial Giants Rush to Apply for Ethereum Futures ETFs\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe megaphone pattern is characterized by two diverging trend lines that produce progressive higher swing and violate market sentiment.\n\nBy the press time, the Ethereum price trades at $1845, with an intraday of 1.02%.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.93 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nFor the past two weeks, the Ethereum price has wavered sideways above the support trendline of the megaphone pattern. Amid the pattern formation, the coin price action resonates between two diverging trendlines until it gives a significant breakout from either one.\n\nThus, a retest to the support trendline was expected to provide strong support, but the observed long consolidation indicates the bulls need to build enough momentum. Having said that, the long-tail rejection candle in August indicates the buyers still defending the bottom support, preserving the potential of a bullish reversal.\n\nIf the buying pressure rises, an upside breakout from the immediate resistance will offer buyers a higher footing to kickstart a new recovery within the megaphone pattern. The potential upswing could lead to a rally to $2140.\n\nIs Ethereum Poised for Extended Correction?\n\nIn case the overhead supply pressure persists, the ETH sellers may give another attempt to break down the lower trendline. For better confirmation, the potential short-sellers must wait for a daily candle closing below the trendline. The possible breakdown will prolong the correction fall to $1800.\n\nMoving average convergence divergence: A narrow spread between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) slope near the midline indicates a neutral sentiment in the market.\n\nSuper Trend: the green film projected in the daily chart reflects the short-term trend that remains bullish."

Grayscale\u2019s Ether ETF will invest in futures contracts that are set to be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe SEC filing notes that Grayscale\u2019s fund will primarily invest \u201cfront-month\u201d Ether futures, which are contracts with \u201cthe shortest time to maturity.\u201d Grayscale added that it intends to \u201croll\u201d Ether futures contracts before they expire.\n\nVolatility Shares also outlined plans to list an Ether futures ETF, investing its assets in cash-settled contracts referencing ETH trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

        "content": "Ethereum price is leading the volatile stint in altcoins, trading 1.3% down to $1,837. The most prominent smart contracts token, with $222 billion of market capitalization and $6.8 billion in the 24-hour trading volume, briefly dipped below support at $1,830, touched lows of $1,825 before recovering to $1,835 at the time of writing on Thursday.\n\nEthereum Reveals 20% Inverse H&S Pattern Breakout\n\nEthereum price since mid-June is stuck in a narrow range, with movement on the upside barely touching $2,000, while the situation around the critical support at $1,800 seems to get dire for the bulls.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf a rebound above $1,900 does not follow swiftly, selling pressure will likely increase as more traders evaluate their positions. It is worth pointing out that Ethereum price is now trading below two crucial moving averages, starting with the 50-day EMA (red) and the 100-day EMA (blue).\n\nBased on the prevailing technical picture tapping insights from other technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has since the beginning of July sustained a downtrend to the oversold region, and the sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a knee-jerk bullish reaction is highly unlikely.\n\nThat said, investors may want to start acclimatizing to Ethereum plunging below $1,800 and possibly revisiting support at the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,785 before considering a trend reversal to $2,000.\n\nIf push comes to shove, declines may stretch to $1,600 allowing sidelined investors to get a lower-priced exposure to ETH, subsequently building the momentum for a larger trend reversal.\n\nA deeper analysis of the daily chart reveals an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. It is a bullish reversal pattern that signals the end of a downtrend and the start of an uptrend.\n\nThe H&S consists of three troughs, with the middle one being the lowest and the other two being roughly equal in height. The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above the neckline, which is a resistance level connecting the highs of the two shoulders at $2,000.\n\nTraders should consider keenly following this pattern to identify a potential change in trend direction and enter long positions when the price confirms the breakout beyond the $2,000 level. The target price is usually calculated by adding the height of the pattern to the neckline, for instance, 19.30% to $2,412.\n\nPropping Ethereum for a rally in the near future is the gradual increase in its DeFi total value locked (TVM), as shown by data from Coinglass. The value of all the crypto assets locked in Ethereum-based smart contracts has since mid-Jun has been rising following a longstanding downtrend from mid-April.\n\nThis increase in the TVL means Ethereum supply on exchanges is shrinking, thus reducing the potential selling pressure\u2014and creating a suitable environment for a rally.\n\nRelated Articles"

These degens as they\u2019re known in crypto poured millions into tokens, with a coin called BALD taking center stage.\n\nTraders reportedly turned a few hundred dollars in initial punts into millions overnight. Indeed, BALD\u2019s market cap peaked at nearly $90 million on Sunday from a $50,000 token market cap two days prior.\n\nBALD\u2019s ascent was shortlived as its price tumbled toward zero after the developer withdrew over $12 million in liquidity. The rug pull \u2013 the term used to describe when a token deployer withdraws liquidity after prices have increased, leaving users unable to liquidate their coins \u2013 splashed across Base\u2019s ecosystem with several of these memecoins rugging would-be early investors.\n\nDecentralized exchange LeetSwap also paused operations after multiple exploits on liquidity pools. The team has since recovered over 400 ETH, per LeetSwap Twitter updates."

Crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), prices remained under pressure after Binance ended the zero-fee trading for all trading pairs except TrueUSD (TUSD) in March end.\n\nBinance Seeks to Improve Market Shares With FDUSD\n\nBinance adds Bitcoin and Ethereum with FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs and introduces zero-fee trading for BTC/FDUSD trading pair, according to an announcement on August 3.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUsers will enjoy zero maker and taker fees for BTC/FDUSD spot and margin under the Zero Fee Bitcoin Trading Program from 08:00 UTC on August 4. In addition, users can trade ETH/FDUSD with zero maker fee, with standard taker fee applicable as per user\u2019s VIP level.\n\nThe trading volume on the BTC/FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs is excluded from the VIP tier volume calculation and all Liquidity Providers program. Thus, providing users with a better trading experience.\n\nBinance ended its zero-fee Bitcoin trading program and BUSD zero-maker fee promotion in March and switch from BUSD to low-market cap TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin. The exchange removed Tether (USDT) from zero-fee trading program, causing Binance\u2019s market share to drop more than 50% and trading volumes to drop significantly.\n\nRecently, CoinGape Media reported that Binance\u2019s market share has dropped to a one-year low, dropping to 53.7% amid regulatory heat and low trading volumes.\n\nRead More: Reports Of US DOJ Fraud Charges On Binance Resurface\n\nIs this Bullish for Crypto Market?\n\nFirst Digital USD (FDUSD) is backed by Hong Kong-based custodian and trust company First Digital. FDUSD\u2019s market cap of $257 million is still low compared to other stablecoins like USDT, TUSD, BUSD, and USTC. Thus, it will not have much impact on the crypto market now, but minting new FDUSD amid demand from Binance can cause a significant boost in market cap.\n\nBinance remains the top exchange for Bitcoin trading. BTC/TUSD and BTC/USDT on Binance are the most traded pairs, accounting for 14.80% and 6.88% trading volume.\n\nAlso Read:"

On July 27, 2023, the court granted the regulatory agency\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAttorney Rispoli Says ETH Has No Protection As Non-Security\n\nReacting to the development, Attorney Rispoli said that although the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to dismiss, it confirmed that ETH does not have any protection as a non-security.\n\nBREAKING!

Ripple lawsuit. As reported, Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not in and of itself a security.\n\nRipple Labs described the ruling as a resounding win for the company and the entire crypto industry. The blockchain company said the case has always been about getting clarity regarding the regulatory status of XRP.\n\nWhile the SEC labeled XRP as a security, Ripple argued otherwise, thus prompting the judge to comment on the coin\u2019s legal status.\n\nInterestingly, the judge agreed with Ripple that XRP itself is not a security. The judge clarified that selling the coin as part of an investment contract does not automatically make it a security.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the ruling has established a legal precedent for the crypto industry. The crypto advocacy group said the verdict distinguishes between an investment contract and the underlying asset."

While its price faces significant resistance at $1,900, ETH remains a profitable investment for many holders, on-chain data shows.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to a recent tweet from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, 64% of current ETH holders hold at a profit. Above 50%, this showed that most ETH holders are currently experiencing a gain in the value of their holdings.\n\n63.9% of ETH holders are currently in profit.\n\nThe bubbles below show important potential resistance/support levels for $ETH. smaller bubbles are easier to surpass when price starts moving. pic.twitter.com/guf4n5PKKH \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 31, 2023\n\nETH bag-holders have a reason to smile\n\nDespite the coin\u2019s sideways movements, transactions involving ETH have mostly returned profits, data from Santiment revealed. A look at the ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss confirmed this.\n\nThis metric shows the ratio between transaction volume in profit and transaction volume in loss. When it returns a positive value, profit-taking transactions exceed loss-taking ones. Conversely, when the metric is negative, it suggests that losses overwhelm profits during a specified time frame.\n\nOn a 30-day moving average, ETH\u2019s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss has remained positive.

According to the data provider, \u201cEthereum\u2019s market price has gained +4.9% against Bitcoin over the past month, and rebounding network growth has had a lot to do with this.\u201d\n\nTo end July\u2019s trading session, ETH recorded a two-week high of 450,000 daily active address count during the intraday trading session on 31 July. On the same day, over 80,000 new addresses were created to trade the altcoin. This represented the highest daily count in the last ten days, data from Santiment revealed."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nAs many as six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) for ether (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). First off the block on July 28 was the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF. That filing was quickly followed by five other applications: the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF all were submitted to the SEC by August 1. Grayscale currently operates the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) with just more than $3 billion in assets under management. It\u2019s suffered from a long period of trading at a substantial discount to net asset value \u2013 41.5% as of yesterday.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer that\u2019s amassed a giant bitcoin stash in recent years, filed to raise up to $750 million in share sales, with plans to use the proceeds to in part buy more bitcoin. The news came just after the company announced its second quarter results late Tuesday afternoon. Including some small bitcoin purchases made last month, MicroStrategy\u2019s holdings as of July 31 amounted to 152,800 tokens worth about $4.5 billion at current prices. The news seemingly gave a lift to bitcoin, which quickly rose about 3% and briefly breached $30,000. The price has since pulled back to the current $29,500.\n\nBinance counts China as its largest market, followed by South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and the British Virgin Islands, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that despite the ban on crypto within China, teams from Binance regularly collaborate with Chinese law enforcement to detect potential criminal activity. It also has 900,000 active users in-country, according to the report. A spokesperson for the exchange did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. Data from the Journal shows that China is a $80.6 billion futures market and a $9.4 billion spot market for Binance. Second place South Korea provides $56.9 billion in futures volume and $1.39 billion in spot volume, and fifth place British Virgin Islands is responsible for $12.82 billion in spot volume and $5 billion in futures volume.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows the number of addresses with a non-zero bitcoin balance has increased to a new record high of 47.9 million.\n\nPer Glassnode, it's a sign of continued bitcoin adoption.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

        "title": "Future of Finance: Arthur Breitman of Tezos on how blockchains \u2018can improve financial infrastructure\u2019 to help create \u2018a wider array of businesses\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Welcome to the Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their jobs, how their firm fits into the crypto ecosystem, and what it all means for how we use money.\n\nTezos, an open-source blockchain launched in 2018 as an alternative to Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains, uses a governance system to enable those who own its tokens to vote on the future of the blockchain. This move, it argues, makes it less susceptible to forks that have affected other protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nArthur Breitman cofounded Tezos with his wife, Kathleen Breitman, in 2014. Since officially launching its blockchain in 2018, Tezos has become one of the most popular networks in the crypto space.\n\nArthur Breitman spoke to Fortune about the increased presence of traditional financial firms in crypto, the pitfalls of Ethereum and Bitcoin, and the blockchain\u2019s future.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nCan you tell me about your background?\n\nMy background is in computer science and applied mathematics. I worked for many years in quantitative finance but also a bit in robotics. I got super interested in the solution of new technologies around blockchains, ways to make them better, smart contracts, proof of stake. There lacked a formal governance process in blockchains that would allow them to incorporate those innovations while remaining decentralized. And so that got me into the rabbit hole of thinking about governance on blockchains. Tezos is an incarnation of that: It\u2019s a blockchain that essentially has a governance mechanism that lets participants in the network vote and accept or reject or proposed amendments, which improves the blockchain overall.\n\nWhat do you think has changed the most in crypto over the past 10 years?\n\nThe ecosystem has become a lot less ideological over time. It started by being strongly about world affairs, and ideology, and ideas, and it\u2019s evolved way way out of that. I think we should get back to that because that\u2019s the real value prop. The reason that decentralized blockchains exist is they solve a social problem, they solve an institutional problem. And we\u2019ve seen an explosion of solutions that attempt to solve noninstitutional problems, but I think those are overhyped and will fade over time.\n\nDo you think that the entry of traditional financial firms could be a positive, bringing more people or investments into crypto?\n\nI don\u2019t see it as the primary driver of growth. It\u2019s a driver. Fundamentally, where these systems shine is in providing alternative institutions. I think they are more about disruptive innovation than they are about incremental innovation. If you\u2019re a big institution, and you\u2019re trusted by your customers, you\u2019re well established, you know, yes, I would say blockchains can solve some problems for you. But if you\u2019re not established, and you don\u2019t have the trust of your customers, then being able to create systems that do not rely on that trust is very interesting. So for large financial institutions, I think it boils down sometimes more to efficiency or distribution. But if you really want to see where those networks shine, it\u2019s going to be with players who are not established.\n\nHow did your background in finance influence your work on Tezos?\n\nAs a quant I would say that I have some skills in financial engineering and an understanding of microeconomics. When we look at the systems, you see a lot of people who are ignoring basic financial principles. You can see this with Terra Luna, for example. If you have a background in financial engineering, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious why this thing was going to collapse. But you know, for some reason, we saw even people from traditional finance get fooled by this, and it\u2019s very bizarre.\n\nIt helped me avoid a lot of basic mistakes that people are making in the space because sometimes they don\u2019t have the background to understand how financial systems can work. I\u2019m not talking about existing financial infrastructure. I\u2019m talking about general principles, you know, \u201cWhat is an asset?\u201d \u201cHow do cash flows work?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s an interest rate?\u201d\u2014very basic financial principles. Designing a blockchain is a very multidisciplinary thing. You need to understand cryptography, you need to understand distributed systems, but you also need to understand finance and economics, and a lot of people do not.\n\nIt seems like sort of a recurring issue, this lack of understanding of basic economic principles. Do you do find that\u2019s been the case with some of the disasters that we\u2019ve seen in crypto over the past few years?\n\nI think some people want to turn a blind eye to it, because I remember\u2014you know, the idea behind Terra Luna is not new. The idea started with a project called Basis, and I remember being emailed by a venture fund asking me to do due diligence on the project, and I told them exactly why it would collapse, and they still invested anyway. So, you know, I think there\u2019s also some cynicism in the industry that is unhealthy.\n\nI read an interview recently where you mentioned how Bitcoin was stuck in the past because of technological limitations that Tezos isn\u2019t affected by. You\u2019ve also criticized Ethereum for dragging its feet on proof of stake. Could you tell me a little bit more about how Tezos has an advantage over the two biggest players in crypto?\n\nThe technology on Tezos is superior to the one that is on Ethereum\u2014it\u2019s faster, it\u2019s more scalable, it\u2019s more robust\u2014so there\u2019s many advantages. Obviously, there\u2019s other considerations, and both Bitcoin and Ethereum are much bigger than Tezos in terms of brand perception and market reach, and obviously those things matter. But purely on a technical perspective, Tezos has an existing static advantage over Ethereum, but it\u2019s also a dynamic advantage because there\u2019s a culture of innovation in the Tezos space that\u2019s been bolstered by the governance model. As a result, Tezos has had 14 successful upgrades, each by votes of the community. You might think of governance initially as just something about safety, but it turns into a powerful engine for innovation.\n\nWhy do you think Bitcoin is stuck in the past as you have said in a previous interview?\n\nBitcoin, I think, understood very early on that if you\u2019re willing to fork willy-nilly to implement innovation, you risk being captured\u2014you risk social capture of the protocol. And to avoid that, they created these very strong cultural norms against ever changing Bitcoin. They\u2019ve succeeded at that, they\u2019ve gained a lot of stability from that, and there\u2019s absolutely value in stability and predictability. But the tradeoff that they made is that Bitcoin basically doesn\u2019t move anymore.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of applications that people have found very, very useful on other blockchains, such as having marketplaces for collectibles, that you cannot build on Bitcoin. Bitcoin also doesn\u2019t have a good story for how to preserve its security as the reward dwindles. Bitcoin wants to maintain a 21 million Bitcoin cap. Unfortunately, without a block reward, you don\u2019t really have a good way to incentivize miners, and as the block reward goes down so does the security budget of Bitcoin. So there\u2019s a lot of real issues, and there\u2019s a refusal to tackle them inside the Bitcoin community.\n\nWhy is improving throughput important for Tezos?\n\nNo blockchain has really scaled, and there are use cases which really depend on a very large amount of throughput. We haven\u2019t really been able to see them, because we don\u2019t have the technology, and when I say \u201cwe\u201d I mean the industry in general. There hasn\u2019t been the ability to support these use cases.\n\nThe other thing is, Tezos has had some success having much lower fees than Ethereum, but a question that often comes up is, \u201cWell, if Tezos has a lot of adoption, what will happen to the fees?\u201d And so even if you have low fees, people may be reluctant in using your network because they say, \u201cWell, you may have low fees now, but if and when you have more success then your fees will go up, and as a result I don\u2019t want to deploy my application here. I may as well use an incumbent, which has high fees now, because I can\u2019t avoid the high fees in the long run.\u201d\n\nRight now, it costs pennies to do a transaction on Tezos and actually $2 to do a transaction on Ethereum, so it\u2019s already cheaper by orders of magnitude. So it\u2019s not about being even cheaper. It\u2019s more about being able to say that it\u2019s going to stay cheap.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of finance?\n\nI think we\u2019re very limited in the assets that are traded today on markets. We have public markets for public equities, which are fairly large and liquid for developed countries. And then if say you want to invest in a smaller country today, you look at an ETF of a developing country and inside you\u2019ll find a bank, a big family-owned conglomerate, and a mining company. It doesn\u2019t really reflect the economy. There is a very long tail of businesses that are very hard to invest in. There\u2019s a very long tail of alternative assets that don\u2019t really have liquid markets. And sometimes it\u2019s for good reason. A reason it can be hard to invest in a smaller business sometimes is that for external investors you need to have a certain amount of transparency and adequate overhead that smaller businesses can\u2019t afford.\n\nSometimes it has to do with the financial infrastructure being immature, and to the extent blockchains can improve financial infrastructure I think we can have a wider array of businesses. It\u2019s also possible, for businesses that run more of their operation on a chain, bringing transparency and making it easier for them to have external investors, because all of a sudden their accounting is more transparent, because all of a sudden external investors can see their ledger.\n\nWe\u2019ll also, I think, see a more global financial system, one that\u2019s not necessarily as focused on developed markets. Like I said, there\u2019s a lot of interesting assets outside of developed markets."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday after Fitch's action. The global rating agency downgraded the US long-term ratings to AA+ from AAA. This downgrade comes at a time when companies are reporting relatively positive earnings.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained as much as 3 per cent to regain the 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading higher as it gained more than 2 per cent and it climbed above the $1,850-levels. Altcoins were trading mostly up.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged above $29,000 in the past 24 hours . This rise could be attributed to MicroStrategy's decision to sell $750 million in stocks and utilize the funds to acquire more bitcoin. Another potential factor could be the recent downgrade of the US dollar by Fitch, indicating concerns about debt and fiscal deterioration, said Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Interestingly, this situation stands in stark contrast to the reaction seen in 2012 when companies reacted nervously to S&P's downgrade of US debt. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the Litecoin hardening event. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading within a range of $1,800 to $1,900 for the past week and is currently trading around $1,867,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged Tether, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Polygon surged about 4 per cent while Litecoin and BNB gained 3 per cent each. Cardano, XRP, Dogecoil and Polkadot were trading 2 per cent up each during the early day.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it jumped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 32 per cent to $39.93 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has reversed its bearish momentum after hitting a low of $28,500 overnight. It is currently trading near $30,000 which is an important resistance level to flip for bullish price action. BTC dominance has hit 50% again indicating that Bitcoin will lead the market in terms of volatility and movement in the near term.\n\n\n\nChart-BTC\n\n\n\nBTC is currently consolidating in the $28,500 - $31,500 range which will intersect a long-term support line at the bottom mid-month. Price is likely to revisit these lows to test as support. Its14-day RSI (at 46) indicates a neutral sentiment. If BTC breaches $30,400 after testing support, momentum will likely lead the asset to its $31,500 resistance.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $28,800, $28,200\n\nResistance: $30,400, $31,500\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "MIT's Project Hamilton for CBDC open sources smart contract research - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "This week MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative (MIT DCI) released the source code of research into smart contracts for central bank digital currency (CBDC) \u2013 PArSEC (Parallelized Architecture for Scalably Executing smart Contracts). Given the solution is designed for central banks, it is a centralized offering and sidesteps using blockchain, although it supports Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThe work is part of Project Hamilton, an initiative in conjunction with the Boston Federal Reserve and the source code is released under the umbrella of openCBDC.\n\nIt claims to have sufficient scale for most potential central bank applications, although it is very much a research project rather than pilot or production ready.\n\nSupported use cases\n\nThe aim of the research was to explore more advanced use cases for CBDC beyond payments. This might include automated market makers (AMM) that can enable FX transactions 24/7 for cross border payments. BIS Project Mariana is exploring AMMs. MIT mentions the potential for trading bonds, tokenized securities and repurchase agreements (repos) using AMMs.\n\nAnother potential use case is to support cross border interoperability. It\u2019s possible to run separate virtual machines so that central banks and private companies can operate in separate underlying systems. This is not dissimilar to the BIS concept of the Unified Ledger.\n\nPArSEC achieves scalability\n\nMIT claims PArSEC supports a peak throughput of 118,000 transactions per second (TPS) for Ethereum-style ERC-20 transactions with an average transaction time of less than 1.6 seconds. To put that in context, a permissioned Ethereum blockchain processes around 400 TPS.\n\nScalability achieved partly by running operations in parallel and using a database rather than a blockchain.\n\nWe had some questions on the topic of scalability. Conceptually with a token based on an ERC-20 smart contract, that smart contract knows every token holder. Imagine a large country such as India where most of the population have CBDC. We wondered about the scalability of a smart contract with hundreds of millions or billions of account holders, even if it\u2019s using a database.\n\nThe PArSEC project also made some important assumptions. For example, the paper assumes \u201ccorrect smart contract execution does not require execution of smart contracts in a linear order; state must simply reflect an ordered execution, and contracts should not interfere with each other.\u201d\n\nIn the real world explicit ordering can be important, particularly for trading securities or FX, where people compete for the optimal price.\n\nUTXO versus account based\n\nThe other research modules of Project Hamilton adopted variations of Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO model partly for efficiency and also in order to preserve privacy. In contrast PArSEC uses an account-based approach for smart contracts.\n\nUTXO works similarly to cash \u2013 when you hand over a note you get some change, and the coins you receive don\u2019t particularly link you to all your other transactions. This contrasts with an account approach \u2013 if you know the identity of someone\u2019s account, you might be able to see all their transactions, so a central bank could take a look.\n\nReading this paper, one could mistakenly arrive at the conclusion that you cannot have smart contracts using UTXO. In fact R3\u2019s Corda enterprise blockchain uses UTXO and so does DAML\u2019s Canton and both have smart contracts. On the other hand, if you want to support Ethereum smart contracts without altering them, an account-based approach is necessary."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission declared HEX and two other crypto projects led by Richard Heart as unregistered securities in a lawsuit.\n\nHeart allegedly raised $1 billion from HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX since 2019, per the SEC\u2019s claims in an Eastern District of New York court.\n\nThe token is now delisted on Uniswap\u2019s front-end interface, though the token is still tradeable on crypto\u2019s largest decentralized exchange.\n\nRichard Heart\u2019s HEX token is now delisted on leading decentralized exchange HEX days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that the token is an unregistered security in a lawsuit filed on July 31.\n\nThe move does not mean that Uniswap users cannot trade the token. Rather, the crypto is removed from Uniswap\u2019s front-end user interface and appears with a warning note. Traders can still swap HEX on the DEX by directly calling up the token\u2019s smart contract.\n\nUniswap added HEX to its list of unsupported tokens found here. Cryptos in this list include coins delisted based on legal consideration and tokens that have proven to be scams or violate trademarks.\n\nSEC Sues Richard Heart\u2019s HEX And Pulse Projects\n\nOn July 31, the SEC sued Richard Heart whose government name is Richard Schueler. Heart was accused of raising at least $1 billion since 2019 from three crypto projects \u2013 HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PLSX).\n\nThe complaint filed at a District Court in Eastern New York also named Uniswap as a trading venue for Heart\u2019s tokens. According to the lawsuit, PulseX was launched as a Uniswap fork, and transactions of unregistered securities issued by Heart occurred on the DEX.\n\nVenue is proper in this District because many of the crypto asset transactions described herein took place on Uniswap, a so-called decentralized crypto asset trading platform whose developers are headquartered in Brooklyn.\n\nIncluded in the lawsuit are claims that Heart funneled cash invested in his crypto offerings toward funding a lavish personal lifestyle, thus defrauding investors of their money. The SEC has several cases against crypto founders including Alex Mashinsky, Changpeng Zhao, and Do Kwon."

It has its digital currency called Ether (ETH) and serves as a foundation for various other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it enables the execution of decentralized smart contracts.\n\nVitalik Buterin outlined the concept of Ethereum in a whitepaper published in 2013. To fund the project, Buterin, and the co-founders organized a public crowd sale in 2014, during which they raised $18.3 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThe initial price of Ethereum during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, and more than 60 million Ether were sold. Considering the current price of Ethereum, this translates to an impressive annualized return on investment (ROI) of over 270%, nearly quadrupling the initial investment each year since the summer of 2014."

        "content": "Empower Oversight, a watchdog group, has released a new batch of documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request yesterday, sparking outrage in the XRP community. The documents reveal a deeper involvement of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and his company, Consensys, in the controversial June 14, 2018, cryptocurrency speech by former SEC Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman.\n\nAccording to the documents released on August 3, 2023, \u201cJoseph Lubin and his company, Consensys, played a much more central role than previously known in driving then-SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman\u2019s thinking and goals with his controversial June 14, 2018, cryptocurrency speech.\u201d This speech has been a point of contention in the Ripple case, especially as the SEC has since claimed that other similar cryptocurrencies, including XRP, were unregistered securities.\n\n\ud83e\uddf51. The @SECgov has now turned over 324 pages of new documents in response to our crypto conflicts FOIA requests. https://t.co/Axzz0cFyJF \u2014 Empower Oversight (@EMPOWR_us) August 3, 2023\n\n\n\nThe documents also reveal that \u201cLubin also appears to have been responsible for bringing Hinman and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin together as the speech drafting advanced.\u201d Furthermore, investors and attorneys closely associated with Ethereum \u201cwere prominent on the list\u201d of a March 28, 2018, meeting on a crypto safe harbor proposal.\n\nThe documents also highlight a meeting between Hinman and Simpson Thacher partner Chris Lin, which was contrary to advice on conflicts of interest rules. The SEC Ethics Office had repeatedly warned Hinman since he was receiving millions of dollars in payments from Simpson Thacher while at the SEC.\n\nEmpower Oversight has been at the forefront of the battle for SEC transparency, filing numerous FOIA requests and lawsuits to compel the SEC to release documents related to its decision-making on cryptocurrency issues.\n\nXRP Army Reacts\n\nThe release of these documents has sparked a strong reaction from the XRP community, also known as the \u201cXRP army\u201d, which has been particularly vocal in their criticism of the SEC\u2019s handling of the situation.\n\nFred Rispoli, a lawyer at HODLaw, lauded Empower Oversight\u2019s efforts, tweeting, \u201cGreat job Empower Oversight. SEC never thought these docs would see the light of day\u2026\u201d\n\nDigital Asset Investor.XRP questioned the apparent double standards, tweeting, \u201cWhy was Bill Hinman doing backflips to accommodate Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin while at the same time giving Brad Garlinghouse the run-around with the help of Jay Clayton and even coming back to the SEC after he left to make sure the Ripple lawsuit went through?\u201d\n\nRenowned XRP community member @Leerzeit went a step further, alleging misconduct at the SEC. \u201cYou are asking what the Inspector General did while he was watching Bill Hinman committing serious misconduct? Committing serious misconduct himself. The SEC is a criminal organization. There is just no way around it.\u201d\n\nCrypto Law founder, attorney John Deaton, highlighted the contradiction in Hinman\u2019s deposition during the Ripple lawsuit, where he claimed he had not communicated with anyone outside the SEC about the content of his speech.\n\nDeaton tweeted, \u201cRecall that Hinman said he never communicated with anyone outside the SEC about the content of the June 14 speech. However, the Hinman doc showed that he met with Buterin a week before his speech on cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, these revelations will intensify the ongoing debate about the SEC\u2019s handling of cryptocurrencies and its enforcement decisions. As the battle for transparency continues, the XRP army seemingly remains committed to holding the SEC accountable for its actions.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price was at $0.6577, holding just above the 200 EMA in the 4-hour chart.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TrdingView.com"

        "content": "The birth of Bitcoin gave rise to a new class of digital assets that have been attractive to enterprising individuals. Since the inauguration of Bitcoin, investors have shifted their focus to crypto projects to benefit from capital gains as these projects gain massive popularity for solving issues using the blockchain network. On average, Bitcoin offers an edge against inflation by giving \u2018above-average returns to investors. The cryptocurrency also offers a store of value where investors can temporarily keep their funds as they scout for investing opportunities in other financial markets. Analysts predict that Bitcoin will be 4x, Ethereum will be 6x, but Bitcoin Spark will surge 130x.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions\n\nBitcoin has been the largest cryptocurrency project in terms of market cap for the longest time. To date, it remains the most expensive digital currency. Experts predict that Bitcoin\u2019s value will be 4x, giving investors 400% gains. On the other hand, Ethereum is the largest altcoin ever to exist. The project was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 after he and his team were inspired by the technology powering Bitcoin. Ethereum developers introduced smart contracts to blockchain technology, allowing other developers to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBitcoin Spark Promises to Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are good investment ideas, more gains are usually revealed on incoming projects, start-ups, and ICOs. Investors have shifted their focus to an emerging Bitcoin hard fork project called Bitcoin Spark. Bitcoin Spark is on the verge of debuting with its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) phase 1 set to commence on the 1st of August, 2023. During this first phase, investors will purchase the token at an affordable price of $1.50 for every BTCS token. Additionally, the team will give a 20% bonus for all purchasing orders completed during this ICO phase to reward participants for early participation.\n\nThe launch price of BTCS after the final ICO phase is $10, representing an 800% gain for any purchase made during the first ICO. Bitcoin Spark, therefore, proves to be a better investment deal than Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Spark aims to solve challenges experienced by participants on the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin network has high transaction fees and low speeds. The network can only accommodate seven transactions per second (7 TPS), and gas fees sometimes exceed the transacted amount. The network also needs a smart contract bridge, a deficiency that greatly impairs its scalability. Bitcoin Spark developers are working on a smart contract bridge to allow developers to automate executions on the network.\n\nBitcoin uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism to approve transactions and verify the addition of new blocks to the network. This model requires high-end computers and huge amounts of electricity. Ethereum uses the proof of stake, which has validators instead of miners.\n\nBitcoin Spark is introducing a new consensus technology called the Proof of Process verification method. This process combines Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Participants on Bitcoin Spark\u2019s network can stake BTCS tokens, the ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency, as well as mine it using their electronic devices.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Spark has a low entry barrier for miners. The team is developing software platforms compatible with Linux, Mac, iOS, Windows, and Android. Users will immediately start mining BTCS upon installing the software applications on their respective electronic devices. Bitcoin Spark also has revenue streams that will help the ecosystem grow. Since mining requires less processing power, companies and individuals will pay in BTCS to access the valuable processing power.\n\nAdditionally, advertisers will have a slot on the platform\u2019s mobile application and website where they must pay in BTCS to advertise to Bitcoin Spark users. The ads will be voted in or out through a decentralized framework by Bitcoin Spark\u2019s community members.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark pushes Ethereum and Bitcoin mining models into the gutter - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Mining is a complex process that crypto ecosystems utilize to validate transactions and add new blocks to their respective ledger networks. Mining is closely associated with the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model that cryptographic projects like Bitcoin capitalize on. Other projects, including Ethereum, once validated transactions using the PoW method but later reverted to the proof of stake (PoS) validation method. While PoW and PoS remain the leading consensus mechanisms in the crypto world, a new blockchain tech reform called proof-of-process has emerged through Bitcoin Spark, with the potential to disrupt these two processes.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin Mining are Outdated\n\nBitcoin uses the PoW consensus model to verify transactions on its network. The project involves using sophisticated computers and mining equipment that consume a lot of electrical energy to solve complex mathematical algorithms. In exchange, these computers earn rewards in the form of bitcoin (BTC). The participants who verify these transactions on the network are called miners. The mining process consumes a lot of energy and is typically expensive to set up and maintain the \u2018mines.\u2019\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum uses PoS to validate transactions on its network. Participants lock their Ethereum (ETH) to gain validation rights that yield ETH in return. Ethereum staking may occur in two ways: solo staking and pooled staking. For solo staking, participants need to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH. The other alternative is pooled staking, where investors can stake on large crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBitcoin Spark is revolutionizing Cryptocurrency Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new decentralized project that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the crypto arena. The project is a major Bitcoin hard fork upgrade that solves the major challenges that the Bitcoin network faces. The project uses a proof-of-process (PoP) consensus model to verify transactions and maintain the network\u2019s operations. PoP combines the PoW mining method, the PoS validation method, and a special complex mathematical blueprint that undermines linear rewards in the form of BTCS tokens that are attributed to the computing power of mining devices or staking sizes. BTCS is the native token of Bitcoin Spark\u2019s ecology.\n\nThe blueprint algorithm is designed to maintain a standard in reward distribution for the validators and miners in the ecosystem. This way, there is a fair distribution of BTCS earnings regardless of the staking size or the type of mining device used. The Bitcoin Spark team is developing remote mining programs for Windows, Mac OS, iOS, as well as Android that will allow users to mine in the comfort of their homes.\n\nThe rewards will be calculated from a direct comparison of the stake an individual has locked as well as mining remotely done on the network in various devices of different computing power. In other words, this complex statement translates to: the higher the staking size and the more mining, the more the rewards an individual will get, but in a non-linear way. More rewards will be allocated to more work done by miners than larger stake sizes.\n\nLike the first-generation Bitcoin, Bitcoin Spark has a maximum supply of 21 million, from which 16.45 million have been allocated to mining rewards that will be distributed to users in more than 120 years. The remaining 4.55 million will be the launch supply, where 4 million BTCS have been delegated to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) set to begin on 1st August. During the ICO\u2019s phase 1 duration, Bitcoin Spark will distribute BTCS tokens to interested parties at a discounted price of $1.50. Moreover, each purchase will automatically qualify for a 20% bonus from the team as a token of appreciation to early investors.\n\nOut of the launch supply, 500,000 BTCS tokens have been allocated to liquidity pools and exchanges ahead of the project\u2019s network launch. The remaining 50,000 tokens will be awarded to the team behind the project\u2019s development.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s official launch price is $10. However, enterprising investors can purchase BTCS tokens at a discounted price of as little as $1.50 during the project\u2019s ICO phases. Once the project is fully launched, its tokenomics, utility, and functionalities support a steady price increase that will heavily reward early investors. Can you imagine purchasing Bitcoin at just $1? How much of it would you buy knowing its future prices will hit headlines?\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "HashKey To Initiate Bitcoin And Ethereum Retail Trading In Hong Kong: What's Next? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "HashKey, a prominent Asian cryptocurrency exchange, will soon be offering its retail customers the option to trade in two of the most dominant digital currencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a report.\n\nThis move by HashKey comes after securing crucial regulatory clearances, positioning Hong Kong as a frontrunner in adopting and legitimizing cryptocurrency trading for retail investors.\n\nRegulatory Greenlight Spurs Crypto Trading\n\nHashKey has since been making significant strides forward in the crypto space. The journey began on August 3 when the firm, in tandem with OSL, achieved a milestone by receiving an enhanced license status. This advancement paved the way for exploring a broader spectrum of services.\n\nWith this newly acquired privilege to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum retail trading in Hong Kong, starting from August 28, the exchange is set to embark on a fresh chapter, catering to the retail segment of Hong Kong\u2019s investment community.\n\nThis decision helps local investors using HashKey\u2019s platform to diversify their portfolios, allocating up to 30% of their net assets into the world of digital currencies.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s leap into retail trading is supported by two crucial licenses sanctioned by Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n\nThe first, the Type 1 license, facilitates HashKey to launch a virtual asset trading platform compliant with Hong Kong\u2019s securities regulations.\n\nAccording to the report, the subsequent Type 7 license further empowers the platform to offer automated trading solutions to a broad audience, encompassing institutional and individual traders.\n\nA Prudent Approach To Retail Crypto Trading\n\nHashKey\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Livio Weng, provided further insight into the exchange\u2019s strategy. Focused on serving retail investors\u2019 essentials, HashKey will initially offer trading options for Bitcoin and Ethereum only.\n\nWeng\u2019s rationale lies in the volatility associated with altcoins, emphasizing the need to present investors with tokens that are perceived to have relatively lower risks, especially in uncertain market conditions.\n\nTo diversify its reach and enhance accessibility, Weng disclosed that HashKey is collaborating with approximately 5 local Hong Kong brokerages. This partnership seeks to incorporate the exchange\u2019s crypto trading services within these brokerage platforms, attracting millions of existing stock traders in the region.\n\nTo streamline the trading experience, users can link their bank accounts, facilitating deposits in both Hong Kong and U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, in line with regional policies and the broader crypto stance, HashKey has decided to restrict users from mainland China from accessing its services, aligning with China\u2019s 2021 mandate that banned crypto transactions.\n\nWeng remains optimistic about HashKey\u2019s retail venture. The firm aims to expand its user base from 500,000 to 1 million by the end of the year. According to Weng, if market conditions are favorable, HashKey could cater to 10 million users by 2025.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Why Is ETH so Important in Crypto? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Many cryptocurrencies used in the decentralized financial industry rely on Ethereum as their backbone technology. In addition, Ethereum\u2019s price is no longer strictly following Bitcoin\u2019s but rather is being propelled by its own triggers.\n\nEthereum has been around for 8 years now. However, a lot has transpired in the little period since its debut on July 30, 2015. Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchain platforms, and its native token, a digital currency called Ethereum, has risen to become the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value and trading volume.\n\nETH and its Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum was created as a network for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications using its native currency, ether. Decentralized apps (DApps) like decentralized financial services (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens, or NFTs for short, began to develop and retain value thanks to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s ability to execute smart contracts that fuel them.\n\nWhat are decentralized apps? Decentralized applications (or DApps) are smart contracts designed for persistent usage. In June of 2021, there were over 3,000 DApps running on Ethereum. That\u2019s more than has been deployed on all other blockchain platforms for mainstream use put together. Industry watchdog DappRadar estimated that by 2020, the biggest 10 DApps would have processed over 90% of all blockchain transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price should surge due to the introduction of DeFi. Many cryptocurrencies used in the field of decentralized financial services are based on Ethereum; hence the term \u201cDeFi\u201d has become synonymous with Ethereum. Over 200k ERC tokens are hosted on Ethereum, including some of the top 100 biggest cryptocurrencies. DeFi is a platform that facilitates the exchange of assets, as well as the borrowing and lending of money, between individuals outside of the traditional banking system.\n\nRelationship ETH \u2013 BTC\n\nBoth the whole cryptocurrency market and ether are heavily influenced by the price of bitcoin. When the value of Bitcoin goes up or down, so does the value of ether. Since most DeFi projects are constructed on the Ethereum blockchain, their prices skyrocketed during the dramatic DeFi bubble that swept the market in the summer of 2020. In the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s late-2020 price surge, investors flipped their holdings from BTC to ETH, seeing the latter as a useful complement to Bitcoin as the former had become too \u201cexpensive.\u201d\n\nEther\u2019s price is no longer closely tracking Bitcoin\u2019s, as it is beginning to be influenced by its own factors.\n\nIs There a Difference Between ETH and Ethereum?\n\nEther may be used as a medium of exchange, an investment, or a store of value in the digital currency market. Ether (ETH) is a cryptocurrency that is stored and traded on the blockchain platform Ethereum. In addition to ETH transactions, this network facilitates a wide range of additional uses, as was previously described. The Ethereum network processes and stores the transaction data.\n\nData storage and distributed applications are two more uses for the Ethereum network. Hosting apps on the Ethereum blockchain is an alternative to using a server owned and controlled by a third party, like Google or Amazon, which would give that firm complete access to all of the data. Since there is no overarching administrator, users are free to share and utilize their data as they see fit inside the app.\n\nMethods to Acquire Ether\n\nChoose a crypto exchange or trading platform where you may buy and sell various cryptocurrencies. This is the simplest option if you just care about buying the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether. Expect to pay a charge for processing or exchanging practically wherever you go.\n\nDeposit currency: To buy Ether, you may connect a debit card or bank account to your trading platform or deposit fiat currency like dollars.\n\nWhen you fund your account, you may buy Ether at the market price and invest in other assets. Once the coins have been deposited into your account, you have the option of keeping them, selling them, or exchanging them for other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s important to remember that selling or trading cryptocurrency may subject you to taxation.\n\nEven while the default digital wallet provided by your trading platform is a convenient place to keep your Ether, doing so might be risky. Your coins are at risk if the exchange is hacked. If you don\u2019t intend to sell or trade your coins anytime soon, you may always move them to a different virtual wallet or an offline wallet that isn\u2019t linked to the internet.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum (and ETH) has completely shaken up the cryptocurrency industry with its innovative smart contract framework and its decentralized application platform. Its development and popularity have been spurred, in large part, by its participation in DeFi as well as the huge range of DApps that are hosted on its platform.\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem is constantly expanding, and Ethereum has emerged as a crucial support structure for the development of decentralized financial systems. In addition, the anonymity of transactions and the complete control that users have over their data make Ethereum an excellent and flexible option for the development of digital financial systems."

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark starts at only 1 Dollar, and so did Bitcoin or Ethereum at one point in time - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) echoes the remarkable beginnings of some of the most renowned cryptocurrencies in existence today. As it begins the first steps of the crypto journey through its ICO, BTCS mirrors the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin (BTC) began with humble origins and made Bitcoin millionaires, as did Ethereum too.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin takes credit for pioneering cryptocurrency, and many investors think of BTC whenever there is a mention of cryptocurrency. True to this, many crypto projects revolve around Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure, including wallets, exchanges, and blockchains. The BTC price was $1 in 2011, and a decade later, in 2021, it attained an ATH of $69,000. Bitcoin caps its maximum supply at 21 million, with the current circulating supply of 19 million, making it deflationary. BTC\u2019s price is currently hovering around $29,000 to $ 30,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, started at $1 in 2015. ETH\u2019s price crossed the $10 milestone in March 2016 before achieving its ATH of $4,444 in Nov 2021. As the largest altcoin in existence, its goal is to address the scalability of Bitcoin through dApps and smart contracts. Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the ETH price suffered a battering in 2022.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nWith all the buzz around the highly valuable Bitcoin, what if you could turn back time to when Bitcoin was only 1$? Bitcoin Spark, the revolutionary BTC fork, is giving you this chance by investing in the early stages of its ICO. Bitcoin Spark is a cutting-edge solution to the problems curtailing BTC from achieving the true Satoshi vision. Bitcoin\u2019s mining process is now a reserve of a few, risking detrimental collaborations and breaching decentralization.\n\nBitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d (PoP), a moderated solution to PoS and Bitcoin\u2019s PoW. PoP introduces a combination of PoS and PoW mining power to solve Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive process and staking power. The system evenly distributes rewards by considering staked amounts and the mining power rental while considering the platform\u2019s revenue generation aspect. The system eases the barrier to entry, making it possible for anyone to mine.\n\nBTCS deploys a Bitcoin Spark application for computing power rental and reward distribution purposes. The app operates in a virtual environment, allowing users to rent computation power to those in need and earn rewards. The Bitcoin Spark team hopes to introduce software compatible with Android, Linux, Mac, iOs, and Windows devices. In addition, the computational power on the devices is self-adjusting, thereby ensuring security by limiting individual dominance.\n\nPoP\u2019s transaction validation is a four-layered strategy running on the BTCS application but with separate services. The execution layer algorithmically selects validators, ensuring all miners, regardless of transaction size, get an equal chance.\n\nBitcoin Spark launches ICO phase one at $1.50 on Aug 1. The early adopters will enjoy impressive 20% bonuses and an opportunity for 800% gains when BTCS launches at $10.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a vision for inclusivity and equal growth opportunities, Bitcoin Spark seeks to revolutionize the digital currency concept, offering a promising investment opportunity to seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers. Its one-dollar entry point is a blessing in disguise to the early adopters who understand the hidden crypto gems.\n\nMore on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
