        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Shanghai Upgrade Approaches \u2013 Can ETH Hit a New High in 2023?\n\nEthereum logo. Source: Adobe\n\nAfter hitting its highest level in a little under eight months on Wednesday in the mid-$1,900s, Ether (ETH) is experiencing a modest pullback and was last changing hands in the mid-$1,800s.\n\nOn the day, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the world\u2019s most widely used smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain is down a little over 2%, according to TradingView.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term technical outlook continues to look good. ETH has been finding decent support recently from its 21-Day Moving Average, and all of its other major moving averages are on the rise in consecutive order.\n\nThe fact that ETH is currently finding decent support in the mid-$1,800s has spurred optimism that an extension of gains in the short-term toward the August 2022 highs just above $2,000 remains a strong likelihood.\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not yet in overbought territory, suggesting a reduced risk of near-term profit-taking.\n\nSome analysts and traders have expressed concerns that, in the wake of a series of key upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain on the 12th of April, ETH could experience some short-term selling pressure.\n\nThe so-called \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade will, amongst other things, allow for the withdrawal of staked Ether tokens.\n\nMost analysts view the development as a long-term positive for the network \u2013 it is assumed that more flexible staking withdrawals will eventually attract many more ETH owners into staking their tokens.\n\nBut some think ETH could experience either a \u201csell-the-news\u201d reaction and have warned that there could be short-term price pressures as investors sell ETH tokens that have been stuck in staking contracts for a long time.\n\nETH staking has been active since late-2020 on Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain, before the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s merge to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Can ETH Hit An All-Time High in 2023?\n\nEven if ETH was to experience a post-Shapella upgrade dip, many expect the downside would be short-lived.\n\nETH also saw a strong bounce from its 200DMA last month, a strong medium-term bullish indicator.\n\nThe \u201cgolden cross\u201d (when the 50-Day Moving Average crosses above the 200-Day Moving Average) in early February is another good sign for ETH\u2019s medium-term technical outlook.\n\nMoreover, macro tailwinds, such as expectations that the Fed will be cutting interest rates later this year to stave off a bank crisis and recession, continue to offer crypto markets broad support.\n\nWhile it can certainly be said that ETH has a positive medium-to-long-term outlook, betting on the cryptocurrency to return to all-time highs this year is another thing.\n\nEther hitting fresh all-time highs this year would require it to rally 160% from current levels.\n\nBut this is the crypto market. ETH is already up more than 100% from last year\u2019s lows in the $800s.\n\nAnd between the months of November 2020 and April 2021, Ether gained 600%.\n\nA 160% rally this year should thus by no means be ruled out as a possibility.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nEthereum Alternatives to Consider\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s outlook is strong, investors should nonetheless always be on the lookout to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nOne high-risk-high-reward investment strategy that some investors might want to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of up-start crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold very cheap and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "title": "Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has followed Bitcoin\u2019s lead and has seen a 10.3% price increase over the past seven days. News of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission took the entire market by surprise and also breathed new life into altcoins. For one trader on the decentralized perpetual exchange GMX, however, the news is not really good news, but rather a nightmare.\n\nEthereum Short Seller Getting Rekt?\n\nThe largest short seller on GMX is using 6.64x leverage to short Ether (ETH) at an entry price of $1,703.97. A total of $1.8 million of collateral is at stake for the anonymous trader. At press time, the position was down 77.4% for a total of -$1.416 million.\n\nAs it stands, the trader\u2019s short position of about $12 million in ETH will be liquidated when the Ethereum price reaches $1,945.18. According to a report from Chinese journalist Colin Wu, it could be the owner of rebelvarma.lens.\n\nAs popular analyst An Ape\u2019s Prologue speculates, the ETH short seller could even double down on his bet. As the analyst writes, the consensus assumes that the short position will be liquidated when ETH reaches $1945. However, there are limit orders that could add a total of $149,000 to the trader\u2019s collateral within the $1935 and $1945 price range. If triggered, this could increase the liquidation price to around $1967.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s chart below shows how his liquidation price changes with ETH price swings. Until Ethereum reaches $1935, the liquidation price remains at $1945, but limit orders are triggered when ETH enters the $1935 and $1945 range, increasing the liquidation price to $1967.\n\nIn addition, the analyst notes that the address holds about $224,000 worth of other assets spread across Arbitrum and the Binance Smart Chain: $90,000 in USDT, $51,000 in USDC, $64,000 in WBTC and $21,500 in AAVE.\n\n\u201cWith a history of mitigating liquidation risk by bridging tokens from other chains to Arbitrum for collateral, we\u2019ll probably see a similar strategy if ETH prices increase. The $224k in available assets could be used to top up collateral in this scenario,\u201d the analyst notes.\n\nIf the ETH short seller uses up all of its assets and puts them up as collateral, the maximum liquidation price could rise to around $2,000, representing a further 6.5% price increase from the current price. Hence, Twitter user @apes_prologue concludes:\n\nWhile his position appears risky, the danger of liquidation is not as imminent as popularly believed, as he has mechanisms at his disposal to protect his position. Additionally, it is also possible he could have hedged his position in other markets that we are unaware of.\n\nETH On The Verge Of Breaking Above $2,000?\n\nRumors are circulating in the crypto community that the liquidation of the GMX short-seller could trigger a breakout of ETH above $2,000. The 1-hour chart of Ether shows that the price is currently stuck in the price range between $1,964 and $1,930 for the moment. A breakout to the upside or downside could be decisive for the next move.\n\nA look at the 1-day chart reveals that a breakout above $1,930 does not necessarily mean a follow-through to above $2,000. The 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level is at $1,975, where major resistance is expected. Ethereum bulls can only target the psychologically important $2,000 level if they break out above this price level.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "As Ether staking yields fall, protocols will have to get creative - DLNews",
        "content": "As more Ether gets staked to secure the network, staking yield is falling.\n\nAnnual staking yield, recently at 5%, is estimated to fall to 3% by year\u2019s end. It could later fall below 1%.\n\nStaking protocols will have to find ways to juice yield in order to remain attractive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking gold rush is only two months old. Still, it won\u2019t last forever, and teams running staking protocols are already contemplating a future in which crypto\u2019s safest yield-bearing play becomes boring.\n\nThe issue: The more Ether staked, the lower its annual yield. That drop is already underway.\n\nYields from staking Ether fluctuated between 5% and 6% in the months immediately after Ethereum shipped a major upgrade last September.\n\nSince then, the share of circulating Ether staked jumped from 11% to almost 20%. This month, the yield from its staking has hovered at about 4.5% to 5%.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nTo contribute to the security of Ethereum, users must stake, or lock up, their Ether. Their compensation is a modest and relatively risk-free return, paid in newly issued Ether. Another major upgrade in April, dubbed Shapella, removed what little risk was left, and investors have stampeded to staking protocols, including Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nNOW READ: Demand surge for $16b Ether staking raises \u2018mass slashing\u2019 and code bug risks\n\nSome researchers predict that the majority of Ethereum will eventually be staked. If that were to happen, yields could fall below 1%, according to Mike Silagadze, the founder of staking protocol ether.fi.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to stake for 70 basis points of yield,\u201d he said. That would force protocols to find new ways to juice the returns.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nRestaking\n\nRestaking is the most obvious source of future yields, according to Darren Langley, the CEO of liquid staking protocol Rocket Pool.\n\nRestaking allows users to recommit their staked Ether \u2014 using so-called liquid staking tokens like Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. That technology made its debut last week, when US-based company EigenLayer launched its eponymous restaking protocol.\n\n\u201cThe staking space is ripe with innovation and the Ethereum blockspace ecosystem is constantly evolving,\u201d Langley said. \u201cEigenlayer serves as a prime example of how these advancements can further augment the potential rewards for stakers.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: \u2018Treat restaking like AI\u2019: Ethereum\u2019s emerging trend sparks concerns about network stability\n\nSilagadze agrees.\n\n\u201cIn that [1%] world, what\u2019s going to provide the staking returns?\u201d he said. \u201cI genuinely think restaking is going to be the biggest thing in Ethereum since Ethereum.\u201d\n\nCounterpoint\n\nTo be sure, stakers could still enjoy an attractive annual yield if Ethereum were to go mainstream. That\u2019s because staking rewards also rise along with network activity.\n\n\u201cRewards may start to increase again as network activity picks up, so it\u2019s difficult to predict where ETH staking APYs will end up long term,\u201d said Josh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, which offers a liquid staking service.\n\nIn November, for example, staking yields briefly jumped from 5.5% to 8% as FTX, one of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, imploded, sparking a frenzy of trading.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nThe inverse relationship between staked Ether and its yield was a design compromise between two choices that each have flaws, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wrote last year \u2014 a fixed rate of reward or a fixed total reward.\n\nThe former would have forced Ethereum developers to choose a reward rate, a choice they probably would have bungled, he wrote. Too low, and nobody would stake, leaving Ethereum vulnerable to bad actors; too high, and the blockchain would issue too much Ether, diluting the token\u2019s value over time.\n\n\u2018People would still be happy to stake their ETH. It\u2019s all about that steady and secure income.\u2019\n\nThe latter would also have created an incentive to bully competing stakers into exiting, leaving those who remained to claim a greater share of the pie.\n\nStill, if staking yields do plummet, Ethereum might reach an \u201cequilibrium,\u201d Matt Leisinger, a co-founder of liquid staking company Alluvial, told DL News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if [a falling yield] incentivises folks to un-stake at some point,\u201d he said.\n\nSome who spoke to DL News said that equilibrium is a long way off.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that by the end of this year there will be 25% of all ETH staked; this would equate to a yield of around 3%,\u201d James Butterfill, the head of research at crypto data firm CoinShares, told DL News. \u201cStill attractive, in my view.\u201d\n\nAnd the safety of staking means yields can go very low before investors begin to look elsewhere, according to Langley.\n\n\u201cEthereum staking is considered one of the safest ways to earn rewards, so even if the reward rate drops significantly,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople would still be happy to stake their ETH. It\u2019s all about that steady and secure income.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been corrected to note the head of research at CoinShares is James Butterfill."

        "title": "ETH Validator Limit Increase: How Stakers Stand to Gain From Raised Ethereum Stake Maximum - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum devs proposed validator limit increase From 32 To 2048 ETH\n\nThe modification might simplify the staking infrastructure for large validators and enhance user experience\n\nSome crypto community users claim this could increase network centralization and reduce the validators number\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) development community has made an announcement about validator limit, that could fundamentally change the direction and formation of the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposed adjustment would roughly boost the validator limit 64 times, from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, a 6,300% rise. This choice could alter the staking environment and could have an impact on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder offered the suggestion during a June 15 Ethereum core developer consensus meeting .\n\nThe Situation with Ethereum Staking Right Now\n\nAs of right now, 32 ETH is required to join the Ethereum network as a validator. Within the Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) architecture, it is up to the validators to suggest and validate new blocks. To encourage mass involvement and network decentralization, the sum was purposefully kept low.\n\nIn order to start the validator software, 32 ETH must be staked. Your responsibilities as a validator include managing transactions, storing data, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This increases ETH production as a reward for your contribution and strengthens Ethereum\u2019s security for all users.\n\nAccording to Neuder, a proposed rise will ultimately assist the Ethereum network in improving its efficiency over time. In addition to raising the amount of ETH that must be staked, Neuder also asked for validator incentive auto-compounding.\n\nNeuder also asserted that the present proposal would benefit major node operators, such as exchanges, which currently oversee hundreds of validators, as well as the Ethereum network by increasing network efficiency and allowing validators to increase their income.\n\nWhy Is Staking Significant?\n\nPeople can get paid for actions that help the network reach consensus by staking their ETH. These bonuses are given in exchange for running software that securely combines transactions into new blocks and validates the work of other validators, all of which contribute to the chain\u2019s safety.\n\nThe network becomes more resistant to attacks when more ETH is staked because it would take more ETH to take over the majority of the network. One would need to possess the majority of the validators and, thus, most of the ETH in the system in order to constitute a serious danger.\n\nThis revolutionary proposal to increase the validator limit to 2,048 ETH has broad ramifications. Because of this limit increase, validators will have to stake a lot more ETH to take part in the network\u2019s security and consensus mechanism.\n\nThe suggested modification might alter the balance of power within the Ethereum ecosystem. The number of prospective validators will probably decline as the staking limit rises, leaving only a smaller number of elite individuals who can afford to stake bigger sums of ETH. This change might result in centralization, which would be at odds with the decentralized blockchain movement\u2019s ethos.\n\nOn the plus side, a more stringent staking requirement might result in a safer network. With more money at stake, validators would have greater incentives to perform honorably and protect the network\u2019s integrity.\n\nDue to the higher financial investment, the considerable increase in the staking cap may deter smaller investors from becoming validators. They may decide to join staking pools instead, where numerous investors pool their funds to pass the new threshold.\n\nImpact of the Validator Limit Increase On the ETH Price\n\nPossible Price Increase\n\nEthereum\u2019s price can climb as a result of the validator limit hike. As validators race to amass enough ETH to satisfy the higher staking requirements, demand for Ethereum may rise.\n\nMarket Constancy\n\nAdditionally, the proposal might help maintain market stability. Less ETH would be floating around the market as a result of more ETH being locked up through the staking process, potentially decreasing volatility.\n\nPotentially Negative Effects\n\nIf this choice is viewed as a step toward centralization, the price may be negatively impacted. The decentralized aspect of Ethereum contributes to its popularity. Any move toward centralization would make it less appealing to investors, which might have an adverse effect on the price.\n\nThe plan drew mixed responses from the cryptocurrency community , with some users pointing out that a shift this large in the amount of ETH staked would reduce the number of validators and increase network centralization. Some users scoffed at the suggestion and said it wouldn\u2019t help the network.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 32 ETH cap currently precludes validators from earning interest on any ether deposited beyond this amount. By removing this constraint, Neuder\u2019s amendment could give validators access to a number of benefits. If implemented properly, benefits include streamlining the staking infrastructure for significant validators and improving user experience. However, detractors contend that raising the validator limit would promote network centralization since it might provide powerful entities with an unbalanced power distribution.\n\nThe suggestion by the Ethereum developers to raise the validator limit is a big move that might drastically alter the staking environment and have an impact on Ethereum\u2019s price. Increased security and price stability are two potential advantages, but there are also concerns about centralization and its effects on smaller investors. These challenges will undoubtedly dominate the conversation as the Ethereum community evaluates this idea."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Layer-2 Optimism Has Changed Its Name - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Optimism has unexpectedly changed its official name.\n\nThe team explained its reasoning for coming up with a new name.\n\nSome might find the new name confusing.\n\nIt\u2019s not that often that companies change their names, especially the more established ones.\n\nHowever, Optimism, a prominent Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, has just changed its name. Here\u2019s why.\n\nOptimism\u2019s New Name\n\nOptimism is one of the most well-known Ethereum Layer-2s and crypto projects in general, especially due to its unconventional name.\n\nHowever, Optimism no longer exists. That\u2019s because the team behind the protocol has changed its name.\n\nNow Optimism is known as \u201cOP Mainnet.\u201d The Optimism Foundation explained the change, saying there was a need to distinguish between Optimism\u2019s blockchain and the rest of the organization.\n\n\u201cThis distinction makes clear the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that \u201cOptimism\u201d encompasses. In the Superchain vision, OP Mainnet is one L2 chain among many, communicating seamlessly with other chains like Base, Zora, and others. One super team. One super dream.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s official: the chain formerly known as Optimism is now OP Mainnet!\n\n\n\nThis distinction makes clear the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that \u201cOptimism\u201d encompasses. \u2014 Optimism (\u2728\ud83d\udd34_\ud83d\udd34\u2728) (@optimismFND) June 23, 2023\n\nHowever, the word \u201coptimism\u201d will remain in the Optimism Foundation\u2019s name. But what\u2019s so \u201coptimistic\u201d about Optimism in the first place?\n\nWhat\u2019s So \u201cOptimistic\u201d About Optimism?\n\nThe name \u201cOptimism\u201d is rather a peculiar one, but it\u2019s not without meaning. The whole idea behind the name is based on how the Optimism, now OP Mainnet, protocol works.\n\nOP Mainnet is based on fraud-proof technology. In essence, the OP Mainnet protocol rolls up transactions on Ethereum mainnet, sends them off-chain, and executes them on OP Mainnet layer 2.\n\nHow does Ethereum know that those transactions executed on OP Mainnet are correct? That\u2019s where fraud proofs come in. All transactions on OP Mainnet are, by default \u2013 or in other words, optimistically \u2013 considered valid. If someone detects an invalid transaction, they can post a fraud-proof proving the transaction is fraudulent.\n\nFor this reason, OP Mainnet is also called an \u201coptimistic rollup.\u201d Arbitrum, the most popular Ethereum Layer-2, also uses fraud proofs and is called an \u201coptimistic rollup.\u201d\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSome users might find the new \u201cOP Mainnet\u201d name confusing because \u201cOP\u201d is also the Optimism token\u2019s ticker.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe fact that Optimism changed its name to reflect its values of decentralization and inclusiveness better is a net positive for the whole Ethereum Layer-2 community.\n\nRead more about recent Polygon (MATIC) price action:\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Price Struggles to Hold, Falls More Than Closest Competitors\n\nRead more about Crypto.com obtaining a license in Spain:\n\nCrypto.com Secures License in Spain After Closing U.S. Institutional Service"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Rallies 6% in 7 Days \u2013 How High Can ETH Go in 2023?\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nEthereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain and the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, is in consolidation mode ahead of what has been touted as one of the most important Fed policy announcements in years.\n\nEther was last changing hands just above $1,800, having seen a decent bounce from earlier weekly lows in the $1,720s on Tuesday.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was last up around 6% in the last seven days.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 How the Fed\u2019s Balancing Act Could Impact Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe US central bank is expected to lift interest rates by another 25 bps, taking the federal funds target range to 4.75-5.0%.\n\nHowever, following the collapse of a series of regional US banks earlier this month and amid signs that contagion continues to threaten dozens more, the bank is expected to soften its tone on the outlook for further tightening.\n\nHowever, the Fed faces a balancing act, as, with US inflation still well above their 2.0% target, they won\u2019t want to allow financial conditions to ease too much.\n\nEther could easily drop to fresh weekly lows under $1,700 if the Fed\u2019s message is interpreted as more hawkish than markets had been expecting (i.e. they play down financial stability risks and emphasize the inflation fight isn\u2019t over).\n\nBut should this create further troubles for struggling banks, that could come to crypto\u2019s aid once again, as investors move funds to assets deemed as \u201chedges\u201d to weakness in the traditional financial sector (i.e. gold and blue chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether).\n\nAlternatively, if the Fed comes across as more dovish than markets had been expected, that could trigger broad risk-on, which would likely lift Ether.\n\nETH/USD bulls would be eyeing a test of last August\u2019s pre-\u201cMerge\u201d highs in the $2,030s, a further 12% rally from current levels.\n\nHow High Can Ether (ETH) Go in 2023?\n\nThe emergence of troubles in the US (and global) banking sectors seems to have marked a key shift in the macro narratives driving traditional asset classes and cryptocurrencies that could have a big impact on Ether\u2019s outlook for 2023.\n\nFirstly, if current money market pricing is to be believed, a dovish pivot from the Fed now looks to be just around the corner.\n\nThat means the outlook is tilted towards much easier rather than tighter financial conditions for the remainder of 2023, which has historically been bullish for cryptocurrencies like ETH.\n\nCrypto, led by Bitcoin, also appears to be benefitting from safe-haven flows, with investors seemingly finally starting to view blue-chip cryptos as a viable alternative to the mainstream, fiat-based financial system.\n\nIf contagion in the US banking space continues to spread, that will likely benefit Ether rather than hamper it.\n\nETH/USD strong recent bounce from its 200-Day Moving Average and recent golden cross (ETH\u2019s 50DMA moved above its 200DMA in early February) are both long-term bullish technical signals.\n\nThe pair could well continue to grind higher in the weeks and months ahead, with a push into the upper/mid-$2,000s per token a distinct possibility.\n\nETH Supply Deflation Could Make Up for Weak On-chain Activity\n\nActivity on the Ethereum blockchain, as per on-chain data presented by The Block, is yet to show the kind of pickup that has historically been needed for an ETH bull market to really get going.\n\nThe number of daily active and new addresses and the number of daily transfers continue to languish within bear market ranges.\n\nIf Ether is to hit new all-time highs, these will likely need to see substantial improvement.\n\nBut ETH could still get a lift from its rising deflation rate, which briefly surpassed 5.0% on an annualized basis a few weeks ago (though it was last around 0.6%).\n\nThe upcoming \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade to the Ethereum network in mid-April is also being touted as a big potential bullish catalyst for ETH.\n\nThe upgrade will allow staked ETH withdrawals for the first time, with greater flexibility expected (in the long run) to attract more investors toward staking their ETH tokens.\n\nThis could reduce the circulating supply of ETH (assuming ETH stakers want to leave their tokens to accrue interest for a prolonged period of time), increasing its scarcity on exchanges and pushing prices higher."

        "content": "Bling Financial makes iOS and Android games that riff on familiar and well-trodden genres and formulas, ranging from the solitaire card game to bubble-popping puzzle games. But there\u2019s a compelling twist in the mix: you can earn small amounts of Bitcoin or Ethereum by playing.\n\nThis feature is not enabled by default when you start playing Bling games like Sweet Bitcoin, Ethereum Blast, or Bitcoin Pop. Luckily, it\u2019s easy to start earning Bling Points while you play levels and watch ads, and then those Points can be converted into BTC or ETH and then deposited into a Coinbase or PayPal account.\n\nWant to earn a little crypto while gaming? Here\u2019s another way to do so.\n\nHow do I turn on crypto earnings?\n\nBy default, Bling\u2019s games just look and play like standard mobile games\u2014albeit ones with a lot of video ads in the mix. To earn cryptocurrency for playing, you\u2019ll need to enable the feature by signing in with an account.\n\nJust tap the \u201cGet Started\u201d button at the top of a Bling app screen and then choose whether to log in with a Google or Facebook account or Apple account if you're using iOS. Tapping the downward-pointing arrow at the bottom also unearths an option to log in with an email address instead. Once logged in, you\u2019ll earn Bling Points that can be redeemed for Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin, a Bling Financial game. Image: Decrypt\n\nWhich games does this work with?\n\nAs of this writing, Bling offers nine mobile games across iOS and Android that offer crypto rewards. The in-game interfaces are largely identical, and they all share the same Bling account so you can earn across games. Here are the games available so far, although this list may change over time:\n\nBitcoin Blast (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Blocks (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Food Fight (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Pop (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Solitaire (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Sudoku (iOS | Android)\n\nEthereum Blast (iOS | Android)\n\nSweet Bitcoin (iOS | Android)\n\nWord Breeze (iOS | Android)\n\nHow do I cash out?\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use the Bling Financial website to cash in your earned points for cryptocurrency and deposit your winnings. Simply click the \u201cCash Out\u201d button in the upper right corner of the Bling website, and then log in with the same account you used in the Bling app.\n\nStory continues\n\nConverting Bling Points to Bitcoin. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling will show you how much you\u2019ve earned. In this example, I have nearly 60,000 Bling points, which equates to 0.00000060 BTC\u2014or just under $0.02 worth of Bitcoin as of this writing.\n\nYou can then choose either Bitcoin or Ethereum, and have the earnings transferred to a Coinbase account\u2014or you can choose U.S. dollars and send that to a PayPal account. After cashing out, you\u2019ll have to wait seven days to do so again."

        "content": "Ethereum Transaction Volume Rivals Visa As Blockchain Transactions Soar\n\nSource: AdobeStock / Kal\u2019v\u0101n\n\nEthereum may be far younger than the traditional payments giants, such as Visa, but it has shown (yet again) that blockchain, in a single decade, developed into a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAs a payment technology, blockchain has grown as much as to rival established players. Recent data from Coingraph has shown that Ethereum, for example, processed $3.01 trillion in transactions, as opposed to Visa, which processed $3.08 trillion.\n\n\n\nIt is a testament to the growth in mainstream adoption of the nascent technology, which is often perceived \u2013 sometimes nearly exclusively \u2013 as a vessel for scammers, drug dealers, and cybercriminals.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest network: its current market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, is $227.8 billion, compared to the 1st-placed Bitcoin\u2019s $538.96 billion and the 3rd-placed Tether\u2019s $82.8 billion.\n\nNotably, as the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain, Ethereum powers numerous financial technology solutions that are looking to disrupt the global, traditional finance market. These solutions include decentralized finance (DeFI), staking, lending, and flash loans, among many others.\n\nIt has grown to become a rich and versatile environment, with plenty of room for further development \u2013 which is another advantage it has over traditional financial layers.\n\nLast year, it was reported that Ethereum processed 4.5 times more transactions than Visa in 2021.\n\nAlso, a report by Ethereum Foundation\u2018s Josh Stark claimed that Ethereum surpassed Visa in trading volume in 2021. \u201cEthereum moved approximately $11.6 trillion USD. That is more than Visa [$10.4 trillion], and more than double Bitcoin,\u201d the report said.\n\nLooking at the latest Ethereum daily transactions, etherscan shows 968,996 on May 28, with the all-time high being 1,932,711 transactions on December 9, 2022.\n\nEthereum 1-year daily transactions chart:\n\nSource: etherscan.io\n\nEthereum Already Entered TradFi\n\nThe popular blockchain is already the network of choice for many established players looking to utilize the novel technology \u2013 and among them, Visa.\n\nBesides just writing about Ethereum\u2019s economics, as reported in mid-May, Visa used Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet to try out transaction-free payments with the help of account abstraction.\n\nIt used a smart contract called Paymaster, allowing the company to take advantage of account abstraction to perform complex tasks on behalf of accounts and manage transaction costs.\n\n\u201cExcited to see Visa deploy our first paymaster smart contract on testnet as we continue to research and experiment with account abstraction and ERC-4337,\u201d Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at Visa, said at the time.\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction without a consensus-layer change, allowing users to bundle and automate transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 lays down interesting future possibilities for improving on-chain user payments experience through a self-custodial smart contract wallet, which can in turn transform the way users engage with digital currencies and digital assets,\u201d Visa said.\n\nVisa first released a proposal that would allow Ethereum users to make automated programmable payments without the involvement of any third party in December last year.\n\nThe company also reiterated its commitment to crypto in March this year, refuting reports that it planned to pause its crypto push due to uncertain market conditions.\n\n\u201cWe continue to partner with crypto companies to improve fiat on and off ramps as well as progress on our product roadmap to build new products that can facilitate stablecoin payments in a secure, compliant, and convenient way,\u201d Sheffield said.\n\nHe added that the previous crypto meltdown did not change their view of digital assets and that \u201c[now] is the time to build!\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing (Monday noon UTC), ETH was trading at $1,898, up 3% in a day and 4.5% in a week.\n\nETH 7-day price chart:\n\nSource: coingecko.com\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Demand for ETH Staking Soars Despite Nearly Month-Long Waiting Period\n\n\u2013 After Eight Years of Dormancy, Long-Forgotten Ethereum ICO Wallet Resurfaces with $15 Million Worth of Funds\n\n\n\n\u2013 Global Payments Giant Visa Experiments with Ethereum\u2019s Goerli Testnet \u2013 Here\u2019s the Latest\n\n\u2013 Mastercard Looking to Make Cryptocurrencies Everyday Way to Pay\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Gas Fees Explained\n\n\u2013 5 Reasons Why Your Business Should Accept Ethereum"

        "content": "What Has Been Happening with Ethereum in 2018?\n\nEthereum has emerged as the second most popular cryptocurrency project after bitcoin, which can be witnessed by the more than USD 50 billion market capitalization of its digital token ether (ETH) and the number of financial institutions and corporations who are running distributed ledger technology trials using the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSource: iStock/znm\n\n2018, however, has so far been a bumpy year for ether holders as the value of Ethereum\u2019s token has dropped substantially in value since mid-January.\n\nPrice Decline After January All-Time High\n\nThe price of ETH hit its all-time high of USD 1,412 on January 14, 2018. Since then, the ETH price has declined substantially \u2013 along with the rest of the crypto asset market \u2013 to currently trade at around USD 500. In March, ETH even was the worst performing digital token among the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nETH price in 2018. Source: Coinmarketcap.com\n\nWhile Ethereum is facing increased competition from other smart contract platforms, such as NEO, Stellar, Cardano, NEM and EOS, which claim to be superior platforms, the price of ether has also suffered due to blockchain startups who have held Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) needing to sell the ether they raised to pay their bills in fiat currency.\n\nTim Enneking, founder and managing director of Crypto Asset Management, told MarketWatch:\n\n\u201cThese companies [that have held ICOs] have expenses in fiat and are having to sell Ether to pay for them. They aren\u2019t great traders and selling it into an already falling market is exasperating the fall.\u201d\n\nBitmain\u2019s New Ethash ASICs Miner\n\nOn April 3, the largest cryptocurrency mining hardware producer Bitmain announced the release of its new Antminer E3 Ethash ASIC Miner. This is the first ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miner that can mine ether and other cryptocurrencies that use the Ethash algorithm. Up until this point, Ethash-based cryptocurrencies have been ASIC-resistant and could only be mined using GPUs (graphics processing units) or CPUs (central processing units).\n\nThe introduction of ASICs mining creates fear of increased centralization, which can be found in the bitcoin and bitcoin cash mining pool distributions. That is why the digital currency project Monero, for example, has announced a hard fork following Bitmain\u2019s release of a Monero ASIC miner to ensure the digital currency remains ASIC-resistant and to maintain a high level of decentralization.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin, however, is not worried about the new ASICs miners potentially threatening the decentralization of \u201chis\u201d network. In a bi-weekly developer meeting, he said: \u201cGetting everybody to upgrade is likely to be fairly chaotic and detract from more important things. So, at this point, I personally lean quite significantly towards no action.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Buterin plans for the network to switch its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake (PoS) in the future, known as the Casper upgrade, which would eventually make all ether hardware mining obsolete.\n\nWhile Buterin is optimistic about switching the Ethereum network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, a report by bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMex suggests that the likelihood of this switch happening is rather small.\n\nIn its report, the BitMex Research team wrote:\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s latest PoS proposal is the best proposal so far [\u2026]. We think [\u2026] it could make a net positive contribution to the security of the system. However, the system remains reliant on PoW mining, at least at the interim stage. [\u2026] Despite the plan to use this proposal as a stepping stone, as part of a gradual shift towards a full PoS system, this could be more difficult to achieve than some in the Ethereum community think.\u201d\n\nLimited Supply\n\nOn April 1, Buterin published a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) which was intended as an April Fool\u2019s \u201cmeta-joke\u201d, but later he said that he believes the idea is \u201cworth considering.\u201d\n\nIn either case, in EIP Buterin stated that he could envision capping the total token supply of ether at around 120 million in the project\u2019s next software update.\n\nMore specifically, he wrote:\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure the economic sustainability of the platform under the widest possible variety of circumstances, and in light of the fact that issuing new coins to proof-of-work miners is no longer an effective way of promoting an egalitarian coin distribution or any other significant policy goal, I propose that we agree on a hard cap for the total quantity of ETH.\u201d\n\nButerin proposes setting the maximum supply ether at 120,204,432, two times the amount of ether sold in the token sale in 2014.\n\nGiven that this proposed change in monetary policy would result in a limited supply that could potentially be met with unlimited demand. Should this proposal be implemented, we can expect to see a rally in the price of ETH."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 ETH Plummets 23%, Is It All Over for Crypto?\n\n\n\nThe crypto markets have been hit with yet another black swan event \u2013 the collapse of one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, FTX.\n\nEthereum, along with the wider crypto markets, has shed a significant percentage of its value over the past few hours as recent events have transpired.\n\nAs rumors started bubbling online about FTX\u2019s potential liquidity problems, market participants have become increasingly spooked, as reflected in the widespread sell-offs. With Ethereum caught in the crosshairs, many participants are wondering whether it\u2019s all over for the crypto space. Read on to find out more.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum has seen a substantial decline in its price over the past 24 hours as spooked investors have been dumping their crypto holdings following the collapse of FTX Exchange.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,162, down 23% on the day, with over $32 billion in trading volume.\n\nEthereum has seen a considerable uptick in its trading volume recently, perhaps due to investors panic-selling their crypto assets in fear of steeper declines.\n\n\n\nETH is now trading below its 36, 50, and 200-day Moving Average, indicating strong selling momentum.\n\n\n\nThe coin seems to be hurtling towards the major support at $1,000, which is a round, psychological level and one that has held well on several occasions before.\n\n\n\nWith the potential Binance acquisition of FTX not yet decided, the general market consensus seems to be that lower prices are coming.\n\nThat said, however, the Relative Strength Index (blue) provides a positive light at the end of the tunnel. It currently sits at 32, which is borderline in the oversold territory. While it\u2019s difficult to say whether the selling is done, for now, there are indications that the worst may be over.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that crypto prices have seen such declines many times before. In 2018, Ethereum rallied to $1,400 and fell back down to $80 in the months that followed. The price of ETH then recovered and hit new all-time highs a few years later, indicating the resilience of the solid projects.\n\n\n\nWhile prices may be falling in the short term, many experts believe that crypto prices will be much higher in the years to come.\n\nCrypto Coins Offering Quicker Profits\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. This means that it requires a significant amount of capital for it to reach higher prices and profits for current investors.\n\nThat\u2019s why many have started looking at alternatives, with presales being a sector that has been doing particularly well over the past year, despite the bear market.\n\n\n\nHere are three new coins that are in presale right now that could post some good returns once they receive their first listings.\n\nDash 2 Trade\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) is a crypto analytics and intelligence platform for traders and investors. Think of it as a Bloomberg Terminal for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nIn just a few weeks, D2T has raised more than $5.7 million, catching the attention of crypto investors around the world.\n\n\n\nWith LBank being its first confirmed exchange listing, D2T has all the fundamentals to see significant gains in the future.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade Now\n\nIMPT\n\nIMPT is a carbon credit marketplace where users can earn and trade NFT-based carbon offsets by shopping with a wide range of eco-friendly retailers.\n\nIMPT\u2019s presale has now raised over $12.5 million making it one of the most popular sales in crypto right now.\n\n\n\nIMPT tokens are currently selling for $0.023, but this will increase and continue to increase in the next stages of the presale.\n\n\n\nVisit IMPT Now\n\nCalvaria\n\nCalvaria (RIA) is a new play-to-earn game that lets players earn and battle with NFT-based collectible cards. What distinguishes it from other blockchain-based games is that users can play it without having to hold any cryptocurrency, something which could serve to make it more accessible to a wider pool of gamers.\n\n\n\nThe presale has raised more than $1.6 million and is about to sell out its fourth stage, with 1 USDT currently buying 40 RIA tokens.\n\n\n\nVisit Calvaria Now"

Source: Adobe\n\nPost-\u201cshapella\u201d upgrade optimism that briefly lifted the Ether (ETH) price to 11-month highs in the mid-$2,150s earlier this month has mostly faded.\n\nEther, the token that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last trading close to $1,900, still up around 4% for the month, but over 11% below earlier monthly peaks.\n\nDespite the fact that the ETH have been taking a breather in the last few weeks, analysts remain optimistic on the cryptocurrency\u2019s medium to long-term prospects.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because macro conditions continue to shift in favor of blue-chip (high market cap, high trust) cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBank crisis concerns continue to bubble with First Republic just taken into FDIC receivership and the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle, while having a little way to go yet, looks to be coming to an end soon.\n\nThat means blue-chip cryptos will likely continue to benefit from 1) safe-haven demand as a \u201calternative\u201d form of money and 2) easing financial conditions (i.e. a lower US dollar and US bond yields).\n\nBut unlike Bitcoin, Ether can also rely on the support of two key deflationary tailwinds that are likely to drive significant price upside in the coming years.\n\nETH\u2019s Supply Deflation Rate Keeps Rising\n\nThe rate at which the Ether supply is deflating continues to trend higher.\n\nOn Thursday, the Annualized EIP-1559 Burn Rate surpassed the ETH Issuance Rate by 1.753%, a week after the deflation rate nearly hit its annual peak a week earlier at 3.933%.\n\nThe net inflation rate has been negative more-or-less every day since the end of January, according to chart data presented by crypto analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nWhen the deflation rate increases, that means that individual ETH tokens are becoming scarcer at a faster rate. Most analysts think this ought to boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s price in the long run.\n\nThe rising deflation rate is linked to a rise in Ethereum network fees.\n\nNetwork fees are split into two components. The first is a base fee that all users must pay to ensure that their transaction is accepted and processed on the blockchain.\n\nThere is then an optional tip that users can pay to have their transaction processed more quickly.\n\nThe Ethereum network automatically calculates the base fee, which rises at times of heavy network traffic.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which was implemented into the Ethereum code in the London hardfork in August 2021, requires that all of these base fees paid by users are then burned, removing the tokens from circulation permanently.\n\nAs a result, when the base gas fee rises, the rate at which Ether is burned also rises.\n\nWhen this burn rate exceeds the ETH Issuance Rate, which is around 0.55%, the ETH supply will decline.\n\nETH is issued to the nodes and stakers that secure the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Supply of Unstaked ETH Tokens is Rapidly Falling\n\nThe (unstaked) ETH price is also likely to benefit from an ongoing, rapid drop in supply as more and more investors stake their ETH tokens to secure yield.\n\nThe recent \u201cshapella\u201d upgrade enabled the withdrawal of unstaked ETH tokens for the first time since staking was introduced to the Beacon chain in December 2020 (at a maximum rate of 50,400 ETH tokens per day).\n\nAs a result of the recently added flexibility to ETH staking, investors have been piling their ETH tokens into the staking contract at a faster rate than the 50,400 ETH token withdrawal limit.\n\nAs per data presented by Glassnode, the number of staked ETH tokens shot to new record highs above 19.5 million on Thursday, up around 1.5 million on the month.\n\nGiven the current ETH supply of around 120.4 million, that means only just over 16% of tokens are currently staked.\n\nThat\u2019s well below other comparative proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchains like Cardano, which normally has a staking participation rate in the 60-70% of supply area.\n\nAs more ETH tokens are locked into the staking contract, where they are stuck behind the 50,400 ETH tokens per day withdrawal limit, the supply of readily available (unstaked) ETH tokens on the market declines, raising scarcity.\n\nTheoretically, this should push up the ETH price.\n\nBoth Deflationary Tailwinds Set to Pick Up\n\nIt would be reasonable to expect that the ETH staking participation rate could rise to the 40-50% in the coming years, meaning tens of millions of (unstaked) ETH tokens being removed from immediately circulating supply.\n\nMeanwhile, history suggests that Ethereum transaction fees and the burn rate could also shoot higher, sending the ETH supply deflation rate sharply higher in the process.\n\nBack in early 2022, high network congestion consistently drove the daily annualized ETH (EIP 1559) burn rate frequently as high as 6.0%.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain was still powered by the much more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism and, as a result of the much higher energy fees and miner rig costs incurred by the miners that powered the network, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate was much higher at around 4.4-4.6% per year.\n\nThat means that Ether\u2019s deflation rate only hit a maximum of around 1.5%.\n\nHowever, if a resurgence in the broader crypto and DeFi market can send the EIP 1559 burn rate back to its early 2022 highs, the new much lower ETH Issuance Rate (in the 0.5-0.6% area) means Ether\u2019s deflation rate could jump to a staggering 5.5%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, eventually, upcoming Ethereum blockchain upgrades (perhaps later this year or in 2024), including the implementation of sharding, should bring down transaction fees as keep this deflation rate in check.\n\nDual inflation tailwinds could well mean that Ether outperforms Bitcoin during the upcoming crypto bull market.\n\nIf Bitcoin is to 5x from current levels to hit $150,000 in the coming years, as many seem to expect, does that mean that Ether could 6x or 7x to rally into the $10,000s?"

        "content": "Top 5 Play-to-Earn Games on Ethereum\n\nSource: Adobe/SYARGEENKA\n\nDespite market volatility, leading play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain games have built communities of players who log on every day to make money playing video games.\n\nRead on to learn about the top play-to-earn games on Ethereum (ETH) by the number of users.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 to improve upon the design and function of the original Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. It established itself as a distributed computing platform that executes smart contracts, which enable parties to transact with each other without the need for a central authority.\n\nAll the transaction records carried out on Ethereum are verifiable, securely distributed across the network, and immutable, making the network safe and transparent for users. Furthermore, the network allows developers to build decentralized applications (dapps), made possible by the network\u2019s scripting language known as Solidity and by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe first dapps, including play-to-earn games, were built on the Ethereum network. Today, Ethereum boasts the largest number of dapps and blockchain games among all blockchain networks.\n\nTop Ethereum games\n\nBelow, you will find the leading play-to-earn games on Ethereum measured by the number of users in the 30 days leading up to the time of writing (note that the data may have changed between then and the time of the publishing).\n\nIt may be a surprise for some that the likes of popular P2E games, such as Decentraland, Axie Infinity, and The Sandbox are not on the list. In the past month, they were not as popular as some of the newer games that have moved up the rankings.\n\nMirandus\n\nMirandus is a Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game set in a player-owned universe. Player-owned means that a participant in the game is able to buy resources such as land, ships, or docks all represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and build on or earn from them.\n\nDuring gameplay, each player is represented by avatars that go on missions to fight against evil characters in the game. These avatars are known as Exemplars and can be purchased in the game\u2019s marketplace. Exemplars come in different forms, and with different functions and varied capabilities. They include elves, dwarfs, orcs, humans, and more, all of which are represented as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs you continue playing the game, you can earn the game\u2019s tokens and take part in its economy. The main token in the Mirandus economy, utilized for transactions within the Gala ecosystem, is GALA, which is currently used in various games created by the gaming company called Gala Games, which owns Miranda. On Mirandus, you can use GALA to purchase Exemplars, land, weapons, and any resource you may require.\n\nAnother token used for in-game purchases in Mirandus is Materium. To earn Materium, you need to have an Exemplar. The more Exemplars you own, the more Materium you earn. You can also get and collect more Materium during each mission you send your Exemplar(s) on.\n\nOver the previous month leading to the time of writing, Mirandus had a total of 4,410 players.\n\nBenji Bananas\n\nBenji Bananas is a game that existed before games started being built on the blockchain. However, with the recent developments, the Benji Banana\u2019s creator, Animoca Brands, is evolving the popular game into a play-to-earn game.\n\nIn the game, players use the main character, Benji to jump from vine to vine and collect bananas, trying not to fall or be hurt by obstacles.\n\nAs part of the transition into a P2E game on the Ethereum blockchain, current Benji Bananas players will be required to purchase \u2018Benji Passes\u2019. These passes are NFTs that would allow players to earn PRIMATE tokens, which can then be exchanged for ApeCoins (APE).\n\nApeCoin\u2019s ERC-20 governance and utility tokens are built on the Ethereum network and have been made famous due to its association with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), one of the biggest NFT collection communities currently in the market.\n\nFor players of Benji Bananas, swinging from one vine to another while collecting rewards carries the promise of earning ApeCoin which can then be used in real life.\n\nBenji Bananas had 1,280 players in the previous month at the time of writing.\n\nIlluvium\n\nIn Illuvium, players explore the fantasy, alien world of Illuvium, a distant planet on which their spaceship crashed.\n\nThe gameplay involves taking up the role of an explorer who goes on quests and fights against monsters and other players. At the same time, you recruit or capture Illuvials, the original inhabitants of Illuvium, and use them to grow your army.\n\nThe Illuvials are mythical-like creatures represented by NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. They have varying rarities, with the rarest being of the highest value. You can also merge three or more Illuvials to create new and rarer versions of the creatures.\n\nThe native token of the game is ILV, which you can earn through contests, tournaments, and by completing quests.\n\nIn the previous month, there were a total of 865 players on Illivium.\n\nMoonCatRescue\n\nSave MoonCats from the Moon and help bring them to the Ethereum blockchain. That is the main objective of the MoonCatRescue game, which was launched in 2017.\n\nInitially, collectors of the MoonCat characters received the characters for free from the MoonCat website. They were only required to pay for gas fees and they wouldn\u2019t know which MoonCat they would receive as they were randomly generated. However, the players paid USD 600,000 in fees on that day alone due to the excitement of \u2018rescuing\u2019 the MoonCats.\n\nFamed as one of the first NFT collections on Ethereum, the MoonCats are currently available on the OpenSea NFT marketplace and the game\u2019s website, where the available MoonCats can be bought and sold in exchange for ETH.\n\nThere were 849 MoonCatRescue players in the previous month at the time of writing.\n\nNFT Worlds\n\nNFT Worlds brings a \u2018multi-metaverse\u2019 and crypto experience to Minecraft through 10,000 3D voxel-based, limitless worlds. This is possible because the project was built on third-party Minecraft servers with Polygon (MATIC), an Ethereum-compatible chain.\n\nThe virtual world allows Minecraft players to own virtual land by buying it off OpenSea, building on it, and earning passive income in the form of the game\u2019s native token WRLD. This is being supported by plans to make it possible for players to \u2018port\u2019 between different worlds/spaces, which would be a lucrative thing for those who have developed their NFT Worlds well. In this way, NFT Worlds helps to bring a virtual economy to the classic Minecraft game.\n\nAt the time of writing, NFT Worlds had a total of 840 players in the previous month.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Top 5 Play-to-Earn Games on WAX\n\n\u2013 Top 5 Play-to-Earn Games on EOS\n\n\n\n\u2013 Top 4 Play-to-Earn Games on Tron\n\n\u2013 Top 3 Play-to-Earn Games on the NEAR Protocol\n\n\n\n\u2013 Top 3 Play-to-Earn Games on Solana\n\n\u2013 Top 5 Play-to-Earn Games on Polygon\n\n\n\n\u2013 How to Play Metaverse Games: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Decentraland\n\n\u2013 Blockchain Games in 2022: Play-to-Earn, Gamification, Interoperability and Major Publishers\n\n\u2013 NFT Play-to-Earn Gaming Most Popular in India, Hong Kong, and UAE, Survey Finds"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Deflation Rate Hits New Yearly Highs \u2013 Here\u2019s Where the ETH Price is Headed Next\n\nEthereum logo. Source: Adobe\n\nThe rate at which the Ether supply is deflating recently reached its highest level of the year. On Wednesday, the Annualized EIP-1559 Burn Rate surpassed the ETH Issuance Rate by 1.425%, the most since a quirk last May where the deflation rate rose above 17% for just one day.\n\nWhen the deflation rate increases, that means that individual ETH tokens are becoming scarcer at a faster rate. Most analysts think this ought to boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s price in the long run.\n\nETH/USD\u2019s near-5.0% drop on Friday, as crypto markets take a knock on concerns about crypto bank Silvergate and reports that Tether committed fraud to maintain access to the global banking system, suggests traders aren\u2019t paying much attention to recent developments in the ETH deflation rate.\n\nIndeed, currently changing hands around $1,570, ETH/USD is now around 10% down versus its recent highs in the mid-$1,700s. While ETH may be down since the start of February, its deflation rate certainly isn\u2019t. Indeed, it seems to be trending higher.\n\nTraders should keep deflation in mind as a potential talking point/narrative that could boost ETH later this year. Other themes that might also boost like Ethereum network upgrades, including the launch of staked ETH withdrawals next month, a potential DeFi resurgence and a potential improvement in the macro backdrop, if a US recession can be avoided and falling inflation gives the US Federal Reserve room to cut rates.\n\nExplainer \u2013 What is Driving Accelerate ETH Deflation?\n\nBefore answering the question as to what is driving the increase in the ETH deflation rate, we need to understand why ETH deflation even happens at all and that requires an understanding of how the Ethereum network fee structure works. Network fees are split into two components. The first is a base fee that all users must pay to ensure that their transaction is accepted and processed on the blockchain.\n\nThere is then an optional tip that users can pay to have their transaction processed more quickly. The Ethereum network automatically calculates the base fee, which rises at times of heavy network traffic. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which was implemented into the Ethereum code in the London hardfork in August 2021, requires that all of these base fees paid by users are then burned, removing the tokens from circulation permanently.\n\nAs a result, when the base gas fee rises, the rate at which Ether is burned also rises. When this burn rate exceeds the ETH Issuance Rate, which is around 0.55%, the ETH supply will decline. ETH is issued to the nodes and stakers that secure the Ethereum network. The below chart shows how Ethereum network (base) gas fees have been gradually rising in recent months.\n\nThe ETH Deflation Rate Could Accelerate Further\n\nHigh network congestion consistently drove the daily annualized ETH (EIP 1559) burn rate as high as 6.0% in early 2022. At the time, the Ethereum blockchain was still powered by the much more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism and, as a result of the much higher energy fees and miner rig costs incurred by the miners that powered the network, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate was much higher at around 4.4-4.6% per year.\n\nThat means that Ether\u2019s deflation rate only hit a maximum of around 1.5%. If a resurgence in the broader crypto and DeFi market can send the EIP 1559 burn rate back to its early 2022 highs, the new much lower ETH Issuance Rate means Ether\u2019s deflation rate could hit a staggering 5.5%.\n\nWhere Next for the ETH Price?\n\nWhile ETH deflation might sound all very exciting, bulls might need to be patient as the near-term outlook for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization looks bumpy. ETH\u2019s latest drop has sent it below an uptrend that had been intact since the start of 2023.\n\nThat potentially bodes poorly for Ether\u2019s near-term price outlook, with a test of February lows in the mid-$1,400s potentially on the cards. Of course, the aggressive rally in US stock markets on Friday, if built upon next week, could prevent further downside in crypto markets. Whatever the case, ETH looks likely to continue bouncing around with its February mid-$1,400s to mid-$1,700s range."

        "title": "Ethereum Constantinople Upgrade: What is it All About? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Constantinople Upgrade: What is it All About?\n\nEther will not be getting a new coin. The upgrade is made up of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals. The upgrade makes miners\u2019 work harder, less profitable, and reduces the influx of new ether. What about the price? The short answer is, nobody knows.\n\nSource: iStock/Nawadoln\n\nUpdated on January 18th: New date for the upgrade is February 27th.\n\nUpdated on January 16th: Ethereum\u2019s developers have decided to postpone the network\u2019s much-anticipated hard fork after a smart contract auditor flagged a potential vulnerability in the upgrade.\n\n____\n\nPopular decentralized application and smart contract platform Ethereum is getting an update (Constantinople) these days, most likely on January 16th. Since the update will not be backwards compatible \u2013 meaning that it is not compatible with previous versions of Ethereum \u2013 it is also known as a hard fork. As for the date, the upgrade will roll out at block height 7,080,000, which will most likely fall on January 16th, and this is the reason why nobody is 100% sure about the date.\n\nAlthough many in the community call this a hard fork due to its backward incompatibility \u2013 whereas a soft fork is an update which is backwards compatible \u2013 this can create confusion, as there is no splitting the Ethereum blockchain into two, the way we are used to imagining when someone mentions hard forks. The project\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin agrees: \u201cIMO the Ethereum community should consider adopting Zcash\u2019s] terminology of calling things like Constantinople \u2018network upgrades\u2019 and reserve \u2018fork\u2019 for splits that leave 2+ viable chains. Too many people asking me lately where they can dump their non-Constantinople coins\u2026\u201d\n\nNo new coin\n\nThis means that Ether will not be getting a new coin. For a split to happen, a sufficient number of miners who disagree with the upgrade are needed, but there is no risk of such a thing happening now. However, there have been a number of malicious actors trying to take advantage of the confusion on Twitter, asking for people to send them their ETH so they can \u201creplace\u201d it with \u201cnew\u201d coins.\n\nTwo alleged \u201chard fork\u201d versions are trying to steal money from users of both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Nowa claims to be forking away from ETH. Ethereum Classic Vision claims to fork away from ETC. These forks are allegedly in response to regularly scheduled network upgrades in both blockchains. Both these forks are scams, and so are the official web wallets that they provide. They attempt to capture private keys. Unsuspecting users may have already lost money using this method.\n\nEthereum node operators and miners will have to update their software ahead of the upgrade. As for anyone else, there\u2019s literally no need to do anything: your ETH holdings will, barring any unforeseen circumstances, stay exactly the same before and after the fork, regardless of where they\u2019re located.\n\nBut what is it about?\n\nThe upgrade is made up of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are documents explaining a new feature or change in Ethereum\u2019s code. Out of those five, four are quite technical and will improve the quality of life, but they\u2019re also not something the average user will notice. The fifth is the only one that will openly affect everyone. Regardless, we will explain all of them in this article.\n\n\u201cWithout getting too technical, the proposed fixes and updates will result in shifting the cost of operations. Currently the \u201cgas\u201d (gas effectively is equivalent to a transaction charge) cost is 35 to make an operation, this will drop down to a cost of 3. In addition, there will be a lowering of cost toward running a node- Block time should stay at about 15 seconds, with transactions per second remaining at a similar average rate. In short, the changes are there to make the cost of running the network cheaper,\u201d according to Piers Courtney, analyst at GlobalBlock, a London based cryptocurrency broker.\n\nEIP 145: Bitwise Shifting Instructions (Efficiency & Speed): EIP 145 will add Bitwise shifting instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The instructions allow for bits of binary information to move to the left and to the right. This improvement means the execution of shifts in smart contracts will be 10x cheaper.\n\nEIP 145 will add Bitwise shifting instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

This reduction enables multiple updates to occur within a transaction more cheaply. EIP 1234: Block Rewards & Difficulty Bomb Delay: EIP 1234 is one of the most highly-discussed Constantinople upgrade. It is comprised of two components: Block Reward Reduction and Difficulty Bomb Delay. Block Reward Reduction (aka the Thirdening) will see the reward for mining go down from 3 ETH to 2 ETH, in an effort to reduce the inflation of Ether in basic supply and demand economics. The Difficulty Bomb is a mechanism that, if activated, would increase the difficulty of mining a new block until it becomes impossible and no new blocks can be mined. This EIP postpones that for another twelve months, at which point it will be voted upon again.\n\nOnly EIP 1234 is obviously important for the average user, especially if they are also a miner. Delaying the Difficulty Bomb is partially due to the shift that Ethereum wants to make from the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to Proof of Stake. The \u201cbomb,\u201d effectively a timer that progressively makes miners\u2019 work harder, reduces the influx of new ether, and also makes mining ETH less lucrative. It is partially designed to chase away PoW miners and welcome the new mentality of staking coins to create new blocks. However, since the Casper protocol, which will make the shift, is not ready yet, the delay keeps the old way of mining still running.\n\nMiners are not necessarily happy\n\nAfter learning what EIP 1234 stands for, it is easy to see why miners are not too happy with it. Peter Pratscher, the CEO of top ether mining pool Ethermine, told CoinDesk, \u201cIn general we are not looking forward to the Ethereum Constantinople upgrade [\u2026] [it] will make mining unprofitable for a lot of miners which will have a negative impact on the security of the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nBut not all is completely lost for miners. Recently, developers from Ethereum\u2019s open-sourced community have tentatively agreed to implement ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining hardware resistance into the project following further testing on the proposed code. Mining using ASIC chips would be blocked with this update dubbed ProgPoW (Programmatic Proof-of-Work) and instead replaced with general purpose, or GPU (graphics processing units) hardware. This would ensure that GPU mining remains competitive.\n\nWhat about the price?\n\nThe short answer is, nobody knows. Markets are unpredictable and previous patterns don\u2019t have to repeat.\n\nThe long answer is that theoretically, reducing the influx of new ether should drive up the price thanks to supply and demand laws. However, history suggests that the price could drop following the hard fork. Still, the coin has been going through difficult times in terms of price throughout 2018, and speculating on the price would be just that \u2013 only speculation.\n\nEther price chart:\n\n\u201cIn the short term, shortly before and during the fork expect to see price volatility pick up although we would expect to see things steady out after there is consensus on the chain. It has been widely reported that this hardfork is expected to relieve some of the tensions that have been building regarding ETH and is likely to be positive for the valuation of Ether in the foreseeable future,\u201d Courtney said.\n\n\u201cThe Constantinople hard fork will be an exciting evolution for the Ethereum community. With the implementation of efficiency, speed, and lower costs, we are moving closer towards the full realization of Ethereum\u2019s potential,\u201d writes Everett Muzzy, Content Marketer at blockchain software technology company ConsenSys."

That means Arbitrum ranks as the seventh highest cashflows generating crypto protocol according to Cryptofees.info.\n\nThe surge in fees generated has come hand in hand with a surge in the number of daily transactions taking place on the protocol of now more than 1 million per day. Indeed, the surge in transactions made headlines recently when Arbitrum transactions managed to exceed Ethereum network transactions on one day earlier this week. At the start of the year, daily Arbitrum transactions were in the 200,000 area.\n\nSource: Arbiscan\n\nDaily Active Addresses, seen as a good proxy for the number of daily active users on the protocol, have also surged to new record highs above 130,000 recently. That\u2019s up from under 50,000 at the start of the year.\n\nSource: Nansen\n\nThe number of unique addresses registered on the protocol continues to post impressive growth, and should soon surpass 3 million.\n\nSource: Arbiscan\n\n\u201cArbitrum is seeing aggressive growth in users/active users/transactions/revenue, led by wider adoption and the scale-up of DeFi and gaming applications on the chain,\u201d commented analysts at Bernstein in a note earlier this week. Bernstein noted impressive growth in a number of Arbitrum-based decentralized exchanges, including GMX.\n\nGMX recently surpassed $100 billion in all-time trading volume, according to DeFi Llama, most of which has taken place on Arbitrum. On Wednesday, daily GMX swap volumes on Arbitrum hit their highest last December at above $23 million.\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\n\nArbitrum has a total trade value locked (TVL) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols of around $3.0 billion, ranking it as the chain with the fourth highest TVL, as per DeFi Llama data. Indeed, Arbitrum, alongside its fellow Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol Optimism, are the only two chains to have recorded impressive growth in TVL over the last month.\n\nAs a result of recent growth, Arbitrum\u2019s market share of all TVL in DeFi protocols has risen to around 3.6%, up from under 2.5% this time last month, and up from only about 1.0% this time last year.\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\n\nHere\u2019s How Arbitrum\u2019s Growth Benefit ETH\n\nThe recent growth and snowballing success of Layer-2 scaling protocols like Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon should all be viewed as bullish for the Ethereum network, and thus ETH. That\u2019s because they fix two of the biggest drawbacks of the Ethereum network, including its low transaction throughput and high network fees.\n\nWhile the Ethereum network only has the capability to process 14 transactions per second, Arbitrum can process around 40,000. Other existing layer-2 scaling solutions can handle similar loads. Ethereum, as stated in the protocol\u2019s roadmap, will undergo a number of upgrades in the coming years, including the implementation of \u201csharding\u201d, which should significantly boost the network\u2019s TPS.\n\nBut there is demand for scalable blockchains right now as crypto\u2019s broader adoption continues to rise. Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solutions can compete with Ethereum\u2019s more centralized but scalable layer-1 competitors (like Solana) to host Decentralized Applications (dApps) and projects, thus keeping these projects within Ethereum\u2019s so-called zone of sovereignty, even if they aren\u2019t building directly on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd transactions on layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum only cost a few cents each, solving another Ethereum network problem that might have encouraged Ethereum users to try out other chains. As of the time of writing this article, average Ethereum network transaction costs are around $2.0 each.\n\nGiven they utilize Ethereum\u2019s underlying consensus layer to settle transactions, when protocols like Arbitrum experience growth, this also contributes directly to Ethereum network growth. So if Ethereum layer-2s are on fire, that can only be a long-term positive for ETH."

        "content": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Arbitrum\n\nSource: Adobe/Djordje\n\nBlockchain networks offer an option of decentralization, transparency, security, and trustless communication to facilitate new Internet-native economies. But many leading blockchains haven\u2019t been able to accommodate their growing number of users. High adoption rates of Layer-1 (L1) chains have typically been followed by increasing transaction fees.\n\nEthereum (ETH), or an L1 chain, is one of the most used blockchains presently, and the network has been struggling to scale because ridiculously high gas fees and slow confirmation times are putting people off.\n\nAs a result, Layer-2 (L2) solutions that are built on top of blockchains to reduce the on-chain burden have emerged for leading blockchains, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum.\n\nRead on to learn more about L2 scaling solutions and how to use Arbitrum to save on Ethereum transaction fees.\n\nWhy do blockchains need Layer-2 solutions?\n\nBlockchains need L2 solutions because they allow for efficient and improved transaction processing. These solutions increase throughput while leveraging the security infrastructure, decentralization, and transparency of the main chain.\n\nLayer-2 solutions are protocols built on top of an existing blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Their goal is to solve the transaction cost, processing speed, and scaling issues that leading chains face.\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen the rapid rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These innovations are onboarding people to the cryptoverse, requiring blockchains to process more and more transactions. However, chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have rather limited throughput, with only 7 and 13 transactions per second (TPS), respectively.\n\nRather than upgrading the blockchain\u2019s protocol directly to increase throughput, we now have solutions built on top of the main infrastructure, taking the processing load off the main blockchain infrastructure. Layer-2 solutions have mostly clustered around Ethereum and Bitcoin, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise as they are the leading crypto networks in the market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s most prominent L2 solutions are the Lightning Network and Blockstream\u2019s Liquid Network, both enabling low-cost, high-speed off-chain BTC transactions.\n\nA number of much-needed off-chain scaling solutions have emerged for Ethereum, which has been suffering from gas fees as high as USD 100 for simple token transfers. Examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starkware.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no individual L2 solution that entirely solves everyone\u2019s needs. Each differs on transaction fees, security, and functionality.\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is one of the most popular Ethereum L2 scaling solutions.\n\nBuilt by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum is designed to increase the speed and scalability of Ethereum smart contracts, with additional privacy features. It allows developers to run Ethereum applications and process transactions on it, without compromising the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nArbitrum is one of a number of L2 protocols addressing some of the pitfalls of current Ethereum-based smart contracts like poor efficiency and high transaction costs, which results in a poor user experience for dapp (decentralized application) users on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nArbitrum adopts a method called transaction rollups. It records batches of transactions on Ethereum and processes them on its L2 sidechain while using Ethereum to ensure correct records. This process removes the computational and storage burden from the Ethereum main chain.\n\nThe three components of Arbitrum include the compiler, validators, and the EthBridge. The compiler compiles several smart contracts into an executable file compatible with running on the Arbitrary Virtual Machine (AVM). Then, validators primarily monitor the state of the AVM and the off-chain processes. Finally, the EthBridge is a decentralized application deployed on the Ethereum main chain that connects Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nThe project has become a favorite among Ethereans because it provides an alternative platform that developers can use to build Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.\n\nArbitrum One \u2013 Arbitrum\u2019s Ethereum mainnet beta \u2013 was rolled out on August 31, 2021, without a token launch or sale. Already, the software is being leveraged by numerous protocols like Chainlink (LINK), Balancer (BAL), and Uniswap (UNI) to increase throughput and lower fees for their users.\n\nHow to use Arbitrum to save on Ethereum gas fees\n\nYou can use Arbitrum to send and receive Ethereum on dapps that support the Arbitrum network.\n\n\n\nTo convert your ETH or Ethereum-based token on the main chain to the Arbitrum layer, you need to set up Arbitrum on a self-custody wallet like MetaMask. Here\u2019s how:\n\nVisit Arbiscan, go to the footer, and click Add Arbitrum Network to add to your Metamask. You can also just add it manually if you have the technical know-how. To send your ETH to the Arbitrum layer, use the Arbitrum Bridge here. When you\u2019re on the Arbitrum Bridge, the site will show you a prompt to connect your MetaMask wallet. If not, connect it manually by opening your MetaMask screen and giving it permission. Input the amount of ETH to bridge to Arbitrum. Click deposit and then proceed to confirm the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain, your funds have been sent over to the Arbitrum Bridge.\n\nArbitrum bridge doesn\u2019t support all Ethereum-based tokens yet. However, there are already a number of applications and platforms that support Arbitrum to enable lower transaction fees for Ethereum users.\n\nWho already supports Arbitrum?\n\nTo enjoy the benefits of the Arbitrum network, you have to use an application that supports the network. The good news is that several popular crypto applications are beginning to support Arbitrum.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the popular applications:\n\nWallets\n\nMetamask\n\nCoinbase Wallet\n\nHuobi Wallet\n\nZapper\n\nZerion\n\nLoopring\n\nCentralized Exchanges\n\nDecentralized Apps\n\nAave\n\nUniswap\n\n1inch\n\nDai\n\nCurve\n\nMakerDAO\n\nSushiswap\n\nWhile Ethereum is being pushed by newer smart contract platforms with higher throughput and enhanced scaling capabilities, L2 solutions could become the savior that helps the leading smart contract platform to retain its market-leading position.\n\n_____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin\u2019s \u2018Endgame\u2019 Roadmap Will \u2018Take Years to Play Out\u2019\n\n\u2013 A Multichain World Is Key to the Success of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Users Flock To Arbitrum In Search of Scalability\n\n\u2013 Watch: Polygon\u2019s Co-founder On \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of Scaling, Ethereum Merge, NFTs, and More"

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: BTC and ETH Poised for 50% Retracement; Brief Market Analysis\n\nIn this update, we will explore the predictions for these two leading cryptocurrencies, as they appear to be positioned for a significant 50% retracement.\n\nWe will discuss a brief analysis of the market conditions surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting key factors that may influence their price movements in the near future.\n\nStay tuned for valuable insights into the potential direction of these digital assets.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is $27,700, and it has experienced a trading volume of $17 billion over the past 24 hours. In this timeframe, Bitcoin has seen a nearly 0.50% increase.\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin holds the top ranking (#1) with a market capitalization of $537,048,136,864.\n\nCurrently, 19,387,487 BTC coins are circulating out of a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin is currently facing significant resistance at the $28,300 level from a technical standpoint. This level is further reinforced by the presence of a \u2018double tap\u2019 pattern observed on the four-hour timeframe.\n\nThe consistent closing of candles below this level indicates a possible exhaustion among buyers, potentially leading to sellers gaining temporary dominance in the market.\n\nTo support this analysis, prominent technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) have been examined.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is positioned around the $27,000 level, while the current market price of Bitcoin is approximately $28,000.\n\nThis significant disparity between the market price and the 50-day EMA suggests an overbought market condition, which could potentially trigger a notable correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf this scenario unfolds and Bitcoin fails to surpass the $28,300 level, investors may be able to engage in short selling below $28,300.\n\nThe initial target for such a move could be a decline to $27,500, followed by a potential further drop to the next support level at $27,000.\n\nConversely, suppose Bitcoin successfully breaks above the $28,300 level and secures a close above it. In that case, investors may consider taking long positions, targeting an initial resistance level of $29,000, with the next resistance likely located near $29,450.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current price of Ethereum (ETH) is $1,893.23, and it has experienced a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. The trading volume during this period reached $7.4 billion.\n\nEthereum is currently ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency according to CoinMarketCap, with a live market capitalization of $227,668,838,442. The circulating supply of ETH coins is 120,254,303.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, Ethereum is displaying robust bullish momentum as it surpasses key resistance levels. It has successfully broken through the resistance at $1,870 and the psychologically significant level at $1,900.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is facing a double-top trend resistance in the range of $1,922 to $1,925. The appearance of an inverted hammer candlestick pattern below the $1,925 level indicates a potential weakening of the bullish strength, suggesting that buyers might be nearing exhaustion.\n\nConsequently, we could anticipate a downward correction in Ethereum\u2019s price below $1,925, potentially reaching the notable support level at $1,885.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nAdditional support may be found around the $1,870 level if the downtrend continues. Furthermore, if the downward trend persists, Ethereum\u2019s price could potentially drop further toward a lower support level of $1,850.\n\nIt is important to note that both the RSI and MACD indicators are currently in the overbought zone, indicating the possibility of a rebound above the $1,870 level.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum successfully breaks through the resistance level at $1,925, it could aim for a higher target, potentially around $1,960 or even higher toward the $1,995 level.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nKeep yourself updated on the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring the handpicked collection of the top 15 most promising digital assets to monitor in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, guaranteeing that you have access to professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and uncover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Will Ethereum Reach Serenity This Year?\n\nEthereum 2.0 will launch by the end of 2020, estimates Andrew Keys, a managing partner at investment firm Darma Capital and one of the first employees at Ethereum application developer ConsenSys. Meanwhile, the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 that will be the base for the multi-client testnet is already out.\n\nSource: iStock/jpgfactory\n\nEthereum\u2019s major network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0 (a.k.a. Serenity), should be rolled out in phases and will bring with it sharding, proof-of-stake (PoS), and a new virtual machine among other things\n\n\u201cProof of Stake Ethereum exists. It\u2019s alive! The roadmap to Serenity is in full effect. 2020 will see Ethereum move stridently beyond Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0, onto Phase 1 and the launch of shard chains. Then, it\u2019s game on,\u201d writes Keys in his blog post.\n\nAs a reminder, the network went through Istanbul as its last upgrade as Ethereum 1.0, with the unplanned addition of the Muir Glacier update. Istanbul itself changed the underlying Ethereum protocol and created new rules to improve the system, with six relevant Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) chosen to be implemented. Ethereum is expected to launch phase zero of Serenity, which will trigger the switch from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, used also by Bitcoin (BTC), to PoS (e.g., used by Tezos). Phase zero will bring forth Beacon Chain, followed by Shard Chains and State Execution in the subsequent phases.\n\nKeys says that Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, already released a block explorer for the Beacon Chain, which currently tracks a testnet version, and the process is rapidly moving towards Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity. \u201cWith the rollout of the Istanbul hard fork, Ethereum is on its way towards 2.0 levels of scalability at layer one,\u201d Keys says.\n\nThat said, though we know that Istanbul was the last step to phase zero, the date for this next phase is not clear and has been postponed from the end of 2019 already, at least according to the roadmap provided by ConsenSys. In October, Buterin said it was months away. In December, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake suggested the fifth anniversary of Ethereum as the date (July of 2020), but the comments were not in favor of that suggestion, with people expecting other details to be worked out before setting a date, and others not wanting to delay the upgrade for an anniversary of any sorts.\n\nNonetheless, while we await the exact date to be set, Eric Conner, a product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis shared that Phase 0 spec v0.10.0 of Ethereum 2.0 has been released.\n\nThe release includes EIP 1564, concerned with reorganization of files/directories, grouping files into fork-based directories. Additional changes include minor optimizations and cleanups, the release states. It adds: \u201cv0.10.0 marks a stable target for Phase 0 for multi-client testnets and security reviews. We expect some revisions in February/March pending the results from each,\u201d writes Danny Ryan, Ethereum 2.0 coordinator.\n\nFurthermore, Ben Edgington, researcher at ConsenSys, said in a note that this release is the basis for both testnets and an audit, while \u201cthe major, breaking, change in v0.10.0 is the long-anticipated update the BLS signature implementation that\u2019s now being standardised.\u201d\n\nEdgington also called Vitalik Butterin\u2019s suggestion for accelerating the transition of the ETH 1.0 chain into the ETH 2.0 chain \u201cthe most potentially impactful proposal of the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThere are a great number of other features that will be introduced or upgraded as phase 0 rolls out. In his latest blog post, Ethereum researcher Carl Beekhuizen explains rewards, punishments, and slashings for validators. Slashing a validator means destroying a portion of their stake if they act provably destructive. Slashing has two purposes, he says: to make it prohibitively expensive to attack Ethereum 2.0, and to stop validators from being lazy by checking that they actually perform their duties. The two major ways a validator can behave slashably maliciously within phase 0 are double voting and surround voting, as described in the original paper by Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith. Additional rules are added in later phases to ensure that validators store and make available the shard data they sign.\n\nOn the other hand, there are tree classes of rewards: whistleblower, proposer, and attester. Finally, there are two common approaches for paying validators in PoS systems: fixed rewards and fixed inflation, says Beekhuizen.\n\n5 design goals for Ethereum 2.0:\n\nDecentralization : to allow for a typical consumer laptop with O(C) resources to process/validate O(1) shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain).\n\n: to allow for a typical consumer laptop with O(C) resources to process/validate O(1) shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain).

USD 143. The price dropped by 1% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 1.5%.\n\nAlso, check out the discussion with Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin on the future of Ethereum with eToro\u2019s Yoni Assia at Ethereal Tel Aviv 2019."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Deflation Rate Keeps Rising \u2013 Here\u2019s What That Means for the ETH Price\n\nEther coin. Source: Adobe\n\nThe annualized daily net inflation rate of the Ether (ETH) supply hit a record low of -2.772% last Tuesday, according to data supplied by crypto analytics firm Glassnode. Ether is the token that power\u2019s the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, which is currently the world\u2019s dominant blockchain in terms of the size of its associated ecosystem of decentralized applications. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEther\u2019s net inflation rate has since risen to around -1% as of Sunday. But there has been a clear trend over the course of the last month. The rate at which the Ether supply is falling, or deflating at, is accelerating. And if current trends activity in the Ethereum network continue, that deflation rate could further accelerate, a trend many analysts think would be bullish for the ETH price.\n\nHow Higher Gas Fees Drive Faster ETH Deflation\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the gas price on the Ethereum network hit a seven-month high of 64 Gwei. 1 Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. The minimum gas fee (denominated in Gwei) that a user needs to pay for a transaction is calculated by multiplying the Gwei Gas Price by the Gas Limit, which is currently 21,000.\n\nThat means that, last Tuesday, when the gas price hit 64 Gwei, users had to pay a minimum of 1,344,000 Gwei, or 0.001344 ETH per transaction. That\u2019s roughly $2.10 based on Ether\u2019s closing price last Tuesday. By Sunday, the gas price had fallen to around 30 Gwei, meaning a transaction fee of 0.00063 ETH, roughly $1.06 based on Sunday\u2019s closing Ether price.\n\nA rising gas price (as represented by a rise in Gwei) is directly related to the rate at which the Ether supply is burned. Before understanding why, we must quickly understand how the Ethereum network fee structure works. Network fees are split into two components. The first is a base fee that all users must pay to ensure that their transaction is accepted and processed on the blockchain.\n\nThere is then an optional tip that users can pay to have their transaction processed more quickly. The Ethereum network automatically calculates the base fee, which rises at times of heavy network traffic. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which was implemented into the Ethereum code in the London hardfork in August 2021, requires that all of these base fees paid by users are then burned, removing the tokens from circulation permanently.\n\nAs a result, when the base gas fee rises, the rate at which Ether is burned also rises. This can be seen in the above chart \u2013 the red bars represent the ETH burn rate as a result of EIP 1559. When this burn rate exceeds the issuance ETH rate, which is around 0.55%, the ETH supply will decline. ETH is issued to the nodes and stakers that secure the Ethereum network.\n\nThe ETH Deflation Rate Could Accelerate Further\n\nThere are signs that activity on the Ethereum network have been rising this year, and this could continue, creating further upwards pressure on gas fees and thus further increasing the ETH burn rate. According to DeFi Llama, the total amount of capital locked within smart contracts on the Ethereum network, or trade value locked (TVL), was last around $54 billion, up from around $35 billion since the start of the year.\n\nThis can be partially explained by the rise in crypto prices. But ETH-denominated TVL is up to around 32.3 million from 31 million at the start of the year. Meanwhile, though the number and volume of ETH transactions on the Ethereum network has been pretty much stagnant over the course of the last year, the number of so-called internal smart contract calls (calls initiated from within an already executed smart contract), have been trending higher in recent months, indicating increasing network smart contract activity.\n\nEther is up around 42% on the year, and if crypto prices continue to rise, Ethereum network activity levels can be expected to continue rising, as investors dive back into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) amid improved market sentiment. High network congestion drove the daily annualized ETH (EIP 1559) burn rate as high as 6.0% in early 2022.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain was still powered by the much more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism and, as a result of the much higher energy fees and miner rig costs incurred by the miners that powered the network, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate was much higher at around 4.4-4.6% per year. That means that Ether\u2019s deflation rate only hit a maximum of around 1.5%.\n\nBut if the EIP 1559 burn rate returns to its early 2022 highs, Ether\u2019s deflation rate could hit a staggering 5.5%. It\u2019s impossible to predict the future path of Ethereum network gas fees and the ETH burn rate. But one thing is for sure, the fact that ETH is a deflationary asset should underpin its price performance in the coming years. With DeFi adoption set to accelerate and the Bitcoin supply still inflating at around 2% per year (until the next halving in around a year and a half), many analysts think ETH has a good chance of catching or even surpassing BTC in terms of market capitalization."

        "content": "Ethereum Surges Above $2,100 Amid Bullish Post-Shapella Upgrade Supply Dynamics \u2013 Where Next for the ETH Price?\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, just surged above $2,100 for the first time since May 2022 amid positive post-Shapella update changes in the ETH supply.\n\nEthereum developers successfully implemented the so-called \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade on Wednesday \u2013 Shapella being an amalgamation of the names of Ethereum\u2019s consensus (Shanghai) and execution (Capella) layers.\n\nAmong other things, the upgrade means that staked ETH and ETH-denominated staking rewards can now be withdrawn from the staking smart contract for the first time since staking was enabled on the Beacon blockchain back in December 2020.\n\nSome analysts had worried that the enabling of withdrawals would lead to a rise in short-term sell pressure in the Ether market, as stakers look to cash in on their accrued yield, as well as ETH price appreciation since December 2020 of around 200%.\n\nHowever, on-chain data reveals that Thursday actually saw a near 100,000 jump in the number of ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain, the largest one-day increase in nearly two months.\n\nThat suggests that rather than a greater proportion of investors withdrawing their staked ETH to cash in, a larger proportion have actually interpreted the successful implementation of the Shapella upgrade as a green light to finally stake their Ether tokens.\n\nWhen more ETH tokens are locked up in staking contracts, this increases the scarcity of unstaked ETH tokens that can be traded across cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThis should arguably boost the ETH price, which appears to have been the case in light of the latest market moves.\n\nUpside in the ETH price is likely also related to relief that there hasn\u2019t been a flood of unstaked ETH entering the market and adding to selling pressure.\n\nETH to Benefit From Deflationary Tailwinds\n\nNow that staking withdrawals have been enabled, more ETH investors are expected to put their tokens into staking contracts to benefit from yield.\n\nInvestors in liquid staking protocols (i.e. buyers of Lido\u2019s stETH token, for example) can expect yields in the 4-5% region, though this will fall as the amount of staked ETH rises.\n\nAs of Thursday, slightly more than 18.25 million ETH tokens are currently locked up in staking.\n\nThat only amounts to just over 15% of the total Ether supply of around 120.4 million.\n\nOther comparable proof-of-stake blockchains like Cardano have significantly higher staking participation rates in the region of 60-70%.\n\nMost analysts expect the Ether staking participation rate to rise towards these levels in the coming years, which, as described above, should lower the supply of circulating ETH (assuming ETH stakers generally leave their ETH in the contract for prolonged periods of time).\n\nThis could arguably be a big, almost deflationary tailwind for the ETH price.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before taking into account that the ETH supply actually is deflationary.\n\nBack in August 2021, an update to the Ethereum blockchain introduced a new ETH burn mechanism \u2013 essentially, after this date, all ETH paid in transaction fees is removed permanently from supply.\n\nThis meant that rather than having a predictable inflation rate of around 4% (this was the annual reward given to miners back when Ethereum was still a proof-of-work blockchain), Ether\u2019s inflation rate become unpredictable.\n\nFor the most part though, this inflation rate remained positive until the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022.\n\nRather than miners being rewarded with around 4% in new tokens each year, ETH stakers are now only rewarded with around 0.55% in new tokens each year.\n\nRising network activity this year, which has been pushing up transaction fees, has also been pushing up the burn rate.\n\nAnd given the ETH issuance rate is so much lower now, it means that the net ETH inflation rate has been consistently negative in recent months.\n\nIt was last around -1.6%, but this could keep going lower if network activity and fees keep rising, which is likely as the crypto bull market matures (which should bring a lot of hype and users back to the Ethereum network).\n\nSimply put, the ETH price is likely to benefit from significant dual deflationary tailwinds in the coming years as 1) more ETH is taken out of supply and put into staking contracts and 2) the ETH supply continues to deflate thanks to token burns.\n\nWhere Next for the ETH Price?\n\nOn-chain network utilization fundamentals still look a little weak despite the returning crypto bull market, with high transaction costs pushing more users towards Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, as well as competitor chains like Solana.\n\nBut deflationary ETH supply tailwinds coupled with optimism that Ethereum continues to make progress towards addressing its scalability issues mean that, on balance, Ethereum network fundamentals should remain supportive of the price for the foreseeable future.\n\nWith macro conditions also improving as US inflation keeps falling and recession risks rise, increasing the likelihood that a Fed rate cutting cycle is nearly here, medium to long-term risks seem strongly tilted in favor of continued ETH price upside in the coming months.\n\nShort-term technicals are certainly also screaming positive.\n\nETH had been finding strong support at its 21-Day Moving Average in recent weeks, which technicians take as a strong vote of confidence by the market in short-term bullish price momentum.\n\nAll of ETH\u2019s major moving averages are moving higher in consecutive order.\n\nThe strong rebound from the 200DMA in mid-March and golden cross (when the 50DMA went above the 200DMA) in early February are also positive medium to long-term technical signs.\n\nWith ETH/USD comfortably above resistance in the form of last August\u2019s highs in the $2,030 area and already in the $2,100s, a melt-up towards the psychologically important $3,000 area in the coming weeks is a possibility."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Annualized Deflation Rate Briefly Surpasses 5% \u2013 Here\u2019s How That Can Impact The ETH Price\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nThe rate at which the Ether (ETH) supply is deflating, which has been accelerating in recent weeks, recently saw a spike higher. Ether is the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain. ETH is the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization and Ethereum is the dominant blockchain in Decentralized Finance.\n\nLast Saturday, the annualized burn rate as a result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 jumped to its highest since last May at 5.679%, outstripping the Ether issuance rate of 0.578% by a whopping 5.101%. The deflation rate has since dropped to around 1.75% as of Wednesday the 15th of March.\n\nCryptocurrency markets saw extreme volatility last weekend and at the beginning of this week amid uncertainty relating to last week\u2019s series of major regional US bank collapses and the policymaker response. Ether was last changing hands on exchanges in the upper-$1,600s, having hit multi-month highs above $1,700 earlier this week.\n\nThe spike in the Ether burn rate came amid a jump in the Ethereum gas price, a fee charged to users of the network, to its highest level since last May. If demand for the Ethereum network continues to rise, causing a rise in network congestion, that will cause further upside in Ethereum gas fees, which will translate to a further acceleration in the cryptocurrency\u2019s rate of deflation. An accelerating deflation rate is likely to be a long-term tailwind for the ETH price.\n\nExplainer \u2013 What is Driving the Accelerating ETH Deflation Rate?\n\nBefore answering the question as to what is driving the increase in the ETH deflation rate, we need to understand why ETH deflation even happens at all and that requires an understanding of how the Ethereum network fee structure works. Network fees are split into two components. The first is a base fee that all users must pay to ensure that their transaction is accepted and processed on the blockchain.\n\nThere is then an optional tip that users can pay to have their transaction processed more quickly. The Ethereum network automatically calculates the base fee, which rises at times of heavy network traffic. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which was implemented into the Ethereum code in the London hardfork in August 2021, requires that all of these base fees paid by users are then burned, removing the tokens from circulation permanently.\n\nAs a result, when the base gas fee rises, the rate at which Ether is burned also rises. When this burn rate exceeds the ETH Issuance Rate, which is around 0.55%, the ETH supply will decline. ETH is issued to the nodes and stakers that secure the Ethereum network."

        "content": "Divergent On-chain Trends Within Ethereum/Bitcoin Network Add to Reasons Why the ETH/BTC Price Might Continue Dropping\n\nBitcoin and Ether. Source: Adobe\n\nThe exchange rate between Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and Ether (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the Ethereum blockchain, has fallen rapidly in recent weeks.\n\nETH/BTC was last changing hands on Binance (as per TradingView) around 0.0625, down around 15% from earlier monthly highs in the 0.0735 area and at its lowest level since July 2022.\n\nETH/BTC\u2019s downside isn\u2019t a result of Ether performing poorly. On the contrary, at current levels in the $1,750s, Ether is up just shy of 10% this month and is up over 27% versus earlier monthly lows under $1,400.\n\nThe problem for Ether is that it, like most other cryptocurrencies, hasn\u2019t been able to keep pace with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been leading a charge higher in cryptocurrency markets amid what analysts have referred to as a \u201csafe haven\u201d bid as cracks form in the global banking system.\n\nFinancial Stability Concerns Disproportionately Benefit Bitcoin\n\nAfter three major regional US banks went under earlier this month, Credit Suisse was bought out by Swiss rival UBS over the weekend. Meanwhile, a consortium of US banks came together last week to provide a $30 billion bailout for US bank First Republic.\n\nDespite efforts from authorities to calm the situation, investors remain on edge that more banks, in the US and elsewhere, might be about to go under. And while this is hampering sentiment in US stock markets, it is helping safe haven assets like gold, and also appears to be helping cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nGold formed the bedrock of most civilizations\u2019 financial systems for thousands of years, hence when troubles in the fiat-based, central bank-centered fractional reserve banking system surface, many investors like to flock back to gold, which many view as the ultimate haven.\n\nBut Bitcoin, which many refer to as \u201cdigital gold\u201d, is increasingly viewed as a safe haven. After all, it is a highly robust, highly decentralized payment system that operates entirely separately from the traditional financial system.\n\nEther can also make the claim to be robust, decentralized, and independent of the traditional financial system. Indeed, given its smart programmability, it arguably goes beyond Bitcoin in that an independent decentralized finance ecosystem can be built directly on top of its blockchain (and already is being built).\n\nBut Ether is only about half the age of Bitcoin. In the eyes of many investors, Bitcoin has more trust, particularly given that its future prospects don\u2019t depend on the efforts of programmers (like the Ethereum Foundation who are still working to upgrade the Ethereum blockchain). Bitcoin is expected to remain pretty much exactly how it is right now, more or less like gold.\n\nEven though the Fed\u2019s rate hiking cycle might not yet be over (they could hike rates by 25 bps this week), markets are already placing bets on the cutting cycle, with many expecting it to come soon amid turbulence in the banking sector. Easing financial conditions could well help lift cryptocurrencies broadly (including Ether), though Bitcoin is likely to maintain its lead on the added safe-haven bid.\n\nBitcoin and Gold. Source: Adobe\n\nOn-chain Trends Favor Further ETH/BTC Downside\n\nJust as investors increasingly turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven, various core on-chain activity metrics are trending higher, showing a growing demand for network utilization. On many of the same metrics, the Ethereum blockchain is showing no such pick-up in activity.\n\nWhile this probably won\u2019t outright prevent Ether from continuing to rally (not if the broader crypto market keeps pumping), it may make it difficult for ETH to keep up with Bitcoin, meaning potential further downside for the ETH/BTC exchange rate.\n\nThe first metric of note is the number of transactions taking place on a daily basis. As can be seen in the below graphs presented by The Block, this metric recently hit its highest level since early 2021 for the Bitcoin network, but remains subdued and within recent levels for the Ethereum network.\n\nMeanwhile, though the rise in the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network in recent weeks hasn\u2019t been quite as impressive, the metric is still close to multi-month highs. The same cannot be said for the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network.\n\nElsewhere, the rate at which new addresses are interacting with the Bitcoin network for the first time has also been trending higher. The same cannot be said for the Ethereum network, with new addresses remaining close to multi-year lows."

        "title": "Mark Cuban Praises Ethereum and Keeps Buying Bitcoin - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Mark Cuban Praises Ethereum and Keeps Buying Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) vs. Ethereum (ETH) debate just became even more complicated thanks to American billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban. He keeps praising ETH as more superior to BTC, but stores much more of his wealth in this most popular cryptocurrency than ETH, aims to buy more BTC, and doesn\u2019t plan to sell it.\n\nMark Cuban. Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, TMZSports\n\nIn March, he said that ETH is \u201cthe closest we have to a true currency,\u201d and now he\u2019s talking about ETH as a store of value alternative as it has \u201ca lot more built-in utility in its organic and native form.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause people are using ETH to buy NFTs, to do more things, and because smart contracts just make it a little bit simpler to do development. And because we\u2019re looking at hopefully a shorter-term evolution to ETH 2.0, [\u2026] I think you\u2019ll see there\u2019s more reason to buy ETH right now beyond just being a store of value \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t exclude, you know, being a store of value to buy ETH,\u201d the Dallas Mavericks owner said during the recent Unchained podcast.\n\nHe added that with Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 1559, \u201ceverything changes and what happens going forward is going to really impact how people perceive it specifically as a store of value.\u201d Once the proof-of-stake is reached, bringing forth a much higher number of transactions per second, there will be a massive change in the environment, he said, resulting in a reason for some to use ETH as a store of value over BTC.\n\n\u201cI think the applications leveraging smart contracts and extensions on Ethereum will dwarf Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be a store of value but because it has to be done using miners, you can\u2019t just switch to proof-of-stake with Bitcoin,\u201d Cuban said.\n\nMeanwhile, any asset that is looking for appreciation has to be sold with narratives, said Cuban. While gold\u2019s narrative has historically been a hedge against inflation, it has never been that hedge, he argued. Gold\u2019s not actually needed, but the narrative that it\u2019s precious helps build its value.\n\n\u201cAnd bitcoin kind of is the same way,\u201d he said. There is no correlation between the actions of the US Federal Reserve and the price of BTC, but it\u2019s a \u201cgreat narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cAll assets could go up in price with inflation, and bitcoin could be one of them [\u2026] but so could the cost of bananas.\u201d\n\nThat said, as a \u201cbitcoin believer as a store of value,\u201d he\u2019ll \u201cmake an exception\u201d \u2013 he plans to buy new BTC, not spend his existing coins, and use that to buy a Tesla.\n\nAlso, recently he said that his crypto portfolio consists of 60% bitcoin, 30% ethereum, and 10% of other cryptoassets.\n\nReserve currency and global tide\n\nMeanwhile, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, argues that BTC has a better chance to become a reserve currency than ETH. Per a Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index April report,\n\n\u201cIt appears the narrative has tilted toward allocating a small portion of assets toward the crypto vs. the risks of missing out on the potential for bitcoin becoming the global benchmark digital asset. Adoption of the benchmark crypto as a global reserve asset has crossed the mainstream threshold, as we see it, and the market tide is rising.\u201d\n\nMcGlone said that BTC is replacing gold suddenly rather than gradually and this process is likely to accelerate, \u201cunderpinning its price for the foreseeable future and magnifying the dollar\u2019s dominance as the reserve currency.\u201d\n\nBitcoin fills the need for a digital reserve-asset in a low-yield world, he said. Companies like Visa, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have \u201cembraced the digitalization of money, buoying the process of bitcoin replacing gold as the global digital-reserve asset,\u201d said the strategist.\n\nMost indicators show a shifting global tide that favors bitcoin as a reserve asset, McGlone concluded.\n\nHowever, despite this tide, ETH keeps outperforming BTC in the crypto market.\n\nAt 15:41 UTC, BTC, with a market capitalization of more than USD 1trn, trades at USD 56,572 and is up by 676% in a year, while ETH (market capitalization \u2013 USD 239bn) trades at USD 1,992 and is up by 1,074%.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Proof-of-Disagreement: Bitcoin\u2019s Work vs. Ethereum\u2019s Planned Staking\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Fight Escalates amid Fresh Capital Entering the Space\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Is Better Than Ethereum At These Four Things\n\n\u2013 Mark Cuban May Be More Involved with Crypto, \u2018Shitcoins\u2019 than First Thought\n\n\u2013 Mark Cuban Says Crypto Is a Store of Value & Redditors Right to \u2018Kick Wall St. Ass\u2019"

Source: Adobe\n\nIn a record week for Ethereum staking, investors moved over 570,000 Ether (ETH) tokens into the blockchain\u2019s staking smart contract last week, according to a Dune analytics dashboard.\n\nThat\u2019s over $1 billion worth of Ether tokens and marked the fastest weekly pace of ETH deposits into the staking contract ever.\n\nAccording to the dashboard, investors requested the withdrawal of around 380,000 ETH tokens last week, worth close to $700 million at current market prices.\n\nThat marks a sharp drop off in the withdrawal requests from the week.\n\nIn the first five days after staked Ether token withdrawals were enabled by the successful implementation of the so-called \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain on the 12 of April, withdrawal requests reached a staggering roughly 1 million ETH tokens.\n\nIndeed, since staked ETH withdrawal requests were enabled just under two weeks ago, withdrawal requests have exceeded new deposits by over 550,000 ETH, worth close to $1 billion at the current market price.\n\nHowever, thanks to a 50,400 per day limit on actual Ether token withdrawals (other ETH withdrawal requests enter a queue) and to the surge in deposits (which enter into the staking contract instantly), the total number of staked ETH tokens has shot up since the implementation of the Shapella upgrade.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the total number of ETH tokens staked was last at 19.227 million, up over 1.1 million since the 11th of April.\n\nAssuming that investors continue to deposit ETH into the staking contract at a faster rate than the 50,400 ETH withdrawal limit, which has largely been the case in the last two weeks, then this number should continue to rise.\n\nIndeed, added flexibility to the ETH staking process, which analysts say drastically reduces investor risk, is expected to entice large sums of ETH into the staking contract in the coming months and years.\n\nRival proof-of-stake layer-1 protocols like Cardano have staking participation rates in the region of 60-70%.\n\nGiven the total ETH supply of 120.4 million, the staked Ether current participation rate is only around 15.9%.\n\nThe limit on daily staked ETH withdrawals might deter some ETH investors given there isn\u2019t total flexibility regarding ETH staking.\n\nBut this participation rate is still expected to rise substantially and could hit the 40-50% at some point.\n\nThat means that there could soon be between 50-60 ETH tokens in the staking contract, a drastic reduction in the readily available supply on unstaked ETH.\n\nThis, alongside Ether\u2019s deflationary tokenomics (thanks to a transaction fee burn mechanism), means that the Ether price looks set to benefit from substantial deflationary tailwinds in the coming years.\n\nWhere Next for the ETH Price?\n\nPost-Shapella upgrade optimism that sent ETH/USD to new 11-month highs in the mid-$2,100s proved short-lived, with ETH having since pulled back to trade more in line with its early April levels in the $1,800-$1,900s.\n\nIndeed, Ether snapped a key short-term uptrend midway through last week, prompting calls for a retest of key downside support levels, such as the resistance-turned-support zone around $1,700.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s strong rebound from its 50-Day Moving Average on Tuesday could be an early sign that the latest short-term market correction is done.\n\nETH/USD saw a similar short-term correction to the 50DMA then recovery to new highs in mid-February.\n\nShort-term bulls may well have their sights set on a retest of annual highs, though major upcoming macro risk events such as this week\u2019s US GDP and inflation reports followed by next week\u2019s Fed meeting, jobs and ISM survey data could throw a spanner in the works, if they deliver a meaningful shift to the macro narrative."

        "content": "Ethereum Shorts Obliterated as ETH Price Crashes Through $2,100 \u2013 Where Next for the ETH Price?\n\nEther (ETH) future short positions have been wiped out on mass in the last two days, as the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization defied the bears and rallied in wake of Wednesday\u2019s highly anticipated series of upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH surged above $2,100 on Friday for the first time since May 2022, taking weekly gain to more than 13%.\n\nThat means Ether is on course for its largest one-week gain in around three months.\n\nAs a result of ETH\u2019s bullish breakout, over $90 million in ETH future short positions have been wiped out in just the last two day, as per data from crypto derivatives analytics website coinglass.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s $62 million wipeout marks the largest short liquidation event in over a month.\n\nThe latest series of Ethereum upgrades implemented on Wednesday, amongst other things, allowed staked ETH tokens to be withdrawn for the first time.\n\nSome analysts and traders had worried that investors might rush to unstake and sell ETH tokens on mass, creating short-term selling pressure that could have weighed on the price.\n\nBut on-chain data, as discussed in an article on Thursday, revealed that the successful implementation of flexible ETH staking actually saw the total number of staked ETH tokens rise on Thursday, rather than decline.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were a total of 18.257 million ETH tokens staked, up from 18.131 million on Monday.\n\nTraders responded by aggressively unwinding bearish bets that the upgrade would trigger short-term sell pressure, sending ETH crashing above $2,100.\n\nAnd the bulls seemingly remain in control. According to separate data presented by coinglass, the funding rate on leveraged ETH futures positions remains positive.\n\nThis means that traders opening leveraged long ETH futures positions are paying funding to those opening leveraged short ETH futures positions, an indication that demand is skewed in favor of long positions.\n\nWhere Next for the ETH Price?\n\nOn-chain network utilization fundamentals still look a little weak despite the returning crypto bull market, with high transaction costs pushing more users towards Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, as well as competitor chains like Solana.\n\nBut deflationary ETH supply tailwinds coupled with optimism that Ethereum continues to make progress towards addressing its scalability issues mean that, on balance, Ethereum network fundamentals should remain supportive of the price for the foreseeable future.\n\nFlexible ETH staking means more investors are expected to lock up their ETH tokens in greater number, taking circulating ETH out of supply (assuming ETH stakers wish to hold their staking positions for the long term).\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s supply inflation rate has been consistently negative in recent months, with the burn rate (essentially all ETH paid in transaction fees is taken out of the supply) having consistently exceeded the issuance of new ETH tokens to stakers.\n\nElsewhere, with macro conditions also improving as US inflation keeps falling and recession risks rise, increasing the likelihood that a Fed rate cutting cycle is nearly here, medium to long-term risks seem strongly tilted in favor of continued ETH price upside in the coming months.\n\nShort-term technicals are certainly also screaming positive.\n\nETH had been finding strong support at its 21-Day Moving Average in recent weeks, which technicians take as a strong vote of confidence by the market in short-term bullish price momentum.\n\nAll of ETH\u2019s major moving averages are moving higher in consecutive order.\n\nThe strong rebound from the 200DMA in mid-March and golden cross (when the 50DMA went above the 200DMA) in early February are also positive medium to long-term technical signs.\n\nWith ETH/USD comfortably above resistance in the form of last August\u2019s highs in the $2,030 area and already in the $2,100s, a melt-up towards the psychologically important $3,000 area in the coming weeks is a possibility."

        "content": "Founder Vitalik Buterin Reveals 5 Features That Excite Him the Most About Ethereum \u2013 The Last One May Surprise You\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, Tech Vision / YouTube\n\nIn his latest blog post, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin discussed \u201cwhat in the Ethereum application ecosystem excites\u201d him, including features related to money, identity, stablecoins, decentralization \u2013 and voting.\n\nHe started by stating that there are very few ideas today that are completely unexplored, which has led to a change in perspective for him: \u201cmy excitement about Ethereum is now no longer based in the potential for undiscovered unknowns, but rather in a few specific categories of applications that are proving themselves already, and are only getting stronger.\u201d\n\n1. Money\n\nIn poorer countries\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency often steps in as a lifeline\u201d in countries where links to global financial systems are limited and extreme inflation is a constant, said Buterin.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s Merge, transactions on the blockchain are included \u201csignificantly more quickly\u201d, and the chain is more stable. This makes accepting transactions after fewer confirmations safer.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin once again expressed his excitement about scaling technology such as optimistic and ZK rollups. Additionally, social recovery and multisig wallets are becoming more practical, he said.\n\n\u201cThese trends will take years to play out as the technology develops, but progress is already being made, said Buterin.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the FTX collapse reminded everyone that \u201ceven the most trustworthy-seeming centralized services may not be trustworthy after all.\u201d\n\nIn wealthy countries\n\nThe more extreme use cases concerning surviving high inflation and basic financial activities do not apply in wealthier countries \u2013 but crypto here has significant value nonetheless. For one, it is \u201cfar more convenient than traditional banking,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nThere is also the notion of crypto as private money in the age of transition to a \u2018cashless society\u2019 \u2013 the transition which is being utilized by governments to increase financial surveillance.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is the only thing currently being developed that can realistically combine the benefits of digitalization with cash-like respect for personal privacy, he said.\u201d\n\nStablecoins\n\nStablecoins were developed due to the volatility of cryptoassets, among other factors, and are popular among the more pragmatic crypto users. However, Buterin argues that,\n\n\u201cThere is a reality that is not congenial to cypherpunk values today: the stablecoins that are most successful today are the centralized ones, mostly USDC, USDT, and BUSD.\u201d\n\nPer Buterin, the stablecoin design space is split into three categories:\n\ncentralized stablecoins (like the ones mentioned above),\n\nDAO-governed real-world-asset backed stablecoins (such as MarkerDAO \u2018s DAI),\n\n\u2018s DAI), and governance-minimized crypto-backed stablecoins (RAI, LUSD).\n\nDecentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-governed real-world assets (RWA)-backed stablecoins, \u201cif they can be made to work well, could be a happy medium,\u201d argued Buterin. They\u2019d combine enough robustness, censorship resistance, scale, and economic practicality to meet the needs of a large number of real-world crypto users.\n\nThat said, making it work would require real-world legal work to develop robust issuers, as well as resilience-oriented DAO governance engineering.\n\n2. Decentralized finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi started \u201chonorable but limited,\u201d and with time it \u201cturned into somewhat of an overcapitalized monster that relied on unsustainable forms of yield farming,\u201d said the Ethereum co-founder. Now, however, it has started \u201csetting down\u201d into a stable medium, with a focus on improving security and on a few applications that are notably valuable.\n\nAnd while decentralized stablecoins \u201care, and probably forever will be,\u201d the most important DeFi product, Buterin noted a few others:\n\nprediction markets: these will likely not make \u201cextreme multibillion-dollar splashes,\u201d but will continue to grow steadily, becoming more useful over time;\n\nother synthetic assets: the stablecoins formula can be replicated to other real-world assets, including major stock indices and real estate;\n\nlayers for efficiently trading between other assets: if there are assets on-chain that people want to use, there will be value in a layer that makes it easy for users to trade between them.\n\n3. The identity ecosystem\n\nWhen we discuss \u201cidentity\u201d, this may include a number of things, such as names, basic authentication, attestations, and proof of personhood.\n\nAn attempt to create a centralized platform to achieve all of \u201cthese tasks from scratch\u201d will not work, argued Buterin, adding:\n\n\u201cWhat more likely will work is an organic approach, with many projects working on specific tasks that are individually valuable, and adding more and more interoperability over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is exactly what has happened,\u201d said Buterin, providing examples of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE), proof of humanity (PoH), proof of attendance protocols (POAPs), and soulbound tokens (SBTs).\n\nEach of these applications are useful individually. But what makes them truly powerful is how well they compose with each other, he wrote.\n\nThat said, there are some issues ahead. Scaling is one, which can be solved \u201cwith rollups and perhaps validiums,\u201d wrote Buterin. But the biggest future challenge for this ecosystem is privacy \u2013 it must be \u201cworked on intentionally for each application.\u201d\n\n4. DAOs\n\nButerin noted a distinction when it comes to the word \u201cdecentralized\u201d, which he said is sometimes used to refer to:\n\na governance structure is decentralized if its decisions depend on decisions taken from a large group of participants,\n\nan implementation of a governance structure is decentralized if it is built on a decentralized structure like a blockchain and is not dependent on any single nation-state legal system.\n\nOne way to think about the distinction is that a decentralized governance structure protects against attackers on the inside, and a decentralized implementation protects against attackers on the outside, he added.\n\nButerin offered three \u201ctheories of decentralization\u201d.\n\nDecentralization for robustness\n\nIf Maker is taken as an example, if there were no safeguards when it comes to the governance in the hands of MKR holders, theoretically someone could buy half the MKR, use it to manipulate the price oracles, and steal a large portion of the collateral, said Buterin.\n\nTo have a decentralized stablecoin work long-term, there needs to be innovation in decentralized governance that does not have these kinds of flaws, he opined, adding that possible directions include:\n\na kind of non-financialized governance, or a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user;\n\nintentional friction, so that certain kinds of decisions can only take effect after a long-enough delay that would allow users to see if something is going wrong and escape the system.\n\nDecentralization for efficiency\n\nA decentralized governance structure is valuable because it can incorporate opinions from diverse voices at different scales, said Buterin, and a decentralized implementation is valuable because it can be more efficient and lower cost than traditional legal-system-based approaches.\n\n\u201cThis implies a different style of decentralization,\u201d he said. While governance decentralized for robustness emphasizes having a large number of decision-makers to ensure alignment with a pre-set goal, intentionally making pivoting difficult, governance decentralized for efficiency keeps the ability to act fast and pivot when needed, \u201cbut tries to move decisions away from the top to avoid the organization becoming a sclerotic bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nDecentralization for interoperability\n\nButerin concluded that it\u2019s both easier and safer for \u201con-chain things to interact with other on-chain things,\u201d than having them interact with off-chain systems that would require a bridge layer \u2013 which could be attacked.\n\nThree \u201ctheories of decentralization\u201d. Source: vitalik.eth.limo\n\n5. Hybrid applications\n\nThis is the final point discussed by Buterin, who opined that many applications are not entirely on-chain, but they still take advantage of blockchains and other systems to improve their trust models.\n\nAs an \u201cexcellent example\u201d he gave voting, which inevitably requires the highest assurances of censorship resistance, auditability, and privacy. Systems like MACI, said he, effectively combine blockchains, ZK-SNARKs, and a limited centralized layer for scalability and coercion resistance.\n\nWhile it will take a long time for countries and voters to get comfortable with the security assurances of electronic voting, whether it\u2019s using blockchain or not, \u201ctechnology like this can be valuable very soon in two other places,\u201d said Buterin. These are:\n\nincreasing the assurance of voting processes that already happen electronically today (eg. social media votes, polls, petitions);\n\ncreating new forms of voting that allow citizens or members of groups to give rapid feedback, and including high assurance into those from the start.\n\nBeyond voting, \u201cthere is an entire field of potential \u201cauditable centralized services\u201d that could be well-served by some form of hybrid off-chain validium architecture,\u201d Buterin argued, such as:\n\nproof of solvency for exchanges;\n\ngovernment registries;\n\ncorporate accounting;\n\ngames;\n\nsupply chain applications;\n\ntracking access authorization.\n\nSource: vitalik.eth.limo\n\nThough many of the mentioned applications are being built as we speak, many also see only limited usage due to the limitations of the current technology: blockchains are not scalable, transactions used to take a long time to get included on the chain reliably, wallet users need to choose between low convenience and low security, as well as \u201cthe specter of privacy issues.\u201d\n\nThat said, \u201cthese are all problems that can be solved, and there is a strong drive to solve them,\u201d while it\u2019s relevant to be intentional about the application ecosystem itself, Buterin concluded.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Co-Founder Makes Big Changes to Roadmap \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Says His Influence Over Ethereum Decreases as Network Nears the Merge\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Has a Layer 3 Vision to Unleash Full Power of Crypto\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Concerned About Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter Plan"

        "title": "3 Ways to Invest in Ethereum Without Buying ETH - Cryptonews",
        "content": "3 Ways to Invest in Ethereum Without Buying ETH\n\nSource: Adobe/sorapop\n\nIf you are interested in adding Ethereum (ETH) exposure to your portfolio but don\u2019t want to deal with the complexities of buying and securely storing ETH coins, there are a handful of alternative investment options for you.\n\nIn this guide, we will examine the growth of Ethereum investment products and list some of the most popular Ethereum-based investment vehicles you could invest in today.\n\nThe Ethereum investment ecosystem is growing\n\nA substantial amount of money has flown into the Ethereum ecosystem in the last twelve months, fuelled by the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), the non-fungible token (NFT) mania, and the crypto bull market of Q1/2021.\n\nHowever, investing in the Ethereum ecosystem can be a steep learning curve. Even for many crypto enthusiasts, purchasing ERC-20 tokens on decentralized trading platforms or yield farming to earn yield in the DeFi market can be challenging.\n\nThe alternative \u2013 for anyone looking to add exposure to the potential future success of Ethereum to their portfolios \u2013 is to buy investment vehicles that provide indirect exposure to the price development of the blockchain\u2019s native coin.\n\nFor retail investors, buying regulated crypto investment products means not having to deal with the technicalities involved in buying and safely storing crypto. Moreover, institutional investors prefer to deal in regulated investment products rather than operate in the crypto capital markets directly, which most fund managers are not allowed for compliance and regulatory reasons.\n\nAs a result, both the number of available Ethereum-based investment vehicles and the funds flowing in these investment products are on the rise.\n\nTop Ethereum investment products\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at three different Ethereum-based investment vehicles that you could add to your portfolio to gain exposure to the price development of ETH without actually holding the token yourself.\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is the first publicly quoted Ethereum investment vehicle in the US, and the second crypto investment product to be regulated by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) after the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The trust focuses entirely on the Ethereum economy, allowing investors to gain exposure to ether while avoiding the hassle of buying, holding, and storing ETH directly.\n\nA trust functions in a similar way as a mutual fund, allowing for the easy transfer of shares under the investor\u2019s name to beneficiaries, according to estate laws. Moreover, the familiar structure makes it easy to engage finance and tax advisors.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust shares are quoted on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and investors can purchase and sell shares via most traditional brokerage accounts at market prices. As of February 3, the market price per share is USD 19.67.\n\nTo date, Grayscale has just over USD 8bn in assets under management (AUM), making it one of the largest crypto management firms in the globe. Since its launch in 2017, the ETH Trust has recorded an impressive 225% growth across the board.\n\nTo invest in the ETH Trust you must be an accredited investor and put in a minimum of USD 25,000. Each share reflects the value of ETH held by the Trust, minus costs and other liabilities. To be precise, each share represents ETH 0.01001839.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that after a six-month holding period shares are eligible to be resold in the secondary market. The Trust is also offered on a periodic basis and always through private placement.\n\nThe digital assets held by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust are stored in offline storage to protect the investments.\n\nMain features:\n\nUSD 8bn AUM;\n\nminimum investment USD 25,000;\n\nsponsor\u2019s fee 2.5% anually;\n\nperformance fee 0%;\n\ninvestor qualifications (US3896381072).\n\nEthereum Futures\n\nIn 2021 the CME Group, which is considered to be the world\u2019s largest and most diverse derivatives marketplace, launched CME Ether Futures, further building on its growing crypto derivatives offerings.\n\nThis was in response to the increasing appetite by institutional investors for transparent, exchange-listed crypto derivatives. The addition of ether, along with Bitcoin Futures and Options, opened the doors for a variety of clients to deploy a range of trading strategies, from hedging their positions in the spot market to gaining leveraged exposure to ether.\n\nThe Chicago-based exchange commenced trading in ether contracts in February, with the first contract registering an opening price of over USD 1,500.\n\nFutures contracts are legal agreements to purchase or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specific date in the future. In other words, CME Ether Futures allow you to speculate on the price development of ETH without having to own the underlying asset.\n\nCME\u2019s ether futures are cash-settled and based on the exchange reference rate that includes data from major cryptoasset exchanges, such as Coinbase, Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, and itBit.\n\nThe derivatives exchange status as a regulated benchmark provider gives investors confidence to invest in Ethereum through futures contracts based on the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate.\n\nIn order to trade ether futures, you must open an account with a registered futures broker that will handle your account and guarantee your trades.\n\nCME Ether Futures come with the following specifications:\n\na single contract is for ETH 50;\n\nthe futures trade under the ticker ETH;\n\nthe prices are quoted in USD and cents per ETH;\n\nether futures trade on CME Globex Sunday through Friday from 5 pm to 4 pm CST;\n\nminimum of 5 contracts per block;\n\nmaximum order size of 100 contracts;\n\nminimum price fluctuations: outright USD 0.5 per ether / USD 25 per contract;\n\ncalendar spreads: USD 0.05 per ether / USD 2.5 per contract.\n\nCME Ether futures are also eligible for exchange for physical (EFP) transactions, provided both parties privately negotiate a transaction to exchange a futures contract for the equivalent value on the spot market position or vice versa.\n\nEthereum Exchange-Traded Notes\n\nFinally, you can also invest in Ethereum through Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) that track the price of ether.\n\nAn ETN is an unsecured debt note issued by a financial institution. Similar to a bond, an ETN can be held to maturity or purchased and sold at will. In practice, ETNs are similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since they are both designed to track the price of an underlying asset, which in this case is ether.\n\nWhen selecting an Ethereum ETN, you should consider several factors in addition to the underlying index and performance of the ETN, such as the investment products\u2019 fees and how liquid it is compared to its peers.\n\nCurrently, there are numerous Ethereum-based ETNs trading on exchanges across Europe, where ETNs are highly popular among retail investors.\n\nVanEck Vectors Ethereum ETN would be an example of an Ethereum ETN. The Liechtenstein-based ETN has the following features:\n\nthe total expense ratio of 1% per annum;\n\nnet assets USD 90m\n\nphysically backed;\n\nfund currency is USD;\n\nlistings on Deutsche B\u00f6rse, SIX Swiss Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Paris.\n\nThe Ethereum investment ecosystem has grown to attract more funds from traditional investors who prefer to invest on a regulated exchange as opposed to investing in the crypto spot markets directly.\n\nIn light of the growing brand recognition and market capitalization of ETH, we may see more funds flowing into these investment products in the near future.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Fractional NFTs Might Democratize Digital Investing\n\n\u2013 Seven Bitcoin IRAs, Reviewed for 2022\n\n\n\n\u2013 How to Invest in Crypto Exchanges: Top 3 Options\n\n\u2013 5 New Blockchain Funds You Could Invest in Today\n\n\u2013 How to Earn Interest on Stablecoins: A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\n\u2013 How to Buy Virtual Land in the Metaverse: A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\n\u2013 Top 7 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining Stocks You Could Add to Your Stock Portfolio\n\n\u2013 Check These 5 Ways to Earn Yield on Your Crypto"

        "content": "It\u2019s Time to Build Ethereum Beyond DeFi and Price Focus \u2013 Vitalik Buterin\n\nEthereum (ETH) is more than decentralized finance (DeFi) and the focus on price, argued its co-founder Vitalik Buterin. According to him, it\u2019s primarily about utility and building out decentralized services that, ideally, combine both finance and non-finance.\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: A video screenshot, Youtube/Grand Amphi Th\u00e9atre\n\nEthereum and projects built of different blockchains are not only about price, as it may be inferred from the current happenings surrounding DeFi. Rather, the goal is to have a crypto space with more utility, more projects, and ecosystems that continue building different kinds of utility, said Buterin in his presentation at the EthCC conference in Paris, held July 20-22.\n\nToday, Ethereum mostly has finance \u2013 the general perception currently is that it is defined and dominated by DeFi. And this is not \u201cbad,\u201d emphasized Buterin, adding that this is not all Ethereum is trying to do.\n\nHe stated that the vision for Ethereum, and much of crypto beyond it, \u201chas always been to take decentralization, trust minimization and mechanism design experimentation far beyond finance.\u201d\n\nThis he described is probably the most interesting part of the vision of general purpose blochchains.\n\nAt this point, there are two primary reasons DeFi is so dominant, per Buterin:\n\nfinance is the area where centralized technology \u201csucks the most\u201d; also, as \u201ccentralized other things,\u201d which also have issues, continue to grow, those issues also become more prominent; transaction fees have been high, and while some can pay for it, there are areas \u2013 such as decentralized media \u2013 that can\u2019t work with high fees.\n\nThe fee problem is currently being solved, argued Buterin, mentioning rollups as one of the solutions again, in combination with sharding to increase the scalability further.\n\nTherefore, he said, now is the good time to think about other things to build on Ethereum, and go further than DeFi. Among the interesting non-financial creations that can already be seen are non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as ENS names, which are technically also NFTs.\n\nLooking at what can be focused on in the near term, there are two goals that have to be met for new projects, per Buterin:\n\nalignment with values: it must be something that the community can get behind doing; alignment with needs: it must be something that is useful to do.\n\nBuilding out the Ethereum social media ecosystem is one of the important things to focus on, says Buterin, as crypto technology can solve a number of major issues plaguing centralized social media: it brings to the table credible neutrality and censorship resistance, among other features.\n\nAnother thing is using Etherum login to sign into other services, like Google or Twitter allows it. However, these centralized login providers are \u201cworst of both worlds in terms of centralization and decentralization,\u201d Buterin said. On the other hand, Ethereum logins that are social recovery wallets can potentially outcompete both centralized and decentralized providers in both self-sovereignty and better account recovery.\n\nDecentralized content, prediction-market-like mechanisms, decentralized sybil resistance, and community-focused forums are \u201cdirection to explore,\u201d according to Buterin.\n\nAnother set of ideas Buterin said he\u2019s excited about is retroactive public goods funding, where the idea is to set up a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that judges what projects were valuable to a community\u2019s goals after the fact.\n\n\u201cEthereum ecosystem needs to expand beyond just making tokens that help with trading other tokens,\u201d said Buterin. \u201cThese things are valuable up to layer-one and layer-two, [\u2026] but once you get to layer-six, you\u2019re actually increasing the financial instability and the risk this whole thing is going to collapse and potentially get a couple of regulators angry.\u201d\n\nHe urged the community to \u201clet\u2019s not just do DeFi.\u201d Moving beyond it doesn\u2019t mean being against it. Rather, in Buterin\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe best applications will combine elements of finance and non-finance.\u201d\n\nAt 11:29 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,981. It\u2019s up 4% in a day and down almost 1% in a week. Overall, it appreciated 708% in a year.\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Makes Curious Cameo in Kutcher and Kunis\u2019 \u2018Krypto\u2019 Video\n\n\u2013 After Bashing Yield Farming, Buterin Offers a \u2018Billion Dollar\u2019 DeFi Idea\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Going to London in August, but Some Changes Will Need To Wait\n\n\u2013 DeFi Has Had a Strong 2021, Driven By New Trends & Paradigms\n\n\u2013 Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019\n\n\u2013 The Ethereum Economy is a House of Cards"

        "content": "The Next Chapter in Yield Farming: Ethereum 2.0 and Sustainability\n\nChyna Qu. Source: DeFiner\n\nChyna Qu is the Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of DeFiner, a decentralized finance network for crypto savings, loans, and payments.\n\n_____\n\nSource: Adobe/A Linscott\n\nYield farming has evolved as a mainstream DeFi (decentralized finance) practice, involving investors, or liquidity providers, putting cryptoassets to work across the many DeFi applications. Yield farmers leverage smart contracts and protocols to get maximum returns on their capital (tokens); they move their assets around using different strategies that involve offering liquidity and lending. While yield farming is a simple supply and demand loop, farmers face some considerable risks such as smart contract bugs, sudden liquidation, or token devaluation.\n\nJust like the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 that attracted widespread media attention and increased adoption of blockchain technology, there is no doubt that DeFi has become the top crypto trend in this pandemic year. This is reflected in the total value locked up in DeFi contracts surging from just USD 1bn in February 2020, to USD 10bn by September 2020, with most of the growth recorded this year.\n\nSource: defipulse.com\n\nThere are, however, a number of important differences between the current DeFi surge and the earlier ICO boom, which indicate that DeFi has reached a more sustainable market than the ICO heyday of 2017. For starters, the market is more mature, with seasoned investors getting involved through considered strategies. Secondly, the level of overhype around yield farming is significantly less than what we saw in 2017 and 2018 with ICOs. This begs the question: how will DeFi evolve to capture a more sustainable financial ecosystem?\n\nHow sustainable is the rise in yield farming?\n\nJune 2020 marked the rebirth of yield farming and its mainstream introduction when Compound started distributing their new token, COMP. Liquidity mining soon helped propel COMP to become the leading DeFi token in just a few weeks. Compound allowed users to earn COMP simply by borrowing and lending the governance token. Some farmers took out leveraged loans to borrow the tokens with the highest COMP yield, producing very high returns. This liquidity mining pattern soon became replicated on other DeFi projects and quickly became standard DeFi industry practice.\n\nNow, there are many open-source projects and applications that are involved in liquidity mining and yield farming protocols. At the time of this writing, top projects like MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Aave now lead the DeFi space in total value locked.\n\nThe Sushiswap scandal that rocked the DeFi space in September shed a spotlight on devaluation risks, after the founder of Sushiswap had converted all of his 2.5m Sushiswap tokens to ethereum (ETH). Initially deemed a crypto exit scam by many, devaluation has now become one of the most feared yield farming risks. The Sushiswap saga left a trail of questions behind, the most significant one being: how sustainable is the rise in yield farming\u2019s popularity?\n\nFor traditional finance experts and even blockchain enthusiasts, yield farming and DeFi have looked like too high a risk \u2014 exit scams, insane APYs (annual percentage yields), and failed projects are just some of the reasons why some critics and media have tipped yield farming to fail in the long run. However, we must remember that just like cryptocurrencies, excessive media frenzies and narratives are expected with every new decentralized financial concept.\n\nWhile I agree platforms leveraging future earnings to reward users with excessive APYs may not be sustainable in the medium to long run, the rise in the number of new projects and products fueled by yield farming will ultimately set a precedent for the longevity of decentralized finance. Since many DeFi products thrive off large numbers and increased liquidity, most of its sustainability is tied to yield farming and how well new products thrive.\n\nScaling and regulation are the next steps for DeFi\u2019s long term sustainability\n\nThese innovations have the potential to transform the face of finance and spur forward the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and other similar assets.\n\nOn the other hand, while yield farming continues to grow and boost recognition for DeFi, it now faces Bitcoin\u2019s age-old problem: scalability. The capacity of the Ethereum network to handle multiple transactions is increasingly threatened, with network congestion leading to slower transaction times, and, ultimately, increased gas (transaction) fees.\n\nETH fees chart:\n\nSource: bitinfocharts.com\n\nEach time I think of yield farming and open finance, I go back to Bitcoin\u2019s history and reflect on how far the crypto and digital asset space has come. Over the next couple of months, some more failed projects, especially those with unrealistic APYs, may shine a negative spotlight on the DeFi world. But for the many DeFi projects that will remain, yield farming will become an industry standard that will transcend DeFi and become an innovative financial solution for many.\n\nWith the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to improve the service quality of DeFi by easing congestion on Ethereum and thus provide faster and cheaper transactions, the immediate future looks bright for DeFi. As DeFi assets under management accelerate, yield farming ought to offer practices that lay the foundations for a sustainable decentralized economy.\n\nYield farming has proved hugely popular for market participants looking to profit from the many DeFi projects emerging. But as the DeFi ecosystem moves to the next level of development, yield farmers ought to consider how their practices can evolve for the benefit of the wider decentralized economy. Only then will we have a truly scalable and transformative ecosystem capable of attracting the mass adoption that the original DeFi market makers first thought possible.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\nDeFi Winning \u2018Bullish\u2019 Fans, But Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Crown\u2019 In Danger \u2013 Survey\n\nGet Ready For Crypto Banking, DeFi & CBDC Surprises \u2013 Venture Capitalist\n\nNo DeFi Bubble, But Merely \u2018a Blip\u2019\n\nTop 4 Risks DeFi Investors Face\n\nThe DeFi Sector Is Breaking The Law \u2013 It\u2019s Time to Act"

        "content": "Do or Die For The Bulls as Ethereum (ETH) Price Tests 200DMA Support\n\nEther coin. Source: Adobe\n\nEther (ETH) bulls are facing a do-or-die moment, as the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the dominant smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain retests key support in the form of its 200-Day Moving Average in the $1,420s.\n\nThe ETH price briefly dipped below the 200DMA to hit $1,408, before regaining some composure to trade closer to $1,450 once again. But ETH/USD is still trading down by around 6% on the day, as per TradingView, and by more than 8% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nCryptocurrency markets have been taking a broad beating on Thursday in wake of Wednesday\u2019s collapse of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, which has raised concerns that fellow crypto-friendly financial institutions SVB Financial and Signature Bank might be next.\n\nThe demise of Silvergate is widely viewed as a blow to crypto adoption, given the bank\u2019s prior efforts to better connect the fiat monetary system and crypto exchanges via its now-shuttered 24/7 wire transfer service between the two.\n\nOngoing macro headwinds, with the US dollar and US yields having seen significant upside in recent weeks as markets up their Fed tightening bets, have been compounding things. Crypto traders will be nervously watching Friday\u2019s US jobs report and next week\u2019s US CPI report, which could determine whether or not the Fed hikes interest rates by 25 or 50 bps later this month.\n\nThe 200DMA is Key to ETH\u2019s Near-term Outlook\n\nThe 200DMA is viewed as a key technical level by most traders. A break above or below it can signal, or act as confirmation of a significant shift in the market\u2019s near-term momentum. Meanwhile, if the market finds strong support at the 200DMA, or fails an attempt to break above it, this is also sometimes interpreted as a signal that the market isn\u2019t ready to shift direction just yet, and may revert to its prior trend.\n\nIndeed, the 200DMA has certainly been a key level for Ethereum in recent months. It acted as a ceiling to the price action twice in 2022 (April and November), twice confirming that the Ether bear market was still in play. Meanwhile, Ether\u2019s decisive break above its 200DMA in mid-January was viewed as a signal that the 2022 bear market might well be over, with the cryptocurrency going on to find strong support above it in mid-February.\n\nIt would be a significant blow to the market\u2019s near-term sentiment if Ethereum was to lose its grip on its 200DMA. Indeed, a swift test of the mid-December highs in the $1,350s would become overwhelmingly likely, with a break below here possibly opening the door to a run lower towards November\u2019s sub-$1,100 lows.\n\nOne saving grace for ETH might come in the form of its 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is close to entering over-sold territory, signaling some consolidation might soon be in order."

Source: TradingView\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum blockchain, continues to suffer amid elevated post-hawkish Fed meeting sell pressure. ETH, otherwise known as Ether, was last down over 5.0% on Friday, having broken out to fresh monthly lows under its 21-Day Moving Average (DMA) earlier in the session. ETH/USD looks on the verge of breaking below $1,200, which could trigger the next leg of selling towards the late-November lows in the $1,150 area.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next For ETH?\n\nEther\u2019s latest drop and fall below its 21DMA, which had in recent weeks been acting as an important source of short-term support, suggest that the positive momentum that lifted ETH as high as $1,350 from November\u2019s sub-$1,100 lows has now been snapped.

Source: TradingView\n\nCan a DeFi Summer 2.0 Trigger a Bounce In Ether?\n\nIn their latest DeFi Ecosystem Landscape Report, analysts at Hashkey Capital argue that the outlook for the DeFi space for 2023 is strong. \u201cMany DeFi applications are now easier to use than home banking applications, which paves the way for onboarding more users in 2023,\u201d analysts state, adding that \u201cthe general public is also getting a better awareness of digital wallets as a result of big social media companies integrating them\u201d. Analysts point to the examples of Reddit, Instagram and Twitter, who are all making moves to add crypto-based services to their platforms.\n\nHashkey continues that 2023 might see DeFi application unlock billions in liquidity from the rapidly growing non-fungible token (NFT) market. The analysts continue that \u201cETH and Ethereum-based assets and L2 based are the main assets used in DeFi\u201d and that \u201cDeFi protocols are one of the biggest users and fee-payers of the Ethereum chain\u201d.\n\nAs a result, they explain that if 2023 is a good year for DeFi, it will likely also be a good year for the price of Ether. \u201cMore DeFi activity will increase the demand for Ether, and it will also burn more Ether (EIP1559),\u201d Hashkey analysts note. \u201cMore Ether burns will result in more Ether scarcity and deflation\u2026 this will lead to higher Ether prices, which will lead to more DeFi activity, and so on and so forth\u201d, they add.\n\nCan Ethereum Flip 2023?\n\nOne of the biggest dreams of ethereum supports and biggest nightmares of the bitcoin maximalist group is that ethereum, currently the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could \u201cflip\u201d bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, in the coming years. The concept of the \u201cFlip\u201d refers to Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization overtaking that of bitcoin.\n\nEthereum currently has a market capitalization of just under $148 billion versus bitcoin\u2019s market cap of around $326 billion. In other words, the total value of all BTC tokens in circulation, according to the current price, is about 2.2 times more than the total value of all ETH tokens currently in circulation.\n\nCan ethereum overtake bitcoin in 2023? Traders shouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility. The ethereum and bitcoin blockchains are very different. The latter is \u201csmart-contract\u201d enabled, meaning DeFi applications can be built to run on top of it. As noted by Hashkey analysts above, a recovery in DeFi markets in 2023, perhaps as global macro conditions take a turn for the better and as adoption trends continue, could substantially boost ETH.\n\nBy comparison, bitcoin solely functions as a digital currency ledger and doesn\u2019t have a thriving DeFi ecosystem sat on top of it. It also still uses the highly energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to secure its blockchain, compared to ethereum, which since the \u201cmerge\u201d in September, runs using the must more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As a PoS chain, ETH can now be used to generate stable and predictable yield, another distinction to bitcoin, which remains a non-yielding asset.\n\nGiven all of the above reasons, if a broad cryptocurrency market recovery takes hold in 2023, there is every possibility that ethereum could claim the title of being the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAltcoins Offering Quicker Returns\n\nCryptocurrencies have been trading sideways for a few weeks now, leading some traders to start looking at alternatives with more potential in the short term. Listed below are some of the leading presales in the market, allowing investors to get in on the ground floor.\n\nFightOut (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launches\n\nFightOut, a brand-new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness application and gym chain that seeks to bring the fitness lifestyle into web3, has opened its pre-sale and investors think the project could transform the existing web3 M2E landscape. While existing M2E applications such as StepN only track steps and require expensive non-fungible token (NFT) buy-ins to take part, FightOut takes a more holistic approach to tracking and rewarding its users for their exercise and activity, and doesn\u2019t require any expensive buy-ins to take part.\n\nFightOut\u2019s FGHT tokens are currently selling for 60.06 per 1 USDT, and interested investors are encouraged to move fast to secure their tokens, with the pre-sale having already raised over $2.08 million in just a few days. FGHT is the token that will power the FightOut crypto ecosystem.\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Presale Enters Final Stage\n\nThose interested in investing in a promising crypto trading platform start-up should look no further than Dash 2 Trade. The up-and-coming analytics and social trading platform hopes to take the crypto trading space by storm with its host of unique features.\n\nThese include trading signals, social sentiment and on-chain indicators, a pre-sale token scoring system, a token listing alert system and a strategy back-testing tool. Dash 2 Trade\u2019s ecosystem will be powered by the D2T token, which users will need to buy and hold in order to access the platform\u2019s features.\n\nDash 2 Trade is currently conducting a token pre-sale at highly discounted rates and sales recently surpassed $9.9 million. The pre-sale dashboard is going to be released on Friday, with the development team currently running ahead of schedule. Tokens are currently selling for $0.0533 each and will be listed on multiple centralized exchanges in around one month.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade here\n\nCalvaria (RIA) \u2013 Final Presale Stage Now\n\nMajor blockchain-based games like Axie Infinity lost significant traction in 2022. As a result, many investors interested in the crypto gaming space are looking for alternative avenues. Calvaria, an up-and-coming play-to-earn battle card crypto game, could be a good alternative. Calvaria seeks to boost crypto adoption by creating a bridge between the real world and crypto, a fun and accessible crypto game.\n\nInvestors should consider Calvaria\u2019s RIA token pre-sale.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Jumps 10% From Recent Bottom \u2013 How High Can ETH Go?\n\nETH/USD eight-hour chart\n\nFollowing weeks of bearish sentiment, the Ethereum price has pushed to highs of $1,215 today after a mid-week rally. This recent price action comes as Bitcoin also gains more ground and reclaims support at $16,000 before inching closer to $17,000.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency appears to have tapped into a fresh bullish momentum that could propel it to $2,000 in the coming weeks, if not days.\n\nEthereum Foundation Chimes in On Staked ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has announced an update about the status of staked ETH tokens following the transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. According to the team, the process of enabling withdrawals on the Beacon Chain is underway.\n\nSome investors have been concerned about rumors online that the Ethereum Foundation deliberately wanted to push back the timeline for the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nStakers are likely jittery following many undesirable events in the market, which affected investors in FTX, BlockFi and Genesis. However, developers say they are working with timelines agreed upon earlier \u2013 where withdrawals were to be enabled during the upcoming \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Ahead of 18% Bullish Move\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced a 10% rally from its most recent bottom as crypto markets generally rebounded. From support at $1,080, ETH traded at a weekly high of $1,215. The pioneer smart contracts token now teeters at $1,201 while considering an 18.71% breakout to $1,406.\n\nThis recovery completed the formation of a double-bottom pattern, opening the door to a much-anticipated rally. Traders scanning for long positions must wait for ETH to print another bullish candle above the neckline resistance at around $1,200 before activating their buy orders.\n\nThe odds are likely to favor the bulls, especially with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator positively influencing the price. Traders will probably consider the 50-day Simple Moving Average (EMA) (in red) at $1,241 as the first take-profit position.\n\nStubbornly bullish traders could wait until the Ethereum price tags the 200-day EMA (in purple) at $1,393 to take some money off the table.\n\nETH/USD eight-hour chart\n\nThe bullish outlook in Ethereum should be considered with a pinch of salt due to a major resistance between $1,199 and $1,232 as highlighted by IntoTheBlock\u2019s IOMAP on-chain model.\n\nApproximately 1.43 million addresses previously purchased 8.30 million ETH in that range. As ETH recovers, some investors may liquidate at respective breakeven points, building more overhead pressure to stifle movement to the upside.\n\nEthereum IOMAP model\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum sits on top of relatively weak support areas. Therefore, selling activities could escalate if the price slides and holds $1,100. Short positions placed marginally below the neckline support at $1,184 will turn profitable toward the primary support at $1,080.\n\nEthereum Alternatives Promising Massive Gains\n\nEthereum price presents a rare buy opportunity with a double-bottom in the eight-hour timeframe. However, the market is still ailing from the FTX crisis that left millions of investors counting losses. Due to such uncertainties in the crypto market, many investors have been looking at presales for shorter-term profits.\n\nBelow are some of the projects with the biggest potential allowing investors to get involved early on.\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade is a new cryptocurrency ecosystem where users can access crypto on-chain analytics, signals, and other precise trading data. Dash 2 Trade enables users to create and test various trading strategies in real-time.\n\nDue to launch in the first quarter of 2023, the sale of its native D2T token has nearly raised $7 million. It has also announced listings on BitMart and LBANK Exchange for early 2023, confirming that investors will indeed have the opportunity to enjoy some returns soon enough.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade Now\n\nRobotEra (TARO)\n\nRobotEra (TARO) is a Sandbox-style Metaverse due to launch its alpha version in Q1 2023. Within its platform, gamers will be able to play as robots and participate in creating its virtual world, including NFT-based land, buildings, and other in-game items.\n\n1 TARO is currently selling for 0.020 USDT (it can be bought using either USDT or ETH), although this price will rise to $0.025 in the second stage of its presale, which will begin soon.\n\n\n\nVisit RobotEra Now\n\nIMPT\n\nAlso running on Ethereum is IMPT, a carbon credit marketplace where users can earn and trade NFT-based carbon offsets, which can also be obtained by shopping with a wide range of eco-friendly retailers.\n\nIMPT\u2019s tokenization of carbon credits as NFTs ensures that such credits can be tracked more transparently, helping to solve many of the problems that have undermined carbon markets up until now.\n\nIMPT presale has raised over $13 million, with IMPT tokens selling for $0.023 before increasing to $0.028 in the next and final stage.\n\nVisit IMPT Now"

        "title": "How Another Ethereum DeFi Summer Can Power the Next Big ETH Price Rally - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How Another Ethereum DeFi Summer Can Power the Next Big ETH Price Rally\n\nSmart-contract activity on the Ethereum blockchain remains relatively healthy, despite 2022\u2019s ferocious bear market that has seen Ether (ETH), last in the low $1,600s, pull over 65% lower versus its November 2021 record highs in the $4,800s. According to a graphic presented by crypto data analytics firm Glassnode, so-called internal contract calls have remained close to their record highs in recent quarters at close to 4.0 million.\n\nExternal contract calls have also remained close to or at record highs in recent quarters of between 600,000 to 800,000 per day. Glassnode explains that Ethereum transactions can include calls for the execution of a smart contract that has been deployed on the blockchain. \u201cWhen a contract is initiated by an Externally Owned Addresses (EOAs), it is referred to as an External Contract Call\u2026 these typically reflect users initiating a specific smart contract, such as an ERC-20 token transfer, a DeFi transaction, or an NFT trade,\u201d Glassnode states.\n\nRegarding internal contract calls, Glassnode explains that \u201cdevelopers of smart contracts can also include contract calls which are initiated from within the executed smart contract\u2026 these are called Internal Contract Calls and enable more complex and composable systems to be built and designed by developers\u201d.\n\nNFT, ERC-20 and Stablecoin Activity Remains Robust\n\nThe ongoing strength of smart-contract activity taking place on the Ethereum blockchain is largely as a result of robust activity amongst the non-fungible token (NFT), ERC-20 and stablecoin transaction types. According to a separate graphic presented by Glassnode, NFT trades made up just under 16% of all transactions taking place on Ethereum on Monday the 27th of February.\n\nERC-20 token transfers \u2013 think the movement of tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 made up just over 11% of all Ethereum transactions, while Stablecoin transactions made up a little less than 10%. So-called vanilla transactions (ETH transfers) came in at 28.5% and \u201cother\u201d came in at 31.5%. That compares to this time two years ago when NFTs only made up around 1.7% of transactions, while stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens made up around 16% and 12%.\n\nOne of the big areas of weakness versus this time two years ago is activity in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) related transactions. In early March 2021, DeFi transactions made up around 12% of all Ethereum transactions. As of late February 2023, they make up only around 4%.\n\nBut DeFi Activity Has Taken A Big Blow\n\nThat decline isn\u2019t so surprising in the context of the huge decline in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem\u2019s total value locked (TVL) in smart contracts. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum TVL was last around $64.4 billion, down over 65% from its late 2021 record highs of above $197 billion. A huge chunk of that decline happened in tandem with the collapse of the Terra DeFi ecosystem when Terra\u2019s UST algorithmic stablecoin collapsed, delivering a significant blow to confidence in the sector.\n\nLess money in DeFi contracts unsurprisingly means less DeFi transactions taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nA DeFi Resurgence Can Power the ETH Price Higher\n\nLooking at the above-presented Glassnode graphic of ETH transaction types, one thing quickly becomes clear. The number of DeFi transactions clearly has a positive correlation to the ETH price. The so-called DeFi summer of 2020 coincided with the initial stages of a long-lasting ETH bull market, that only really ended in 2022 when DeFi activity as a proportion of total ETH transactions started to see a lasting decline.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take too much of a jump to conclude that, if Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem can experience another resurgence akin to that seen during the summer of 2020, then this could help power the next ETH rally.\n\nETH Staking Can Power the Next DeFi Summer\n\nLuckily for the ETH bulls, a new catalyst to trigger the next DeFi summer is fast approaching. Ethereum developers are expected to implement the so-called \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade on the mainnet within the month. And this upgrade will allow those who have staked their ETH tokens to withdraw their ETH principal and earnings for the first time.\n\nETH staking has been available since late 2020, but stakers have previously not been able to withdraw their tokens. The lack of staking flexibility has acted as a deterrent for ETH investors. As of the end of February, only 17.3 million ETH is staked, amounting to only around 14% of the total supply. Many other comparable layer-1 blockchains that use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism but have flexible staking have staking participation rates in the 60-70% range.\n\nThere is clearly room for a big jump in the ratio of staked ETH to total ETH and decentralized liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool could be big beneficiaries. Liquid staking is already the largest Ethereum DeFi sector by TVL (Lido, Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH and Rocket Pool have a combined TVL of $12.76 billion) and looks set to continue its expansion.\n\nThis could help to power growth in other DeFi spheres as staked ETH investors look to get further yield on their staked ETH tokens. And rising DeFi TVL within the Ethereum ecosystem could help drive narratives about the blockchain\u2019s broader adoption and significant medium to long-term price gains."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 How High Can ETH Go in 2023? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction \u2013 How High Can ETH Go in 2023?\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency that powers the smart contract-enabled decentralized Ethereum blockchain, is consolidating on Thursday near the $1,250 mark after posting decent gains in the first few days of this week. Indeed, despite now having pulled close to 2% lower versus Wednesday\u2019s highs in the $1,270 area, ETH is still up about 4.0% this week, after mustering a clean upside break of both of its 21 and 50-Day Moving Averages on Wednesday.\n\nIn wake of the recent push higher, which seems to have been more technically driven amid a lack of any notable Ethereum-specific catalysts, short-term price predictions have become more bullish. However, macro headwinds could be a problem for the bulls, with Fed officials (in speeches and via Wednesday meeting minutes release) sounding hawkish and US labor market data (so far) coming in strong.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next For ETH?\n\nSo maybe Fed tightening bets could push ETH back towards where it started the week in the $1,200 area. But amid a positive technical picture, a retest of these levels could attract substantial buying interest. After breaking out of a medium-term downtrend earlier this week, ETH bulls are targeting an eventual test of the December highs in the $1,340 area, as well as a potential test of the 200DMA at $1,390.\n\nHowever, whether ETH could press on beyond these levels is another thing. The cryptocurrency remains locked within a downward trend channel that has been in play since July 2022. And ongoing headwinds to the broader crypto sector thanks to a still very hawkish Fed and weakening US economy suggest a big break higher might not be imminent in the coming weeks of months.\n\nHow High Can ETH Go in 2023?\n\nThat being said, many do expect macro headwinds to ease later this year. Many economists expect US inflation to continue its rapid drop back towards the Fed\u2019s 2.0% target and this should eventually give the US central bank room to begin cutting interest rates to support growth, which is also expected to weaken substantially. This could result in a broad pumping of risk assets. ETH bulls will cling on to the hope that the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization can get back to its pre-\u201cmerge\u201d highs in the $2000 area from last August.\n\nEthereum Upgrades to Also Boost ETH?\n\nAside from potential macro tailwinds that could lift Ethereum this year, the Ethereum blockchain protocol will also be undergoing a number of key changes/upgrades that could also bolster investor appetite. The first major upgrade will be the so-called \u201cShanghai\u201d hard fork, which is scheduled for March.\n\nThe main benefit of this hard fork will be that ETH network validators will finally be able to withdraw the ETH that they have staked in order to secure the network. Analysts think that by enabling staked ETH withdrawals, more investors will be attracted towards ETH staking, which normally yields somewhere in the region of 4-5%. This could substantially boost demand for the cryptocurrency, some predict.\n\nEthereum developers also hope to make progress on making the Ethereum blockchain more scalable via \u201csharding\u201d \u2013 this is essentially where the Ethereum network is split into multiple parallel blockchains (shards), allowing it to process more data and transactions. Developers have tentatively scheduled a sharding upgrade for the fall.\n\nAltcoins to Consider\n\nWith the broader cryptocurrency market still struggling in early 2023, traders/investors might be looking to diversify their holdings with assets that stand a better chance of posting short-term gains. Here is a list of some of Cryptonews.com\u2019s favorite presale tokens of highly promising crypto projects.\n\nFight Out (FGHT) \u2013 Presale Launches\n\nFight Out, a brand-new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness application and gym chain that seeks to bring the fitness lifestyle into web3, has opened its pre-sale and investors think the project could transform the existing web3 M2E landscape. While existing M2E applications such as STEPN only track steps and require expensive non-fungible token (NFT) buy-ins to take part, Fight Out takes a more holistic approach to tracking and rewarding its users for their exercise and activity, and doesn\u2019t require any expensive buy-ins to take part.\n\nFight Out\u2019s FGHT tokens are currently selling for 60.06 per 1 USDT, and interested investors are encouraged to move fast to secure their tokens, with the pre-sale having already raised over $2.65 million in just a few weeks. FGHT is the token that will power the Fight Out crypto ecosystem.\n\nVisit Fight Out Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Presale Enters Final Stage\n\nThose interested in investing in a promising crypto trading platform start-up should look no further than Dash 2 Trade. The up-and-coming analytics and social trading platform hopes to take the crypto trading space by storm with its host of unique features.\n\nThese include trading signals, social sentiment and on-chain indicators, a pre-sale token scoring system, a token listing alert system and a strategy back-testing tool. Dash 2 Trade\u2019s ecosystem will be powered by the D2T token, which users will need to buy and hold in order to access the platform\u2019s features.\n\nDash 2 Trade\u2019s pre-sale has actually now sold out but, luckily, due to massive investor demand, the project is still selling tokens to investors. Sales just surpassed $13.7 million and the pre-sale dashboard is going to be released soon, with the development team currently running ahead of schedule. Tokens are currently selling for $0.0533 each and will be listed on multiple centralized exchanges starting this month.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade here\n\nC+Charge (CCHG) \u2013 Presale Now On\n\nThe carbon credit industry is projected to be worth $2.4 trillion by 2027. Democratizing access to accrue these benefits is going to massive business in the years ahead and this is something crypto start-up C+Charge hopes to achieve. C+Charge is currently building a blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) payment system for EV charging stations that will allow the drivers of electric vehicles (EVs) to earn carbon credits.\n\nC+Charge aims to boost the role of carbon credits as a key incentive for the adoption of EVs. At present, large manufacturers of EVs like Tesla earn millions from selling carbon credits to polluters. C+Charge wants to democratize the carbon credit market by allowing more of these rewards to find themselves in the hands of the EV owners, rather than just the big businesses.\n\nC+Charge has just started its pre-sale of the CCHG token that its platform will use to pay at EV charging stations. Tokens are currently selling for $0.013 each, though by the end of the presale, this will have risen by 80%. The project has already raised close to $78,000 in just a few weeks. Thus, investors interested in getting in early on a promising environmentally friendly cryptocurrency project should move fast.\n\nVisit C+Charge here"

        "content": "Is Ethereum Poised To A Parabolic Growth To USD 2,000?\n\nThe text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.\n\nSource: iStock/PokPak05\n\nEthereum steals the spotlight of Bitcoin, surging to USD 1,439 Monday and surpassing its previous all-time high of USD 1,432. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading flatline. It seems that Ethereum is breaking away from the correlation with Bitcoin that\u2019s been apparent in the past few months.\n\nInvestors have been waiting for 3 years for this to happen. 2020 was the year of the DeFi ecosystem, with ETH surging to USD 400 from less than USD 200 per ETH. Other DeFi tokens such as Chainlink, Uniswap and SushiSwap all rallied to new highs.\n\nThe recent rally of ETH could be attributed to the launching of ETH 2.0, which promises lower fees and faster-responding speed. Like Bitcoin, ETH is getting more attention and recognition from institutional investors. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) recently announced that its cash-settled Ether Futures will be launched in February 2021. Analysts expect this move will allow more money to flow into ETH.\n\nWith wider adoption, ETH could reach USD 2,000 in the coming months. The total open interest for ETH options reached its all-time high of USD 1.8 billion. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled for. It measures the flow of money into a futures or options market and signals the trading sentiment of the market.\n\nTraders are quickening their pace to withdraw ETH from exchanges. The ratio of EH tokens depositing at exchanges has dropped to 22% from the 26.33% of September. This usually indicates increasing hodling sentiment among traders.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is an upgrade aiming to enhance the network\u2019s scalability, programmability, and security. After its completion, the Ethereum blockchain will fully adopt proof-of-stake(PoS) to secure its network, while ETH 1.0 employs a consensus mechanism known as proof of work (PoW). The whole process is divided into 4 phases and is expected to last for at least 2 years.\n\nThe final phase of ETH 2.0 is expected to launch in 2021 and it is not the end for Ethereum blockchain. With the release of ETH 2.0, users could utilize ethereum in a much cheaper and efficient way, while getting more security. The increase in usage comes with greater demand that could send ETH\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nBexplus is a Bitcoin-based trading platform offering 100x leverage and contracts for BTC, ETH, EOS, LTS, and XRP.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Jumps Up 20% in Two Weeks \u2013 Here\u2019s Where It\u2019s Headed Next\n\nDespite having pulled back now more than 7% from its recent highs last week around the $1,680 area, Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum blockchain, is still up close to 18% in the last two weeks. Ethereum is the most popular and well-known smart-contract-enabled decentralized layer-1 blockchain protocol, with its native Ether cryptocurrency the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nETH sellers have been in control over the last few days ever since Ether failed an attempt last week to push above key resistance in the $1,680 area, a failure which appears to have triggered an uptick in profit-taking by short-term speculators. Technical selling by intra-day traders has likely also played a part \u2013 ETH\u2019s latest leg lower was triggered by a bearish breakout from a short-term pennant structure that the cryptocurrency had formed on the 4-hour candle sticks.\n\nWhere Next For ETH?\n\nLooking at ETH on a longer-term time horizon, things are looking more positive. Yes, ETH failed to get above the $1,680 resistance (so far), but the cryptocurrency is no longer stuck within the confines of the long-term downward trend channel that dominated for much of late 2022 and into early 2023.\n\nEther also continues to trade substantially to the north of all of its major moving averages, which are all now moving higher. Meanwhile, the rate at which the 50DMA is rising suggests that, assuming there is no massive drop in ETH in the coming weeks/months, there should be a bullish golden cross sometime in February (when the 50DMA crosses above the 200DMA).\n\nETH\u2019s latest pullback means that, according to the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), Ether is no longer overbought, suggesting that there is room for buying pressure to rebuild in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nPositive Fundamental Tailwinds\n\nMacro and Ethereum-specific fundamentals may continue to cushion downside. On the macro front, markets are increasingly expecting that the end of the Fed\u2019s interest rate tightening cycle is soon approaching and that by the end of this year and in 2024, the Fed will be easing interest rates once again. That\u2019s thanks to the ongoing rapid pullback in US inflationary pressures and growing signs that the economy is sliding toward recession.\n\nAn easier Fed outlook has historically boosted crypto, as happened in 2019 and then in 2020/2021. Ethereum, meanwhile, is expected to implement a major upgrade at the end of this quarter that will enable staked ETH withdrawals, which is expected to drive fresh demand for the asset, with investors attracted by the prospect of being able to flexibly access a stable yield.\n\nEthereum network fundamentals remain strong, with the number of non-zero balance addresses expected to surpass the important 100 million threshold later this year \u2013 a proxy for the cryptocurrency\u2019s continued, inexorable adoption. The combination of the above factors could well keep ETH supported in the coming weeks and months, enabling the cryptocurrency to eventually retest its summer 2022 highs to the north of the $2,000 level.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nEthereum Alternatives\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for other high-potential crypto projects alongside ETH, we\u2019ve reviewed the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the CryptoNews Industry Talk team.\n\n\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

The pair has recorded higher lows since November 2022, with the $1,900-$2,000 level acting as technical and psychological resistance levels, according to the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout above $2,000 could quickly propel ETH toward the 2022 breakdown levels of around $3,000. The targets of the bullish ascending channel pattern also coincide around these levels.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHSBC Hong Kong customers can now trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), broadening access to digital asset derivatives in the emerging Asia crypto hub.\n\nThe ETFs, which are traded as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong\u2019s so-called \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile app on Monday. They offer traders exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts that trade on commodity exchanges.\n\nThe specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, a representative from HSBC Hong Kong confirmed to Decrypt. The news was first reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSCOOP: HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it. The move will expand local users\u2019 exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nHSBC is the largest bank in Hong Kong, Wu said, and HSBC is the first lender in Hong Kong to allow its customers access to digital asset ETFs.\n\nAdding ETFs to its investment platform offers HSBC Hong Kong investors access to derivatives, without which customers might seek out access on an unregulated exchange, possibly using a VPN, Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear opportunity for [HSBC] to get ahead and offer this one product that is otherwise not allowed in Hong Kong,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s a \u201cclear customer need.\u201d\n\nThe CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management, a firm that saw the two products listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year. The two ETFs were the first in Asia to track digital asset futures, according to the firm\u2019s website.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth ETFs invest in futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), making them an \u201ceasy transparent way for investors to capture the performance\u201d of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CSOP Asset Management.\n\nThe Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is managed by Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong and invests in CME contracts as well, but launched in January of this year.\n\nWhile there\u2019s robust demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng said that the demand for derivatives is equal, if not greater. And ETFs allow companies to offer exposure to crypto without opening themselves to regulatory risk in a nascent industry to which Hong Kong has only recently signaled openness.\n\n\u201cIf all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another,\u201d Feng said of crypto exchanges more generally. \u201cIt's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook.\u201d\n\nFutures ETFs correlated to the performance of digital assets are nothing new in the United States. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved a spot-based Bitcoin ETF yet\u2014BlackRock wants to change that\u2014ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nFeng said the \u201csimplicity and convenience\u201d of ETFs make them a much more palatable option for retail traders compared to other derivatives, such as options, where traders need to understand concepts like strike prices and gamma.\n\n\u201cWhen you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will eventually speculate because it\u2019s just so easy.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Has a Layer 3 Vision to Unleash Full Power of Crypto - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Has a Layer 3 Vision to Unleash Full Power of Crypto\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, ETHWORLD / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin always seems to be looking a step into the future \u2013 or three. While layer 2 (L2) is currently still developing, Buterin contributed to the layer 3 (L3) discussion, arguing that these could serve a different purpose(s), leaving scalability to L2s.\n\nAs a reminder, layer 1 is the base layer. Ethereum itself is an L1 chain and one of the most used blockchains presently. L2 solutions are built on top of these blockchains to reduce their on-chain burden.\n\nTo this, in his blog post titled What kind of layer 3s make sense?, Buterin \u2018adds\u2019 another layer, writing:\n\n\u201cIf we can build a layer 2 protocol that anchors into layer 1 for security and adds scalability on top, then surely we can scale even more by building a layer 3 protocol that anchors into layer 2 for security and adds even more scalability on top of that?\u201d\n\nHe warns, however, that these concepts are not as simple as they sound and that there is often something in the design that is not stackable and can only give \u201cscalability boost once.\u201d\n\nOther issues can emerge too, including, but not limited to, limits to data availability and reliance on L1 bandwidth for emergency withdrawals.\n\nL3s, though, are not a Buterin-invention, and others too are already discussing their utilization. Newer ideas, such as the one proposed by blockchain startup StarkWare, Buterin says, focus more on assigning different roles to L2s and L3s, instead of just \u201cstacking the same thing on top of itself,\u201d arguing that:\n\n\u201cSome form of this approach may well be a good idea \u2013 if it\u2019s done in the right way.\u201d\n\nWhile scaling can be relegated to L2s, L3 could be used for:\n\ncustomized functionality, for example privacy;\n\ncustomized scaling;\n\nweakly-trusted scaling (validiums \u2013 a scaling solution that uses off-chain data availability and computation designed to improve throughput by processing transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet).\n\nSource: StarkWare\n\nPer Buterin, this seems \u201cfundamentally reasonable,\u201d but he argues that some large questions with very complicated answers still remain, such as: is a three-layer structure the right way to accomplish these goals? The fact is, he suggests, many of the roles which may be given to L3s may perhaps be accomplished on the L2 level, while other issues could be solved with a different, existing or proposed, approach.\n\nSource: vitalik.ca\n\nTherefore, Buterin argues,\n\n\u201cA three-layer scaling architecture that consists of stacking the same scaling scheme on top of itself generally does not work well. Rollups on top of rollups, where the two layers of rollups use the same technology, certainly do not. A three-layer architecture where the second layer and third layer have different purposes, however, can work.\u201d\n\nAnd though not the best long-term solution, validiums on top of rollups \u201cdo make sense,\u201d he said. Rollups are a scaling solution that enables the transaction to be executed off the chain. They perform transaction execution outside L1, after which the data is posted to L1 where consensus is reached.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-awaited and highly-anticipated Ethereum Merge blockchain upgrade happened on September 15, triggering the blockchain\u2019s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nWhile the coin\u2019s price briefly went up in the days leading to the event, in the six days since the Merge, ETH fell 18.8%. On Wednesday morning (UTC time), it is trading at USD 1,329, down 2% in a day and 15.5% in a week.\n\nETH 7-day price chart.

        "title": "Analyst Predicts Rally for One Ethereum-Based Altcoin, Unveils Forecast for Three Additional Altcoins - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH)-based token is gearing up for a significant burst to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 347,000 Twitter followers that the Ethereum-based supply-chain management blockchain VeChain (VET) appears poised for a rally after reclaiming both its horizontal and diagonal support levels on the monthly timeframe.\n\nAccording to Rekt Capital, he\u2019s expecting VET to rally to its next monthly resistance at $0.269.\n\n\u201cForming a new higher low (black).\n\nAnd if indeed the June monthly candle closes just like this, it\u2019s possible VET could consolidate via the green path over the coming weeks.\n\nStill needs to confirm the new higher low.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, VET is trading for $0.18.\n\nNext up is Waves (WAVES), a protocol focused on token and decentralized application (DApp) creation. According to Rekt Capital, WAVES could be on the verge of carving a bottom on the monthly chart as it creates a triangle pattern. Rekt says the bottom could be confirmed if WAVES takes out its resistance at $2.50.\n\n\u201cMay be developing a macro triangle, not yet clear if ascending.\n\nBlue $2.50 resistance may be the breakout point for the triangle.\n\nBreakout would enable a return into the blue-blue range for some 40%-wide consolidation.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, WAVES is worth $2.22.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s list is the internet-scale blockchain MultiversX (EGLD), formerly known as Elrond. Rekt Capital says that EGLD managed to stay above its monthly support at $32.54. Should EGLD bulls continue to hold the immediate support area, the analyst predicts a rally for MultiversX to around $40.\n\n\u201cGreat reaction from horizontal support (black).\n\nContinued stability here and EGLD will avoid a breakdown into the range denoted by blue arrows.\n\nMore, holding here could enable an EGLD rally to the year-long downtrend (black).\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, EGLD is worth $35.44.\n\nThe last altcoin on the analyst\u2019s radar is the fan engagement token Chiliz (CHZ). According to Rekt Capital, CHZ remains in a multi-year bear market, but the token could rally to $0.096 as long as it is above its immediate support at $0.05.\n\n\u201cRed multi-year downtrend has been weighing on CHZ.\n\nIn fact, it forced a breakdown from blue support.\n\nNow that CHZ has found support at black below\u2026\n\nCHZ could try to rally to blue to check if it will become new resistance.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, CHZ is trading for $0.08.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $210 Million Gets Liquidated in Market Volatility \u2013 Where is ETH Heading Now?\n\nEther coin. Source: Adobe\n\nMajor cryptocurrency prices have tumbled on Friday, amid jitters about the health of crypto bank Silvergate, which has seen a rapid exodus of major customers in the last few days. Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the mid-$22,000s, down around 4.5% on the day. Ether (ETH), the token that powers the Ethereum blockchain, was last down around 4.7% on the day and trading in the upper-$1,500s. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization was last around $986 billion, down a little over 4.4% or around $43 billion on the day.\n\nThe drop in prices has resulted in a surge in trader liquidations. According to crypto derivatives data analytics website coinglass.com, long positions in the crypto futures market worth over $210 million were closed on the 2nd of March. That\u2019s the highest in nearly one month.\n\nSome analysts said that the release of some of Mt Gox\u2019s bitcoin to victims of the exchange\u2019s hack many years ago may have added to the sell pressure. Either way, Bitcoin is now more than 11% below its recent highs above $25,000, whilst Ethereum is closer to 10% down from its recent highs in the mid-$1,700s. Crypto seems to have been playing catch up with recent downside in US equities as a result of concerns about additional interest rate tightening from the Fed in wake of recent strong data.\n\nCan a Stock Rally Underpin Crypto?\n\nIn fairness, US stock prices are surging this Friday, which is helping put a floor under crypto prices, but the major indices still remain a long way below recent highs. Macro analysts said traders have become more optimistic on Friday because the Fed hasn\u2019t been giving an indication they want to take interest rates above 5.5%, the level currently priced in by the market. Meanwhile, robust data, including the latest monthly ISM services report, lowers the risk of a US recession later this year.\n\nIf the US stock rally can continue, this bodes well for equities. And continue it might, according to positive recent technical developments for the S&P 500. The index recently found strong support at its 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a key long-term downtrend, indicating the bull the positive run since last year\u2019s low may yet have further legs to run.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for ETH?\n\nPositive momentum in stocks could well act as a tailwind for Ether in the coming days and weeks. So could upcoming upgrades to the Ethereum network. Later this month, the final major public Ethereum testnet will go through the Shapella hard fork, setting the stage for an upgrade to the mainnet next month. The main feature of the coming upgrade is that staked ETH withdrawals will finally be allowed.\n\nWhile some think this may result in some short-term sell pressure as ETH investors cash in on their withdrawn ETH and ETH earnings, most suspect it will be a long-term positive driver. Flexible withdrawals should attract more ETH investors towards staking, which should result in a greater proportion of the supply getting locked up, which could boost scarcity and prices.\n\nThese drivers might be able to lift Ether in the coming weeks, but in the immediate future, the risk of further sell pressure remains. That\u2019s because Ether\u2019s latest drop has seen it break to the south of an uptrend that had been in play since the start of the year. Near-term risks remain tilted towards a potential test of February lows in the $1,460 area.\n\nETH Alternatives to Consider\n\nETH could do well in the months ahead. However, traders looking for quick gains might want to consider other high-potential tokens, such as those being sold in pre-sale by promising up-and-coming crypto projects. We\u2019ve reviewed some of the best candidates in this list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, as analyzed by the Cryptonews Industry Talk team.\n\nThe list is updated weekly with new altcoins and ICO projects.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bulls Hold $1,400 Level \u2013 Where is ETH Heading Now?\n\nEther coin. Source: Adobe\n\nAfter a brief dip below the $1,400 level for the first time in nearly two months earlier in the session, Ether (ETH) has managed to regain a modicum of composure in the wake of the release of a mixed US jobs report for February.\n\nETH, the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last changing hands close to $1,425, after US wage growth came in cooler than expected and following a surprise jump to 3.6% in the US unemployment rate.\n\nThat still leaves Ether still down close to 1% on the session and close to 7% lower in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe ETH price cratered from the mid-$1,500s on Thursday amid a combination of concerns relating to the collapse of crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and a growing liquidity crisis at fellow crypto-friendly bank SVB Financial.\n\nSell pressure was exacerbated after the New York Attorney General referred to Ether as a security in its ongoing lawsuit against KuCoin.\n\nCrypto markets have been fretting about a regulatory crackdown from US authorities in recent weeks and some fear the US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon attempt a crackdown on Ether, claiming it to be an unregistered security.\n\nSome have also cited the Biden administration\u2019s latest budget, which would seek to crack down on crypto tax loss harvesting, as a headwind for prices.\n\nETH Liquidations Spike as Price Collapses\n\nThe latest tumble in the ETH price has unsurprisingly resulted in a spike in leveraged long-position liquidations. Long future\u2019s positions worth nearly $63 million were wiped out on Thursday, according to data presented by coinglass.com, the highest since the 23rd of January.\n\nLong liquidations on Friday are also already around $30 million, substantially higher than the average level of recent weeks.\n\nOptions Markets Turn Bearish\n\nInvestors are increasingly positioning for the risk that the latest downturn in the ETH price extends, according to options market data presented by The Block.\n\nThe 25% delta skew of Ether options expiring in 7, 30 and 60 days have each fallen to new two-month lows in the -7 area.\n\nThe 25% delta options skew is a popularly monitored proxy for the degree to which trading desks are over or undercharging for upside or downside protection via the put and call options they are selling to investors.\n\nPut options give an investor the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a predetermined price, while a call option gives an investor the right but not the obligation to buy an asset at a predetermined price.\n\nA 25% delta options skew above 0 suggests that desks are charging more for equivalent call options versus puts.\n\nThis implies there is higher demand for calls versus puts, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign as investors are more eager to secure protection against (or bet on) a rise in prices.\n\nWhere Next for Ether (ETH) as Bulls Hold $1,400 Level?\n\nThe fact that ETH has been able to hold above the $1,400 level, for now, means that there hasn\u2019t yet been a sustained, convincing break below the key 200-Day Moving Average level at $1,423. The 200DMA acted as strong resistance in 2022 and has been touted as a key support level for 2023.\n\nA break below it would be a massive blow to the medium-term bullish ETH thesis, as a sustained break above the 200DMA (as seen earlier this year) is seen as a key indicator of a positive shift in the market\u2019s medium-term momentum. If ETH falls back under $1,400, this momentum would have arguably evaporated.\n\nEyes will be on next week\u2019s key US CPI inflation data release. ETH bulls will be hoping that the data surprises to the downside, resulting in markets further pricing out the risk of a 50bps rate hike from the Fed later this month. Bulls will also be hoping for some calm relating to the troubles faced by crypto-friendly US banks.\n\nKey resistance to keep an eye on if ETH does bounce is around $1,460 in the form of the February lows. Meanwhile, to the downside, bears will be eyeing a retest of support at $1,350.\n\nA break below here could open the door to a retest of last November\u2019s lows under $1,100.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama citing on-chain data, this is a key area of support given that a break below it would spark a massive $68 million in liquidations in long positions taken out on decentralized exchanges (DEX).\n\nAnother level to watch, according to DeFi Llama, is around $1,240, where $30 million in DEX long are at risk of being wiped out."

        "content": "Crazy Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Dampen Rally, Help Competitors\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) transaction fees have spiked by 89% and 260% in the past month, as growing demand for BTC and ETH has overburdened both blockchains with unprecedented traffic. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s issues are seemingly boosting its competitors.\n\nSource: Adobe/Du\u0161an Zidar\n\nBitcoin\u2019s median transaction fee currently sits at USD 13.75, having risen by 4,674% compared to a year ago, when fees were only USD 0.288. Ethereum\u2019s median fee is currently USD 12.94, a figure which has risen by 22,443% compared to this time last year.\n\nWhile bitcoin\u2019s status as a store of value means it suffers fewer repercussions from higher fees, Ethereum\u2019s issues may be boosting rival chains and platforms, such as Cardano (AND) and Binance Smart Chain. As reported, Tron (TRX) is also enjoying this situation.\n\n7-day moving average. Source: bitinfocharts.com\n\nThe wrong kind of all-time highs\n\nEthereum transaction fees have hit all-time highs in recent days and it comes with numerous downsides.\n\nFirst, they\u2019re apparently putting off DeFi users, who Coin Metrics said \u201cdo not want to pay excessive fees\u201d in order to trade on decentralized exchanges, lock funds into DeFi platforms, or transfer non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe higher fees are also pricing out smaller holders, with Ethereum\u2019s median transfer value rising to an average of about USD 312. This may indicate some people are being discouraged from transferring smaller amounts, or it may simply indicate the rising price of ETH.\n\nHowever, Coin Metrics noted that Etherum usage has remained high overall despite the fees, with active addresses average around 600,000 per day since January.\n\nAs for BTC, even though its fees have risen to a three-year high, they haven\u2019t broken all-time records (set in December 2017). And with bitcoin\u2019s price (and ethereum\u2019s) continuing to rise, there isn\u2019t sign of significant dampening of demand, yet.\n\nAlso, if nothing else, the spike in transaction fees has provided yet more confirmation \u2014 if any were needed \u2014 that bitcoin is more a store of value than a medium of exchange at this stage.\n\nCosting upwards of USD 13, high transaction fees mean that you\u2019d need to be desperate to use bitcoin to make small purchases.\n\nHappy competitors\n\nWhile higher fees are leading to longer confirmation times for BTC, they appear to be having a number of more serious knock-on effects for Ethereum.\n\nThe past few weeks have seen \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019 Cardano rise up the cryptoasset rankings, jumping in price by over 90% alone over the past seven days to become the fourth biggest crypto by market capitalization. Cardano uses a fee structure based around the price of ADA, which is currently low enough (USD 0.81) to keep fees comparatively much lower than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nAt the same time, platforms that use alternative blockchains to Ethereum have risen in popularity. This is the case with PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange which, being on Binance Smart Chain, isn\u2019t currently plagued with higher fees like the Ethereum-based SushiSwap.\n\nAs Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was only too happy to point out on Twitter, today saw PancakeSwap overtaking SushiSwap in terms of 24-hour volume.\n\n\u201cCongrats on flipping Sushi. Low fees work,\u201d he said.\n\nTop 5 decentralized exchanges by trading volume today:\n\nSource: coingecko.com\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how long this situation might last though.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Says High Ethereum Fees Might Be Gone Even Before ETH 2.0\n\nEthereum (ETH) Co-founder Vitalik Buterin brought his new proposal to the table that could make high fees on the network a thing of the past sooner than initially expected.\n\nSource: Adobe/Anton Gvozdikov\n\nSummarising his ETHOnline Kickoff Summit presentation last Friday, Buterin wrote in a Twitter thread today that his proposal for Ethereum 2.0 is \u201cnot \u201crollups instead of sharding\u201d, it\u2019s \u201crollups on top of sharding.\u201d\n\nRollup is a scaling technique that keeps transaction data on-chain, in a compressed form, but the computation is pushed off-chain. Meanwhile, sharding divides the blockchain\u2019s nodes into smaller groups, known as \u2018shards.\u2019 Rather than validating the same transactions at the same time, different shards then validate different sets of transactions, thereby increasing the number of transactions that can be processed per second.\n\nButerin added that \u201crollups are already here or coming soon even before sharding, and rollups without sharding still offer that 100x increase in throughput. So get on a rollup today!\u201d\n\nWith the network\u2019s rising popularity, as well as the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom, things are getting increasingly crowded, and the way the network deals with this currently, said Buterin, is with higher fees \u2013 which recently hit a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cThe [layer 1] is nearly unusable for many classes of applications,\u201d wrote Buterin, \u201cand there\u2019s no non-[layer 2] path that can get us to scalability in the short-to-medium term.\u201d\n\nLayer 1 (L1) is the base protocol (the Ethereum blockchain), while Layer 2 (L2) is any protocol built on top of Ethereum.\n\nIt is Phase 1.5, which is an interim update, or ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 merger phase, when a scalable proof-of-stake (PoS) network could already be reached instead of waiting until Phase 2, by using shard chains as data availability layers and rollups as the execution environments instead of the shards. Or as Buterin wrote in a recent post: \u201cphase 1.5 and done.\u201d\n\nHe offered a scaling roadmap for which he said encompasses the next 1-2 years and includes \u201ccombining the scaling mechanism of sharding with the scaling mechanism of rollups.\u201d\n\nThis follows the above-mentioned post in which Buterin proposed \u201ca rollup-centric [E]thereum roadmap\u201d wherein \u201cthe Ethereum ecosystem is likely to be all-in on rollups (plus some plasma and channels) as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future.\u201d\n\nButerin argued that base-layer scalability for applications is not coming until Phase 2, \u201cwhich is still years away,\u201d while at the same time \u201c[ETH 2.0\u2019s] usability as a data availability layer for rollups comes in [P]hase 1, long before [ETH 2.0] becomes usable for \u201ctraditional\u201d layer-1 applications.\u201d\n\nETH 1.0 clients could be repurposed as optimistic rollup clients, he said, while the future needs to see all users\u2019 primary accounts, balances, assets, etc., as well as Ethereum apps and Ethereum Name Service domains, entirely inside a layer 2, instead of their current home, layer 1.\n\n\u201cThe main reasoning Vitalik gives for focusing our energy on this rollout plan instead of on getting to [P]hase 2 is he believes that by the time [P]hase 2 rolls around, we\u2019ll already have a bustling layer 2 ecosystem which optimistic rollups will be a big part of,\u201d wrote Anthony Sassano, SetProtocol product marketing manager and author of the Ethereum-focused newsletter The Daily Gwei. \u201cBasically, the network effects will be too strong and we may have wasted research and development effort on [P]hase 2 instead of focusing on phase 1 and 1.5.\u201d\n\nSupporting Buterin\u2019s proposal, Sassano added:\n\n\u201cImagine that the base-layer of Ethereum becomes an ultra-decentralized and ultra-secure layer for these layer 2 constructions to settle on while end-users get to experience similar security guarantees but with ultra-low fees and near-instant transactions on layer 2.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, per dapp data aggregator and analysis firm DappRadar, \u201cEthereum stands as the most significant blockchain even given the gas price jump\u201d thanks to the recent DeFi and DEX dapp categories explosion, as well as the yield farming in combination with the interest in governance tokens. \u201cWhile some anticipated Ethereum 2.0\u2019s release, others joined the hype regardless of the high Ethereum gas prices,\u201d it said.\n\nThere was also a 154% increase when looking at daily active wallets. DeFi and DEX categories together went up from 12,800 daily active wallets to 50,200 in Q3 2020. In Q3, DeFi became the largest ecosystem in Ethereum, holding 90% of total daily active wallets. 74% of the DeFi ecosystem\u2019s daily active wallets belong to the Uniswap decentralized exchange which grew 560% quarter-on-quarter. Balancer (BAL) with 1,100 daily active wallets is in the second place, and SushiSwap with around 984 daily active wallets in the third.\n\nSource: DappRadar\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum 2.0 developers were hard at work launching testnets this year before the Phase 0 arrival. The most recent one is Medalla, followed by the parallel-running, short-term Spadina. Both have experienced issues, and with Medalla having stabilized, another short-term testnet will follow Spadina, called Zinken. The bugs are getting fixed and they\u2019re getting smaller each time, Buterin said in his presentation:\n\nAt pixel time (11:15 UTC), ETH trades at USD 352 and is up by 1% in a day, trimming it\u2019s weekly losses to 2%.\n\n___\n\nLearn more: Bitcoin And Ethereum Scale Slower Than Cryptoverse Grows"

        "content": "Key Ethereum Levels to Watch as ETH Price Pivots $2,100\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nMidway through last week and following the successful implementation of the Shanghai and Capella upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, the price of Ether (ETH) broke convincingly above the $2,000 level for the first time since May 2022.\n\nEther, the crypto token that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, has since been consolidating either side of the $2,100 level, with gains on the year currently around the 73% mark.\n\nNaturally, after Ether\u2019s latest push higher above the key psychological $2,000 mark and long-term resistance around $2,030, traders are asking where next for the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nContinued consolidation over the next few days and weeks is a distinct likelihood given a lack of major macro and Ethereum-specific fundamental catalysts to drive the price action.\n\nWith the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade now out of the way, attention now turns to 1) watching on-chain ETH token staking trends and 2) on when Ethereum developers will implement the next round of major upgrades to the blockchain.\n\nFor reference, the latest series of Ethereum upgrades unlocked staked ETH token withdrawals for the first time since staking was enabled on the Beacon chain back in December 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the next major macro events that could really shift narratives about the outlook for US economic growth and Fed tightening policy come next Wednesday (Q1 GDP) and Friday (March Core PCE Inflation).\n\nA steady crawl higher in the ETH price is certainly possible, but the risk of further profit-taking activity remains high, with ETH\u2019s 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) having recently crossed into overbought territory.\n\nKey ETH Levels to Watch\n\nTo the upside, traders will be monitoring how the ETH price responds to resistance in the $2,140-60 area in the form of the earlier yearly highs and last January\u2019s lows.\n\nMeanwhile, to the downside, the closest major area of support is the August 2022 high in the $2,040 area.\n\nIt would be unsurprising to see the ETH marooned within this range over the course of the next few days, assuming no major unexpected catalysts arrive to shake up the price action.\n\nBut should volatility pick up once again and profit-takers and shorters overpower the bulls, the next major support area to monitor to the downside is an uptrend linking ETH lows since late March, the 21-Day Moving Average (currently at $1,918) and previous yearly highs in the $1,940 area.\n\nA retest of this collection of support levels would be a key test of the market\u2019s short-term bullish momentum.\n\nShould dip-buyers come back in force and prices bounce in the $1,900s, many technicians might interpret this as a powerful vote of confidence in the market\u2019s near-term outlook.\n\nMany would likely then be targeting a test of the $2,300 area.\n\nIndeed, beyond the January low at $2,160, $2,300 is the next key area of resistance (the February 2022 lows. Beyond that, the next area to watch is the March 2022 lows in the $2,440 area.\n\nIf the ETH bulls can push the price above here, there aren\u2019t any major resistance levels until beyond the psychologically important $3,000 mark, aside from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level back from the 2022 lows to the 2021 record highs, which sits around $2,870.\n\nWhile things will certainly be choppy in the months ahead, major cryptocurrencies are likely to continue trading with an upside bias.\n\nThat\u2019s because macro conditions will likely continue to shift favorably as traders up bets for a Fed rate cutting cycle to stave of a recession in the second half of this year and in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ether is likely to benefit from dual deflationary tailwinds in the form of 1) more ETH tokens being moved into the staking contract and 2) ETH supply deflation thanks to the ongoing burning of transaction fees.\n\nOptimism regarding continual upgrades to the network, the next round of which should materially improve ETH\u2019s transaction throughput via the implementation of sharding, could add another major tailwind."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: BTC and ETH Experience Nearly 2% Spike; Is More Upside Ahead?\n\nIn the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have recently shown a notable spike, with both digital assets experiencing a nearly 2% increase in their prices.\n\nThis upward movement has left investors wondering if there is further upside potential shortly.\n\nAs the two leading cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention and dominate the market, it\u2019s crucial to analyze the factors driving their recent surge and assess the possibilities for continued growth.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the current trends and predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin stands at $27,201, with a trading volume of $9.7 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis represents a nearly 2% increase in value during that period. Bitcoin holds the top position on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of $527 billion.\n\nThere are currently 19,385,881 BTC coins in circulation, out of a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nOn the technical front, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a significant surge after breaking above the resistance level of $26,865.\n\nThis breakout has resulted in a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern, indicating a potential continuation of the upward movement in the market.\n\nThe leading technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are both showing bullish signals, suggesting that BTC has a strong potential for further gains.\n\nHowever, there is a downward trend line that may act as a resistance around the $27,350 level.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nNevertheless, based on the formation of three consecutive bullish candlesticks in the four-hour timeframe, there is a high probability that BTC will surpass this level and target the next resistance at $27,500.\n\nBreaking through this level could lead to a rally towards $27,800, with a potential breakout exposing BTC to $28,200.\n\nOn the downside, Bitcoin has a key support level of $26,865, and a continuation of the downward trend may lead to a test of the next support at $26,001.\n\nTraders should closely monitor the $26,800 level as it will provide further insights into BTC\u2019s price action.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $1,847, and it has recorded a trading volume of $4 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum has seen a modest increase of around 1% during this time. With its live market capitalization standing at $222 billion, Ethereum holds the second position on CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe circulating supply of Ethereum is approximately 120,256,010 ETH coins.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nJust like Bitcoin, the second-leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is currently experiencing a strong bullish movement after finding support near the $1820 level, which is the 50-day exponential moving average.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum may face resistance around the $1870 level, and a decisive breakthrough above this level could further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s price. The next significant resistance level is around $1900.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf Ethereum manages to surpass this level, it could potentially target the $1920 level.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the leading technical indicators, such as the RSI and MACD, which both indicate a bullish sentiment. In case Ethereum breaks below the $1820 level, it may find support around $1780 or $1760.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay informed about the latest ICO projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring the curated list of the top 15 most promising digital assets to watch in 2023.\n\nThis carefully selected roster has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring you have access to professional recommendations and insights.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and discover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the ever-evolving world of digital assets.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

The topic that ignited the heated discussion was the contentious issue of cryptocurrency regulation, specifically concerning the fate of XRP and Ethereum (ETH) in the face of mounting pressure from the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser unequivocally stated that the regulatory overreach would inevitably lead to the demise of XRP and every other cryptocurrency, except for Bitcoin, which he deemed \"untouchable.\"\n\nOf course the SEC is 'overreaching' but that won't stop them from killing off XRP and every other shitcoin.

He countered by highlighting the SEC's prior labeling of Bitcoin as a security. While conceding that the commission could inflict damage on XRP, Deaton believed that the influence of its current transient regulator, Gary Gensler, would be short-lived.\n\nHe further argued that software code itself should not be classified as a security, emphasizing the need for a level playing field where the best technologies could thrive.\n\nUnswayed by Deaton's arguments, Keiser remained steadfast in his belief that both ETH and XRP would suffer the same fate. Dismissing chatter about Bitcoin as inconsequential, he declared that Gensler, the current SEC chairman, would pursue Ethereum and XRP as unregistered securities.\n\nKeiser went on to assert that the regulator functioned as a protection racket for the banking cartel, ready to employ national security and the Patriot Act if necessary to eliminate these projects."

Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, Real Vision Finance\n\nHoskinson spent much of his recent livestream discussing Cardano\u2019s recent progress and his hopes for the future.

        "content": "Miner Backlash Over Fee Upgrade Provokes A Countermove by Ethereum Devs\n\nEthereum (ETH) developers have responded to a miner backlash against a fee-related Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) by proposing to bring forward the blockchain\u2019s planned move to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism which makes miners obsolete.\n\nSource: Adobe/bizoo_n\n\nDeveloper Mikhail Kalinin has submitted a pull request to \u201cimplement the executable beacon chain proposal,\u201d which would deploy a version of the Ethereum Mainnet with PoS consensus. Similarly, Ethereum 2.0 lead coordinator Danny Ryan has advocated simplifying the merge proposal in order to roll out Ethereum 2.0 sooner.\n\nSuch moves are arguably an attempt to diminish the influence of some Ethereum miners, who have opposed a scheduled upgrade that would automatically set fees. However, the catch is that any proposal to merge sooner with the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain would have to be approved by the miners also.\n\nMiners protest, Ethereum developers react\n\nScheduled to go live in July, EIP-1559 will introduce a \u201ctransaction pricing mechanism that includes [a] fixed-per-block network fee,\u201d among other things.\n\nUnfortunately, some Ethereum miners aren\u2019t particularly enthralled by it, with a group of them planning a \u201cshow of force\u201d on April 1, when they\u2019ll collectively move their hash power to the Ethermine pool.\n\nComing a couple of weeks before the important Berlin upgrade, this action is apparently intended as a demonstration of miners\u2019 power and importance. But rather than change their plans, it seems that at least some Ethereum developers are now proposing to speed ahead with the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 rollout.\n\nWithout going too deep into technical specifics, the proposal from Mikhail Kalinin would build a version of the Ethereum Mainnet with a PoS mechanism on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, something which could accelerate deployment.\n\nAccording to a ConsenSys blog published yesterday, the benefit of this plan \u201cis that the move to PoS will be minimally disruptive to current dapps [decentralized apps], tooling, and users. We just get to turn off mining.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, used now by ETH and by Bitcoin (BTC), which involves using computational power to solve complex mathematical equations, PoS requires participants to put down a minimum amount of funds to allow a new block to be added to the ledger.\n\nParticipants in this sort of initiative are called validators. In exchange for their efforts in verifying the veracity of transactions, validators receive block rewards, similar to PoW, when miners get, e.g., BTC.\n\nThe catch\n\nTurning off mining would certainly avoid any miner resistance to EIP 1559 or any future updates. However, as ConsenSys themselves noted, the process of \u201cdocking\u201d the existing Ethereum chain to the PoS Beacon Chain is likely to be tricky.\n\n\u201cThis procedure will be fraught, and may require some incentivization on miners up to the point of merging and beyond,\u201d wrote James Beck, ConsenSys\u2019 director of communications.\n\nBeck doesn\u2019t outline what form such incentivization may take. But for some observers, the whole EIP 1559 issue could have been avoided if Ethereum had a better handle on communication.\n\nIrrespective of Ethereum\u2019s perceived organizational flaws, the conflict doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt the price of ETH, which has risen by around 2% over the last 24 hours (10:18 UTC) and 15% over the past week to USD 1,790.\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Miners Are Likely to Accept EIP-1559 Activation \u2013 Analysts\n\n\u2013 EIP-1559 Won\u2019t Lower High Ethereum Fees On Its Own \u2013 Professor\n\n\u2013 ETH \u2018Insanely Cheap,\u2019 DeFi To Rally, BTC Dominance to Drop \u2013 Pantera Capital CIO\n\n\u2013 What\u2019s in Store for Ethereum in 2021?\n\n\u2013 Too Costly Ethereum is Pushing DeFi Users Away, Fuelling BNB Rally\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Miners Don\u2019t Cause Price Volatility, Says Analyst"

        "content": "\u2018DOGE Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu Clogs Ethereum While Musk Lifts Dogecoin Again\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) token has taken over the Cryptoverse, calling itself the dogecoin (DOGE) killer and prompting many to raise alarms. Meanwhile, 50% of SHIB\u2019s total supply is deposited to the wallet of Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, while the Ethereum fees skyrocket yet again and DOGE received another boost from Elon Musk.\n\nSource: Adobe/Africa Studio\n\nDOGE has become such a widespread phenomenon both within the Cryptoverse and outside of it, that it\u2019s little surprise we\u2019re seeing projects trying to capitalize on its image/likeness.\n\nAnd today, Elon Musk took to Twitter yet again to fuel the flames, asking if Tesla should accept the coin \u2013 with 77% of nearly 1.24m votes saying \u2018yes\u2019 and 22 hours to go.\n\nSource: Elon Musk / Twitter\n\nDOGE jumped by around 14% in half an hour and is now (10:10 UTC) trading at USD 0.519. The price is unchanged in a day and is up by 19% in a week.\n\nHowever, a digital \u2018dog\u2019 coin, launched in August 2020, is the talk of the town today. Called SHIB, it\u2019s referencing the Shiba Inu dog breed, which has been so firmly connected to DOGE that it\u2019s its first association.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019d be nothing much to talk about SHIB has its price not jumped in the past month, the speculations being that it caught the eye of Chinese investors, in addition to being listed on major exchanges Binance, OKEx, and Huobi \u2013 all popular with Chinese traders.\n\nBinance\u2019s May 10 announcement describes it as \u201can experiment in decentralized community building and another meme coin similar to Dogecoin [and] the first token to be listed and used as an incentive for using ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange.\u201d It also adds that three wallets hold 60.5% of the coin\u2019s total supply.\n\nBinance shortly suspended all withdrawals on the same day, with some suggesting it was due to the SHIB trading traffic.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also said that \u201ca large number of users\u201d were demanding SHIB.\n\n\u201cSHIB token allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them,\u201d stated OKEx\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe Shiba Token website adds to all this that SHIB is nicknamed \u2018the DOGECOIN KILLER\u2019, and that it\u2019s an ERC-20 only token which \u201ccan remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time.\u201d\n\n50% of the total supply is locked in Uniswap and the keys were thrown away, they said, while \u201cthe remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don\u2019t own team tokens they can dump on the community.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwoofpaper\u201d explains further that the founder, called Ryoshi \u2013 who claimed to dislike centralized exchanges \u2013 chose Ethereum as a \u201csecure and well-established\u201d network that allows decentralization and growth, while half of the total supply is sent to Ethereum co-founder\u2019s wallet because \u201cthere is no greatness without a vulnerable point and as long as VB doesn\u2019t rug us, then SHIBA will grow and survive.\u201d\n\nSo the team gave Buterin the coins he didn\u2019t ask for to do as he pleases, but his move could potentially bring the price down should he ever decide to sell them.\n\nPer CoinGecko, at 7:43 UTC, the coin\u2019s price is up 120% in a day, 1,944% in a week, and 39,205% in a month, now trading at USD 0.00003249. The maximum token supply is 1 quadrillion, while the circulation supply and the market capitalization remain under a question mark. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization is USD 11.95bn, and ranks 18th by this metric.\n\nSHIB price chart:\n\nSource: coingecko.com\n\nThose behind SHIB also launched LEASH, the purpose of which was \u201cto tame DOGE [in a way that, every day] the price of LEASH will rebase to 1000/1 the price of DOGE.\u201d Now, it has been unleashed and will not rebase, the website added, announcing the next token called BONE Dogecoin Killer, with the details to be revealed along with ShibaSwap.\n\nThey also claim that a percentage of purchases using Amazon Smile goes to a non-profit Shiba Inu Rescue Association.\n\nEthereum fees skyrocketing\n\nSpeaking of the Ethereum network \u2013 while dropping somewhat by the beginning of the month, Ethereum median transaction fee started rising on May 2 and then jumped on May 7, altogether seeing a 684% increase in a matter of eight days. On May 10, the number stood at USD 31.\n\nThis is in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC)\u2018s median fee of USD 8.25 on the same day, while its highest in the past month was USD 28 \u2013 still lower than Ethereum\u2019s latest jump.\n\nSource: bitinfocharts.com\n\nThis, some find, could be SHIB\u2019s work as well.\n\nWarnings and worries galore\n\nAnd while some claim that a lot of money can be made with a portfolio comprised entirely of dog-themed coins, with the sudden rise in SHIB, much like what happened with SafeMoon in late April, came many warnings against purchasing the coin.\n\nMany are also calling it a scam, likening it to the famous Bitconnect scam.\n\nTo others, there\u2019s no difference between the \u2018dog\u2019 coins, or others described as scams. While everybody are free to do what they want, \u201cthings like DOGE, SHIB, SafeMoon take away the spotlight from the decentralized future we\u2019re trying to build,\u201d argued analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, adding that \u201c90% of the people will lose money on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can make a lot of money short term on memecoins, but the stink stays on you for a while if you are looking to stick around and build,\u201d tweeted Messari CEO Ryan Selkis.\n\nPer CZ, \u201cit seems people don\u2019t care about use cases anymore.

According to crypto intelligence portal EmberCN, the address, which had remained inactive for six long years, received 50,000 ETH from an ICO participant back in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time the address has shown signs of activity. In March 2017, it received 50,000 ETH, followed by a subsequent transfer of 36,000 tokens to the Kraken exchange, potentially selling them at an average price of $255. These movements indicate a history of strategic selling by the address holder.\n\nThe original Ethereum bidder associated with this address acquired a substantial amount of 192,026 ETH during an ICO in July 2015. The tokens were obtained at a price of $0.311 per unit. Over the course of the next two years, a significant portion of the acquired tokens, precisely 177,403 ETH, made their way to centralized exchanges, potentially selling at an average price of $70.\n\nWhales awaken, risks increase\n\nThe awakening of this major player in the crypto market led to questions about its potential impact on the Ethereum price rally. The market has witnessed similar instances in the past, where large holders of cryptocurrencies have moved substantial volumes, often triggering market volatility.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nWhile the Ethereum price initially experienced a 14% drop since the last awakening of such whales at the end of May, it managed to recover its value. If more whales surface, it might be wise to draw lessons from history and exercise caution, avoiding an overestimation of the potential risks."

        "title": "Polygon and Matic: What is the difference? - crypto.news",
        "content": "Polygon is a layer-2 scaling infrastructure on the Ethereum blockchain, while MATIC is its native token used to power the ecosystem. As they are often confused in the crypto community, learn the difference in our guide.\n\nWhat is MATIC?\n\nMATIC is the native token of the Polygon platform, formerly known as the Matic Network. It originated as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, but when the Matic Network rebranded to Polygon and expanded its scope, the role of the MATIC token also evolved. The MATIC token is now used in Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and to pay transaction fees on the network.\n\nMATIC tokens supply is limited, just like some other cryptocurrencies such as BTC. The supply of MATIC tokens is capped at 10 billion as per the platform\u2019s rules.\n\nThe rebranding of Polygon coupled with developments on the network and its adoption, saw MATIC tokens grow in price and market cap. The token now holds a high position in the cryptocurrency rankings.\n\nWhat you can do with Polygon (Matic)\n\nThe token has different use cases in the Polygon ecosystem, including payment for transaction fees and staking. Users can also earn MATIC tokens by validating transactions or executing smart contracts on the Polygon network. This is done by offering some computational resources and services to the Polygon network to function as validators.\n\nMATIC is also a governance token on the Polygon network. Users who own and stake MATIC can vote on the network upgrades, with each vote equivalent to the amount of staked MATIC cryptocurrency.\n\nMATIC on Polygon vs MATIC on Ethereum?\n\nThere is a difference between a MATIC token on the Ethereum network and a MATIC token on the Polygon network. Matic is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, while MATIC is the native token of the Polygon blockchain, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n\nThe difference means that a MATIC token on the Ethereum network and a native MATIC token on the Polygon network won\u2019t share the same wallet address since they are on different blockchain networks. Transferring a token minted on the Ethereum network to your MATIC address on the Polygon network without using Polygon\u2019s bridge service could potentially lead to a loss of your token. However, if you transfer a token minted on Ethereum to an Ethereum address (for example, MetaMask), it will be successful. The same is true in reverse, but only with the proper use of Polygon\u2019s bridge for the transfer.\n\nPolygon vs. Matic: What is the difference?\n\nWhile Polygon and Matic are often used interchangeably, they have clear distinctions. Polygon is a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, while MATIC is its native token used to power the ecosystem.\n\nLaunched in 2019 as Matic Network, the project originally offered Plasma chain. The project rebranded to Polygon in 2021, integrating a more extensive suite of solutions, but chose to keep the name MATIC for its native utility token. This rebranding led to some confusion in the crypto community, with many people mistakenly viewing them as separate projects. You can compare Polygon to Matic as Ethereum to ETH.\n\nPolygon explained\n\nBorn initially as Matic Network, Polygon is a project designed to address Ethereum\u2019s challenges, such as network congestion and high gas fees. It was created in 2017 by experienced Ethereum developers Sandeep Nailwal, Jaynti Kanani, Anurag Arjun, and Mihailo Bjelic.\n\nThe key attribute of Polygon is its capability to process transactions on a parallel, Ethereum-compatible chain before feeding them back to the main Ethereum network. This system decreases network congestion, enabling smoother operations.\n\nThe platform includes different tools to build and run applications compatible with Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. The proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol is designed to facilitate fast transactions at minimal costs. Polygon zkEVM is a solution that uses zk rollups to process transactions off-chain and then send them back to the main blockchain.\n\nPolygon is not the only layer-2 scaling solution on the Ethereum network. Rival platforms include Solana, Cosmos, and Avalanche. However, Polygon sets itself aside from its competitors by granting developers immense control and customization when selecting a scaling solution they deem idle for their application. For instance, on Polygon, developers can choose between optimistic roll-ups and zk-roll-ups per their needs.\n\nThe solution to Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings\n\nHigh transaction fees in times of network congestion, costing hundreds of dollars, and slow transactions are some of the biggest issues faced by persons using DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other platforms built on the Ethereum network or generally transferring tokens over the network.\n\nPolygon aims to solve this problem by offering a scaling solution on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the project, it has the capacity of more than 7,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nHow does Polygon work?\n\nPolygon architecture | Source: Polygon Wiki\n\nPolygon is a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, aiming to reduce transaction costs and speed up transactions. It uses its own proof-of-stake blockchain and various scaling solutions, including side chains, to achieve this. The blockchain claims to handle 7,000 transactions per second compared to Ethereum, which typically can process around 15-20 transactions per second.\n\nPolygon also cuts transaction costs by processing transactions on its side chains, and it offers users flexibility in choosing their preferred scaling solutions. Transaction fees are generally much lower than Ethereum\u2019s average.\n\nPolygon network architecture consists of three core layers:\n\nEthereum layer: This layer includes a set of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Its main function is facilitating the proof of stake (PoS) mechanism. In Polygon, anyone can stake MATIC tokens, earn rewards, and establish checkpoints on the Ethereum mainnet, helping to ensure the reliability and integrity of the system.\n\nHeimdall layer: As the validation layer, Heimdall handles the aggregation of blocks, organizing them into a data structure called a Merkle tree. These aggregated blocks are then regularly published to the root chain. Validators on this layer ensure the correctness of blocks since the last checkpoint and publish a Merkle root hash to the Ethereum mainnet. This process provides transaction finality and proof for asset withdrawal.\n\nBor layer: As the block producer layer, Bor compiles transactions into blocks. It operates in time intervals termed \u201cspans,\u201d during which block producers are selected and rotated. Heimdall nodes also regularly validate these blocks, ensuring the overall system\u2019s security and consistency.\n\nEach of these layers plays a crucial role in Polygon\u2019s function, working together to provide a network for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.\n\nPolygon use cases\n\nAs Polygon looks to diversify beyond Ethereum, its major use case is to facilitate the seamless integration of different blockchain projects and networks into the Ethereum ecosystem. Some of the current use cases of Polygon include:\n\nDeFi Projects\n\nPolygon supports several DeFi projects built on the Ethereum blockchain. By lowering the transaction costs and the transaction time in DeFi protocols, Polygon enables DEXs to offer more liquidity since most people are encouraged to deposit into the liquidity pools. Popular DeFi platforms using Polygon include 1inch, Curve Finance, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, and Aave.\n\nBusiness support\n\nPolygon offers business operations support to ParcelMoney\u2013 a crypto payroll and treasury management platform. Polygon supports the platform via its low-cost and scalable network built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nOn the NFTs side of the spectrum, ATARI-an NFT platform, partnered with Polygon to facilitate the platform\u2019s growth leveraging Polygon\u2019s low-cost and scalable network to ensure fast, safe, and efficient transactions.\n\nClosing words\n\nPolygon is a layer-2 scaling solution on the Ethereum blockchain network that enables it to scale and facilitate quick transactions. Sometimes called the \u201cEthereum internet of blockchains,\u201d Polygon seeks to enhance the scalability, sovereignty, and scalability of Ethereum-based projects while still providing the security, interoperability, and structural benefits of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPolygon is powered by MATIC-an ERC-20 token used to pay transaction fees on the Polygon ecosystem, govern the network, and pay network transaction fees. In essence, MATIC is the native coin of Polygon, just like ETH is to Ethereum.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Ethereum Bulls Beware \u2013 These 3 Key On-chain Metrics Suggest ETH Price Upside May Be Hard to Sustain\n\nEthereum logo: Source: Adobe\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, has enjoyed an excellent start to 2023, rallying in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market. At current levels close to $1,650, Ether is close to 40% higher on the year.\n\nWhile it would be foolish to exclude the possibility that Ether continues to rally ahead of the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s upcoming Shanghai hard fork upgrade in March, an upgrade that is set to (finally) free up ETH withdrawals, it may be too early to bet that a new bull market is already here and a return to record highs in the $4,800s later this year is imminent.\n\nThat\u2019s because three key on-chain metrics that typically all shoot higher during an aggressive bull market all remain very subdued. Until they do turn higher, bulls would do well to temper their optimism.\n\nMetric 1 \u2013 Daily Transactions Still Subdued\n\nThe number of transactions taking place on a daily basis on the Ethereum network remains below where it was this time last year. That\u2019s according to data presented by crypto analytics firm The Block, the 7-Day Moving Average (DMA) of daily transactions was last just above 1 million, still well below the record highs hit in 2021 of around 1.65 million. A pick-up in transactions could be a lead indicator for a pick-up in the ETH price, if/when it happens.\n\nMetric 2 \u2013 Active Addresses Languish\n\nThe number of daily active addresses (i.e. addresses interacting with the Ethereum blockchain) also remains below its level of this time last year. According to The Block, the 7DMA of active addresses was last around 400,000, still well below its record high of around 750,000 in 2021. Spikes in the number of active addresses, like in late-2017/early 2018 and in 2021 tend to coincide with upticks in the ETH price. Thus, as with the above, a spike in active addresses could be a lead indicator of an Ether rally.\n\nMetric 3 \u2013 Address Growth Remains Sluggish\n\nThe number of new addresses being created on the Ethereum network each day remains sluggish and below its level this time last year, according to data presented by The Block. The 7DMA was last around 67,000. This time last year the 7DMA was around 80,000. The rate of new address creation tends to spike in tandem with rallies in the ETH price, as was the case in 2017/2018 and in 2021.\n\nUnless there is a significant improvement in each of these on-chain metrics, which collectively act as a proxy for demand for the Ethereum blockchain, it is difficult to make the case for a rally back to 2021\u2019s record highs."

        "content": "Ethereum In ATH Territory Against USD, But Far from ATH Against Bitcoin\n\nEven though Ethereum (ETH) has entered its all-time high (ATH) against the US dollar territory today, it\u2019s still many satoshis away from its ATH against bitcoin (BTC). (Updated at 12:09 PM UTC with the latest price data. Updated at 13:39 UTC with the two last paragraphs.)\n\nSource: Adobe/Wit\n\nThree years after reaching a major peak, ethereum may be surpassing it soon. It reached its previous all-time high on January 13, 2018, with the price of USD 1,432 per coin, according to Coinpaprika. As reported, Coingecko put the figure at USD 1,448.18 on its ETH page. Messari went a bit lower with USD 1,431.77, while Coincodex went considerably higher at USD 1,570. And Bitinfocharts had the lowest price of the lot at USD 1,355.59.\n\nIn either case, as ETH had rallied up, it had dropped back down in the following months, only to start rallying again in late 2020 and particularly the first weeks of 2021.\n\nThe second coin by market capitalization has gone up 14% in a day, 28% in a week, and 118% in a month, trading at USD 1,417 (12:07 PM UTC) after it reached USD 1,424 earlier today.\n\nAgainst BTC, however, it\u2019s still very far from breaking the all-time high. Here, the story goes a bit differently. The peak was reached earlier than the one in USD \u2013 in June 2017, when ETH 1 was worth BTC 0.154. (Meanwhile, for fun, this amount of BTC was worth USD 406 at the time, and around USD 5,700 currently.)\n\nHowever, a single ETH is worth just BTC 0.038 at the time of writing. That is a 75% difference. What\u2019s more, while short-lived spikes are noticeable on a shorter time scale, zoomed out to observe the entire ETH\u2019s lifetime, the value in BTC has more or less remained unchanged since September 2018.\n\nETH price chart:\n\nThat said, in USD terms, ETH still seems to be in a rallying mode, aiming higher \u2013 going up more than 23% in a week, compared to bitcoin\u2019s 1% \u2013 while BTC has traded between the USD 35,000 and USD 37,000 level for the past four days, currently sitting at USD 37,331. Also, while BTC appreciated nearly 329% in a year, ETH went up nearly 740% in that same time.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been in a range for the past few weeks, which gives time for capital to rotate\u201d into other digital assets, Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to economist and trader Alex Kr\u00fcger, \u201cEthereum will soon pass to the next level,\u201d while the levels \u201cto watch beyond all time highs\u201d are USD 1500, USD 1600, USD 1920, USD 2000, USD 2240, USD 2500, and USD 2750, he said.\n\nPer an analyst at crypto research firm Messari, Ryan Watkins, there\u2019s plenty of reason to be bullish on ETH, as Ethereum\u2019s daily transaction volume is going parabolic. Per Coinpaprika.com, the volume jumped from USD 20.76bn to USD 30bn (and from BTC 565,961 to BTC 813,405) between January 18 and 19, while it had been at USD 30bn four days ago as well.\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of days ago, crypto analytics firm Santiment noted that the ratio of ETH on exchanges continues to decrease and move to offline holder wallets, calling it \u201cone of the most promising signs for ETH bulls.\u201d Today they tweeted that, as it was \u201canticipated for much of the past week, Ethereum finally created separation from Bitcoin on surging non-exchange whale accumulation & ETH tokens moving off exchanges.\u201d\n\nAnd all this said, when it comes to ATHs, be it bitcoin\u2019s or ethereum\u2019s, there are some disagreements over what their historic ceilings actually are, as different platforms provide slightly different data. Nonetheless, quite a few people are keeping an eye on the ETH price, waiting to see it break the record (in USD), and/or expecting the full coin bloom in an altseason.\n\n\u201cAlthough Ethereum is currently experiencing high gas fees, ETH 2.0 and the move to proof of stake will create a more scalable infrastructure for DeFi applications. At the end of last year, it was announced that 100,000 ETH was already locked in the Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract. This large amount of locked funds, plus increased demand from major financial institutions looking to get into blockchain, has created increased demand on a macro level,\u201d Kadan Stadelmann, Chief Technology Officer of Komodo (KMD), said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cTo a mainstream audience, Ethereum has always been the lesser-known cousin to Bitcoin. However this time around we are seeing more media awareness and understanding about what Ethereum is and we hope that this continues throughout 2021 as the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry grows and gradually gets adopted,\u201d Samantha Yap, Founder & CEO at YAP Global, a PR agency specializing in fintech, blockchain & crypto companies, said.\n\n___\n\nReactions:\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\nEthereum is Still an Unfinished Product, Says Bitcoin Investor Lyn Alden\n\nWhat\u2019s in Store for Ethereum in 2021?\n\n\u201cEthereum Is (Not) Money\u201d Trigger Tested Again And It Still Works\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum Fight Escalates amid Fresh Capital Entering the Space\n\nBitcoin Is Better Than Ethereum At These Four Things"

        "title": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Immutable X - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Immutable X\n\nSource: Adobe/Tasphong\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network has been struggling to scale, plagued with skyrocketing gas fees and slow transaction confirmation times. Following the explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) over the last two years, the strain on the network has become palpable, leading to the much-needed development of layer-2 scaling solutions to reduce fees and decongest the network.\n\nLayer 1 is the blockchain itself, while layer 2 encompasses projects built on top of it.\n\nImmutable X was released to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues for low-cost minting and trading of NFTs. Read on to learn more about Immutable X and how it addresses the scaling challenges on Ethereum pertaining to NFTs.\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nThe increasing popularity of NFTs has led to congestion on Ethereum, resulting in extremely high fees for simple transactions. Immutable X leverages layer-2 solutions to ease up the burden of transactions on the Ethereum network, helping it to scale.\n\nImmutable X is the first layer-2 scaling protocol for NFTs on the Ethereum network. The protocol says it offers instant trade confirmations, increased scalability, and zero gas fees without compromising user custody. It intends to solve network scalability for NFTs by leveraging the power and security of the Ethereum blockchain while maintaining its integrity.\n\nA collaboration between Immutable and Starkware aims to scale digital assets in an open decentralized environment.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nThe Ethereum NFT ecosystem faces several key challenges. Scaling is at the top of the list, with the network only being able to process a handful of NFT transactions per second.\n\nThe increase in NFT activity on-chain has led to network congestion and drastically reduced transaction speeds. Consequently, this has impacted ETH gas fees as users compete to confirm transactions, making the network slow and expensive.\n\nHigh gas fees and long transaction times have resulted in a decrease in NFT trading activity on-chain and the NFT market expanding onto more affordable chains. Equally important are the technical limitations faced by NFT developers due to scalability and the controversy about the environmental impact of NFTs.\n\nImmutable X counters these challenges by introducing two different layer-2 solutions known as ZK-Rollups and Validium. Under a \u2018Volition\u2019 model, users will be able to choose whether particular assets are held as Validium zk-proofs or ZK-Rollups.\n\nImmutable X uses ZK-Rollups to process thousands of off-chain trades by creating proof that all these transactions are valid, and then publishing that proof on-chain, where it is verified by a smart contract. The validation of a transaction happens when the owners of the assets sign off on the transaction.\n\nSince the Ethereum network still hosts the proofs in smart contracts, the security of the network is captured along with increased speeds.\n\nValidium is similar to ZK-Rollups but differs in the sense that the resulting proof is not published on layer 1. While this serves to improve transaction speeds, it needs a trusted group to hold authority. It\u2019s important to note that Validium is yet to be implemented.\n\nSince transactions on Immutable X are not being processed on Ethereum layer 1 they are gas-free. This is a far cry from the exorbitant fees charged for on-chain transactions. Immutable X is able to process up to 9,000 NFT transactions per second as well as instant transaction resolution.\n\nThe instant resolution drastically improves the user experience of NFT trading and eliminates scaling challenges for NFT creators who want to mint their work on Ethereum.\n\nImmutable X has a native utility token known as IMX that powers NFTs trading in its marketplace and can be staked to earn rewards.\n\nUnlike the energy-intensive computations required to secure the Ethereum blockchain, Immutable X relies on staking to secure the protocol. Therefore, the layer-2 protocol expends less energy and is an environmentally friendly alternative.\n\nHow does Immutable X differ from other Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions\n\nEthereum layer-2 solutions include State Channels, Plasma, and Optimistic Rollups. The protocols differ from immutable X in approach to solving the blockchain trilemma in sacrificing one of the three; decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nState channels\n\nState channels use a scaling solution that allows users to make thousands of transactions off-chain but only submit an opening and a closing transaction on-chain. The intermediate states are signed by both parties to indicate assent. While this opens the door for free peer-to-peer transactions and higher layer-1 throughput, it also exposes the participants to counterparty fraud, especially if you rely on another person to represent you in a transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, ZK-Rollups process transactions in batches, then generate a \u2018proof\u2019 for that batch. Using this proof, rather than checking each transaction individually, you can check the entire batch outside.\n\nPlasma\n\nPlasma uses smart contracts and Merkle trees to create multiple child chains. Through the use of fraud proofs, plasma chains directly inherit the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHowever, unlike Immutable X, which offers instant transaction resolution, withdrawals from Plasma chains take up to two weeks \u2014 an exit period where users can report fraud. This dramatically impacts the system\u2019s user experience (UX).\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nOptimistic Rollups use key actors known as aggregators to scale Ethereum layer 1 by compiling batches of transactions off-chain and sending them to a smart contract on the main chain through fraud proofs. This enables the network to achieve consensus on a batch of transactions as opposed to every transaction, consequently improving transaction speeds.\n\nThe downside of using Optimistic Rollups to scale NFTs is that there is no possibility for fast NFT withdrawals. Also, in the case the Optimistic Rollup is successful and holds a significant amount of value, they are prone to attacks.\n\nIn contrast, ZK-Rollups use validity proofs, rather than fraud proofs, to process the transactions on-chain and provide users with immediate confirmation that transactions are valid and immutable.\n\nWho\u2019s already using Immutable X?\n\nNumerous blockchain games and NFT marketplaces have already adopted Immutable X to improve their user experiences.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Now Bitcoin Price Analyst Too\n\nEthereum (ETH) Co-founder Vitalik Buterin keeps criticizing the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, though agreeing that a lack of correlation between the rise in bitcoin (BTC) price and the coin\u2019s halving isn\u2019t enough to do away with this popular and disputed model.\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot.\n\nThe theory that the halving causes a price rise is \u201cunfalsifiable\u201d due to the inconsistency in price increases, Buterin tweeted on Sunday.\n\nPlanB, the model\u2019s author, disagreed with Buterin\u2019s opinion, writing that in the S2F terms, halvings make BTC scarcer, arguing that it\u2019s more about the average price levels than the peaks.\n\nQuite a discussion has been led following the statement, with the model\u2019s supporters, critics, and those in between chiming in. In reply to Buterin, Twitter user Ricardo Lopes argues that the lack of correlation argument is not sufficient to disprove the model because \u201cit\u2019s not what the model projects. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to imply a peak is due to the halving event, rather that each period between halvings sees different orders of magnitude due to different supply,\u201d he writes, and adds: \u201cFalsifiable if that no longer happens on a new period.\u201d\n\nAll this goes back to multiple narratives surrounding Bitcoin halvings, as well as possible outcomes, one of the most popular of which is that the coin\u2019s price will significantly rise. According to the stock-to-flow model, when a halving happens, the stock-to-flow ratio doubles and the model price increases.\n\nPer this model, Bitcoin was initially set to jump to USD 100,000 before Christmas 2021. Also, according to the updated model, Bitcoin will hit USD 288,000 in a few years. Just two weeks ago, the model was updated with a new data point \u2013 a red dot \u2013 indicating that the new bull cycle has seemingly begun and BTC might reach USD 100,000 in a year.\n\nMeanwhile, as reported, in four years since the second halving in 2016, BTC price increased by 1,364%.\n\nThis is not the first time Buterin criticized the S2F model, as he expressed his dislike for it as a tool to predict BTC\u2019s price before. PlanB said at the time that the Ethereum Co-founder ought to be a critic, as liking S2F would mean saying ETH has no value.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin is not the only member of the community with a dose of skepticism, as this group includes the well-known Bitfinex trader J0E007 who said that the second model is a step in the right direction, as well as Eric Wall, Chief Investment Officer at crypto asset management firm Arcane Assets, who claimed that the S2F model is based on the flawed logic that \u201calmost no one understands.\u201d\n\nAt pixel time (11:39 UTC), BTC trades at USD 9,143 and is down by 3% in a day and by 6% in a week. The price dropped by 3% in a month, erasing almost all its gains in the past 12 months.\n\n___\n\nHere are a few more reactions from this ongoing debate:\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n___\n\nLearn more: Did Vitalik Buterin Just Say That Ethereum Is Now More Important Than Bitcoin?"

        "title": "Ethereum Won't Hide From Quantum Computers Behind PoS Shield - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Won\u2019t Hide From Quantum Computers Behind PoS Shield\n\nThere are two mechanisms by which a quantum computer might violate a cryptoasset. Quantum computing poses a threat that concerns PoS and PoW in equal measure. It\u2019s difficult to predict whether such a threat would emerge suddenly or gradually. Source: Adobe/Bartek Wr\u00f3blewski\n\nQuantum computing has long been regarded as Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s \u2018bogeyman.\u2019 The popular fear is that, as secure as Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptoassets are in terms of standard cryptography, quantum computers could provide additional means of breaking them.\n\nOne other popular assumption is that, because they don\u2019t use PoW, proof-of-stake cryptoassets such as Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Tron (TRX) (and eventually, Ethereum (ETH)) aren\u2019t as vulnerable to quantum computing attacks as networks like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). However, according to a variety of computer scientists and crypto experts, it\u2019s not the consensus mechanism of a coin which creates the biggest risk in terms of quantum computers, but rather the signature system.\n\nIn other words, given that the vast majority of PoS cryptoassets also use (non-quantum) cryptographic signature systems to sign individual transactions, they\u2019re nearly as vulnerable to quantum hacks as their PoW rivals. That said, the advent of sufficiently powerful quantum computers is still some way off, while their emergence is likely to incentivize a widespread shift to post-quantum cryptography.\n\n51% attacks and signature attacks\n\nThe important point to make when considering whether PoS is less vulnerable to quantum computing is that there are two mechanisms by which a quantum computer might violate a cryptoasset:\n\nThe mechanism used to win the right to publish a block of transactions and to achieve distributed consensus (e.g. PoW or PoS) The mechanism used to authorize individual transactions (typically involving some public/private key signature system)\n\nIt\u2019s the first mechanism that affects PoW more than PoS, with Bitcoin and other proof-of-work coins theoretically vulnerable to a quantum computer-driven 51% attack.\n\nThat said, Marek Naro\u017cniak \u2014 a physics PhD student at New York University who has worked with Prof. Tim Byrne on research into quantum computing \u2014 explains that talk of a 51% attack perpetrated by quantum computers still remains theoretical.\n\n\u201cIf someone has a sufficiently large quantum computer and wishes to perform a 51% attack \u2014 consisting of outperforming remaining miners and producing invalid blocks \u2014 it would have to be a really massive quantum machine. The reason for that is that Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work is based on a hashing function for which there is no known efficient quantum algorithm [that can reverse it],\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nBut while Bitcoin\u2019s weakness compared to PoS cryptoassets is still pretty hypothetical, quantum computing poses another threat that concerns PoS and PoW in equal measure.\n\n\u201cEven if consensus requires no cryptographic \u2018work\u2019 [in the case of PoS] it still does rely on cryptography which is currently mainly based on elliptic curves which are vulnerable to quantum algorithms. An attacker with sufficiently powerful quantum computers could break other validators signatures and still mess with the consensus,\u201d said Naro\u017cniak.\n\nThis is a concern echoed by other commentators. In an analysis published by Deloitte, Bram Bosch wrote that around four million bitcoins are stored in addresses that use p2pk and p2pkh scripting, which is vulnerable to attacks via quantum computers.\n\n\u201cPresently, about 25% of bitcoins in circulation are vulnerable to a quantum attack. Even in case one\u2019s own bitcoins are safe, one might still be impacted if other people will not (or cannot) take the same protection measures,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nAgain, vulnerable scripting is something that could potentially affect PoS cryptoassets as well as Bitcoin, even if quantum computers are far from being widely available. And even without older schemes such as p2pk(h), Shor\u2019s algorithm \u2014 an algorithm for quantum computers \u2014 could be used to break many public-key cryptography systems.\n\n\u201cIf one has a sufficiently large and reliable quantum computer it would be possible to break the digital signature used to sign Bitcoin transactions. Such a person could use the modified Shor\u2019s algorithm to sign transactions which take other people\u2019s coins and transfer them at will,\u201d said Marek Naro\u017cniak.\n\nHe added that the worst thing about this \u201cis that it could not even be detected,\u201d and that PoS is just as vulnerable as PoW: \u201cIt would still be possible to produce transactions by breaking cryptographic signatures and producing transactions using someone else\u2019s outputs.\u201d\n\nQuantum-resistant solutions\n\nFortunately, current cryptographic research is more than aware of the theoretical threat posed by quantum computing, so you probably shouldn\u2019t start selling all of your crypto just yet.\n\nResearchers at Imperial College London published a paper in 2019 that outlined a protocol that would allow Bitcoin \u201cusers to securely move their funds from non-quantum-resistant outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, Australian computer scientists at Monash Blockchain Technology Centre and CSIRO\u2019s Data61 developed what they described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most efficient blockchain protocol that is \u2026 secure against quantum computers.\u201d\n\nSo solutions seem to be available, should a viable quantum computer emerge that could realistically be used to threaten PoW and PoS cryptoassets. And for most commentators, it\u2019s more likely that existing cryptos will shift to using post-quantum algorithms, rather than new post-quantum cryptoassets appear to take their places.\n\n\u201cI think the latter scenario of existing cryptocurrencies shifting to the use of post-quantum cryptography is going to be far more likely,\u201d said cryptocurrency journalist and analyst Roger Huang. \u201cIt occurs to me that it will be much harder to build the legitimacy, network effects, and exchange/off-exchange volume of something like BTC from scratch than it is for BTC to just adopt post-quantum cryptography.\u201d\n\nFor Bram Bosch, it still may be some time before the Bitcoin community (or any other) is compelled to actually implement solutions for quantum computing risks.\n\n\u201cThe threat of a quantum attack would have to be very obvious and serious before the Bitcoin community would gain consensus on this matter. It\u2019s difficult to predict whether such a threat would emerge suddenly or gradually and as such, whether there would be time to react at all,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what\u2019s interesting about the danger posed by quantum computing: it\u2019s unknown, unpredictable quality. But given that it\u2019s a risk mostly to the signatures used by pretty much all cryptoassets, we do know it will be a threat to PoS and PoW cryptos alike.\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Price Might Hit USD 1M Sooner Than a Quantum Computer Attacks\n\n\u2013 Can Quantum Computing Kill Bitcoin?\n\n\u2013 Crypto Security in 2021: More Threats Against DeFi and Individual Users\n\n\u2013 Crypto Tech In 2021: Focus on Scalability, Privacy and Usability\n\n\u2013 Proof-of-Disagreement: Bitcoin\u2019s Work vs. Ethereum\u2019s Planned Staking\n\n\u2013 Here Are the Ways Governments Could Attack Bitcoin \u2013 and None of them Sound Hot"

        "title": "What is ERC-20? A comprehensive guide - OKX",
        "content": "Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is an open-source project where developers can create and launch decentralized applications (DApps). Although there are many positives to the Ethereum network, it does have its issues. For instance, the network is prone to bottlenecks during peak times. As a result, transaction fees and wait times are relatively high. This led to the creation of ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20) tokens.\n\nThe token standard was designed to increase efficiency and make building on the Ethereum blockchain easier.\n\nWhat is an ERC-20 token?\n\nERC-20 tokens are sets of fungible digital tokens that reside on the Ethereum blockchain. This technical standard helps develop smart contracts on the blockchain, enabling developers to create and deploy tokens on Ethereum. The ERC-20 token standard is a series of rules developers must strictly follow to ensure that the tokens created and subsequently launched are compatible. This allows users and developers to become active participants in any service, application, or protocol on the Ethereum network.\n\nEach ERC-20 token serves its purpose within the ecosystem and can be interchanged across Ethereum's network. The creation of this token standard streamlined the development phase, helping token creators interact between applications and tokens.\n\nHistory of ERC-20 token standard\n\nFabian Vogelsteller initially proposed the idea of ERC-20 tokens. He submitted the proposal via Ethereum's GitHub page. He tagged an \"Ethereum Request Comment\", and it was assigned the number \"20\" because it was the 20th comment on the page. Following approval from the Ethereum developer's community, Vogelsteller's proposal was implemented under the name \"Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-20). However, it is known as ERC-20.\n\nSince the proposal's implementation in 2015, smart contract tokens designed on the Ethereum blockchain must comply with the guidelines.\n\nHow ERC-20 tokens work\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard was designed to function with smart contracts or pre-arranged agreements that mechanically execute once definite conditions are met. Smart contracts enabled by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are similar to vending machines. They are programmed to undertake predetermined actions under certain situations. That is how ERC-20 tokens work.\n\nOnce instructions or guidelines are followed, ERC-20 tokens can be created and issued. They are fungible \u2014 one token is equal in value to another. These tokens not only allow a seamless exchange of assets, but they also confer governance rights to holders. And are a rewarding passive income source (staking).\n\nBenefits of ERC-20 to the Ethereum network\n\nThe introduction of the ERC-20 token standard has proven to be a game-changer for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market. Some of the benefits of ERC-20 tokens include the following:\n\nInteroperability\n\nInteroperability is a sticking point of the crypto industry. The inability to conveniently exchange assets across multiple chains makes the transfer process extremely complex, halting blockchain's global adoption. ERC-20 allows tokens that follow the guidelines to communicate and exchange assets effortlessly. If you own the ERC-20 token for a particular project, you can conveniently exchange it for another token for a different project.\n\nInteroperability promotes communication, faster token transfers, and a cost-effective token exchange process.\n\nAdvanced security\n\nSince ERC-20 tokens adhere to the same instructions and are built on Ethereum, they benefit from the network's security features, such as \u2014 decentralization, immutability, and transparency. These security features disable malicious users from manipulating the token supply, transfers, withdrawals, or validation process.\n\nTransparency\n\nLike the blockchain, the underlying technology of ERC-20 tokens is transparent. All ERC-20 transaction details are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, making it possible to track token movement easily.\n\nIt continues; it helps determine the authenticity of transactions and tokens, providing token owners and developers with a higher degree of security.\n\nHigh liquidity\n\nHigh liquidity means ERC-20 tokens can be bought and sold on centralized and decentralized exchanges. The availability makes these tokens a preferred choice for investors keen on profiting from the volatile nature of the crypto market.\n\nCustomizable and easy-to-use\n\nToken creators or designers can customize tokens to serve and meet specific purposes. They can set the total token supply, add unique functions to the tokens, set decimal points, and pick a symbol.\n\nIn addition to seamless customization, ERC-20 tokens are incredibly easy to use. Tokens can be created and easily managed with tools like MetaMask, MyETherWallet, etc. The simplicity and exceptional availability make them accessible to users and developers, which promotes innovation within the ecosystem.\n\nCons of ERC-20 token standard\n\nLimited flexibility\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard aims to increase compatibility and stability. However, it also limits functionality levels. For instance, ERC-20 tokens are unable to complete certain complex tasks. This poses a considerable concern for developers that require an additional level of flexibility for their tokens.\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nTransacting ERC-20 tokens can be an expensive task. Gas fees are required to initiate and complete any transaction, and depending on the state of the Ethereum network, these gas fees can be too steep for the average user. The fluctuations in gas fees make it extremely difficult to predict the exact cost of transactions, dispelling the desire to own and transact these tokens, especially for low-income investors.\n\nAbsence of universal acceptance\n\nNot every crypto exchange accepts ERC-20 tokens. While the token standard has garnered vast support, certain exchanges do not accept or list them on their platforms, thus limiting the token's liquidity.\n\nPopular ERC-20 tokens\n\nSince implementing the ERC-20 proposal from Fabian Vogelsteller, we've witnessed an influx of these tokens released into the market. These are some of the most popular ones:\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nTether is a stablecoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token standard. It's designed to provide faster transaction throughput and cheaper transactions. According to the Tether website, the token is pegged to the U.S. dollar in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe team claims to achieve this ratio by holding an equivalent of the token in U.S. dollars in a separate, safe account. It is used to move funds across exchanges and has become one of the most popular trading pairs on centralized exchanges.\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap is a decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) that runs as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. $UNI \u2014 is an ERC-20 token and is the native currency of the DEX. It's also worth mentioning that Uniswap is powered by an automated market maker (AMM) model.\n\nUnlike centralized exchanges, Uniswap has no order book or a centralized structure that sets trades.\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nNot only is BNB an ERC-20 token, but it is the native token of the reputable Binance centralized exchange. BNB serves several purposes in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nThe increased popularity of the BNB token has led to its increased availability and acceptance on various decentralized and centralized exchanges.\n\nOther ERC token standards\n\nERC-20 is the most popular token standard. However, there are slightly less prominent ones that exist. They include:\n\nERC-777: the ERC-777 standard enables an urgent recovery option if a user's private keys are missing. It also enhances the privacy and anonymity of transactions.\n\nERC-721: this standard was designed to issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since ERC-20 tokens cannot issue non-fungible assets as it is fungible, ERC-71 was proposed as an alternative.\n\nERC-223: the ERC-223 standard was proposed as a viable solution to losing tokens sent to the wrong address. The ERC-223 standard allows you to retrieve tokens sent to incorrect addresses.\n\nERC-1155: this token standard allows developers to create and launch more efficient transfer tokens. The ERC-1155 saves hundreds of dollars in transaction fees and is compatible with NFTs and utility tokens.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat does ERC-20 mean?\n\nERC-20 means Ethereum Request Comment, number 20. It is the technical standard for smart contract tokens created on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat's the difference between ETH and ERC-20?\n\nETH or Ether is the native token on the Ethereum project and serves as a payment currency for validating transactions on the network. ERC-20, on the other hand, is a token standard for building smart contracts-powered tokens running on the Ethereum network.\n\nIs ERC-20 the same as Ethereum?\n\nNo, ERC-20 is not the same as Ethereum. It is a technical token standard developers must follow to create and issue tokens on Ethereum.\n\nWhich is the most popular ERC-20 wallet?\n\nThere are dozens of prominent ERC-20 token wallets, but the OKX Wallet edges others as the most popular one at the moment."

        "content": "Binance Chain is On \u2018a Parabola\u2019, Surpassing Ethereum in Several Metrics\n\nCentralized Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has been outperforming decentralized Ethereum (ETH) lately in several network metrics, including daily active addresses, daily transactions, daily tokens transfers, and average gas price \u2013 but not in the number of unique addresses.\n\nSource: A screenshot, Instagram/binance\n\nSince its launch in September 2020, Binance Smart Chain has been much discussed as a potential competitor to Ethereum, particularly given the latter\u2019s well-known high fee issue. What\u2019s more, different projects \u2013 including decentralized finance (DeFi) ones \u2013 have been recently expanding to BSC or migrating to it from Ethereum, citing high fees as a cause.\n\nAnd now it seems that BSC has been swiftly overtaking Ethereum in a number of network metrics.\n\nPer Ethercan.io data, daily active Ethereum addresses reached 648,188 on Sunday, April 25. In comparison, the highest recorded number was 719,094 in January 2018.\n\nWhile relatively stagnating between September and late December 2020, the daily number of unique addresses that were active on the BSC started rising, shooting up since February 2021, per BscScan.com. Its peak was 1.08m just five days ago, standing at 729,221 on April 25 \u2013 over 81,000 more than Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum unique addresses have seen a constant and significant rise since mid-2017. Between April 25 that year and the same date this year, the unique addresses increased 9,813% to 149.32m.\n\nBSC unique addresses jumped 4,735.3% between mid-February and yesterday, going from 1.38m to 67.08m. Despite the smaller number, the percentage is nearly half of the increase seen by Ethereum, but gained in much shorter time.\n\nThe Ethereum daily transactions chart shows 1.39m total transaction on Sunday. Three days prior, it reached a high of 1.57m.\n\nBSC has seen a significantly higher number here on the same day. Daily transactions were 7.2m, down from its all-time high of 9.1m, reached four days earlier.\n\nThe number of ERC-20 tokens transferred daily is currently lower than the previously seen, short-lasting all-time highs, the highest among them being 1.57m in June 2018. On Sunday, this number was 938,826, recording a drop from the days prior.\n\nMeanwhile, 8.1m BEP-20 tokens were transferred on Sunday, down from the April 21 ATH of 10.3m, and up 2,733% since the year started.\n\nThe daily average gas price used on Ethereum on Sunday was 55.4 gwei \u2013 the lowest it\u2019s been since the year began. The highest recorded in 2021 was February\u2019s 373.8 Gwei, while its short-lived all-time high is 939.59 gwei from 2016.\n\nThis picture is quite different over on BSC. While peaking for one day to 305 Gwei in late August, the daily average gas price has been relatively stable since, then gradually dropping since February. On April 25, it was 6.7 gwei.\n\n\u201cBSC activity is on a monster parabola with no signs of stopping,\u201d wrote Andrew K\u00f8ng of Mechanism Capital. \u201cIt is apparent that while the pie is growing, BSC is capturing the [lion\u2019s] share of the new retail entrants.\u201d\n\nAs for Ethereum network activity metrics, K\u00f8ng argued that the growth doesn\u2019t yet seem parabolic, that the metrics are only just starting to surpass the last cycle peak, and \u201cthat there may still be a lot of room to grow.\u201d\n\nHe also likened the arguments of BSC being only for scams and Ponzi tokens to claims that Bitcoin (BTC) is only good for drugs and criminal activity.\n\nOthers noted BSC\u2019s \u201cexponential\u201d growth as well. \u2018K\u2019 argued that \u201cthe argument of \u201csee how much demand this copy of [ETH] has, this is bullish for [ETH]\u201d is just plain wrong.\u201d Users who care about decentralization and are fine with paying USD 100 per transaction are already deep in DeFi, they said, but those who don\u2019t care and are currently priced out of Ethereum \u201care 99% of all future DeFi users.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su said that he thinks that \u201cBSC has been one of the most bullish catalysts ever for ETH\u201d: \u201cMetaverse is not zero sum. Going to Mars is not bearish for Earth.\u201d\n\nAt 16:22 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 2,484, having appreciated 6% in a day and 11% in a week. Binance coin (BNB) also turned green in both time frames, going up 5% in a day and 11% in a week, and changing hands at USD 534. BNB also rallied by 110% in a month and 3,190% in a year, compared with ETH\u2019s 46% monthly gain and a 1,180% jump in a year.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Developers On Why They Don\u2019t See Cardano & Binance Chain As Rivals\n\n\u2013 How Bitcoin and DeFi are Completely Different Phenomena\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Won\u2019t Hide From Quantum Computers Behind PoS Shield\n\n\u2013 New Generation of \u2018Bitconnectors\u2019 Flock into SafeMoon Despite Warnings\n\n\u2013 Too Costly Ethereum is Pushing DeFi Users Away, Fuelling BNB Rally\n\n\u2013 Binance Smart Chain Put to Political Test, as More ETH-Based Projects Use It"

        "title": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Optimism - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Optimism\n\nSource: Adobe/woodpencil\n\nEthereum (ETH)\u2019s scaling challenges have led to exorbitant gas fees that are increasingly excluding people from using the network to access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nFortunately, there are layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions that are addressing Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes by taking weight off the main chain. Optimism, for example, is a layer-2 scaling solution that is helping Ethereum run computations off-chain and only publish transaction data on-chain in a bid to drastically reduce gas fees.\n\nRead on to learn more about Optimism and how to use the layer-2 protocol to save on Ethereum transaction fees.\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum network. The scaling solution works by moving transactions and computations from layer-1 (L1) onto a second layer, thus reducing transaction fees and increasing network throughput.\n\nLayer 1 (L1) is the base protocol (the Ethereum blockchain), while Layer 2 (L2) is any protocol built on top of Ethereum.\n\nSince the transactional data is broadcast onto the Ethereum mainnet, the structural integrity of the network remains intact. However, Optimism allows you to transact in milliseconds and save up to 10x on gas fees.\n\nFrom a developer\u2019s perspective, you get to reuse programming languages on Ethereum with little to no changes in the code.\n\nOptimism uses Optimistic Rollups, which rely on aggregators to compile batches of transactions off-chain and transmit them to a smart contract on-chain via fraud proofs. Conversely, fraud proofs prevent invalid state transitions from happening.\n\nTo ensure deterministic smart contract execution between the mainnet and L2 layer, Optimism uses OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine). This is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible execution environment designed for use in layer-2 solutions.\n\nThe OVM feature acts as a repository for OVM contracts and ensures any functionality between L1 and L2 remains consistent. In other words, any action executed on Optimism is eventually mirrored in L1.\n\nRemember, Optimism is EVM-compatible and, therefore, allows for seamless and near-instant transfers from L1 to L2. However, transactions going from L2 to L1 will take roughly a week to allow for potential fraud proofs.\n\nWith the OVM 2.0 upgrade, which occurred in November, EVM equivalence was introduced to Optimism, bringing it to almost 1:1 parity with Ethereum. EVM compatibility required Optimism to continuously modify, even reimplement, lower-level code that the layer-1 supporting infrastructure relies upon.\n\nOn the other hand, EVM equivalence bridges the gap between Ethereum\u2019s L1 infrastructure network effects and the L2 execution environment. This upgrade makes Optimism in complete compliance with the base Ethereum protocol.\n\nHow to use Optimism to save on Ethereum gas fees\n\nThe easiest way to start using Optimism is through the popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask. Here\u2019s how!\n\n1. Open your MetaMask wallet browser extension.\n\n2. Select the dropdown \u2018Ethereum Mainnet\u2019 at the top of the wallet.\n\n3. Should Optimism not appear in your list, choose \u2018Add Network.\u2019\n\n4. Add the following details:\n\nNetwork name: Optimistic Ethereum\n\nRPC URL: https://mainnet.optimism.io\n\nChain ID: 10\n\nCurrency: ETH\n\nExplorer: https://optimistic.etherscan.io\n\n5. Click \u2018Save,\u2019 and you will be connected to Optimistic Ethereum.\n\nTo start holding and using Optimistic Ethereum tokens, you will need to bridge your ERC-20 assets to Optimistic Ethereum using the Optimism Gateway.\n\nTo access the Optimism Gateway, access \u200b\u200bgateway.optimism.io, connect your MetaMask wallet and swap your tokens from the mainnet onto layer-2 in the same way you would swap tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap (UNI).\n\nWith the ETH bridged into Optimism, you can interact with protocols in the same way as on the main chains, inheriting Ethereum\u2019s structural integrity and features.\n\nOptimism-supported applications\n\nDozen of dapps (decentralized applications) have already adopted Optimism to provide a more affordable user experience to their users.\n\nHere is a list of popular Optimism-supported applications:\n\nDecentralized apps\n\nUniswap\n\nSynthetix\n\n1inch\n\nLyra\n\nPerpetual Protocol\n\nKwenta\n\nGelato\n\nWallets\n\nCoinbase Wallet\n\nMetaMask\n\nRainbow\n\nEncrypted Ink\n\nTrust Wallet\n\nimToken\n\nTokenPocket\n\nRabby\n\nNFTs\n\nQuixotic\n\nOptiPunks\n\nCircular Art\n\nDope Wars\n\nOptimistic bunnies\n\nOptimistic Loogies\n\ntofuNFT.\n\nGas fees on Optimism\n\nAccording to Optimism\u2019s team, baseline user transactions are between 10-50x cheaper and are expected to improve over time. However, the baseline costs are just a benchmark. There are capacity constraints on Optimism that must be controlled by a variable cost.\n\nThe control is through the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 pricing mechanism where should demand rise, the protocol will increase fees until daily transactions fall back within the limit. Note that gas is affected by several factors, such as gas price and gas consumed by the transaction.\n\nTo learn more about how to reduce Ethereum gas fees using an L2 solution, check out the first piece of our layer-2 scaling solution covering Arbitrum.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3\n\n\u2013 How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Immutable X\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum and Uniswap Tank Despite Optimism News\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin\u2019s \u2018Endgame\u2019 Roadmap Will \u2018Take Years to Play Out\u2019\n\n\u2013 A Multichain World Is Key to the Success of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse\n\n\n\n\u2013 DeFi Trends in 2022: Growing Interest, Regulation & New Roles for DAOs, DEXes, NFTs, and Gaming\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions for 2022"

Source: Trading View\n\nETH, the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum blockchain, was last changing hands around $1,275, up around 6.5% in the last seven days.\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency gained 6.5% alone on Wednesday as traditional risk assets like US equities rallied in the wake of a more dovish-than-expected message from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Jerome Powell on the prospect for further rate hikes in the coming months. Price predictions have become increasingly bullish in the wake of the latest move higher.\n\nEthereum is trading a tad lower on the day on Thursday amid profit-taking, but has gained nearly 18% since printing a double bottom earlier this month under $1,100. Thursday saw the release of fresh US data (Core PCE Price Index) that supported the idea that inflation in the US is easing faster than expected, supporting the idea that the US central bank won\u2019t have to be as hawkish from now on.

Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum remains locked within a downs trend channel that has been suppressing the price action since late summer 2022. It will need to muster a decisive break above $1,500 to get above this trend channel. The cryptocurrency continues to reel from the impact of FTX\u2019s abrupt collapse early last month and continues to hang over sentiment, so betting on a swift more than 25% rally from current levels may be a little premature.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum is able to muster a break above its current downtrend, that would open the door to a test of the September highs in the $1,800 area, as well as a test of August\u2019s peak \u201cMerge\u201d optimism highs in the $2,000 area.

Developers building on these testnets have been migrating their projects in development to the Goerli and Sepolia testnets, both of which will continue to be used in the years ahead.

        "content": "How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: StarkWare\n\nSource: AdobeStock / Jay\n\nOver 7,000 decentralized applications (dapps) are currently operating on the Ethereum (ETH) network. However, the Ethereum network was not originally designed for such a workload. Ethereum dapps have suffered from the chain\u2019s scalability issues, which have caused transaction speeds to slow down and gas fees to skyrocket.\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions are being deployed to address these issues. Starkware is one of the most promising ones.\n\nWhat is Starkware?\n\nStarkWare, founded in January 2018 by Eli Ben-Sasson, Uri Kolodny, Michael Riabzev, and Alessandro Chiesa, is a developer of layer-2 scaling services that allows for high throughput and reduced transaction fees on layer-1 blockchains.\n\nLayer 1 (L1) is the base protocol (the Ethereum blockchain), while Layer 2 (L2) is any protocol built on top of Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to improving scalability, Starkware also brings increased privacy to Ethereum using its STARK technology, which includes products like StarkEx and StarkNet.\n\nStarkEx is a layer-2 scaling engine built with Cairo and SHARP that helps scale cryptoasset exchanges and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms via ZK-Rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups). It can handle spot and derivative trading, payments, and NFTs minting. DiversiFi, dYdX, Sorare, and Immutable X have all deployed StarkEx on their platforms.\n\nAccording to Starkware\u2019s website, StarkEx has USD 1.1bn in total value locked (TVL), settling USD 426bn worth of trades and facilitating about 123m transactions. These transactions were processed for minimal fees.\n\nStarkNet is a decentralized and trustless layer-2 STARK-based ZK-Rollup that allows developers to create and run smart contracts on its platform. Decentralized applications can be deployed independently on StarkNet just like on Ethereum for extremely low fees with increased speed and high throughput. StarkNet also aims to be interoperable with the Ethereum main chain and other layer-2 solutions, enabling liquidity for the general layer-2 crypto market.\n\nBeyond scalability, the technology behind Starkware\u2019s products is aimed at retaining security even when quantum computing becomes mainstream. This addresses concerns raised about the security of public-key cryptography employed in many cryptoassets when faced with an attack of the immense power of quantum computing. Starkware uses lightweight cryptographic hash functions, which makes its products fast and quantum-secure.\n\nHow does Starkware work?\n\nTo understand how Starkware works, we need to first explore how the technology behind its two major products work, these being StarkEx and StarkNet.\n\nStarkEx and StarkNet are based on ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) and ZK-Rollups.\n\nZK-STARKs enables users to share and prove the authenticity of a data computation publicly without revealing the contents of the data. It\u2019s like allowing third parties to verify your banking information without revealing it to them. ZK-STARKs are an improvement of the so-called zk-snarks, as the latter requires a trusted third party to set up the proof system, hence, leaving a possibility for that trusted third party to compromise the privacy of the system.\n\nZK-STARKs, on the other hand, remove the need for a trusted third party to set up the proof system, enabling the sharing of data to be decentralized and trustless.\n\nOne of its benefits for blockchain systems includes improving scalability by taking smart contracts computation and storage off-chain for the STARK system to generate proofs with leaner cryptographic hash functions. These proofs are then sent on-chain to the blockchain network for verification \u2014 in turn, increasing transaction speed and reducing costs for users.\n\nZK-Rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions utilized by StarkEx for increasing throughput and speed on the Ethereum network. ZK-Rollups bundle/rollup hundreds of transactions off-chain into a single transaction and generate a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) proof that is posted to the main chain for verification. This reduces the number of transactions being processed on the Ethereum main chain and, in turn, reduces gas fees.\n\nHowever, the ZK-Rollup utilized on Starkware generates a STARK proof instead of SNARK that is sent to the main chain for validation.\n\nHow does Starkware differ from other Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions?\n\nStarkware\u2019s difference compared to other Ethereum layer-2 solutions is seen in the combination of ZK-Rollups and its invented ZK-STARKs.\n\nThe three layer-2 scaling solutions utilized by most Web 3 platforms are Plasma, Optimistic Rollups, and ZK-Rollups. Plasma and Optimistic Rollups both scale the Ethereum network using fraud proofs. However, fraud proofs usually take a very long time to confirm withdrawal requests from users. Their computation is complex and comes with big data sizes.\n\nZK-Rollups \u2014 zk-SNARKs in this case \u2014 address this challenge, through validity proofs that allow instant withdrawals and reduce data size. Although it comes with a downside.\n\nBefore now, typical layer-2 ZK-Rollups are unable to execute smart contracts, which facilitate decentralized applications. However, the emergence of Starkware\u2019s STARK is beginning to change the outlook.\n\nZK-SNARKs reduce data size and use elliptic curve cryptography for privacy, Starkware solutions use cryptographic hash functions, which makes it quantum-resistant and trustless. But its STARK-based proofs usually have larger proof sizes, making them more expensive to verify.\n\nWho is already using Starkware?\n\nNumerous notable dapps are already using StarkWare\u2019s scaling solutions to provide a better product for their users.\n\nDiversiFi: a decentralized exchange that allows you to invest, trade, and swap tokens on Ethereum without paying the expensive gas fees required by the network. DiversiFi makes use of the innovative StarkEx scaling solution to provide high-speed, low-latency, and gas-free self-custodial trading.\n\ndYdX: one of the most popular decentralized exchanges (DEXes) in the crypto market, offering autonomous derivatives trading. dYdX offers layer-2 perpetual smart contracts via the StarkEx scalability engine, enabling traders to enjoy reduced gas and trading fees, more trading pairs, reduced minimum trade size, instant trade settlements, higher leverage, and lower liquidation penalties.\n\nSorare: a fantasy football NFT gaming platform on the Ethereum network that allows users to buy, sell, trade, and manage a virtual football team with digital players. StarkEx allows instant offers, rewards, claims, and transfers on Sorare while also reducing gas fees.\n\nTo learn more about how to reduce Ethereum gas fees using an L2 solution, check out the first piece of our layer-2 scaling solution covering Arbitrum.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Optimism\n\n\u2013 How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: Immutable X\n\n\n\n\u2013 ETH Rises with Broader Market as Ethereum Fees Hit a 7-Month Low\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3\n\n\n\n\u2013 DeFi Trends in 2022: Growing Interest, Regulation & New Roles for DAOs, DEXes, NFTs, and Gaming\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions for 2022"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Now a Billionaire as ETH Prices Surge\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin appears to have become a billionaire \u2013 as the latest ETH price surge saw the token reach a new all-time high, pushing the value of his crypto holdings well over the USD 1 bn mark.\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a screenshot, YouTube/ETHWORLD.\n\nAnd in addition to a main account that now holds over USD 1bn worth of ETH, it appears that his second account contains ETH tokens worth a further USD 2.8m.\n\nAnd Buterin\u2019s crypto wealth does not end there. During an ask-me-anything session on the Ethereum subreddit back in 2020, Buterin revealed the extent of his non-ETH crypto holdings, explaining that he held smaller positions in \u201cnon-ethereum-ecosystem tokens\u201d including bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin (BTC), dogecoin (DOGE), zcash (ZEC) and omisego (OMG).

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Shoots Up 11% \u2013 $2,000 Incoming?\n\nEther could break past $2000 soon if it sustains the bullish momentum it has created over the past day. Within 24 hours, ETH has gained 11% to trade at $1,530 at the time of writing. Ether\u2019s gains come amid a major recovery across the cryptocurrency market as the crypto market cap surpasses $1 trillion.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nEther has made a double-digit gain over the past 24 hours, allowing the token to recover the losses after traders started selling to avoid risks related to the Merge. ETH is now on the way to breaking past the psychological level of $2,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has traded in the green zone over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has managed to break past $20K for the first time since October 7, and altcoins are also rallying as traders take advantage of the spike in volatility.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ether has traded between $1,378 to $1,543, indicating high volatility. ETH\u2019s trading volumes stand at $27.44 billion after triple-digit gains over the past day. Ethereum\u2019s market cap is at $184 billion, with a market dominance of 17.83%.\n\nLike most large-cap cryptocurrencies, Ether has been consolidating over the past few weeks, with the prices barely changing as volatility dropped to notably low levels. However, as stock markets rallied yesterday amid the release of earnings reports by tech firms, the crypto market volatility has also increased in response.\n\nThe technical indicators prove that ETH is indeed in bullish territory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI0 is at 59, showing that the token is leaning toward the overbought zone. The buying pressure witnessed over the past 24 hours could have created this trend. On the other hand, the RSI level does not show a high risk of a trend reversal.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is also in the bullish zone, indicating that Ether could continue gaining. If the rally is sustained, a push to $1,550 is likely, after which the price could gain to $1,750.\n\nOn the other hand, the buying pressure could be exhausted if the macroeconomic factors attributed to the recent rally are no longer in play. If the price of ETH retraces, the token will drop to $1,460, and the token could test lower support levels at $1,360.\n\nDiversify your portfolio with these altcoins\n\nPresales are usually a good way to diversify your crypto portfolio. Some of the hottest presales in the crypto market right now are for Dash 2 Trade, IMPT and Calvaria.\n\nDash 2 Trade is a platform that provides investors with trading signals that ease their investment decisions. The D2T presale has already raised over $2.5 million after completing the first stage.\n\n\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade Now\n\nThe other major presale that is happening right now is for IMPT. IMPT is the native token for IMPT.io. IMPT.io is a project tapping blockchain technology to lower carbon emissions by streamlining the carbon credits market. The IMPT presale has entered the second stage after raising $10.8 million.\n\n\n\nVisit IMPT Now"

        "content": "T-Mobile Parent Company Launches Ethereum Staking Validator\n\nSource: T-mobile\n\nDeutsche Telekom (DT), the parent company of wireless network operator T-Mobile, has announced that its subsidiary T-Systems MMS will support the Ethereum blockchain network by infrastructure in the form of validator nodes.\n\nIn a press release , the German tech giant revealed that T-Systems will also provide liquid Ether (ETH) staking services through a partnership with ETH staking service provider StakeWise.\n\nThis partnership will see the DT subsidiary participate in the governance of the decentralized application (dApp) as it has joined the StakeWise decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\n\nAccording to DT, the move is intended to cement the company\u2019s presence in the blockchain space while contributing to the transparency of the second largest blockchain network.\n\nThe move is also to show support for the Ethereum network\u2019s transition to using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. T-Systems MMS already maintains other \u201csustainable blockchain networks\u201d such as Flow, Celo, and Polkadot.\n\n\u201cAfter collaborating with Flow, Celo, and Polkadot, we are now taking the next decisive step in the blockchain world and are doing pioneering work here with Ethereum. As a node operator, our entry into liquid staking and the close collaboration with a DAO is a novelty for Deutsche Telekom\u201d, said Dirk R\u00f6der, Head of Blockchain Solutions Center at T-Systems MMS.\n\nT-Systems MMS is not the only front on which DT is gaining greater footing in the blockchain space. In September, T-Mobile signed a five-year partnership with Helium Network to allow the blockchain-based decentralized wireless service provider to provide its users 5G network with T-Mobile\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts expect more institutional adoption of ETH and the Ethereum blockchain\n\nIn a statement, Kirill Kutakov, the co-founder of StakeWise, noted that he expects strong demand and capital flows in the Ethereum network. He added that the partnership with T-Systems is making the Ethereum ecosystem safer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the move to Proof-of-Stake, we expect strong demand and significantly increasing capital flows in the Ethereum network. We are therefore pleased that T-Systems MMS, as an infrastructure provider, is giving our protocol more reliability and making the Ethereum ecosystem safer overall,\u201d Kutakov remarked."

        "content": "One Old Presentation by Buterin Brings an Unresolved Ethereum Issue Again\n\nAn old speech by Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has resurfaced at a time when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief Gary Gensler is issuing warnings about initial coin offerings (ICOs) being securities.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. Source: a video screenshot, edited by Cryptonews.com\n\nThe Cryptoverse residents have been sharing an old video of Buterin, taken at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in March 2014, or a few months before the Ethereum ICO. In the video, Buterin discusses what ETH represents in the Ethereum ecosystem, describing it as \u201csort of like the reserve currency of the network.\u201d However, he further stated that the sale of ETH had to be delayed for a number of reasons, one of these being of legal nature, saying that:\n\n\u201cSo, from an organizational standpoint, our current situation is that we have an entity registered in Switzerland. And the reason why we\u2019re looking at Switzerland as the jurisdiction is because \u2013 first of all, Switzerland is very well-known for its very friendly banking laws, it is much easier to do anything related to innovative finance [there] than in something like the United States or even Canada.\u201d\n\nHe added that the team was also looking into Panama, which \u201chas some similar properties,\u201d but ultimately decided on Switzerland as it\u2019s \u201cmore stable.\u201d\n\nBitcoiners were quick to pick this up.\n\nHowever, this might not be so simple.\n\nAndrew M. Bailey, Associate Professor at Yale-NUS College, brought back another old statement, this time by crypto researcher Hasu, who wrote in a 2018 blog post:\n\n\u201cWhile most people don\u2019t doubt that the ethereum presale was likely a securities issuance, they argue it is now decentralized enough to no longer fit that bill.\u201d\n\nPer Hasu, insider investing is incentivized by ICOs in general and the structure of the Ethereum presale in particular.\n\nHasu\u2019s article was an addition to another one published that year by lawyer Preston Byrne, in which he stated that \u201cwhether Ether and/or Ripple are in fact investment contracts under the SEC v. W.J. Howey test is now an issue of public concern, with financial services culture hero Gary Gensler arguing that Ether might be classed as a security (properly, an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d), and Coin Center\u2019s Peter van Valkenburgh arguing that it shouldn\u2019t because a sufficient degree of \u201cdecentralization\u201d should exempt a cryptocurrency from regulation.\u201d\n\nAdding that he agreed with Gensler on this point, Byrne also wrote that \u201cunless we can show that this Ether has been sold into the wider market, [\u2026] Ethereum is not as decentralized as we might hope.\u201d\n\nThis \u201clikely has legal consequences and rather undermines the \u201cDecentralization Defence\u201d being put to the regulators by industry lobbyists.\u201d\n\nAll these old arguments have been dug back up at a time when a number of regulators and lawmakers are calling for and working towards tighter regulations of the crypto sector. As reported, Gensler recently asked the SEC staff to investigate \u201can array of potential policy changes\u201d with \u201cat least seven SEC initiatives\u201d probing ICOs, among other areas.\n\n\u201cI think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: \u201cTo the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities \u2014 and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security \u2014 we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply,\u201d Gensler said in his speech this week, adding that he\u2019s agreeing with Clayton.\n\nWalking back\n\nBlockchain company Ripple has been brought into this conversation as well, as the company and its two top executives have been battling the SEC in court for months now over the regulator\u2019s claims that the Ripple-affiliated XRP token is an unregistered security.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one of Ripple\u2019s arguments in the case is that the regulator said that ETH is not a security. The former head of the agency\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance (2017 to 2020), William Hinman, famously gave a speech in 2018, in which he said that ETH and bitcoin (BTC) are not securities, and thus not subject to SEC jurisdiction.\n\nBut the SEC said it\u2019s not the same in the case of XRP.\n\nMeanwhile, today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed:\n\n\u201cJust weeks ago, Hinman filed a sworn affidavit in Court saying the SEC still has \u201cnot taken any position or expressed a view\u201d on ETH\u2019s status\u2026so how is the market supposed to have clarity?!\u201d\n\nHis comments is again a response to the Gensler\u2019s recent speech, for which Michael Arrington, Founder of Arrington XRP Capital, TechCrunch, and Crunchbase, suggested may be \u201cwalking back clarity on ETH, at least.\u201d\n\nCryptonews.com reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.\n\nAt 14:06 UTC, ETH trades at USD 2,614 and is up by almost 4% in a day and 14% in a week.\n\n____\n\nHere\u2019s the full presentation by Vitalik Buterin at the 2014 Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin, Texas:\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin \u2018Innovation Is Real\u2019 & 9 Other Key Takeaways From Speech By SEC Chair\n\n\u2013 SEC Coinschedule Settlement Opens up Old Crypto Securities Wounds\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Hope No. 1559: What It Does and What It Doesn\u2019t Do\n\n\u2013 Pantera CEO Trims Bitcoin Price Forecast For 2021, Sees ETH Outperforming\n\n\u2013 \u2018Fiat-Like\u2019 Proof-of-Stake Chains Favor Centralization & Rich Players\n\n\u2013 The Ethereum Economy is a House of Cards\n\n\u2013 Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019\n\n\u2013 MEV Harms Ethereum Users And it May Be Here For Some Time"

        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): Everything you need to know - OKX",
        "content": "When Vitalik Buterin built Ethereum, he wanted to push the boundaries of blockchain technology. Bitcoin inspired him, but he felt the tech should do more than just process transactions. As a result, he built the Ethereum blockchain network. Ethereum has all the features of Bitcoin. It can process peer-to-peer transactions and store them in an immutable and decentralized way. It can also do certain things that Bitcoin cannot. For instance, it can run smart contracts.\n\nSo how does a blockchain run a smart contract? In Ethereum's case, the answer is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM forms the backbone of how the Ethereum network operates. In this article, we discuss what EVM is, how it works, its benefits, and use cases. But before we dive deep, let's have a quick recap about smart contracts.\n\nWhat are smart contracts?\n\nSmart contracts are computer programs or applications that run autonomously on a blockchain network. They consist of data codes developers deploy to carry out specific instructions. Users do not control smart contracts as they run as programmed.\n\nThe Ethereum network is the first blockchain to implement smart contracts. As a result, millions of smart contracts are coded and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain today. The EVM played a vital role in achieving that feat.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\nThe EVM is built into the heart of its protocol. As its name suggests, the EVM is a virtual machine or digital software that powers the Ethereum network. Virtual machine software can execute programs, store data, connect to networks, and perform other computational tasks. It is also responsible for the code execution and deployment of smart contracts.\n\nHow it works\n\nSince Ethereum processes more than just peer-to-peer value transactions, it requires an intricate computation system. So, instead of calling the network a distributed ledger, Ethereum developers refer to it as an \u00a8unbounded state machine\u00a8. And that is a basic description of how the EVM works. The Ethereum network thus comprises two states: a world state and a machine state.\n\nWorld state\n\nThe world state is where Ethereum stores its account balances and smart contracts. Similarly to the Bitcoin ledger, it is decentralized, immutable, and accessible to everyone online. The EVM updates this layer every time it completes a transaction. That means everyone with a block explorer can view the Ethereum blockchain and see the same data in real time.\n\nMachine state\n\nThe machine state is where the EVM carries out the step-by-step processing of transactions. It is also popularly referred to as Ethereum's sandbox for developers. The Ethereum network processes two types of transactions. The first type is the \u00a8message call\u00a8 \u2014 when one account transfers ETH tokens to another. In this scenario, the EVM moves the ETH tokens from one wallet address into another. Which then updates the transaction on the world state. The sender is charged gas fees for the computations completed in sending the transaction.\n\nThe second type of transaction is called \u00a8contract creation\u00a8. It refers to when a developer wants to execute a smart contract onto Ethereum. In this scenario, the sender supplies gas fees and inputs a \u00a8Smart Contract bytecode\u00a8.\n\nSolidity programming language\n\nThe most widely used computer language for creating Ethereum smart contracts is Solidity. Like Javascript, it is a high-level language suitable for humans, but machines do not understand it. Therefore once developers write a smart contract in Solidity, they must translate it into machine language or bytecodes using an Ethereum Virtual Machine compiler, like solc.\n\nSmart contract execution\n\nAs the EVM executes the code, the gas supply reduces according to the gas cost of the computations executed. If, at any point, the gas supply is reduced to zero before the transaction is complete, the EVM immediately halts. It abandons the transaction and makes no changes to the world state. The network is unaffected, but the sender's ETH balance goes down to pay for the computations used to execute the code to the halting point. However, if the execution completes successfully, the EVM updates the world state to match the machine state version.\n\nEthereum gas fees\n\nAs we can see from the above, gas fees play a crucial role in processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. When Ethereum used the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, processing a transaction required hardware and electricity, and miners required incentives to carry out their tasks. In the case of processing ETH token transfers, gas fees vary depending on the congestion of the pool.\n\nWhen executing smart contracts, gas fees take on a different role. At the point of execution, Smart Contract bytecodes are broken down into smaller pieces called \u00a8opcodes\u00a8. Opcodes are short for Operational Codes and are the instructions the EVM uses to perform computations. Each opcode is assigned a gas fee \u2014 the more complex the opcode, the higher the cost. This step is essential in keeping the Ethereum blockchain secure from malicious attacks. For example, if a user deploys a DDos attack, the EVM will continue executing the smart contract in the machine state. It will charge gas fees for every computation, and when the sender runs out of gas, it will abandon the transaction.\n\nWhat are the benefits of EVM?\n\nAs described above, the EVM prevents malicious activities from attacking the network. Therefore it enables the execution of smart contracts and other automated services in a secure and trustworthy platform.\n\nThe Ethereum network has the largest crypto ecosystem. It is the gold standard for Dapp creation and smart contract deployment. Many other blockchains have created side chains that allow Ethereum developers to transfer their applications without changing the code.\n\nEVM is also decentralized, meaning anyone can create a smart contract on Ethereum without permission. It also enables developers to build and deploy decentralized services and applications, recently gaining massive popularity.\n\nEVM use cases\n\nWith the Ethereum Virtual Machine executing smart contracts, many new inventions have hit the blockchain space. Here are the top five EVM use cases:\n\nERC-20 tokens\n\nERC-20 tokens are generated by smart contracts using predefined data structures. The data structure is responsible for giving the token a name, distributing it, and keeping track of it. In 2017, when initial coin offerings (ICOs) were popular, many new cryptocurrencies were launched using the ERC-20 tokens. Today, the best use of ERC-20 tokens is for stablecoins, like USDT.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to buy, sell or trade crypto by deploying smart contracts. Exchanges such as Uniswap and ShushiSwap also use automated market makers (AMMs) applications, allowing users to tap into the liquidity pools of tokens without third-party interference.\n\nNFTs\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital artwork stored on the blockchain. They authenticate ownership and cannot be copied. Blockchain enthusiasts use smart contracts to create and mint NFT collections. Some of the most expensive NFT collections include the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Cryptopunks. Owners can transfer or trade their NFTs on marketplaces such as OpenSea.\n\nDeFi lending\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) Lending refers to platforms that allow users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies without using a third party. Smart contracts govern the borrowing and lending protocols. Loans are issued immediately to borrowers, and lenders sometimes receive interest daily.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a communal entity that lacks a central authority. In DAOs, individual members collectively make governing decisions regarding the project. The rules of a DAO are established by core community members and implemented through smart contracts.\n\nEVM limitations\n\nThe EVM has two significant limitations. Firstly, it requires users to have foreknowledge of Solidity and coding skills. Many people need help coding, making it difficult for new users to create and interact with smart contracts.\n\nIts second limitation is that gas fees can become very expensive when creating a smart contract or deploying an Ethereum network application.\n\nWhich cryptos are EVM compatible?\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains are a simple solution to solving the expensive gas fee problem. Developers have borrowed certain parts of the Ethereum network and created DApps that enable users to quickly and easily move assets between any EVM networks. Many of the most popular blockchains in use today follow this EVM-compatible approach, mainly:\n\nBinance Smart Chain\n\nAvalanche\n\nFantom\n\nCardano\n\nPolygon\n\nTron\n\nThe future of EVM\n\nBuilding upon the basic foundation of Bitcoin, Vitalik Buterin's vision is to create a decentralized supercomputer that is accessible to all virtually. The Ethereum Virtual Machine has had a huge role in making that vision a reality. Since its conception, the EVM has had several upgrades and continues to evolve and improve. Given that smart contract applications drove the last major trends, it is amazing to imagine what this technology will unlock.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is an EVM in crypto?\n\nEVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is digital software that enables the Ethereum network to execute and deploy smart contracts.\n\nWhich cryptos use EVM?\n\nMany of the most popular blockchains in use today follow this EVM-compatible approach, mainly:\n\nBinance Smart Chain\n\nAvalanche\n\nFantom\n\nCardano\n\nPolygon\n\nTron\n\nIs Solana EVM based?\n\nNo. Solana is not compatible with EVM. It uses its own unique infrastructure, developer tool sets, and token standards.\n\nWhat are the benefits of EVM?"

        "content": "One Ethereum Classic Dev Team Quits With Empty Pockets, Others Stay\n\nAfter news broke on Monday that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) development team ETCDEV has been shut down as a result of a lack of money to fund the operation, the community was quick to clarify that other teams are still in the game.\n\nSource: iStock/BBeale\n\nAccording to the official website of the Ethereum classic project, \u201cETCDEV is a leading Ethereum Classic development company with a strong focus on decentralized computing providing long term support for the ETC blockchain.\u201d\n\nIgor Artamonov, founder & chief technical officer of ETCDEV wrote in the announcement that the team has tried to secure investments to fund their own operations, but that this effort has been unsuccessful. Artamonov also noted that the crypto market crash was part of the reason for why the group, comprising of ten people, has found itself in an increasingly difficult financial situation in recent weeks.\n\nFollowing the announcement, however, the verified Ethereum Classic Twitter account was quick to point out that this does not in any way mean that ETC itself is being shut down. As the group said, Ethereum Classic is backed by other groups of developers.\n\nIt also appears that the pains felt by ETCDEV over the lower crypto prices have yet to take effect on the other development groups working on Ethereum Classic. In November, ETC Cooperative (Artamanov is among the advisor of this group) announced that they are still hiring people for their operations. This time, the group is looking for a communications director to be based out of their New York office. The group is offering a \u201ccompetitive salary range up to USD 110,000 depending on experience.\u201d\n\nHowever, one can also find five jobs openings, including two developers, on the website of ETCDEV.\n\nAt the moment, it\u2019s not clear how the shut-down of major team will impact the future of Ethereum Classic. If ETC is to keep its position as a relevant digital asset into the future, it will now be up to the other development teams backing it to pick up the ball and continue building on the platform.\n\nPrevious ETCDEV team plans for 2019:\n\n\u2022 Scalability improvements and multiple Orbita interoperable sidechains (towards to 1,000+ tx/sec)\n\n\u2022 Light client for IoT and Mobile\n\n\u2022 Interoperability with other blockchains\n\n\u2022 Improve cryptography on EVM (for zero knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, etc)\n\n________\n\nEthereum Classic, which is one of top 20 cryptocurrencies my market capitalization, received a boost in its price prior to being listed on Coinbase this summer, but has since suffered a prolonged sell-off along with the rest of the crypto market. On Tuesday morning ETC is down by more than 6%, or more than majority of other top coins.\n\nETC price chart:"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction; Choppy Sessions in Play as New Year 2023 Approaches - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction; Choppy Sessions in Play as New Year 2023 Approaches\n\nTo finish 2022, a dreadful year for coin prices, the top two cryptocurrencies are virtually unchanged from the weekend before. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade choppy due to a lack of volatility as investors prepare to celebrate the New Year 2023. However, the Bitcoin price and Ethereum prediction haven\u2019t changed much recently, as BTC has been consolidating in a narrow range of $16,450 to $16,750.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum is choppy, oscillating in a narrow range of $1,180 to 1,200, and a break of this level has the potential to determine future trends. Ethereum (ETH) has had a rough year, but its underlying worth is higher than its current market price.\n\nETH Fundamentally Stronger Than Before, But Investors Wary of Price Falls\n\nIn 2022, the network finally implemented its long-awaited Merge, marking the beginning of its switch to a proof-of-stake consensus method. When validators were used in place of miners, the blockchain\u2019s energy consumption dropped by 98%.\n\nTo this day, more almost a hundred days after the Merge, ETH is trading at only $1,217. There are presently over 490,000 validators in the network, and that figure is only anticipated to expand by 2022.\n\nBeaconcha.in, an open-source Ethereum blockchain explorer, reports that as of November 1, over $19.2 billion in ETH have been staked on the network since September. Even though ETH2 will make the network more efficient and speedier, the price has been struggling in recent months, despite early optimism about the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential for significant gains.\n\nWhile its fundamentals have wowed market experts in the past, this year the asset has lost more than 55% of its value. Mike McGlone, senior macro strategist at Bloomberg, predicts Ethereum (ETH) will surge past Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming bull market. Because of the smart contracts and widespread use of the Ethereum network, they influence his opinion of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nThe current bitcoin price is $16,547, and the volume of trading in the last 24 hours is $10 billion. Bitcoin is gaining good support on the 4-hour time frame at $16,460, which is being extended by an outward trend line visible in the chart below.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin must break out of a narrow trading range to determine future price movement. A positive breakout of the $16,720 level might lead to Bitcoin price reaching the next resistance level of $16,990.\n\nBecause the RSI and MCD are negative, a bearish breakout of the $16,460 level might expose Bitcoin to immediate support levels of $16,200 or $16,000. A further negative breakdown of $16,000 today might expose BTC to the $15,500 level.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $1,195, with a $2.5 billion 24-hour trading volume. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is declining; however, the ETH has found immediate support at $1,180. This support level is extended by a rising trend line observed over a 4-hour time period.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nA candle closing above $1,180 in the 4-hour timeframe will almost probably imply a bullish reversal. In contrast, a positive reversal may take the Ethereum price to an immediate resistance level of $1,220, which is stretched by the 50-day simple moving average.\n\nA break below an upward trend line, on the other hand, has the potential to extend the selling trend to the following support levels of $1,150 and $1,100.\n\nHigh Potential Alternative Coins\n\nDespite the market\u2019s ongoing bearish trend, a few altcoins are making headlines in the new year 2023.\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nThe FightOut (FGHT) platform works in the same way as a personal trainer, except that the FGHT token is proactively rewarded for exercise time. All activities are recorded and can be used to improve the statistics of one\u2019s metaverse avatar.\n\nFGHT presale is doing pretty well and it has already raised more than $2.5 million. As the sale progresses, the current selling price of 60.06 FGHT for $1 (FGHT can be purchased with ETH or USDT) will rise.\n\n\n\nVisit FightOut Now\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T)\n\nDash 2 Trade will be an Ethereum-based platform that will provide real-time statistics and social trading data when it launches early this year 2023. Trading signals, on-chain analytics, strategy-building tools, and newsfeeds will be among the first features, assisting both new and experienced traders in keeping up with the volatile bitcoin market.\n\nDash 2 Trade, one of the largest ICOs of 2022, has launched its dashboard beta with only 7 days until the presale ends. D2T has already raised over $11.8 million in venture capital.\n\nD2T is the system\u2019s access coin, and it is now worth $0.0533 in the presale after initially selling to investors for $0.0476.s coin, and it is now worth $0.0533 in the presale after initially selling to investors for $0.0476.\n\nVisit Dash 2 Trade Now\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nC+Charge (CCHG) is a novel blockchain-based technology that aims to reward owners of electric vehicles for charging and driving their vehicles. Its native token, CCHG, is currently on presale. Electric car use has increased significantly in recent years around the world.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) business has developed as an environmentally beneficial alternative to the traditional automotive area, which has been yearning for a change.

However, it has embarked on an upward trajectory, breathing new life into the market. Nevertheless, amidst this surge, the available supply of Ethereum on exchanges has been steadily dwindling, adding an intriguing twist to the unfolding narrative.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023- 24\n\nEthereum maintains a bull trend\n\nLooking at the daily timeframe chart of Ethereum revealed an intriguing journey that began around 15 June when it initiated its upward surge. Since then, it has accumulated growth of over 16% in value.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum hovered around the $1,890 mark, exhibiting a slight dip in value.\n\nHowever, on 23 June, it concluded the trading session with a noteworthy addition of 1.10%. While it has yet to reclaim the $2,000 price range, an exciting development unfolded as it successfully shattered the resistance posed by its short Moving Average (yellow line) around the $1,820 price zone.\n\nThis breakthrough indicated a positive shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nThe press time price trajectory has also propelled Ethereum into a bull run, as evidenced by its Relative Strength Index (RSI). As of this writing, the RSI line stood above 60, signifying a strong bullish trend.\n\nEthereum on exchanges declines\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s valiant efforts toward recovery, a fascinating phenomenon persists\u2014the dwindling supply of ETH on exchanges.

This downward trajectory has persisted until now, further deepening the scarcity of Ethereum available on exchanges.\n\nETH profitability for long-term holders\n\nExamining the profitability of Ethereum for long-term holders revealed that, despite the recent uptrends, they have yet to translate into profitability for these holders.\n\nAs of this writing, the two-year Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) had dipped below zero, standing at -10% at press time. This indicated that individuals who have held onto ETH during this specific held at a loss.\n\nHowever, there remained a glimmer of hope. A sustained increase in value could potentially propel these holders into a more profitable zone, alleviating their loss position at press time.\n\nFurthermore, traders, as per data provided by CoinGlass, held optimistic expectations for an impending price surge. As of this writing, the funding rate on CoinGlass stood in positive territory.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis was a significant indicator of positive sentiment among traders actively taking long positions.\n\nIt is worth noting that a price rise could further enhance the positivity of the funding rate, potentially attracting more traders to take long positions.

        "content": "EIP-1559 Three Weeks Later: ETH 100,000 Burned, Supply Grows\n\nJust over 100,000 ethereum (ETH) has been burned as a result of the networks latest London upgrade three weeks ago. Still, the total supply of ETH appears to be growing, although increasingly more coins are being locked up for the Ethereum 2.0 launch, setting up conditions for a potential supply squeeze, claim some experts.\n\nSource: AdobeStock / denisismagilov\n\nOn August 5, the much-anticipated London upgrade went live, that aimed, among other major points, to revamp the network\u2019s monetary system via Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559).\n\nDeemed to be \u201cthe most complex change done on Ethereum mainnet to date,\u201d the upgrade has a number of goals, the crux of which was to introduce a fee burning mechanism to offset ETH inflation, improve fee estimation, and bring about a base fee and more reliable transaction inclusion.\n\nContrary to some popular misconceptions, the upgrade was not supposed to lower the gas prices in the long run, and didn\u2019t make ETH deflationary by default.\n\n3 Weeks Post-EIP-1559 Implementation\n\nAs of today, London ready clients comprise 98.1% of the Ethereum network, while only 1.9% of the nodes are yet to upgrade their clients, according to ethernodes.org.\n\nAccording to the latest report by on-chain analytics firm CoinMetrics, the percentage of ETH transactions using the new EIP-1559 fee mechanism is steadily increasing. Over 40% of the transactions were EIP-1559 compliant as of August 22, and the number is expected to climb upwards as wallet developers continue to implement the new format.\n\nEIP-1559 transaction type adoption. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nAccording to WatchTheBurn.com, the total amount of burned ETH in transaction fees has surpassed ETH 100,000 today (c. USD 312.63m). However, the total ETH issued for the rewards was over ETH 283,920 (c. USD 887.6m), meaning that EIP-1559 helped to offset the inflation by 35.37%, calculates the website.\n\nAs such, the total supply of ETH has continued to increase, and is currently (UTC 13:20) reaching a bit more than ETH 117,386,167 (USD 366.98bn) \u2013 a net growth slightly more than ETH 183,453 since August 5, according to Etherscan and WatchTheBurn.\n\nThis is equivalent to ETH 4.9 (c.

According to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant,\n\nETH supply \u201cis melting like an athlete running a marathon on a hot summer day.\u201d\n\nThis is due to the ongoing ETH fee burn and ETH 2.0 staking \u2013 according to the firm\u2019s stats, over 6% of the total ether supply is currently locked in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract.\n\nPer beaconcha.in, there are ETH 6.99m (USD 21.85bn) currently staked, and 218,278 active validators.\n\nIn addition, ETH reserves on centralized exchanges have been dropping, too, as they reached ETH 18.98m (USD 59.4bn), and there seems to be a declining trend of new ETH deposits, states the firm\u2019s analyst TheBullduck.\n\nTotal ETH on exchanges.

        "content": "Put Away the Ethereum \u2018Knives,\u2019 We Come in Peace \u2013 Solana Co-founder\n\nSource: Adobe/Rafael Henrique\n\nNot everyone in crypto is at each other\u2019s throats. And while the rivalry between advocates of competing protocols is real, not all up-and-coming altcoin pioneers say they want to be known as Ethereum (ETH) \u201ckillers\u201d \u2013 particularly one of the masterminds behind Solana (SOL).\n\nSOL\u2019s growth has been nothing short of meteoric this year, with the authors of a recent report noting that it has expanded x45.8 in the past 12 months \u2013 and like many similarly promising altcoins is on course for a breakout 2022. Earlier this year, the coin has muscled its way into the top 10 coins per market capitalization and most recently has broken into the top 5, surpassing more established tokens like XRP.\n\nIn fact, SOL\u2019s rate of growth in the past 12 months has outpaced that of cardano (ADA), a protocol that was arguably positioned from the outset as an ETH killer.\n\nBut in a Twitter exchange this week, the SOL co-founder Raj Gokal refuted the notion that there was any bad blood between his protocol and Ethereum.\n\nChris Burniske, the co-founder of the crypto venture firm Placeholder, wrote that he had given up hope of \u201ceveryone\u201d in crypto \u201cgetting along,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to accept we are tribal in nature and competition actually fires everyone up. Is it ideal? Maybe not. Is it real? Definitely yes.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote that \u201cdespite pretty words,\u201d the \u201cknives are fully out.\u201d\n\nThe Placeholder co-founder explained that in crypto \u201cgenerally people want their biggest bags to win,\u201d particularly when it comes to \u201clayer 1 protocols\u201d \u2013 a factor that \u201cwill influence almost all communications.\u201d He thus advised punters not to \u201ctake what you see and hear as truth. [K]nives are fully out.\u201d\n\nBurniske noted that while bitcoiners traditionally had no time for ETH advocates, \u201chating\u201d them to the extent that \u201cthey never bothered to get involved.\u201d\n\nBut, he opined, \u201cthe competition between ETH and other [smart contract layer-1 protocols] is much more intimate \u2013 this opens up more subversive avenues for disinformation and attempted sabotage.\u201d\n\nGokal was adamant that Burniske was mistaken, however, writing:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just pretty words, man. it really doesn\u2019t have to be a fight. More key pairs are better.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nETC rode the bullish wave with 16.5% gains over the past 48 hours.\n\nRising Open Interest encouraged bulls with more gains likely.\n\nHolders of Ethereum Classic [ETC] rode the bullish market wave to record significant gains over the past 48 hours. A price bounce of 16.5% saw ETC smash the $17.66 resistance to trade at $18.84, as of press time.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs the global crypto market cap continues to rise with Bitcoin [BTC] approaching $31k, all the signals point to an extension of Ethereum Classis\u2019s bullish rally.\n\nStrong inflow of trading volume initiates bullish break of sideways structure\n\nETC bounced off the key support level of $13.31 to steam the severe losses it had suffered from the bearish swing. The dip to $13.31 created a price imbalance, which was slowly filled as price recovered. This led Ethereum Classic to trade sideways between 10 June to 20 June.\n\nAn increase in the daily trading volume had been highlighted in this previous price report as the key to a significant bullish breakout. A slight uptick in volume on 21 June saw ETC break the minor resistance at $16.42 before a brief pullback.\n\nHowever, the trading volume ramped up on 23 June with a big bullish candle on the 12-hour timeframe flipping the $17.66 from resistance to support.\n\nBulls firmly have the $20.27 level in sight and sustained trading volume could see this target met. Buyers can wait for a retest of the $17.66 support before riding the bullish wave to $20.27.\n\nOn the flip side, another decline in trading volume could turn over the advantage to sellers, especially at the next resistance level ($20.27).\n\nMeanwhile, the on-chart indicators supported the continuation of the bullish rally. The Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) climbed strongly into the overbought zone with a reading of 73, as of press time.\n\nMore capital inflows into ETC delivered a positive reaction on the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) which stood at +0.28.\n\nRising Open Interest indicates support for bullish push\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out ETC Profit Calculator\n\nMarket speculators responded to ETC\u2019s bullish rally with a significant increase in Open Interest (OI). Data from Coinalyze showed that the OI rose by $20 million over the past 48 hours. This hinted that futures traders were actively looking to ride ETC\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nDespite the bullish rally, the fluctuating Funding Rate should be closely monitored by ETC buyers to avoid being caught out by a bearish reversal."

        "title": "ETH Bulls Aim at $2K But is a Retest of $1.8K Coming First? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price recently received support at the 200-day moving average and subsequently embarked on a strong bullish rally, breaking above the 100-day MA. This could be a positive indicator for Ethereum\u2019s mid-term prospects, but it also carries the risk of being a bull trap.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of correction and a significant downtrend, the price reached the $1.6K level, which coincided with the 200-day moving average and found support. The significant buying pressure at this level triggered a rapid reversal and an upward trend toward the critical resistance zone around $2K.\n\nAdditionally, the price surpassed the 100-day moving average at $1.8K, suggesting a bullish bias for Ethereum in the mid-term. However, to confirm the presence of a bull market in 2023 and restore sufficient demand to the market, Ethereum\u2019s price still needs to overcome the substantial resistance at the $2K region and consolidate above.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn general, the Fibonacci retracement tool is helpful for identifying potential reversal points and correction targets during impulsive trends. As previously mentioned, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a mid-term correction phase after reaching the yearly high of $2.1K through an impulsive uptrend.\n\nExamining the chart reveals that the bearish correction leg found support and reversed at the 61.8% retracement level, a commonly observed target for correction phases. The prevailing buying pressure within this critical range resulted in a robust bullish trend towards the $2K region.\n\nIf the price successfully surpasses the significant resistance around $2K, it will pave the way for a mid-term bullish trend, as this level holds psychological significance. However, it is worth considering the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, which suggests the possibility of a slight rejection and short-term consolidation before Ethereum makes its next move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has been consolidating below the $2K level for the past few months after being rejected from that level. The uncertainty seen on the price chart is also reflected in the futures market sentiment.\n\nThis chart displays the Funding Rates metric, which indicates whether the futures market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Recently, after a period of correction in the market, which coincided with a downtrend in the funding rates metric, the price found support and began a strong rally.\n\nHowever, the metric has started to show a slight uptrend during this bullish rally, suggesting increased buying pressure and a greater tendency among participants to take long positions rather than short positions.\n\nWhile this could be seen as a bullish sign for the market, traders should exercise caution as it may actually be a bull trap, potentially leading to a long-squeeze event."

Some aspects of XRPL's design pave the way for the flexibility and impressive performance of Hooks, a dev says.\n\nNative features and token standards: Wo Jake explains difference between Ethereum's smart contracts and Hooks\n\nXRP Ledger- and Ethereum-based software (Hooks and smart contracts respectively) are built differently. While Ethereum (ETH) became feature-rich thanks to \"standards and cool stuff\" built since its launch in 2015, XRP Ledger's design has a variety of features \"natively.\"\n\nI don\u2019t think people still *fully* understand the technical & business implication on a #Hooks-enabled network.\n\n\n\nThe #XRPL comes with a variety of features natively, and with Hooks (smart contracts) & Evernode (L2), we\u2019re going to have a LOT of flexibility and leverage. \u2014 Wo Jake \ud83e\ude9d (@woj4ke) June 25, 2023\n\nThis statement was shared by Wo Jake, independent developer of XRP Ledger and its flagship second layer solution Evernode. In his recent tweet he admitted that not many people actually understand the technical and business implications of XRP Ledger with Hooks.\n\nJake is also sure that the combination of the feature-rich core design of XRP Ledger, its Hooks functionality and L2 scaling tools unlocks marvelous opportunities in terms of both flexibility and leverage.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of functions that are still waiting to be implemented into XRP Ledger's technical design:\n\nWe are the early builders, we have the chance to shape an entire network.\n\nXRP token, a core native asset of XRP Ledger, is changing hands at $0.48 on major spot trading platforms. It lost 1.38% of its valuation in last 24 hours.\n\nXRPL Hooks: Audit passed, what's next?\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, XRPL Hooks, a simple smart contract for XRP Ledger, finally accomplished a major milestone this month.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, it was reported that cybersecurity firm FYEO completed the audit of XRPL Hooks' codebase with no major bugs disclosed.\n\nNow, the discussion is gaining steam regarding the next phases of Hooks Amendment implementation in mainnet. Some seasoned XRP developers, including Scott Chamberlain, a co-founder of Evernode, are sure that it is better to activate this function on an isolated sidechain."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nChiru Labs, the Web3 startup behind popular Ethereum NFT collection Azuki, is set to extend the project with the release of 20,000 new NFTs on Tuesday, the company announced. The new collection, Azuki Elementals, will expand the universe of the original anime-themed project with additional profile picture s(PFPs).\n\nThe 10,000 existing Azuki NFT owners have already been airdropped a token for one of the Elementals, leaving half of the supply for the public sale. At the \"Follow the Rabbit\" community event in Las Vegas on Friday, Azuki holders were surprised with the airdrop of Elementals, but the art has yet to be revealed.\n\nRemaining Elementals will go on sale Tuesday at 9:20 am PST via a Dutch auction, at a starting price of 2 ETH (about $3,750) apiece, with the price dropping every 5 minutes until the supply is depleted. The price of the final NFT sale will ultimately be the price that everyone pays, and earlier buyers will be refunded the difference.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Azuki Elementals sale opens on Tuesday, June 27 at 9:00 AM PT. \u2070Elementals will be available to reveal immediately after sale ends. Full details below. \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/hKBwzIUE58 \u2014 Azuki (@Azuki) June 25, 2023\n\nCurrent holders of Azuki NFTs will have a slim 10-minute window prior to the auction\u2019s start to purchase additional Elementals in a preferential presale, while owners of Beanz NFTs (a collection spun off from Azuki) will similarly get 10 minutes after that (just before the public sale) to snatch up Elementals NFTs.\n\nWhile details regarding Elementals are still under wraps, the collection\u2019s slogan, \u201dFour Domains, One Garden,\u201d appears to allude to a mythic landscape sorted into four distinct kingdoms. Each is defined by a classical element: fire, water, earth, and lightning. \u201cThe Garden\u201d is a term used to refer to the broader Azuki community, which stretches across both the metaverse and real-life collaborations and events.\n\nLike with Azuki, the 20,000 Elemental NFTs will be comprised from randomized attributes of varying rarity. The collection will contain four tiers of Elementals that will be randomly distributed during both the presale and public sale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEach increasing tier has a higher chance of revealing rare traits in an Elemental, though all tiers can potentially reveal so-called \"grail\" NFTs, a Chiru Labs spokesperson told Decrypt. \"Grail\" NFTs typically feature the rarest traits in a project and thus tend to be among the most valuable on the secondary market.\n\nElementals marks the first full follow-up collection to Azuki, the smash-hit collection that emerged as 2022\u2019s highest ranking new, original NFT project in terms of trading volume. To date, Azuki has racked up over $1 billion worth of trading, according to analytics platform CryptoSlam. Beanz NFTs, which were airdropped for free to Azuki holders last spring, account for another $273 million worth of secondary sales.\n\nThe team behind both projects has been quick to capitalize on its runaway success and extend the IP into other realms. In April, Chiru Labs revealed a partnership with Line Friends, the media and merchandise property with dominant cultural presences in Japan, South Korea, and across the world. Numerous Beanz-themed collaborations with Line Friends across content, merchandise, and events are reportedly in the works.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify presale timing and details around the Line Friends collaboration."

        "content": "Demand for ETH Staking Soars Despite Nearly Month-Long Waiting Period\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nSince the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade to the Ethereum mainnet just over one month ago, which allowed Ethereum validators to withdraw all or some of their staked Ether (ETH) tokens from the staking smart contract for the first time, demand for ETH staking has soared.\n\nAccording to wenmerge.com, the waiting period for an ETH owner to enter the Ethereum network as a new validator has surged to 27 days and 7 hours, with 50,398 prospective validators current in the queue.\n\nEther owners can set up as network validators and earn a yield of around 4-5% annually via token staking.\n\nETH staking has been available on the Beacon chain since December 2020, but staking withdrawals were only enabled at last month\u2019s upgrade.\n\nThe addition of withdrawal flexibility to ETH staking reduces its risk in the eyes of many investors, who may have been deterred from staking their ETH tokens prior to the implementation of withdrawals for fear their funds would be locked up for a prohibitively long period of time.\n\nThe surge in the number of validators queueing up to join the network comes hand in hand with a surge in the number of ETH tokens being entered into the staking smart contract.\n\nAs of Monday, the number of staked ETH tokens had hit 21.652 million, up around 3.5 million in the one month since the Shanghai upgrade, as per Glassnode data.\n\nGiven the total supply of ETH tokens was last around 120.08 million, that means the staking participation rate is now just over 18%.\n\nThat\u2019s up from around 15% prior to the upgrade, when the number of staked ETH tokens was around 18.1 million and the total ETH token supply was around 120.4 million.\n\nDual Deflationary Trends Set to Provide Major ETH Price Tailwind\n\nCompetitor proof-of-stake chains with flexible staking contract withdrawals like Cardano have staking participation rates in the 60-70% range.\n\nWhile only just over 50,000 ETH are allowed to be withdrawn from the staking contract each day, Ether staking isn\u2019t completely flexible and thus might not be able to achieve a staking participation rate of quite this high.\n\nBet let\u2019s say the Ether staking participation rate hits 50% \u2013 which might take less than a year given that the participation rate is currently rising by around 3% per month.\n\nThat would mean a further 38.4 million ETH tokens moving into the less liquid ETH staking contract.\n\nUnstaked ETH token will all of a sudden become a lot scarcer, which should be a tailwind for the price.\n\nNow factor in the fact that the Ether supply is also rapidly deflating.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, the recent spike in transaction fees as a result of meme coin-related network congestion resulted in a spike in the ETH burn rate (essentially, the Ethereum network burns all ETH tokens that are used to pay transaction fees, as per EIP1559 from back in August 2021) saw Ether\u2019s deflation rate surge above 8% earlier this month.\n\nSupply deflation should act as another major long-term tailwind for the ETH price."

It was created by Parity Technologies, a blockchain infrastructure company. They are the developers behind the advanced Ethereum client Parity Ethereum, and the interoperable blockchain network Polkadot, among a number of other technologies.\n\nAvailable for iOS and Android, the v.3.0 Beta of the app brings new features, the announcement says, and now includes:\n\nSupport for Kusama CC2 (Chain Candidate 2) network; ability to use Parity Signer with Polkadot-js apps and Polkadot-js extension, as well as bond funds to validate or nominate, transfer funds, or vote for governance proposals by signing with the offline device;\n\nSupport for Universal Offline Signatures, the standard created for efficient data transmission through QR codes;\n\nBetter visualization of addresses on small mobile screens, faster account identicon generation, unified fonts, improved button colors, etc.\n\nA screenshot of the app. Source: Parity\n\nThe creators explain that all you have to do is take your old smartphone, restore it to factory settings, and then go into airplane mode forever in order to turn off all Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and any other connection. Then, you create your accounts. They warn, however, never to connect this phone to the internet or to a device that is connected to the internet, such as your computer.\n\nTo update it, make a backup of all your phone\u2019s accounts, reset your phone to delete the accounts, install the new version, go offline and recover your accounts backed up on Parity Signer.\n\nThe device will allow you to generate and store multiple private keys, and in addition to the mentioned Kusama CC2 network, it supports Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Kovan and Ropsten networks.\n\nYou use it by entering the amount and recipient into your device that is network-connected, then verifying and signing with Parity Signer. You can also use the app to scan the QR Code.\n\nBack in July, Polkadot Network has announced Kusama, an experimental version of Polkadot, with real economic conditions, for developers to experiment in and test out a Polkadot-like environment.\n\nAlso, check out our list of six alternative hardware wallets."

        "content": "Ethereum Gas Fees Highest During US Business Hours, Coin Metrics Finds\n\nSource: AdobeStock / Edi Chen\n\nEthereum (ETH) fees are still on the rise, with no day so far in November seeing average transaction fees of less than USD 30. However, the fees vary significantly depending on the time of day transactions are made, opening up opportunities for savings, a new report from on-chain analytics firm Coin Metrics has found.\n\nAccording to the report, transaction fees on Ethereum \u2013 also called gas fees \u2013 are highly dependent on the amount of traffic on the network at any given time \u2013 an issue that is still present after Ethereum\u2019s implementation of the EIP-1559 upgrade.\n\nAs pointed out by Coin Metrics, Ethereum transaction fees since EIP-1559 include a fixed-per-block network fee known as a base fee that must be paid in order for a transaction to be included in a block. And given that this base fee fluctuates with demand for block space, transactions become significantly more expensive during peak hours on the network.\n\nFortunately, however, finding out when the network is typically most congested can be done, with Coin Metrics saying that US business hours tend to have the highest base fees during any 24-hour period.\n\nSource: Coin Metrics\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the morning period of midnight to 8am [US Eastern Time] tends to have cheaper base fees vs. US business hours (9am-5pm),\u201d the report noted. It added that weekends, and in particular Sunday mornings Eastern Time, tend to be quiet periods, with a base fee that is on average 50% lower than the average at noon on Wednesdays.\n\nThe finding that US business hours have the highest fees is perhaps surprising given that Ethereum is a global network that is open 24 hours per day all days of the year.\n\nHowever, the report cited peaks seen in sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the marketplace OpenSea, and peaks in the usage of the stablecoins tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) seen during those hours, as major contributors to traffic during these peak hours.\n\nIn conclusion, Coin Metrics said that one possible solution to minimize the amount of fees paid might be to schedule transactions to non-peak hours. And luckily for users, solutions, such as the Gelato Network of decentralized smart contract bots, already exist for scheduling transactions for other times of the day.\n\nWith increased adoption, bots like Gelato that automate smart contract executions to occur during optimal times have the potential to ease congestion on the Ethereum network, the report finally said.\n\nBased on data from BitInfoCharts, the average transaction fee paid on the Ethereum network on Tuesday stood at over USD 45, while the 7-day moving average of the fee remained slightly lower at USD 43.\n\nThe 7-day moving average of the transaction fees remains slightly below its all-time high of USD 53.3 reached on November 15, but is still high enough to price out some economic activity from the network, as noted in an earlier Coin Metrics report.\n\nEthereum average transaction fees (7-day moving average):\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nAt 13:29 UTC on Wednesday, ETH traded at USD 4,303, up a strong 2.6% over the past 24 hours, and up 1.2% over the past 7 days.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Fee Debate Heats Up as Avalanche Enters and Exits Top 10\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Fees Pushed Higher by DEX Trading as Optimism\u2019s Upgrade Nears\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Tests All-Time High as On-Chain Activity Grows, SHIB Burns ETH\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 Helped Coinbase Save ETH 27 on Daily Fees\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Users Flock To Arbitrum In Search of Scalability\n\n\u2013 USD 0.5 Million Paid in Failed Ethereum Transaction"

        "content": "Total Staked ETH Tokens Keeping Surge Higher \u2013 What This Means for the Ethereum Price\n\nEthereum. Source: Adobe\n\nIn wake of last week\u2019s major Ethereum blockchain upgrade enabling the unstaking of ETH tokens from the Beacon chain for the first time since staking was enabled in December 2020, the number of ETH tokens locked in the staking smart contract has continued to surge higher.\n\nTotal staked ETH tokens were at 18.62 million on Monday as per data presented by crypto analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of nearly 500,000 in one week, the fastest pace at which the total number of staked ETH tokens has risen since late February.\n\nIt also marks a new all-time high for the total number of staked ETH tokens.\n\nThe rapid rise in the number of staked ETH tokens in the last week shocked some traders an analysts who had been expecting the enabling of staking withdrawals to result in net outflows from the staking smart contract.\n\nSome of these traders and analysts had expected ETH investors to withdraw their ETH tokens and accrued ETH yield on masse, potentially triggering a wave of selling and a drop in the ETH price.\n\nGiven the opposite happened (i.e. the number of staked ETH tokens rose, rather than falling), the ETH unsurprisingly saw a pop higher as bearish bets were unwound.\n\nETH/USD jumped from under $2,000 and in the last few days has been consolidating in the $2,100.\n\nIt seems that there were more ETH owners waiting on the sidelines for the successful implementation of staking withdrawals before depositing their ETH into the staking contract than there were staked ETH owners eager to withdraw their tokens from the staking contract and sell them down.\n\nThe newfound flexibility in ETH staking lowers the risk to investors of putting their tokens into the staking contract.\n\nAs a result, substantial inflows of ETH into the staking contract are expected in the years ahead.\n\nWhat Rising Staking Participation Could Mean for the Ether (ETH) Price\n\nGiven last week\u2019s market reaction, one might expect a continued rise in the total number of staked ETH tokens to provide an ongoing tailwind to the ETH price.\n\nAssuming that when investors deposit their ETH into the staking contract that this is a long-term investment play, this should act as a deflationary tailwind for ETH.\n\nThat\u2019s because as the number of staked ETH rises, the supply of readily available non-staked ETH will decline, increasing its scarcity and potentially boosting its price.\n\nAnd the supply of unstaked ETH potentially has a long way to fall.\n\nAt present, as noted above, only about 18.6 million ETH tokens out of the total current circulating supply of just under 120 million tokens are currently in the staking contract.\n\nThat\u2019s around 15.5%.\n\nComparable proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain protocols like Cardano have staking participation rates of in the 60-70% range.\n\nIf Ethereum can reach a staking participation rate of 60-70%, that would imply a decrease in the number of unstaked ETH tokens of around 50-60 million.\n\nThat would have a huge impact on the market and could drastically reduce the availability of ETH tokens on major crypto exchanges and for other functions such as paying gas fees and for use within Decentralized Finance.\n\nThis could be a major ETH price tailwind in the years ahead.\n\nAnother major long-term tailwind will be the combined impact of the ETH token burn introduced by the London hardfork of August 2021 and the drop in the ETH issuance rate as a result of the \u201cMerge\u201d to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work last September.\n\nIndeed, the ETH supply is currently falling at a rate of around 1.5% per year.\n\nHowever, this deflation rate could accelerate in the months ahead if network congestion rises and pushes up network fees and the ETH burn rate, due to the fact that the ETH issuance rate has remained largely unchanged in recent months in the 0.5-0.6% per year range.\n\nIndeed, the deflation rate momentarily hit 5.6% earlier this year amid a sudden spike in network activity that triggered a short-lived spike in network fees."

        "content": "In recent weeks, the crypto market sentiment has witnessed a remarkable upswing, buoyed by a surge of optimism triggered by the filing of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by several institutional investors.\n\nThis development has instilled renewed confidence among market participants, driving crypto prices to new multi-month highs. Now, this trend appears to be gaining more momentum as more financial institutions join the ETF bandwagon.\n\nNotably, on Monday, June 26, reports suggested that HSBC, the largest European bank, has allowed its customers at HSBC Hong Kong, the largest bank in the special administrative region of China, to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs on the Hong Kong exchange, according to widely-followed crypto reporter Colin Wu.\n\n\u201cHSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it.\u201d \u2013 Colin Wu wrote in the tweet.\n\nBitcoin ETF Hong Kong. Source: Wu Blockchain\n\nAt the moment, there are three crypto ETFs that are listed on the Hong Kong exchange, including CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.\n\nHong Kong regulators ask major banks to accept more crypto clients\n\nHSBC\u2019s support for crypto ETFs comes after Hong Kong regulators put pressure on international banks operating in the city to take on more crypto clients.\n\nMore specifically, earlier this month, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) asked HSBC, Standard Chartered, and the Bank of China to accept more crypto exchanges as clients.\n\nPer the report, traditional banking giants in Hong Kong are reluctant to take on more crypto clients due to \u201cresistance from senior executives\u201d stemming from recent high-profile collapses in the industry. HKMA reportedly \u201cencouraged the banks to not be afraid.\u201d\n\nThe regulator\u2019s incentive comes as Hong Kong continues to double down on its efforts to become a crypto and fintech hub. On June 1, the city\u2019s much-anticipated licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms (\u201cVATPs\u201d) launched, aimed at fostering crypto growth in the region."

This is the first Ethereum blockchain-based game that has gone through Sony\u2019s rigid process of approval.\n\nPlague Hunters. Source: a video screenshot\n\nPlague Hunters, the sequel to its forefather, the successful Plague Road, is developed by Arcade Distillery, a New York-based video game maker. Arcade Distillery is expected to release the game in Q1 2019.\n\nThe game teaser:\n\nThe game will use the freemium model, so it will be free to play with a chance for players to purchase in-game items. For this, Plague Hunters will have a built-in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Players can use the marketplace to exchange their items with each other with having full ownership of the assets. The in-game assets will be non-fungible tokens, which you may know from CryptoKitties.\n\nDespite that the marketplace will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, Plague Hunter will not feature blockchain-based gameplay. Instead, the gameplay was designed for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch, a gaming console, with Arcade Distillery exploring options to release the game for Xbox One and smartphones.\n\nWhile the gameplay will be very similar to non-blockchain based games, users in Plague Hunter\u2019s ecosystem will have full ownership of every asset they receive, collect, or buy, as well as the scarcity of the in-game items will have provable scarcity.\n\nBasing a video game on the blockchain is a creative way to introduce new people to cryptocurrencies as well as to attract crypto enthusiasts into blockchain gaming.\n\nBut Plague Hunter is not the only blockchain-based game that\u2019s to be released. Earlier in November, the Coinbase-backed card game Gods Unchained released its gameplay trailer. The game \u2013 which was inspired by popular titles like Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone \u2013 will also feature blockchain-based assets, but the gameplay will happen on the creator\u2019s, Fuel Games\u2019 servers.\n\nGods Unchained is soon going into private beta for stress testing the game, and in three months, the game\u2019s open beta will be released with the full launch coming thereafter."

But some believe this dislike has roots much closer to home.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. Source: a video screenshot, edited by Cryptonews.com\n\nSharing two article titles on the possible effect of coronavirus outbreak on BTC price, Buterin commented that \u201c95%+ of articles of the form \u201cevent X will make crypto go (up | down)\u201d are post-hoc rationalized bullshit.\u201d\n\nWhile the Bitcoin evangelist at Kraken, Pierre Rochard, thought that the stock-to-flow model may be a part of the other 5%, Buterin very much disagreed.\n\nRochard also previously pointed out that the coronavirus is not a factor in the stock-to-flow model and should just be considered \u201cnoise\u201d for bitcoin investors.\n\nWhile Buterin certainly has his supporters, Blockstream\u2019s CEO Adam Back, finds that Buterin\u2019s dislike of the model stems from Ethereum\u2019s own inadequacies. \u201c[Of course] you can\u2019t have a stock2flow when your altcoins stock is undefined and its flow is adjusted ad hoc on the whims of a few programmers,\u201d argues Back.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin previously said that a lot of cryptos are committed to a capped issuance schedule and the \u201cidea that issuance is evil, and we must have a hard cap, and because a hard cap is the Austrian way, and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflations fiat goldbugs.\u201d As a reminder, Bitcoin\u2019s issuance is capped at almost 21 million, while Ethereum does not have a fixed supply.\n\nThe stock-to-flow model, created by anonymous analyst PlanB, measures the bitcoin price by using the number of BTC in circulation (stock) and the number of new BTC entering that circulation (flow). While some find it quite accurate, predicting a new high between 2021 and 2020, climbing to some USD 100,000 and accelerating, others are concerned by the growing stock-to-flow hype.\n\nSource: Digitalik\n\nFurthermore, hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor urged to \u201cforget about stock-to-flow,\u201d adding: \u201cUsing stock-to-flow to predict prices is absolute nonsense. \u201d\n\nPlanB and Back shortly commented on Trezor\u2019s post at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum found itself in some trouble as the opposition to its ProgPow upgrade is rising.\n\nAt pixel time (13:24 UTC), bitcoin trades at c.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Target for 2022 Cut Again But New Highs Still In Play \u2013 Survey\n\nSource: Adobe/Alvaro\n\nThe price of ethereum (ETH) might reach a new all-time high of USD 6,872 in 2022 before correcting to USD 5,783 by the end of the year, according to a once again less optimistic average estimate by a panel of fintech & crypto industry players.\n\nAt 15:26 UTC, ETH traded at USD 2,825 and was up 1% in a day. The price dropped 18% in a month and is now down 4% in a year.\n\n\n\nETH is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of roughly USD 4,900 by approximately USD 2,000 driven by \u201cthe Merge\u201d \u2013 which will supposedly make Ethereum more energy-efficient, secure, and deflationary, a survey of 36 fintech and crypto specialists by comparison site Finder showed.\n\n\u201cThe Merge, an upgrade to Ethereum, should happen this summer. This could have an explosive effect on the token. People have been waiting for this for years. It should be far more secure, 99% more energy-efficient, and deflationary. If that isn\u2019t the trifecta of potential, as a leading blockchain, I don\u2019t know what would be,\u201d surveyed technologist and futurist Joseph Raczynski was quoted as saying.\n\nHowever, as reported, The Merge might not happen this summer and now is estimated in a \u201cfew months after\u201d June.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin Fr\u00f6hler, CEO of Morpher, gave his highest short-term ETH price target of USD 10,000, stating that \u201cEthereum will undergo the equivalent of 3 Bitcoin halvings with its Merge update. Ether will become a deflationary asset yielding 5\u201310% APY [annual percentage yield].\u201d\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, the panel\u2019s optimism for short-term price movements of ETH has cooled down as the same survey conducted by Finder at the start of 2022 predicted ETH price to hit USD 7,609 in 2022.\n\nThe key reasons for the slightly less bullish price outlook for ETH were growing competition in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, scalability, and lack of long-term confidence in the network.\n\n\u201cEthereum is at a very uncertain place in its journey at the moment. It is currently losing DeFi market share to its competitors (although it still remains dominant by a huge margin). Until Ethereum upgrades its systems and fulfills its promises to scale, I do not have long-term confidence in the network. That being said, I still think people will buy the token out of hype/promise/potential. I don\u2019t think ETH will be the #2 asset forever though,\u2019 said Keegan Francis, global cryptocurrency editor at Finder.\n\nAt the same time, John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, pointed out that \u201cether (and other non-stablecoin) crypto prices seem to fairly mindlessly follow the BTC price and seem to be part of a common speculative bubble.\u201d\n\nOverall, the survey respondents were quite divided on the Merge\u2019s impact on ETH price, as 44% were unsure if it is going to result in a much anticipated ETH supply shock.\n\nNevertheless, the panelists still expect the price of ethereum to surpass USD 10,000 by the year 2025 and USD 20,000 by 2030 and only 6% of them thought that now is a good time to sell ETH.\n\n_____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist\n\n\u2013 \u2018PoS Fanatics Attacking PoW are Actual Supervillains\u2019, Kraken\u2019s Powell Says as US Politicians Charge\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Staking Sees Accelerating Growth Ahead of Merge\n\n\u2013 Top Narratives About Ethereum and Its Merge with Its Proof-of-Stake Beacon Chain\n\n\n\n\u2013 The Ethereum Economy is a House of Cards\n\n\u2013 Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2013 As Bitcoin Keeps Tanking, Arthur Hayes Joins Chorus of USD 1M BTC Predictors and Warns of \u2018The Doom Loop\u2019\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Price Forecast for 2022 Cut Once Again as Break \u2018Only\u2019 Above USD 80K Now Expected"
